All public knowledge of the attack indicates a false flag - but Trump may be sitting on undeniable evidence.<br><br>HOWEVER - it&#039;s irrelevant whether it&#039;s true or not in the grand scheme of things.<br><br>And this is why:<br>1. If it wasn&#039;t a false flag he responded appropriately. All he did was bomb an airfield - targeting aircraft and infrastructure while avoiding personnel - after warning the Russians. No Russian casualties = No WWIII. Currently conflicting reports on SAA casualties. Doesn&#039;t matter. By targeting the air base and not Assad&#039;s headquarters (like Libya) he demonstrated this had NOTHING to do with regime change. Just sending a message.<br><br>Also, the way he was silent about this shit until the attack was pretty cool. It&#039;s what a President ought to do. Don&#039;t run your mouth, just do what needs to be done. That ought to scare the shit out of any other country.<br><br>2. He just put Assad in check while sedating Neo-Cons like McCain, and Israel (who are the people who would have supported the false flag). He&#039;s winning over support from people stonewalling him with a glorified firework show.<br><br>3. He&#039;s being tough on China and North Korea. He was meeting with the leader of China today. By pulling the trigger unannounced like this he&#039;s showing he&#039;s not fucking around with North Korea. No doubt a message to Iran as well.<br><br>4. Even if Syrian forces are grounded they still have Russian air support. Essentially nothing has changed strategically speaking.<br><br>5. The momentary salt of some of his supporters will fade as the hysteria dies down when it&#039;s seen as it is - truly nothing of significance.

I entered into the restaurant looking to start off with an appetizer and as I browsed them menus thinking of a good drink to have with the sampler, a very sweaty man sat upon the stool next to me. We started talking as I always give a fair shake to anyone never judging a book by its cover and the topic turned to politics. I have to say at this point the man was beyond wasted, must have been served too many drinks. He started mumbling as he saw the television &quot;mayn, fugg trump pussyass muhfugga why you ypipo gotta ruin everything mayn&quot;. Not wanting conflict I simply said &quot;sir the good thing about our country is we had a fair shake of an election, better luck next time huh? In the mean time hopefully things change for the better&quot;. To which the man nearly with the force of a newly alerted and inebriated Clark Kent leapt off his stool exclaiming &quot;MAYN FUCC THAT SHI-CUZ!

They converted because they followed a rebel messiah in the 1600s called Shabbetai Zevi. Zevi was a false prophet, who, for a time, was thought (by Jews) to be the messiah. But then it came out that he was embezzling donations, that he&#039;d married a prostitute from Poland, and was engaging in sex parties. When the scandal broke, most of his followers fell away. The Ottoman authorities were disgusted, and gave Zevi an ultimatum: convert to Islam or die. Zevi mortified the Jewish community when he capitulated and converted to Islam.<br><br>All but a militant few abandoned Zevi.<br><br>For these true believers, Zevi wasn&#039;t a fraud at all. To them, he was sending a complicated moral message. It can be boiled down to &quot;You gotta sin to get saved&quot;. So, like their leader, they started throwing sex parties, wife-swapping and trying to break every taboo imaginable to man (in order to reach a higher spiritual level). They also regarded Zevi&#039;s conversion as fake, so most of them became false converts to either Christianity or Islam, in solidarity with Zevi.<br><br>But here&#039;s the thing: These other Jews were NOT given the ultimatum Zevi was.

In fact, almost all of the leadership of the Young Turks were Ottoman Jews. Even Ataturk [Kemal Mustafa] was probably from the Dounm\u00e9. Every biographer on him concedes that a lot of effort has gone into obscuring his origins and hiding his ancestry. Ataturk himself gave clues that he might have been Jewish. Like when he admitted to a Jewish writer [named Itamar Ben-Avi] that he&#039;d learned Hebrew prayers as a boy (and that he had a &quot;secret prayer&quot; which he then proceeded to recite in perfect Hebrew). Here&#039;s a website that deals with these issues, and even they mention the likelihood of his being from the Dounm\u00e9: http:\/\/www.jewornotjew.com\/profile.<wbr>jsp?ID=478","filename":"_b84AUctYFllyk1HR0mbGz5aCKGxgvgPfh-TjpPOyGA","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491770527938,"time":1491770527,"md5":"GzfLDB0gbaESWg5N6y3XcA==","fsize":169608,"resto":120323583,"id":"GzbLEYZo","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":120333682,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)16:43:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120323583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120323583<\/a><br>PART 3:<br><br>Anyway . . . This dominant component of Shabbateans [i.e., followers of Shabbetai Zevi] in the leadership of the party is why, when the Young Turks took over, the Islamic aspect of Turkey was played down, suppressed and Latin letters were brought in (in an attempt to Westernize the new nation). The &quot;secularization&quot; of Turkey was due to the Dounm\u00e9.<br><br> Footnote: Many of Israel&#039;s Founding Fathers entered Palestine from the Ottoman Empire (like Ben Gurion). And many had connections with the Young Turks. Which is why the Armenian genocide is such a sensitive subject for Israel. It&#039;s not merely that Israel doesn&#039;t want any rivals to the official &quot;Holocaust&quot; from WWII. It&#039;s that they don&#039;t want too much attention drawn to the perpetrators of the Armenian genocide, because a lot of skeletons start to fall out of the closet when you start to put it under the microscope.","filename":"1486580047995","ext":".jpg","w":1158,"h":585,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":63,"tim":1491770599602,"time":1491770599,"md5":"0VoXsxFShX3mDa+7+1JOqw==","fsize":320588,"resto":120323583,"id":"GzbLEYZo","country":"RS","m_img":1,"country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":120333803,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)16:44:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120323583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120323583<\/a><br>Based Atheist ;)","time":1491770665,"resto":120323583,"id":"JapyoYl7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120333857,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)16:44:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120326297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120326297<\/a><br>No Islam was second.","time":1491770687,"resto":120323583,"id":"JapyoYl7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Millenials are driven by hedonism and don&#039;t care about anything other than reckless debauchery. They don&#039;t care about politics, history, culture. The only thing they care about are drugs, sex, and their stupid EDC music. And as these fuckers have already proven by their embrace of socialism in the form of Bernie Sanders, they will destroy the West by allowing in third worlders and voting for socialists economic policies. We&#039;re fucked once baby boomers die and the GOP loses 60% of its voting base. <br><br>I&#039;m throwing in the towel. I tried to live a fruitful and productive life that would make my grandparents proud. But no more. Guess I&#039;ll stick to raves and LSD from now on.","filename":"feel","ext":".jpg","w":645,"h":773,"tn_w":208,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491882766506,"time":1491882766,"md5":"ZqemELQ7G2oLNI8pn1GJeQ==","fsize":38893,"resto":0,"id":"fKiFyT8Z","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"millenials-have-ruined-the-west","country_name":"United States","replies":17,"images":3,"unique_ips":11},{"no":120549782,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:04:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"pussy","time":1491883447,"resto":120548520,"id":"CljDltup","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120549855,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:04:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120549782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120549782<\/a><br><br>What is there to do?

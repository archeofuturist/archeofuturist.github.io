This detachment, coupled with the fact that they do not live in a house and therefore do not hold ownership over their little plot of land, leads to people removing themselves from the traditional connection with fellow inhabitants of their settlement. Another factor in this depersonalising experience is the breaking of the family as the young move away and ultimately leave their elderly parents in elderly homes instead of taking care of them themselves.

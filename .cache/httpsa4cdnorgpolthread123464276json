The caveat, however, hides a conflict of loyalties that would plague a libertarian society: on the one hand are the particular loyalties of one&#039;s preferred Utopian community; on the other hand, loyalty to the larger \u201cframework for utopias\u201d; within which one&#039;s utopia exists. The second loyalty implies a value relativism incompatible with the first one, meaning either that loyalty to the libertarian framework will undermine the utopias within it, or that the particular values of the utopias will destabilize the libertarian framework. The durability of a libertarian society, then, requires a mentality best characterized as nihilistic. In this, libertarianism differs from liberalism but is surprisingly similar to the cultural diversity movement.

The entire ideology of Anarchy is worthless at the outset. There is nothing to salvage from it. Look up Kowloon The Walled City if you think anarchy is such a great idea. Or maybe the Hong Kong elderly people living in cages. It&#039;s an inhuman philosophy that considers nothing of the society, only the individual. It&#039;s the other extreme of Communism, again benefitting the international Jews.","time":1493558206,"resto":123464276,"id":"xGRi97pL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123476584,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)09:18:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123476012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123476012<\/a><br>This is, unfortunately, probably true.

We can&#039;t just keep growing the population without limit, every ecosystem that we destroy then destroys any future prospect of getting resources in the future, which is the entire problem with the system. You would be right when you said: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You have to realize that while resource are supposedly limited, the earth is a closed system so all resources are reused.<\/span><br><br>But the problem is, they&#039;re not reused. There is so much waste in the United States it is mind boggling, there is garbage and plastic patch in the Pacific Ocean right now that is the size of Texas, go ahead and look it up. The United States throws out half of the food that goes on its shelves in a grocery store, I used to work in one, and the perfectly good food that was thrown in the trash on a daily basis disgusted me. I suppose we can agree then that the waste of resources is a huge problem, then?","time":1490504890,"resto":118316707,"id":"N6wMKg0H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118322996,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:09:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118321211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118321211<\/a><br>Still no refutation","time":1490504962,"resto":118316707,"id":"kRZrTvfx","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":118323006,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:09:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118322315\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118322315<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I didn&#039;t step on anyone to get to where I was<\/span><br><br>Everyone steps on someone.

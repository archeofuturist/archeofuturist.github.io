If an expression becomes ambiguous by dropping the sign - e.g. because its all written on the same line as with this - then you keep it and make the order of operations explicit. By splitting the division operator over two lines, i.e not using the sign but structuring the expression as a ratio, then the positioning of the bracketed expression will make it&#039;s application explicit and the sign can be dropped without compromising the operator.<br><br>However, those insisting on order of operations following the rules they were taught e.g. expand the brackets at least have an excuse.

If the Russians launched against us, it would come in three waves. First would be active installations that could be used to launch a nuclear strike against them... ICBM silos, submarine bases, bomber bases and shit like that. Second would be ancillary military bases... Army bases, marine corps bases, tactical fighter and airlift, strategic airlift and so on... Third wave would be auxiliary targets that can be used for military purposes, things that can support the war effort like ports, rail hubs, major industrial areas, economic centers.<br><br>Third wave is cities that are not going to be collateral damage from nuclear strikes against military targets. So, if Minot AFB gets hit, you will probably have time to run for the hills.<br><br>That&#039;s under a controlled scenario. There&#039;s a scenario where if the Russians just hold back and strike one target, America can hit one of equal or lesser value and call it a day. I think that&#039;s stupid, but RAND has theorized it so, what ever.<br><br>Just as likely as the first option, the Russians sperg out and launch everything they&#039;ve got at anything worth a shit.<br><br>Transit times for ICBMs are around 45 minutes to an hour. SSBMs hit their targets way faster... Tactically interesting scenario. Bombers take hours, but they&#039;re very flexible and would strike basically once the other two parts of the triad have done their work, which I think would be the most likely thing to bomb your city.<br><br>Submarine launched ballistic missiles have that interesting tactical component of being stealthy and hiding out in friendly waters of they can.<br><br>Imagine a Russian sub hiding out in Vancouver&#039;s Burrard inlet and nuking Seattle... There&#039;s a real possibility of a nuclear reaction from the United States that would wipe out Vancouver, killing the enemy sub in the process...

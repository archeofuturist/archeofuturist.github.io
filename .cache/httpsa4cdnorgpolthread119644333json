The breed itself is aggressive, yes, but they&#039;re not impossible to be tame. They&#039;re excellent dogs, when treated with love and discipline. It&#039;s when they&#039;re abused and treated poorly that they become savage and feral creatures. People must understand they&#039;re taking in an animal that was bred for home protection and fighting in pits, thus the name. It&#039;s a guard dog - not a family dog. So I do agree, if you&#039;re new to owning dogs, do not even consider pitbull as an option. Or any other &quot;guard dog&quot; for that matter. You won&#039;t be able to handle it and it won&#039;t respect you. <br><br>Also, I must digress. The &quot;nanny dog&quot; myth is just as harmful. They&#039;re not harmless creatures, they&#039;re dogs bred specifically for fighting and killing. It&#039;s like trusting a wolfhound with a child. Would you really? If you know there&#039;s a threat to your child, and you choose to take it anyways, you don&#039;t deserve to have kids. Or pets.<br><br>Tl;dr they&#039;re bred to kill - why take the chance if you suck at handling dogs? Don&#039;t. They&#039;re a niche pet with special needs.

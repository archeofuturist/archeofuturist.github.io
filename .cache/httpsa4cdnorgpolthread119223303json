I spoke to the priest afterwards and he arranged a private confession for 4pm. I confessed all my sins and I broke into tears at parts, but I was forgiven and I have never felt like this before in my life.<br><br>God is real and the worshippers of Lucifer (the Jews) are doing everything in their power to pollute your mind and make you lose your faith. <br><br>It is not possible to defeat Satan and the Jews who worship him if you are not one with the Lord. Please I beg you, go to confession and confess your sins to the Lord so you may be forgiven.<br><br>The Jews want you to go to hell and they will do anything to stop you gaining your faith again, but God wants you to go to heaven.<br><br>God bless you all besides the Jews.<br>You Jews will burn forever in a lake of fire for killing the Lord, your disgusting and wicked ways and your Satan worship will NEVER prevail. Your souls are black.","filename":"Christ","ext":".jpg","w":466,"h":700,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491155105129,"time":1491155105,"md5":"gxu8KnrlPeaaTQduT27XbA==","fsize":43919,"resto":0,"id":"ZpyoWRuO","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"just-did-my-first-confession-in-13-years","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":37,"images":2,"unique_ips":20},{"no":119223538,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)13:47:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;ve thought of joining a church.<br>However I know most of them are into the new version nonsense.<br>And I see chruch people are sinful.<br>And I wouldn&#039;t possibly be able to confess to 19 years of sins. <br><br>Wouldn&#039;t they just let you say the recent ones or something?","time":1491155238,"resto":119223303,"id":"H6bBpY6q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119223656,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)13:48:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119223303\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119223303<\/a><br>Amen brother","time":1491155303,"resto":119223303,"id":"X4\/USfjg","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":119223661,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)13:48:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119223303\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119223303<\/a><br>Take this garbage to <a href=\"\/x\/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;\/x\/<\/a> where it belongs.","time":1491155307,"resto":119223303,"id":"imSAk4H+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119223720,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)13:48:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119223538\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119223538<\/a><br>You can say whatever you want.<br><br>That&#039;s the whole thing of it.

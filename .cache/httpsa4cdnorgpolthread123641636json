I don&#039;t know what the fuck people were thinking voting for him as leader. He&#039;s a Scouse. Most Brits wouldn&#039;t dream of voting for a Scouse unless they were a) Scouse themselves, or b) he was posh Scouse like Andy Burnham. He&#039;s also a gobshite.<br>Honestly, I&#039;m reminded of something my ex Flying Squad Uncle once told me about fringe groups when I asked him abut how often they were infiltrated. He&#039;d infiltrated CND donkey&#039;s years back and, at the time I asked, some naughty boys had got their marks preggers and been found out.<br>He told me that infiltration was rare, because most fringe groups on the right AND left were fronts set up by the security services to attract any potential dissidents. He recommended a book to me but I forget it&#039;s name now: It explained that the UK had been doing this since the 19th century and it was the reason why no crazies had ever got into power here.<br><br>I&#039;m strating to think that&#039;s all UKIP ever was. Nuttal should have gone into this election arguing that a vote for UKIP was a vote to hold the Tories feet to the fire; that UKIP MP&#039;s could hold the balance of power if there was a hung parliament. Instead he makes alliances with them and makes his entire manifesto about Mohammed. Fucking clown! Or just doing his job? Who fucking knows?<br><br>There ain&#039;t going to be a Brexit, that much I do know. May needs her bigger majority to sideline the hard Brexiteers in her party. Once she&#039;s got it, we&#039;re fucked...","time":1493658690,"resto":123641636,"id":"YhfumI4b","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123644084,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:15:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why did he lie?

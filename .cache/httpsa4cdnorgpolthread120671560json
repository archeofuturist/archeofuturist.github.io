I wanted to take a second and make a thread thanking you various anons. Over the past few years (found 4chan in 2007 from green text stories), I&#039;ve come here daily for the laughs, the heart ache, and the pranks. <br><br>When I found \/pol\/ in 2009, then \/new\/ I began to see the transformation first hand. It was a glorious thing to see. But at the same time, I knew it would be bitter sweet. You see, \/pol\/ is the not only the last place on the surface web which promotes free speech, it promotes free thinking. It begs you to ask the questions of &quot;How come? Why not? What if? or Then what?&quot; These questions have been lost in daily society but live and breath here as the lifeline and pulse of \/pol\/. You guys helped me understand that without continuous questioning the truth would forever remain hidden and with it, hope. <br><br>That&#039;s what \/pol\/ is to me. In some ways you could call me a masochist for thinking this was. Taking the red pill, going down the rabbit hole and coming out the other end wishing I was dead and never saw or read what I had. But in the end, it was well worth it. So in conclusion the most truthful statement I have read on \/pol\/ came from a thread not more than 30 mins ago and it summarized \/pol\/ so well I had to share it. <br><br>&quot;The upside is a community of like minded individuals all plagued by the same bitterness.&quot; <br><br>Remember who we are \/pol\/, we are that voice in the wilderness crying out to people to repent of their ways and see the truth. Regardless of how uncomfortable it may be. <br><br>I&#039;ll see you guys later.","filename":"1455247926271","ext":".jpg","w":4050,"h":2687,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1491951001482,"time":1491951001,"md5":"gNmrvOI2an945pfwJDbGNg==","fsize":1237062,"resto":0,"id":"sNc4fZga","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"most-truthful-statement-you-read-on-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120671693,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)18:51:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120671560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120671560<\/a><br>tl;dr :DDD","time":1491951063,"resto":120671560,"id":"+OjYvJZw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

We need to be getting invlolved and putting more time and effort in fixing the system on a local level. Get involved in your city council, vote on as many local ballots as you can. I know I&#039;ve noticed plenty of my local officials being mega-schlomos. And the more far right officials we have on a local level. Contact your local investigative journalists and support them, they&#039;re out there fighting the good fight. AT THE VERY LEAST, look into your local reps to find out if they&#039;re doing anything illegal that could violate their positions. All of my city council members are doing blatantly illegal things and are just somehow getting away with it.","filename":"the truth about the holocaust","ext":".jpg","w":2257,"h":2481,"tn_w":227,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493341740528,"time":1493341740,"md5":"gQI16TnZ8Q55YA\/N5BuHRw==","fsize":892983,"resto":0,"id":"nIItNgNV","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-should-do-something-more-than-just-make-memes","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123122178,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)21:13:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123121583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123121583<\/a><br>I&#039;m sure posting ridiculous Holocaust jpgs is a great first step","time":1493342038,"resto":123121583,"id":"qGPXrhRj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123122272,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)21:14:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123122178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123122178<\/a><br>go back to lurking you pussy","time":1493342081,"resto":123121583,"id":"QALkcwk2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

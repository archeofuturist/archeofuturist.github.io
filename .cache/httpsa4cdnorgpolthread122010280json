It&#039;s impossible for words to describe what is necessary to those who do not know what horror means. Horror... Horror has a face... and you must make a friend of horror. Horror and moral terror are your friends. If they are not, then they are enemies to be feared. They are truly enemies! I remember when I was with Special Forces... seems a thousand centuries ago. We went into a camp to inoculate some children. We left the camp after we had inoculated the children for polio, and this old man came running after us and he was crying. He couldn&#039;t see. We went back there, and they had come and hacked off every inoculated arm. There they were in a pile. A pile of little arms. And I remember... I... I... I cried, I wept like some grandmother. I wanted to tear my teeth out; I didn&#039;t know what I wanted to do! And I want to remember it. I never want to forget it... I never want to forget. And then I realized... like I was shot... like I was shot with a diamond... a diamond bullet right through my forehead. And I thought, my God... the genius of that! The genius! The will to do that! Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure. And then I realized they were stronger than we, because they could stand that these were not monsters, these were men... trained cadres. These men who fought with their hearts, who had families, who had children, who were filled with love... but they had the strength... the strength... to do that. If I had ten divisions of those men, our troubles here would be over very quickly. You have to have men who are moral... and at the same time who are able to utilize their primordial instincts to kill without feeling... without passion... without judgment... without judgment! Because it&#039;s judgment that defeats us.","filename":"AN","ext":".jpg","w":630,"h":1200,"tn_w":65,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492721588817,"time":1492721588,"md5":"7kOzQ+jECO+ZxUGpJeD10w==","fsize":73724,"resto":122010280,"id":"Kq3LtcY5","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122042884,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:55:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"So what does &quot;redpilled film&quot; even mean?

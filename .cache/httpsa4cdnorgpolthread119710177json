As a Christian minority in the Middle East this hits me where it hurts. <br><br>Bush toppled Saddam and created a power vacuum in Iraq which killed millions, with sectarian violence still raging to this day. Obama comes along and campaigns about how he was against the war in Iraq and toppling governments. However, he does the exact same thing to Libya. A once prosperous nation is literally sent into hell by forcibly removing the dictator. Anyone with a half brain would know this was bound to happen with military action against Gaddafi yet Obama did it anyway even after his &quot;I was against the war in Iraq&quot; campaign slogan. There was definitely malicious intent here. Obama also wanted to attack the Syrian government over the &quot;alleged&quot; chemical attacks but did not have the support of the American people.<br><br>Next comes along Trump. He states continuously that he was against the war in Iraq. He also goes further and states that the US cannot be sure of who they are arming in Syria, and that while Assad is a bad guy, he is necessary for stability in the region. This is music to my ears and all other Christian minorities in the Middle East. This might come as surprise but we LOVED Saddam, we LOVE Assad. There is a time and place and a very specific type of society where democracies work... they absolutely do not work in the Middle East. A heavy hand is needed to keep the peace in the Middle East. <br><br>Now this two faced piece of shit Trump says he has &quot;changed his attitude on Assad.&quot; Is this a fucking joke? He just pulled a bait and switch in front of our fucking eyes! What&#039;s worse is he now has the consent of the public to put American soldiers wherever he desires without the consent of the public for &quot;surprise attack&quot; reasons. This is looking to be the biggest fucking con in human history. <br><br>Does \/pol\/ actually support Trump in this or is all the cheer leading here from the_Donald?","filename":"FullSizeRender (9)","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":976,"tn_w":192,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491456587972,"time":1491456587,"md5":"DM+qN0le2ORHIugJkUWQGQ==","fsize":139051,"resto":0,"id":"TO9cMJKe","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"itt-sincere-discussion-on-trump","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

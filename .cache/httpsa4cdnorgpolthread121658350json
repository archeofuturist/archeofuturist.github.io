The Arabs invaded with few thousands in a population of millions, after killing the Visigothic king in a small skirmish there was nothing maintaining the unity of the warring kingdom and Spain fell like a house of cards, thus many nobles started converting to Islam en masse to retain their possesions and privileges, the most famous being the hispanorroman family of the Banu Qasi who basically controlled all of what today is Aragon. The Moors were basically Iberian converts, and they were for most of their existence disconnected from the rest of the muslim world.

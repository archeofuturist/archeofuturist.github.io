Our overall security and defence depend both on how much we spend and how we spend it. Increased investments should be directed towards meeting our capability priorities, and Allies also need to display the political will to provide required capabilities and deploy forces when they are needed. A strong defence industry across the Alliance, including a stronger defence industry in Europe and greater defence industrial cooperation within Europe and across the Atlantic, remains essential for delivering the required capabilities. NATO and EU efforts to strengthen defence capabilities are complementary. Taking current commitments into account, we are guided by the following considerations:<br>Allies currently meeting the NATO guideline to spend a minimum of 2% of their Gross Domestic Product (GDP) on defence will aim to continue to do so. Likewise, Allies spending more than 20% of their defence budgets on major equipment, including related Research &amp; Development, will continue to do so.<br>Allies whose current proportion of GDP spent on defence is below this level will:<br>halt any decline in defence expenditure;<br>aim to increase defence expenditure in real terms as GDP grows;<br>aim to move towards the 2% guideline within a decade with a view to meeting their NATO Capability Targets and filling NATO&#039;s capability shortfalls.","time":1490643452,"resto":118549266,"id":"d9CqZrPe","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118550835,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:37:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118550073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118550073<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;$300 billion<\/span><br>Wouldn&#039;t you write 300 billion dollarydoos as &quot;$billion 300&quot;?","time":1490643478,"resto":118549266,"id":"mQWQFtF0","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118550868,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:38:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118550269\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118550269<\/a><br>Any country can let immigrants in.

Articles counting the number of days he spent &quot;at the gold course&quot; are really just counting his time working at Mar-a-Lago, where he happens to be rich enough to have a world-class golf course in his back yard. That&#039;s like saying all his time at the White House is time spent &quot;at the bowling alley.&quot; As for time that is actually spent golfing, most of that is not recreational, and is done for the purpose of making deals and building relationships. &quot;Play golf&quot; was always one of the key pieces of advice he would give on how to be successful. The only reason he gets along at all with congressional leaders is because he used to play golf with them. This is very different from Obongo flying out to play golf by himself in the middle of a crisis. Trump has no intention of taking vacations.","filename":"nixon bowling

If most people were in the spot you claim to be they would have been flogged to hell and back. They would have been put through the system for the most absurd or non-existent reasons, had the book thrown at them and then threatened to near death while in jail or prison.. Even other inmates are no longer white nationalists. If you expect to go to jail or prison and find whites sticking up for each other you will be sorely disappointed.. What you will find are a bunch of gay or bi-sexual white dudes that scorn white nationalism and anything politically incorrect yet still feign toughness and tribe mentality.. most of these dudes are huge.

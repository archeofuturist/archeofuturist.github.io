Articles counting the number of days he spent &quot;at the gold course&quot; are really just counting his time working at Mar-a-Lago, where he happens to be rich enough to have a world-class golf course in his back yard. That&#039;s like saying all his time at the White House is time spent &quot;at the bowling alley.&quot; As for time that is actually spent golfing, most of that is not recreational, and is done for the purpose of making deals and building relationships. &quot;Play golf&quot; was always one of the key pieces of advice he would give on how to be successful. The only reason he gets along at all with congressional leaders is because he used to play golf with them. This is very different from Obongo flying out to play golf by himself in the middle of a crisis. Trump has no intention of taking vacations.","filename":"nixon bowling

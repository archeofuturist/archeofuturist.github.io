Within the means of your budget, that is. <br><br>For instance, a lot of these buildings take up (or did at one point) take up the better part of a single city block. Yet they are a mere twenty stories, or less in height. You can&#039;t make a modern city of buildings like this guys. At least not one that&#039;s meant to be a hub city, or primary source of trade\/business. A tourist location? Sure, that works. Look at Belgium, but most cities require high skylines because they can&#039;t afford to keep expanding horizontally due to urban sprawl issues, and if you want to build up you have to build with certain materials. <br><br>You can&#039;t build a 70-story structure made principally out of brick or limestone, for instance. It just can&#039;t be done. I love the Flatiron building, but it&#039;s only 22 stories for a reason. You can augment these structures, sure, but after a point you need to start being realistic with the cost of construction. <br><br>Try building something as tall as the 111 West 57th skyscraper for instance out of brick and not have a truly insane amount of bloat out towards the bottom before you peak. <br><br>Also, most cities (even New York) have their sky scrapers at around the height of the Flatiron still, and are still neo-classical\/art deco. Right now it&#039;s a lot of cherry picking of terrible choices, I will absolutely agree with you. <br><br>But if you just keep in mind that nearly every city planner in the world wants to stop urban sprawl, and wants to build vertically within the confines of pre-existing urban areas, without being able to pull the eminent domain card...

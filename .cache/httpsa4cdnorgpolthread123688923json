Give me ten days, and I can bring a complete novice to a near-expert level of proficiency with the gun. That\u2019s fucking easy. The hard part? Convincing somebody to actually use it. Convincing someone that they actually need to overcome the culturally conditioned aversion to interpersonal violence that Americans have been spoonfed for the last sixty years, is far more challenging than teaching someone the mechanics of gunfighting. Guess which side has already overcome that cultural conditioning? I\u2019ll give you two hints: first, it\u2019s not the guys typing away on FB about how they\u2019re gonna \u201cslaughter\u201d Leftists, as soon as they get permission from their Mommy.

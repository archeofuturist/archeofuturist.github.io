For the first time since Subway first opened 51 years ago, Subway is closing more locations than it is opening. <br><br>A lot of stores are closing because Americans don&#039;t make enough money and are squeezed by rising costs of living. Stores like Macy&#039;s, Gamestop, Radio Shack, Sears, Payless Shoe Source, and many more. <br><br>Things are so bad in America, that we can&#039;t even afford sandwiches anymore. The original 5$ footlong is now more like a 7$ footlong. <br><br>Something is really wrong in America when the people can&#039;t afford fast food from the second biggest fast food chain.","filename":"170420142439-subway-storefront-780x439[1]","ext":".jpg","w":780,"h":439,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492741360707,"time":1492741360,"md5":"l0jGZxVfYvUIrhXV0RQ\/zw==","fsize":168169,"resto":0,"id":"VM3EVtbJ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"subway-closing-stores","country_name":"United States","replies":21,"images":0,"unique_ips":19},{"no":122082999,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)22:33:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122081826\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122081826<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Something is really wrong in America when the people can&#039;t afford fast food from the second biggest fast food chain.<\/span><br><br>Protip: the great recession didn&#039;t end.

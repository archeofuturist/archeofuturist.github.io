The Visigoths, along with the Barbarians, the Vandals, the Franks, and the Huns, were what we would call today \u201cbarbarians,\u201d and were not into learning science, math, philosophy, and architecture. They were interested in conquering and destroying civilizations, the very epitome of \u201craping and pillaging.\u201d And conquer and rape and pillage they did. So why is Europe so civilized today? Did these early barbaric conquerors of Europe all of a sudden take up an interest in culture? The answer is that the Catholic Church, and specifically the monasteries of St. Benedict (the Father of Europe) befriended the conquerors, converted them to the Church of Jesus Christ, and then took up the task of educating them and civilizing them.","filename":"bad_posture_2","ext":".gif","w":951,"h":657,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":172,"tim":1493668211250,"time":1493668211,"md5":"\/R3tpsnmKTo3RwYPVUej\/w==","fsize":650246,"resto":0,"id":"94ktHa9o","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ancient-rome-was-the-center-of-culture-science","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":123664111,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)15:59:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ha gaeyyy!","time":1493668792,"resto":123662921,"id":"YDajuxBB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123664482,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)16:02:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123662921\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123662921<\/a><br><br>They were Arian Christians long before they attacked Rome itself you fucking moron.","time":1493668979,"resto":123662921,"id":"Vs+WfCyl","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123664909,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)16:06:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123664482\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123664482<\/a><br>anyone who pushes the &quot;barbarian&quot; deception is a kike.<br><br>Read Tacitus if you want the truth about the Germanic peoples.","time":1493669177,"resto":123662921,"id":"blLCQ8yx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123665228,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)16:08:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123662921\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123662921<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ll of that came to a screeching halt in 410 AD, when the Visigoths sacked Rome, and the Roman Empire came to an end. <\/span><br><br>Get off my history board.","filename":"eeyore","ext":".png","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493669324084,"time":1493669324,"md5":"lZFNAdbPNDrISZDuDqoWnA==","fsize":414744,"resto":123662921,"id":"6GDMwnqN","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123666371,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)16:16:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123665228\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123665228<\/a><br> If you were a real student of European History you might come to the realization that the dark ages weren\u2019t caused by the Catholic Church preserving knowledge and transcribing Bibles and other secular literature,, but rather from the barbaric invasions of the Visigoths\/Huns\/Franks\/Barbarians in the 5th and 6th centuries; the barbaric invasions of the Vikings\/Magyars\/Moslems in the 9th and 10th centuries; and the barbaric invasion of the Mongols in the 13th Century!

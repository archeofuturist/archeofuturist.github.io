The Visigoths, along with the Barbarians, the Vandals, the Franks, and the Huns, were what we would call today \u201cbarbarians,\u201d and were not into learning science, math, philosophy, and architecture. They were interested in conquering and destroying civilizations, the very epitome of \u201craping and pillaging.\u201d And conquer and rape and pillage they did. So why is Europe so civilized today? Did these early barbaric conquerors of Europe all of a sudden take up an interest in culture? The answer is that the Catholic Church, and specifically the monasteries of St. Benedict (the Father of Europe) befriended the conquerors, converted them to the Church of Jesus Christ, and then took up the task of educating them and civilizing them.","filename":"bad_posture_2","ext":".gif","w":951,"h":657,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":172,"tim":1493668211250,"time":1493668211,"md5":"\/R3tpsnmKTo3RwYPVUej\/w==","fsize":650246,"resto":0,"id":"94ktHa9o","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ancient-rome-was-the-center-of-culture-science","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123664111,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)15:59:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ha gaeyyy!","time":1493668792,"resto":123662921,"id":"YDajuxBB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

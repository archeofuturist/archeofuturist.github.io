Apparently AI scientists or whatever also use it, but I hate it. I can&#039;t deny that it makes learning to program easy, though.<\/span><br> - Pros: easy to learn, from your first &quot;Hello world&quot; program to advanced programming concepts. Can be used for any level project, although it&#039;s less popular in professional application (but more popular in more scientific-oriented applications).<br> - Cons: I absolutely despise its syntax. It&#039;s also relatively different to &quot;normal&quot; C-style languages; if you grasp programming concepts well learning a new syntax should be easy, but will still take some getting used to.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Javascript: the obvious (and practically only) choice for web development. However, I&#039;d advise learning the language first; once you can program well, you could start building websites, because really that&#039;s two different skills.<\/span><br> - Pros: insanely popular right now, useful for web development, heck you can make an entire website (including serverside and even database) in javascript using something like the MEAN stack.<br> - Cons: it&#039;s a very forgiving language; the original vision was that it would be used for 10-line scripts embedded in HTML website pages. Of course it&#039;s evolved a lot since then, but things like dynamic loose typing make it easy to screw up if you&#039;re attempting a larger project.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;C#: It&#039;s like Java but better. I&#039;m sure you know what java is.<\/span><br> - Pros: Out of these three languages, it&#039;s the most non-meme one. It&#039;s developed by a large organisation, has a lot of features, proper object orientation, etc. etc. In my opinion, it&#039;s the best &quot;traditional&quot; language out there. Also unlike Java it&#039;s actually well-designed for the most part so if you try to learn to program in C#, you&#039;ll actually learn to program, not learn how to deal with Java&#039;s shittier aspects.","time":1490221761,"resto":117828398,"id":"psWVD+rG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

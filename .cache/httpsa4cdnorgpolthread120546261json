The French presidential election looks like it&#039;s down to two candidates: Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen. And although Le Pen is fairly close to Macron in first round polling, it&#039;s obvious that nobody is going to reach 50%, which means that the top two candidates will go head to head in the second round.<br><br>As of right now, Macron is leading Le Pen in second round polling by about 25-30 points. In fact, Macron is holding a sizable lead against every other candidate in second round polling. So the only way to keep him from winning is to push him into third place. So even if Le Pen beats him in the first round, at least one other candidate will have to beat him as well.<br><br>The most obvious choice is Francois Fillon, but he has been several points behind the two leaders for some time now, and it doesn&#039;t look like he can close the gap.<br><br>There is, however, a fourth candidate, Jean-Luc Melenchon, whose numbers have skyrocketed recently and he is now only about a point behind Fillon. However, he has much more momentum on his side, and is the more likely of the two to edge out Macron.<br><br>If Melenchon catches up to Macron, and Le Pen regains her lead over Macron, then the presidential election is going to be a runoff between Melenchon and Le Pen.<br><br>Le Pen is polling much better against Melenchon than she is against Macron, and even if she doesn&#039;t win, Melenchon would make a much better candidate than Macron anyway.<br><br>So my plan is this: focus efforts on meme&#039;ing Melenchon into second place to eliminate Macron and send the election to a Melenchon-Le Pen runoff. And keep meme&#039;ing Le Pen, so she gets back in first place. We don&#039;t want a Macron-Melenchon runoff.<br><br>What say you, \/pol\/? Can we get Le Pen elected by meme&#039;ing Melenchon ahead of Macron in first round voting?

We have a two party democracy where both are run by an alien culture that historically leeches nations to death. No third party can win because the same people control the media. We are locked out of our own government.<br><br>No other race tells itself that race doesnt matter. This is something new, only to whites, as told to us constantly by Jews. Look at the result.<br><br>The USA is a place-holder label on a map of North America now, a space written in between Mexico and Canada. We. Do not. Control. This land. It is no longer ours.<br><br>New borders have to form around demographically identifiable regions. This order is ill and cannot last. New orders cannot emerge until this one is gone.<br><br>White people. Hear me. Guerrilla tactics, sabotage. You do not have to engage directly. We need to get rid of this order. The Berserker still lives in our blood.<br><br>Chaos is your friend. Do not fear it. Chaos is what kills this sick order. You either wait for their chaos to attack you or you prepare and make your own. When you need a plan, need protection, leverage, and edge, unleash chaos. Kill this sick order before it kills us. The chaos is coming either way.","filename":"Ruin","ext":".jpg","w":971,"h":675,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":173,"tim":1491998885572,"time":1491998885,"md5":"nQJMz7RsBK26GOthRgMNsw==","fsize":206792,"resto":0,"id":"XLyrpkpz","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-united-states-is-over-we-have-a-two-party","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":2,"unique_ips":4},{"no":120748390,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)08:12:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120748055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120748055<\/a><br>the answer is to get rid of the state, or at least install a new minarchist government, and keep it down with bloody revolutions every 50 years.<br>the only way out of this is anarchism.","time":1491999126,"resto":120748055,"id":"r3Z11fYV","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":120748676,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)08:15:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120748055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120748055<\/a><br>America is Dead and the Alt-Right killed it.

Women are naturally less risky than men are. You can see this when young adults or teenagers do stupid shit, it&#039;s usually almost always male, whereas women tend to do less crazy shit. Because of how men are more likely to do risky behaviour, they are more likely to either be super successful or super unsuccessful. This is why there are much more men who are homeless compared to women because these men probably did something risky (do heroin, gamble, etc..). However, at the same time, doing risky things could end up with you being very successful and, thus, going down in history. This is why the richest people are men, and the poorest people are men, women usually sit in the middle, because they don&#039;t take risks.<br><br>Watch this video titled &quot;Vomit Cake&quot; and ask yourself if women would ever do the same thing.

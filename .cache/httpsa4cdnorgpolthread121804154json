The reason why it cant work in America right now is because we choose to participate in a financial system of debt. We decide to work for money in hopes of trading that money for needs and wants... well when the money itself is created by one single buisness out of thin air and lent to our government with interest. <br><br>The only way for communism to work is if people work just as hard as they used to, but instead work directly for their needs and wants. Americans can not be mandated to participate in this flawed and rigged financial system, and the only alternative is co-dependance in your community. We need to fix this country from the inside out. <br><br>First logical step in a direction that would starve out the federal reserve is legilization of marijuana and for people to use their lawns and backyards and community shared land for agriculture and fish farming. We need plumbing more than electricity, and we can own small systems to produce our own energy for food storage.<br><br>Next logical step is to just sever your participation in this corrupt financial system by quitting your job and just support yourself and community with agriculture. Stop paying taxes and spend all the money you have. <br><br>I voted for Trump","filename":"bismuth_crystal_art__0143_by_beeblebroxz-d9ajje0","ext":".jpg","w":910,"h":878,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":241,"tim":1492577585151,"time":1492577585,"md5":"OG9C5A65dWgXg39BORT17g==","fsize":190320,"resto":0,"id":"AwaEgKQp","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"communism","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":1,"unique_ips":11},{"no":121804991,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:00:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121804154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121804154<\/a><br><br>Communism will never work.

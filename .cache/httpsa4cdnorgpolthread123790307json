They are produced by an organization that the Southern Poverty Law Center lists as a white nationalist hate group. While we unequivocally support freedom of expression on campus, and student and employee pride in their identities, as an institution of higher learning we are equally committed to ensuring that our campus community has the historical context needed to understand the arguments these flyers make.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Campus Diversity Officers Dr. Teresa Maria Linda Scholz (Staff &amp; Students) and Professor Martin Berger (Faculty) invite you to participate in a conversation about the flyers and campus climate. The event will take place on Monday, May 15 from 5:30-7:30 pm in the Oakes Learning Center.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We will begin the event by hearing briefly from faculty who work on race, gender and representation about the flyers\u2019 ideological significance before turning to audience roundtable discussions. We ultimately want your perspective in determining concrete steps that our campus can take to build a more inclusive community\u2014for those of us of color, those of us who are white, and all of us with multiple, intersecting identities.<\/span><br><br>(cont)","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":748,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493745462310,"time":1493745462,"md5":"dRMk0fvI1Y6MwNzYeUXo7Q==","fsize":203104,"resto":0,"id":"WsWCPyuy","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ucsc-whites-cannot-love-who-they-are","country_name":"United States","replies":28,"images":11,"unique_ips":25},{"no":123790474,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)13:19:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123790307\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123790307<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Campus Diversity Officers Dr. Teresa Maria Linda Scholz<\/span>","filename":"Judaism-Intensifies","ext":".gif","w":501,"h":585,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493745545155,"time":1493745545,"md5":"vds8tD0vl1mqFaX3enFRWg==","fsize":217086,"resto":123790307,"id":"8YzxaQrm","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123790487,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)13:19:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123790307\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123790307<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We want people of color to feel safe and valued on campus and we want European Americans to feel safe and valued on campus.

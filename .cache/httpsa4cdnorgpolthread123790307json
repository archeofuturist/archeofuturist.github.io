They are produced by an organization that the Southern Poverty Law Center lists as a white nationalist hate group.

The event will take place on Monday, May 15 from 5:30-7:30 pm in the Oakes Learning Center.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We will begin the event by hearing briefly from faculty who work on race, gender and representation about the flyers\u2019 ideological significance before turning to audience roundtable discussions.

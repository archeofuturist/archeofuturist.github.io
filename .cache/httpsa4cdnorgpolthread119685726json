Ive lived in mexico ten years, and I will tell you this: there are no blacks or asians. The darker population is largely mixed with the lighter population, with contrast seen only in the upper class. We all share a pretty similar origin story: our &#039;roots&#039; lie in the mixture of europeans (Spanish) and the natives, the revolution stemming from the &quot;Creole&quot; race. If an authoritarian figure capitalized on this they could really turn this country around.","time":1491449809,"resto":119685726,"id":"NoIILqeE","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":119699175,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)23:36:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119698945\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119698945<\/a><br>THE MODERN WORLD BRINGS NOTHING BUT THE LOSS OF IDENTITY AND DEPAIR!<br><br>DEATH TO THE MODERN WORLD","filename":"tumblr_omrbbfnZUV1v1qqh8o1_500","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":667,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491449811769,"time":1491449811,"md5":"ZhMCq+eWKXfxas9ShcsQeg==","fsize":98894,"resto":119685726,"id":"zyccCabT","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":119699332,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)23:38:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119685726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119685726<\/a><br>Why the fuck would I want a more authoritarian government on this shithole holy fuck you&#039;re retarded OP","time":1491449904,"resto":119685726,"id":"BtX+ZAKA","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":119699470,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)23:39:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119699167\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119699167<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ive lived in mexico ten years, and I will tell you this: there are no blacks or asians.<\/span><br><br>you are full of shit<br><br>ive lived in mexico 30 years and there are blacks in some states.<br><br>there are FUCKTONS of asians in the north and mid-states (you cant possibly go public school in tijuana without getting used to seeing asians)","time":1491449986,"resto":119685726,"id":"\/AXQOX40","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":119699485,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)23:39:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119698945\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119698945<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thinking youre the only one who&#039;s preached neoluddism<\/span><br>Look up Luddy and Ted Kaczynski in the \/pol\/ archives","time":1491449995,"resto":119685726,"id":"+\/l35J1h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119699636,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)23:41:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119698227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119698227<\/a><br>The downside I see about that idea is that whoever does it needs to become just as bad as the corrupt politicians are and by considering that would mexicans trust him?","time":1491450092,"resto":119685726,"id":"tE7UynsJ","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":119699640,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)23:41:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119699175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119699175<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;DEPAIR<\/span><br><br>lol.","filename":"1489467379241","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":1117,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":116,"tim":1491450093380,"time":1491450093,"md5":"CwvRntDYvrE0cmcia2S54w==","fsize":340415,"resto":119685726,"id":"9\/CBj5w0","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119699813,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)23:43:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119699175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119699175<\/a><br>Technology = technique = efficiency<br>Efficiency is hindered by identity.

I would rather be around people that hate me but atleast kind of look like me. I feel my people deserve to be helped. I understand the grand majority of mexicans are illiterate niggers, but they are still mexicans culturally. I don&#039;t speak very good spanish, like I can hold a conversation but, I need to brush up more, my question is fellow tortilla bros, should I go back?

These people consume popular media that paints a reality for them to believe in and feel comfortable with. Every single powerful institution and system that exists pushes most agendas of progressive politics yet it&#039;s just not enough. All of their beliefs are manufactured for them and shared by their friends.<br><br>Along comes someone who doesn&#039;t agree with everything they say and it&#039;s an utter disaster for them. Their world crumbles when the black on BuzzFeed tells them that another violent, criminal blacks get shot by police and the policeman wasn&#039;t lynched for it. <br><br>These people consistently make the argument from a moral highground about how offended they are, about how they&#039;re emotionally hurt by opponents and there&#039;s an increasing trend of the left pointing out how many mean messages they get online. The Wikipedia page of the Canadian m-103 motion mentions how the proposer received &#039;many vicious, cruel and hateful&#039;. Imagine if Trump were to resort to this kind of bullshit. These people can&#039;t comprehend that receiving mean messages isnt exclusive to colored progressives.<br><br>I&#039;ve been in the psych ward multiple times done a lot of crazy shit without any psych being able to specifically diagnose any serious mental illness. I believe it&#039;s from my philosophy and my views on life. I&#039;d love for these people to just spend a day with my thoughts.","time":1490457096,"resto":118235191,"id":"2J0eklkq","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118237728,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)11:57:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118235191\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118235191<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow.&quot;<\/span><br>- Ecclesiastes 1:18 (KJV)<br><br>Pleasure isn&#039;t the highest good.

These people consume popular media that paints a reality for them to believe in and feel comfortable with. Every single powerful institution and system that exists pushes most agendas of progressive politics yet it&#039;s just not enough. All of their beliefs are manufactured for them and shared by their friends.<br><br>Along comes someone who doesn&#039;t agree with everything they say and it&#039;s an utter disaster for them. Their world crumbles when the black on BuzzFeed tells them that another violent, criminal blacks get shot by police and the policeman wasn&#039;t lynched for it. <br><br>These people consistently make the argument from a moral highground about how offended they are, about how they&#039;re emotionally hurt by opponents and there&#039;s an increasing trend of the left pointing out how many mean messages they get online. The Wikipedia page of the Canadian m-103 motion mentions how the proposer received &#039;many vicious, cruel and hateful&#039;. Imagine if Trump were to resort to this kind of bullshit.

She would cook, and clean, and do his laundry, and take care of every little thing for him. Very loving, and caring, faithful, and friendly. She was only ever with him in her life, and she was a loving mother as well. Very family oriented.<br><br>For the Woman:<br><br>Her husband was not competing with millions of women in the work force, along with illegal immigrants. Advanced college degrees were not needed, and a good job was ready for every able bodied man who wanted to work. Her time was devoted to raising her family, and romance with her husband. Things were made in America then, and the manufacturing base was not yet outsourced to China, and every place else.<br><br>For the children: Very low divorce rate in parents, and had 2 parents. The mom was typically a stay at home mom, and the children would often be more physically able because they played outside instead of sitting on the x-box. They ate healthy home cooked meals instead of McDonalds all the time...<br><br>Why can&#039;t we have this again? Why did Liberals insist on destroying this?","filename":"1950wife","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":743,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490297673571,"time":1490297673,"md5":"YNK\/pcMF7bfCJjnTCeRBzw==","fsize":341812,"resto":0,"id":"uZWwGkJQ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"life-was-better-for-everyone-in-the-1950s","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":117972089,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)15:35:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Life was better for everyone in the 1950s<\/span><br>Dentistry.","time":1490297731,"resto":117971987,"id":"mYi+IyRO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117972448,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)15:38:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117972089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117972089<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dentistry.<\/span><br><br>What does that have to do with anything?<br><br>Yea, I&#039;m sure we got nicer things like better dentistry today, and vaccines and stuff like the internet... but the fact of the matter is things have gone to shit, and we need to MAGA!","time":1490297907,"resto":117971987,"id":"uZWwGkJQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117972969,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)15:42:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117971987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117971987<\/a><br>Mcdonalds has no correlation with obesity rates.<br><br>you can easily eat mcdonalds every day 3 times a day and get your needed nutritional needs without going over your calorie limit.<br><br>looks up john cisna.","time":1490298161,"resto":117971987,"id":"wIpBJ2Rb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117972996,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)15:42:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"Libshits hate white families","filename":"IMG_1655","ext":".png","w":254,"h":209,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":102,"tim":1490298175438,"time":1490298175,"md5":"mhzMASOC+xN5IWWXEtv3CA==","fsize":61148,"resto":117971987,"id":"gozbBBGF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117973143,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)15:44:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The man had a wife who could cook, clean, do his laundry, and do everything that he didn&#039;t feel like doing.

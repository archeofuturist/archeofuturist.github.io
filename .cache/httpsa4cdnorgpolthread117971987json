She would cook, and clean, and do his laundry, and take care of every little thing for him. Very loving, and caring, faithful, and friendly. She was only ever with him in her life, and she was a loving mother as well. Very family oriented.<br><br>For the Woman:<br><br>Her husband was not competing with millions of women in the work force, along with illegal immigrants. Advanced college degrees were not needed, and a good job was ready for every able bodied man who wanted to work. Her time was devoted to raising her family, and romance with her husband. Things were made in America then, and the manufacturing base was not yet outsourced to China, and every place else.<br><br>For the children: Very low divorce rate in parents, and had 2 parents. The mom was typically a stay at home mom, and the children would often be more physically able because they played outside instead of sitting on the x-box. They ate healthy home cooked meals instead of McDonalds all the time...<br><br>Why can&#039;t we have this again?

Sex is not very gratifying for the average non-deviant woman. To women, sex is mostly just a gift she gives to a man. Women are attracted to men the same way men are attracted to men: socially, not sexually. The orgasms some women can experience is really just a male orgasm. The clitoris is just a vestigial penis. The vulva is not anatomically related to the vagina at all, the actual vagina itself is nothing more than a birth canal. Embryos start off as &quot;sexually undifferentiated&quot;, meaning it comes with the parts necessary become both male or female. Maleness is only activated if a y chromosome is present, resulting in the gonads become testicles instead of ovaries. The vulva is the embryo&#039;s penis\/phallus template. Men have useless functional nipples they will never use for similar reasons. The female orgasm is sort of like a pleasurable &quot;trick&quot; some women can get themselves to do. Just like men can make their nipples lactate with enough effort. When a woman achieves this neat little trick, you can actually see her erectile muscles and pelvic area contract in the same way men do when they orgasm. These involuntary contractions are what pushes the semen out of the urethra during ejaculation.<br><br>Women just were not shaped by evolution to enjoy sex. &quot;Female sexuality&quot; is a mostly new idea that feminist invented.","filename":"1490057447481","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490300920693,"time":1490300920,"md5":"F95cPomUZv7UZ69T9g7nbA==","fsize":79408,"resto":117971987,"id":"Oj1cE5d3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117978574,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)16:28:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"It wasn&#039;t all that great for everyone<br><br>Men came back from WW2 with morphine addictions, and the women were popping vallium<br><br>Women still cheated, affairs were not uncommon <br><br>Instead of getting abortions, women would have the kid then drop it off in a dumpster or on a stoop in the next town over<br><br>Drinking\/smoking a lot more.

By some miracle of magic, you have been given the ability to change the course of American politics forever. You can choose which party is in power from 2018-2022, after which the future is uncertain. Your choices are as follows: <br><br>Option 1: Total Republican Rule<br><br>The GOP gains a supermajority in the house and senate, and takes near-complete control of all state legislatures (except for the deep blue states, where they get 50-60% of the seats). Two liberal SCOTUS justices retire, and enough federal\/circuit judges retire to open up even the 9th Circuit to a conservative majority. This GOP is dedicated to fiscal conservatism and will drastically cut taxes, regulation, and spending, possibly privatizing social security and neutering medicare. The GOP will, however, double the current immigration level and pass a pseudo-amnesty for illegal immigrants. Many of the new GOP members are cultural libertarians and crypto-progressives, and will begin to push the party left on social issues after an initial period of appealing to Christian conservatives (except gun control, they will repeal the National Firearms Act and make a Constitutional Carry Amendment).","filename":"red_pill_blue_pill-copy3","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":289,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":144,"tim":1493940229274,"time":1493940229,"md5":"99SlJ+cVlp8fmL8x1Opn6w==","fsize":33724,"resto":0,"id":"ScL0mI0v","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"which-party-would-you-choose","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":124128948,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)19:24:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124128905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124128905<\/a><br><br>Option 2: American Democrats<br><br>A new political party called the American Democrat Party is created in advance of the 2018 elections, and sweep their way into power, winning many seats by less than 5% in a three-way split. They will narrowly win the 2020 presidency in a dramatic electoral tie and House vote. They are culturally conservative ethnonationalists and economically pragmatic. They will win a majority of state legislatures and majorities in the House and Senate, enough to barely pass their agenda after a bitter fight. They will repeal and replace the 1965 Immigration Act with a 95% white quota at current immigration number levels, favoring Northern European races. They will replace the Federal Reserve with a national public bank. However, they will institute single-payer healthcare and national gun licensing\/registration (though they repeal the Hughes Amendment and don&#039;t ban anything). <br><br>The ADP is skilled at propaganda and persuasion (though not to the degree as the Nazis), and they will begin to gradually roll back cultural Marxist advances in all of society, suppressing the media and intellectuals who criticize Western traditions. By the end of their 4 year period, their favorability ratings will be 25% strongly for, 25% strongly against, 50% indifferent. Through their control of the media, education, and their influence, they will have reverted social progress in all spheres to late 2000s levels. If they stay in power, they will continue this success, and will start to push for the annexation of Alberta and other territories, beginning a new era of American colonialism and expansion.","time":1493940256,"resto":124128905,"id":"ScL0mI0v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124129005,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)19:24:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124128948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124128948<\/a><br><br>Option 3: Accelerationism <br><br>The GOP is decimated in the 2018 midterms by the Democratic Party, and President Elizabeth Warren wins 2020 in a landslide to become the first female president. Most of the new Democrats are faux-progressives, and aside from destroying middle America with new climate regulations and taxes, they push a neoliberal agenda. They will quadruple the current immigration level, pass full amnesty, and open &quot;Cultural Assimilation Centers&quot; all over white suburbs and towns where immigrants are relocated to be given jobs and low-cost housing. They promote a diverse and equitable society for all, mandating diversity quotas in all businesses and government programs. Social liberalism is upped to the nth degree, and all of the news media becomes like &quot;Bill Nye Saves the World&quot; after conservative news outlets are &quot;&quot;&quot;closed&quot;&quot;&quot;. 4chan is taken down in violation of hate speech laws. Gender identity exploration classes are made mandatory in elementary school, inflammatory speech is banned, and semi-automatic rifles are banned, with a New York City-style permit process required for all new gun purchases. There is a high likelihood of mass armed uprisings in protest of the new government. <br><br>What do you choose? <br>http:\/\/www.strawpoll.me\/12896521","time":1493940283,"resto":124128905,"id":"ScL0mI0v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124129046,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)19:24:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124128905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124128905<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124128948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124128948<\/a><br>Would you like some right wing with your right wing turkey","time":1493940298,"resto":124128905,"id":"9iFJgS4C","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124129250,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)19:26:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124128948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124128948<\/a><br>Obviously the American Democrat Party.","time":1493940377,"resto":124128905,"id":"1uiahLGi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

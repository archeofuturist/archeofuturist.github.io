In contrast to the self-enclosed, regimented spaces of the disciplinary societies which operated through successive &#039;striations&#039; or discrete enclosures such that &#039;one was always starting again (from school to the barracks, from the barracks to the factory)&#039; the societies of control are characterised by a &#039;variable geometry&#039;. Within this variable geometry boundaries become permeable, consequently societies of control announce themselves as a general &#039;crisis&#039; of all &#039;interiors&#039; and, in contrast to the disciplinary regimes, in the societies of control &#039;one is never finished with anything&#039;, instead we encounter only &#039;limitless postponements&#039;. Deleuze highlights the differing dynamics of these regimes through the distinction between &#039;molds&#039; and &#039;modulation&#039;:<br><br> &#039;Enclosures are molds, distinct castings, but controls are a modulation, like a self-deforming cast that will continuously change from one moment to the other, or like a sieve whose mesh will transmute from point to point.&#039;&quot;<br><br>http:\/\/www.thehowlingfantods.com\/df<wbr>w\/addiction-and-the-societies-of-co<wbr>ntrol-david-foster-wallaces-infinit<wbr>e-jest.html","time":1490516800,"resto":118335703,"id":"ZbV3ZqHS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118338751,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)04:27:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118335703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118335703<\/a><br>These wojaks keep getting weirder and weirder.","time":1490516875,"resto":118335703,"id":"5teKjdvl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118340035,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)04:44:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118338658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118338658<\/a><br>Cont. <br><br>Im in rehab and its teaching me a lot about the human experience with regard to filling voids and the ineluctable worship of something whether it be internet or football or knitting or fast food and the nuances of general existence and whatnot and maybe studying our condition from a philosophical stance is te place to start.

The point of Holly&#039;s character lifestyle is less about the concept of independence, and more so about the fear of commitment and potential loss of freedom. She doesn&#039;t necessarily stop living a &quot;feminist&quot; lifestyle because Paul not only indulges in, but enjoys actively participating in her interests and lifestyle. I&#039;ve always seen the film as more of a critique on the social expectations of western civilization, particularly during the 1950s and 60s.","time":1490629639,"resto":118519294,"id":"BwZ+MyKv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

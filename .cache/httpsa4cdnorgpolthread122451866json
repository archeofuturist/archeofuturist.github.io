But guess what he rose on the third day because death could not hold it&#039;s grip on the blessed son of God and when you are resurrected on the day of judgement the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead will also be the same spirit that raised you on the last day.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How to enter heaven<\/span><br>One enters into heaven through faith alone, for Christ had already died for our sins and so what could we possibly add on to that? Are we to say that the blood of Christ is not sufficient and we are to add onto that? No, his blood cleansed us of sin and to be cleansed of your sins you first must believe and Christ will do the rest.<br><br>I invite Christians, agnostics, atheists and everything in between, that includes people of other faith, to discuss Christianity and learn more about the largest religion in the world.

I deliberately not include the answer so that people can ask this question and I can respond to it. The reason why I do this is because I believe that through conversation and effective questioning it can cause you to think deeper about the truth of the gospel. Ok, I&#039;ll begin.<br><br>Yes, we are saved from faith alone apart from works. This is an undeniable truth of scripture Jut look at this verse from Romans in the Bible<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.<\/span><br>Romans 3:28<br><br>But then this make one wonder. Doesn&#039;t this contradict James?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.<\/span><br>James 2:24<br><br>But what one must first understand is that there are two kinds of faith. One is false faith, the type that even the devil has, then there&#039;s true faith; the type that brings forth good fruits IE proof of it&#039;s existence by doing good works. A better verse to understand this would be on James as well.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passa<wbr>ge\/?search=james+2:14-20<\/span><br>James 2:14-20<br><br>So what does this tell us? It says that if you have faith but it does not bring good fruits then it is false. A truly saved man will do good works not to get something out of God since his heavenly place has been set for him since he has been saved by the blood of Christ but rather that we do it out of love. You treat your children nicely out of love not to seem good to them, and so we do the same for god. We love God and so try to please him. Theoretically, you could be saved and go out on a murder spree, but you wouldn&#039;t do that due to your love of God. <br><br>Hope that answered your question.","time":1492969120,"resto":122451866,"id":"FYhKs4C0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122453411,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)13:39:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122452775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122452775<\/a><br>good point","time":1492969142,"resto":122451866,"id":"XdOCGV8E","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122453671,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)13:41:09","name":"JW on \/pol\/","com":"<a href=\"#p122452470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122452470<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(Proverbs 18:1) One isolating himself will seek [his own] selfish longing; against all practical wisdom he will break forth<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(Matthew 5:44,45,46) However, I say to YOU: Continue to love YOUR enemies and to pray for those persecuting YOU; 45 that YOU may prove yourselves sons of YOUR Father who is in the heavens, since he makes his sun rise upon wicked people and good and makes it rain upon righteous people and unrighteous. 46) For if YOU love those loving YOU, what reward do YOU have?

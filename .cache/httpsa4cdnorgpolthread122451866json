But guess what he rose on the third day because death could not hold it&#039;s grip on the blessed son of God and when you are resurrected on the day of judgement the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead will also be the same spirit that raised you on the last day.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How to enter heaven<\/span><br>One enters into heaven through faith alone, for Christ had already died for our sins and so what could we possibly add on to that? Are we to say that the blood of Christ is not sufficient and we are to add onto that?

I deliberately not include the answer so that people can ask this question and I can respond to it. The reason why I do this is because I believe that through conversation and effective questioning it can cause you to think deeper about the truth of the gospel. Ok, I&#039;ll begin.<br><br>Yes, we are saved from faith alone apart from works. This is an undeniable truth of scripture Jut look at this verse from Romans in the Bible<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.<\/span><br>Romans 3:28<br><br>But then this make one wonder. Doesn&#039;t this contradict James?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.<\/span><br>James 2:24<br><br>But what one must first understand is that there are two kinds of faith. One is false faith, the type that even the devil has, then there&#039;s true faith; the type that brings forth good fruits IE proof of it&#039;s existence by doing good works. A better verse to understand this would be on James as well.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passa<wbr>ge\/?search=james+2:14-20<\/span><br>James 2:14-20<br><br>So what does this tell us? It says that if you have faith but it does not bring good fruits then it is false. A truly saved man will do good works not to get something out of God since his heavenly place has been set for him since he has been saved by the blood of Christ but rather that we do it out of love. You treat your children nicely out of love not to seem good to them, and so we do the same for god. We love God and so try to please him. Theoretically, you could be saved and go out on a murder spree, but you wouldn&#039;t do that due to your love of God. <br><br>Hope that answered your question.","time":1492969120,"resto":122451866,"id":"FYhKs4C0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122453411,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)13:39:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122452775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122452775<\/a><br>good point","time":1492969142,"resto":122451866,"id":"XdOCGV8E","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122453671,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)13:41:09","name":"JW on \/pol\/","com":"<a href=\"#p122452470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122452470<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(Proverbs 18:1) One isolating himself will seek [his own] selfish longing; against all practical wisdom he will break forth<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(Matthew 5:44,45,46) However, I say to YOU: Continue to love YOUR enemies and to pray for those persecuting YOU; 45 that YOU may prove yourselves sons of YOUR Father who is in the heavens, since he makes his sun rise upon wicked people and good and makes it rain upon righteous people and unrighteous. 46) For if YOU love those loving YOU, what reward do YOU have?

The works that faith needs is not just simple &quot;good deeds&quot; otherwise any gay atheist liberal handing a sandwich over to a homeless person is now saved. No, the &quot;works&quot; that the Bible demands you practice is DEMONSTRATIONS of faith and EXERCISE of faith. These demonstrations of your faith is done by abstaining from all immorality, degeneracy, and hypocrisy. It is also DEMONSTRATED and EXERCISED by practicing INTEGRITY. The ability to stand up to pressure, threats, intimidation, and threat of pain\/death itself ON BEHALF OF CHRIST. This is what Peter failed at when he denied Jesus publicly three times. He showed a lack of integrity because, at the time, his faith in Christ promise to be resurrected was weak. <br><br>So basically, as many say today.

The Church, they said, is seeking to arouse religious war in France, and is summoning to her aid the violent persecution which has been the object of her prayers. What a strange accusation! Founded by Him who came to bring peace to the world and to reconcile man with God, a Messenger of peace upon earth, the Church could only seek religious war by repudiating her high mission and belying it before the eyes of all. To this mission of patient sweetness and love she rests and will remain always faithful. Besides, the whole world now knows that if peace of conscience is broken in France, that is not the work of the Church but of her enemies. Fair-minded men, even though not of our faith, recognize that if there is a struggle on the question of religion in your beloved country, it is not because the Church was the first to unfurl the flag, but because war was declared against her. During the last twenty-five years she has had to undergo this warfare. That is the truth and the proof of it is seen in the declarations made and repeated over and over again in the Press, at meetings, at Masonic congresses, and even in Parliament, as well as in the attacks which have been progressively and systematically directed against her. These facts are undeniable, and no argument can ever make away with them. The Church then does not wish for war, and religious war least of all.

The Judaizers, who were trying to enter heaven by their works, were following descriptive text where the OT comments on the old covenant laws that which we are not to live by today. But the same is for everywhere in the Bible where it talks about works; they&#039;re always descriptive. E.g., sacrifice our children to prove our faith in God like Abraham (Gen. 22). Make rash vows like Jephthah (Judges 11:30-31). <br><br>But what we are prescribed to do it believe and have faith.<br><br>In Romans four there is a very important word used, and you seem to be missing here.

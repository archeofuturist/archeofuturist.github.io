I think a satellite was taken down as it flew over the US. <br><br>No reason to think we haven&#039;t used our automated space shuttle to intercept and hack every nations satellites. That&#039;s what we built the ships for and Obama flew them several times a year for weeks long missions. <br><br>During escalated military situations we always keep a functioning command and control center in the air, on the surface, below ground, and under water. The Orion&#039;s are likely fueling the airborne command and control systems in a safe region of our ocean. The hawker hunters are old and obsolete. So it&#039;s likely just code for military plane operating in civil air space.<br><br>I saw a very small report almost as a foot note in one of the journals that stated simply &quot;us may attempt to destroy north Korean satellite as it passes over the United States tonight.&quot;<br><br>I think someone flipped a switch on a transmitter last night and hacked a satellite to pilot it into the atmosphere. Most likely done from a plane on the sky over the Pacific. <br><br>Trump is blinding Best Korea.","filename":"IMG_4526","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":1800,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492060673005,"time":1492060673,"md5":"jgd5DUb4sd0BACyt\/7q9eA==","fsize":530584,"resto":0,"id":"PQbDNlFv","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-think-i-figured-it-out-that-thing-that-came","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120872056,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)01:21:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120871721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120871721<\/a><br>Would be breddy cool","time":1492060905,"resto":120871721,"id":"4MrK1FTP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

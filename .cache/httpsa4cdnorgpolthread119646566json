Trump, a useful idiot, went along with their measures.<br>-Trump probably stands to benefit financially from making the Russians happy but is not a foreign agent or some Tom Clancy shit like that.<br>-Key figures within Trump&#039;s circle also stand to benefit enormously from making Putin happy. Maybe some of them are actually compromised, maybe some of them are useful idiots.<br>-The GOP establishment knows some or all of this but won&#039;t admit it because then they wouldn&#039;t get to undo all the bad black man&#039;s actions, kill net neutrality, slash taxes, and generally buttfuck this country right in the pussy.<br>-Some figures in Trump&#039;s circle will resign in disgrace. Maybe one will go to jail.<br>-Trump will call it all fake news or say he knew something was off about those guys but was focused on MAGA and will not lose a single Republican voter.<br>-Sean Spicer will hang himself.<br>-Trump will beat Franken\/Warren or whoever the fuck in 2020 but lose the popular vote by even more.","time":1491424144,"resto":119646566,"id":"dLbFlaxA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119651982,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)16:32:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119651595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119651595<\/a><br>I&#039;m interested in your ideas, explain in detail each of your bullet points.

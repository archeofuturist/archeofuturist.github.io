One true king. One true Crown.

So much so that nowhere else in the world can you find anything remotely similar. One massive Military, dominant projection force, global dependent economy, and cancerous culture that infects every single nation on the planet. We are the center of the world. <br><br>We have passed a point now technology, and socially that there is no reverting. The world has been fine tuned to revolve around us.

We are not losing the mantle without taking all you worthless pieces of shit out with us, so you better get used to us being the top dog, or make a move.

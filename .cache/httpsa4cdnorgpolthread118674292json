That Trump would&#039;ve fulfill every promise he made in the campaign trail. <br><br>But now that he won, we&#039;re watching him and the GOP implode on themselves. He&#039;s backing down on his promises. And when he does &quot;fulfill&quot; his promise he&#039;s doing it half-assed. (For example, the wall is still getting built. But instead of Mexico paying for it, he&#039;s taxing Americans for it)<br><br>I voted for Trump, but these days I kinda wish he would&#039;ve lost. Having that dream of him winning is much better than what we&#039;re seeing now.","filename":"1476820788830","ext":".png","w":600,"h":621,"tn_w":241,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490723539697,"time":1490723539,"md5":"IWFvo5pUsOo1\/hWFpS0uqA==","fsize":39060,"resto":0,"id":"gU3r36ou","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"if-hillary-had-won-at-least-we-would-still-have","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118674541,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)13:54:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118674292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118674292<\/a><br>It&#039;s been 2 months, fuck off","time":1490723682,"resto":118674292,"id":"kr5VsHVA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118675023,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)13:59:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118674292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118674292<\/a><br>Fuck the old hag witch Hillary Clinton.

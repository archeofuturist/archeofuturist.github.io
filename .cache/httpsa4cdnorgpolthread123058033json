Corporations are government fictions. They shield individuals by allowing them to have ownership without responsibility. The modern corporate law and tax structure is an example of regulatory capture, these regulations don&#039;t protect the consumer but artificially raise the barrier to entry (licensing, requirements, fees) to keep out disruptive competition and ease the cost of doing business at higher levels (tax strategies, litigation, IP). <br><br>2. A business which charges consumers extreme prices just for profit is a high time-preference (short term), economically unfavorable strategy. This is not to say that people always act rationally, but given that there is no such thing as a natural monopoly, artificially raising prices to attempt to create profit (1) bids the price above what the market can bear, REDUCING profits -- you may price hike 30% but now only 10% of your consumer base can still afford it; and (2) as other Anons have said, creates a niche for competitors to expand. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Why do free-marketeers speak about corporations as though they are people when they are not? <\/span><br><br>A privately held corporation is made up of individuals who own the corporation in the same way you own your body. They can use the corporation to advocate it&#039;s own interests, to speak and behave freely in any way a person would.<br><br>What most people have a problem with is that corporations have lobbied to get it both ways: all of the liberties without assuming the risk. The individuals responsible for making corporate decisions are rarely held personally accountable for damages, debts, crimes -- attributing these things to the collective non-person.

I know there is a lot of hostility to the idea right now, but maybe by discussing it more, we can help change Midwestern perspectives on the matter. <br><br>A NASA scientist noted a few days ago that a pipeline is probably inevitable in the future:<br><br>http:\/\/www.ideastream.org\/news\/nasa<wbr>-scientist-undoing-great-lakes-prog<wbr>ress-would-take-generations-to-reco<wbr>ver<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;NASA Scientist: Undoing Great Lakes Progress Would Take Generations To Recover<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The fresh water of the Great Lakes is the lifeblood for our region, but in the future it may be seen as a lifeblood to other regions, too. That\u2019s just one thought shared with me by Jay Famiglietti, a hydrologist and Senior Water Scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory...<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;GANZER [Interviewer]: \u201cThe Great Lakes make up about 20% of the freshwater supply, in volume, in the world. How do the Great Lakes fit into this crisis? How does their health fit in?\u201c<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;FAMIGLIETTI: \u201cWell the health of course is very important, but from a quantity perspective you might imagine that there\u2019s a giant bullseye that can be seen from space that\u2019s sitting above the Great Lakes, meaning: it\u2019s a target-area in a sense for the rests of the country. Because there\u2019s so much fresh water, you can imagine that 50 years from now, well we\u2019re already talking about this, but 50 years from now there might actually be a pipeline that brings water from the Great Lakes to Phoenix. I think that\u2019s part of our future.\u201d<\/span>","filename":"Great Lakes","ext":".jpg","w":2100,"h":1701,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":202,"tim":1492151676187,"time":1492151676,"md5":"Gq19+0YXt2fEKca5I60DKw==","fsize":645382,"resto":0,"id":"D15mCVwJ","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"do-you-think-that-the-great-lakes-will-eventually","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":2,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121029466,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)02:38:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121029194\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121029194<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;GANZER: \u201cSo the protections that we have on who can draw from the Great Lakes Watershed, you think those will go away out of necessity?\u201c<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;FAMIGLIETTI: \u201cI think the only way that would happen would be with national intervention, and we actually lack that national water policy in this country.

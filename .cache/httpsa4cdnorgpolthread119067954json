May she rest in peace. I was a foster kid and dealt with some gruesome people... but I got good, got stronger, got help, got enlisted, got educated, got involved... and then got revenge. Many of my foster brothers and sisters never get to the strong part. Very few don&#039;t &#039;get good&#039;, but very few think that isn&#039;t enough. They&#039;re just... broken. Broken people scratching and clawing their way to the next bit of safe ground, always letting every extended hand feel like a savior. Broken records playing the same bad song over and over... broken hearts and broken minds, finally waking up and seeing nothing but their own errors and not the failures of the people around them that helped them make those mistakes and took their advantage.<br><br>For any of you folks here with similar issues, it&#039;s a multi-step process to recovering from abuse, no matter what kind:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get good.

It doesn&#039;t take a degree, but a degree can be something you want. Learn about the interests you have had and chose a way forward.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get involved. I was a CASA. Not a social worker, not a lawyer. They all knew I was a dangerous person whose kids were not to be fucked with. Try it.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get revenge.

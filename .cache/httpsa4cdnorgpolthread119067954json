May she rest in peace. I was a foster kid and dealt with some gruesome people... but I got good, got stronger, got help, got enlisted, got educated, got involved... and then got revenge.

Broken people scratching and clawing their way to the next bit of safe ground, always letting every extended hand feel like a savior. Broken records playing the same bad song over and over... broken hearts and broken minds, finally waking up and seeing nothing but their own errors and not the failures of the people around them that helped them make those mistakes and took their advantage.<br><br>For any of you folks here with similar issues, it&#039;s a multi-step process to recovering from abuse, no matter what kind:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get good.

Certainly, before revenge, you do EVERYTHING else first I mentioned above. Know where you stand, have the resources and ability to follow through, do so, and do not wait for the machinery that failed you to fail the people you could help. Vengeance IS empty if only what you know about your own anger is what is on the plate when you sit down to the feast.<br><br>I will say that one incident in which I could have gotten vengeance involved a street incident in which the target ran away. That target is still one of the two I managed to get locked up, but came as a result of me stopping him from beating a foster child in his care and trying to find something to finish him with. The police took the child&#039;s report, let me go and later I came back as a witness to testify to my own severe beatings in his home.<br><br>I still know that foster kid, he is in college now, doing better than average and playing baseball, which is pretty good and normal in my opinion.","time":1490982315,"resto":119067954,"country":"GE","country_name":"Georgia"}]}

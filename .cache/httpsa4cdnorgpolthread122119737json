Public schools should not be allowed to sue each other in petty battles like this over funding.<br><br>What happened was the public school got upset more students were going to the Catholic school and sued them to take away their funding and lost. More students. The increased funding was coming from the students, because the more students you have the more funding you receive. The catholic school wasn&#039;t turning anyone away. They want kids to come so they can teach them their religion. It&#039;s a core belief. The public school was upset they were losing students\/money. They brought this upon themselves. This case isn&#039;t about what the headline says. The headline should be:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Evil secular school senses dwindling support for their values and abuses government funds to sue it&#039;s own institution.<\/span><br><br>Schools should not be allowed to play politics like this. If the public school wanted to sue the catholic one, the funds should have come out of the union coffers or from donations. This is a petty battle between administrators and surprise surprise, the religion ends up being the target even though they were in the right. A ten year court case and all they managed to accomplish was more protections for religion.

I got a bit of a plan to make these lefties use their brains for once (hopefully).<br><br>Emma Watson (Harry Potter, human rights activist) has just starred in a new movie, and has already gotten criticism from a couple of places (Rotten Tomatoes has given it a pretty low rating at 17%)<br><br>Now, I want to start a campaign saying that the movie is actually amazing and portrays social media in the most accurate way; anyone who says otherwise is only seeing it from their point of view, which is one where they have used and relied on social media so much.<br><br>If anyone says anything bad about the movie, we can just disregard them as &quot;Emma Watson haters&quot; and &quot;Anti-human-rights&quot;. To add further to this, John Boyega (black dude from The Force Awakens) is also in the movie. We can also say that anyone who hates on the movie is racist or discriminatory, since the movie is led by a woman and a black guy.<br><br>Call it a long shot, but I think it could work. Just need a stable plan to get it in action.","filename":"Screenshot_2017-05-02-09-19-32","ext":".png","w":480,"h":800,"tn_w":150,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493681498088,"time":1493681498,"md5":"8c\/ZgA9PlTJUAsUCX4pwMA==","fsize":289399,"resto":0,"id":"Y7XdcDQk","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-circle","country_name":"Australia","replies":11,"images":0,"unique_ips":8},{"no":123691503,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)19:34:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"ill give you your first reply to see where it goes.","time":1493681642,"resto":123691204,"id":"eklgyEYT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123691602,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)19:34:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1493681698,"resto":123691204,"id":"C7jt3Zji","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123691850,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)19:37:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123691204\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123691204<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We can also say that anyone who hates on the movie is racist or discriminatory, since the movie is led by a woman and a black guy<\/span><br><br>ermahgerd leftists will lose their shit1!

It involves our beloved founders who were active participants in liberalism, so sit tight and pop some popcorn.<br>It all began five hundred years ago--to the year, actually--with the Protestant revolt. The new doctrine of private interpretation was enshrined in a new religion which took the Scriptures of the Church and reinterpreted them according to each and every person&#039;s intellect. Not much different than taking someone else&#039;s work and interpreting their work for them. This principle, in practice, split Europe from its historical patrimony and cut off huge swaths of her from the Church. Princes, caring little for religion, saw opportunities to loot Church wealth and property. Oh, Reformation indeed!<br>Theology aside, the principle of private judgement was burning in the hearts and minds of men all over Western Europe. This theological principle soon became a philosophical principle, and Protestants sick of the &quot;constraints&quot; of Christianity began setting their mental axes to philosophy. Humanism was born, and further was developed into secular humanism as the Greeks fled West to escape Mahometan persecution, bringing with them their pagan texts which previously had been interpreted in a Christian light--now were unleashed in their pagan interpretation. This was Renaissance.","time":1490679838,"resto":118611144,"id":"2E4kHeVR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118617274,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:44:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118611144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118611144<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118617224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118617224<\/a><br><br>Those revolutionaries whose fathers thumbed their nose at the Church, and they who tended to the iconoclasm of Christian philosophy set to realize their philosophies in the socio-political realm.

Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9, they said. Overthrow of altar and of throne.<br>This wonderful time was called the Enlightenment. These men were so enlightened, they set their axes to the seven day week, murdered the clergy and Catholic faithful, looted the churches (much like their Protestant ancestors), enthroned a prostitute on the altar of the Paris cathedral and founded the Cult of Reason! These enlightened individuals were the bloody result of that wonderful, God-given philosophy of classical liberalism which put the rights of man over the rights of God.<br>No longer would God have any representative over the people. The State would be indifferent!

If Bearing did a little bit of research on Richard, he would have found that trying to attack his character is one of the many mistakes that other YouTubers have done. Hell, just about a week ago, that muslim individual did the same thing. This might work if Richard was more a social structure person but he isn&#039;t. His arguments are solely base on research done by Health Organizations, governments, Independent companies, and Colleges. These primary sources that he uses have been peer reviewed by multiple perspectives. It was embarrassing that Bearing would even tried this tactic.

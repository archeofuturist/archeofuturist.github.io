It all revolves around this question: How long the &quot;days&quot; of Genesis 1? Young earth creationists have written many thousands of pages of material, arguing that you can only interpret the Hebrew as a 24-hour day. Our argument here is much simpler, and will only take a few sentences.<br><br>How long is a day in Genesis Chapter 1? Consider this\u2026the Bible says a day to the Lord is as a thousand years to man (II Peter 3:8). Remember, Adam was created on the sixth day, and these \u201cdays\u201d were as God sees days, because only God was here\u2026not man. Man was only here at the very end of the sixth day.<br><br>Therefore, it doesn\u2019t matter how I interpret the word day in human languages\u2026the question is, \u2018What is a day to God?\u2019 Think about this\u2026if you are in the middle of space, and you are the all-powerful, all-knowing, eternal God of the universe, who never sleeps, then what is a \u201cday\u201d to you? If you are eternal, what meaning does time have for you? Wow, there goes another million years! It won\u2019t matter because you have billions more! <br><br>If you are convinced that the earth is 4.5 billion years old, and you are convinced the world was created, and did not happen by chance, then you must come to the conclusion that a day for God is a long period of time. God gives us the term day so that limited, finite man can better understand the creation story.","time":1492849751,"resto":122251776,"id":"LqIufsG\/","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122254783,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:29:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122252122\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122252122<\/a><br>This whore looks like Megan Kelly.","time":1492849754,"resto":122251776,"id":"dedeBPo6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122254828,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:29:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122252288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122252288<\/a><br>This, no mexicans for some medicore animals is a solid trade off for me.","time":1492849797,"resto":122251776,"id":"G3Agr+Vv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122254872,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:30:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122251776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122251776<\/a><br>Oh no, some animals have to move.

Not at all. Yes, you can argue for a literal 24-hour day, but it is just as easy to find Hebrew scholars who believe in an old earth, and say that &quot;day&quot; is a long period of time. So, as a believer, it is up to you to decide who is right.<br><br>Consider the use of the word &quot;Yom&quot; by Moses. In the Genesis creation account and in Psalm 90 (written by Moses), it is used four different ways!<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1.12-Hour Period. In Genesis 1:5, it says &quot;God called the light \u201cday,\u201d and the darkness he called \u201cnight.\u201d And there was evening, and there was morning\u2014the first day.&quot; This use of &quot;Yom&quot; is for a 12-hour period.<\/span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2.24-Hour Period.

This use of &quot;Yom&quot; is for a 24-hour day.<\/span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3.The Entire Creative Week. In Genesis 2:4, it says &quot;This is the account of the heavens and the earth when they were created. In the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens.&quot; Here, &quot;Yom&quot; refers to the entire six-day creative week.<\/span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4.A Long Period of Time. Psalm 90:4 says, &quot;For a thousand years in your sight are like a day that has just gone by, or like a watch in the night.&quot; In this instance, Moses says &quot;Yom&quot; is like a thousand years.<\/span><br><br><br>In each case, it is the same author, Moses, who uses the word &quot;Yom&quot; to represent a different period of time.

In order to impress her he returns to islam. When her father finds out,he doesn&#039;t allow him to marry her until he becomes fully devout. He loses respect from his family and his career in order to be more devout to faith. <br><br>Meanwhile,she is forced to be even more devout and she undergoes heavy sharia life practice. She gets ill from abuse and eventually dies.The guy finds out it was because of him and falls into severe depression. He goes to US but becomes more religious,in order to make up for suffering. He meets some christian girl and starts going out with her to feel better. He also starts to make her convert to muslimah but then she loses her family and then starts to undergo sharia lifestyle.<br><br>He realizes she is also suffering just like the girl that died and in the end leaves her,for her to not have same fate. When he comes back to Pakistan he loses respect from religious community and still can&#039;t back to his family and friends and realizes religion destroyed him and gives up on it. <br><br>Basically lose everything ,but still happy that you are red pilled.","filename":"K34tz2ijjhsdhf","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":576,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1493054291714,"time":1493054291,"md5":"9lQKepZcd1QKnOxCs\/oczQ==","fsize":34045,"resto":0,"id":"zfYJ5ntD","country":"HR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"finished-watching-a-paki-series-called-khuda-aur","country_name":"Croatia","replies":14,"images":0,"unique_ips":8},{"no":122610221,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:21:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;a Paki series<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;talking shit about islamists<\/span><br>wat","time":1493054474,"resto":122609880,"id":"Su20GuV7","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122610592,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:23:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122609880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122609880<\/a><br>nice. will use to redpill my indonesian friends who insist &quot;religion of peace, guys.&quot;","time":1493054639,"resto":122609880,"id":"5ytWFWWr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122611004,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:27:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122610221\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122610221<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122610592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122610592<\/a><br>Sounds like it was talking shit on both extremely religious and extremely irreligious people\/communities<br><a href=\"#p122609880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122609880<\/a><br>Are you going to link the drama so we know wtf you&#039;re talking about?","time":1493054826,"resto":122609880,"id":"iZ75cThN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122611283,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:29:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122611004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122611004<\/a><br><br>http:\/\/www.dailymotion.com\/video\/x5<wbr>0mzds","time":1493054950,"resto":122609880,"id":"zfYJ5ntD","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":122611442,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:30:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122609880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122609880<\/a><br>Bruh what were you on who watches these shows","time":1493055022,"resto":122609880,"id":"kA+xA06a","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":122612175,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:36:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122611283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122611283<\/a><br>Just read the (poorly written and with poor grammar) synopsis on Wikipedia.

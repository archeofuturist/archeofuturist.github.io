Tons of people on the right and even those on the left like Antifa. More and more people are coming to the consensus every day that Civil War II in the United States is inevitable at this point.<br><br>Trump has essentially totally discredited himself (pic related). He&#039;s done too many 180s to name and it looks like he has no intention of stopping his 180s. By 2018-2019 he may be unrecognizable from the Trump that was elected. I as well as many others I think thought that Trump might be able to put some things back together and stall a Civil War II but it looks like he really has no intention of that at all (and if not him then there really is no one else in all of America that could or would)<br><br>So with this prospect of Civil War II, I&#039;m seeing a lot of people saying that the best course of action for the right is to go full accelerationist and collapse America sooner rather than later so we can get the violence over with (from an ethno-nationalist pov, the argument is that when the war happens we will need all the whites we can get and we better have a war while whites are still the majority). <br><br>So, what does being an accelerationist mean in practical terms? What is it that the voting citizen of the US who believes in accelerationism should do? Is it even the best idea at this point?","filename":"18197483_401012866964777_908351919_n","ext":".png","w":593,"h":683,"tn_w":217,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493356082565,"time":1493356082,"md5":"mMmYg9XPcefS05k8O6RVCg==","fsize":394976,"resto":0,"id":"zrnFaTZZ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"accelerationism-101","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123151741,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)01:13:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s time to go to sleep now.

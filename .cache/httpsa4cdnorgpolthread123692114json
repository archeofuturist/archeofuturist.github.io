No funding cuts for sanctuary cities, and no money for a deportation force.<br><br>3. Non-defense domestic spending will go up, despite Trump\u2019s insistence it shouldn&#039;t.<br><br>4. The National Institutes of Health gets a $2 billion boost, on top of the huge increase it got last year. Trump vowed to slash its funding.<br><br>5. Trump also failed to cut money for other kinds of scientific inquiry. For example, he wanted to defund the Advanced Research Projects Agency\u2013Energy. Instead, it&#039;s getting a $15 million increase.<br><br>6. The EPA&#039;s budget is trimmed by just 1 percent, with no staff cuts. Trump wanted to cut the EPA by a third.<br><br>7. No cuts in funding of Planned Parenthood.<br><br>8. Trump gets less than half as much for the military as he said was necessary.<br><br>9. The measure doesn&#039;t fund the Justice Department for stopping medical marijuana in states where it has been legalized, even though Trump sought such funding.<br><br>10.

They figured it would be easy, or at least doable, because by then they would have dealt with finishing the confirmations of Trump&#039;s cabinet and would have a new healthcare bill that they agreed on. However, Paul Ryan failed to forward a bill that the GOP could agree on, and they apparently didn&#039;t predict the Dems to be as obstructionist with confirmations as they have been.

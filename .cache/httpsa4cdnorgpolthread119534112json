We have not been subjected to the kind of totalitarian \u2018co-ordination\u2019 that it might have been reasonable to expect.

Anyone who has lived long in a foreign country will know of instances of sensational items of news \u2014 things which on their own merits would get the big headlines-being kept right out of the British press, not because the Government intervened but because of a general tacit agreement that \u2018it wouldn\u2019t do\u2019 to mention that particular fact.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At any given moment there is an orthodoxy, a body of ideas which it is assumed that all right-thinking people will accept without question.

Anyone who challenges the prevailing orthodoxy finds himself silenced with surprising effectiveness. A genuinely unfashionable opinion is almost never given a fair hearing, either in the popular press or in the highbrow periodicals.<\/span><br><br>Orwell&#039;s true fear was not censorship, but intellectual cowardice and a climate that strongly encourages conformity without outright banning dissent.

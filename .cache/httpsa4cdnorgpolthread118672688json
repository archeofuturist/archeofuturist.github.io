Then they were starved so that the max number possible could be crammed into incinerators. With this version of history, in theory you can make up any body count you want because there are almost no corpses as most were turned to ash.<br><br>My question is this. If you were going to exterminate the Jews by going to great lengths to conceal them being exterminated and to conceal the body count, wouldn&#039;t it be more economical and make more sense to round them up and transport the Jews to one of the 10 active volcanoes in Europe? You don&#039;t need to wait for them to starve or spend any upkeep costs on those you&#039;re going to execute. You just have them jump into one of the 10 volcanoes and let the lava incinerate their body. Fat or thin, lava don&#039;t care.","filename":"download","ext":".jpg","w":193,"h":116,"tn_w":193,"tn_h":116,"tim":1490722638402,"time":1490722638,"md5":"hIa+9gF98BYHdxyxnQ8ehQ==","fsize":4623,"resto":0,"id":"POW131e1","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"holocaust-denialism-and-volcanoes","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":1,"unique_ips":9},{"no":118672963,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)13:39:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118672688\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118672688<\/a><br>Hmmm...

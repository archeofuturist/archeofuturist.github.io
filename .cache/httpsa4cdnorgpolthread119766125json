This means that while it has the shores for you and your man to cuddle up on against the waves, the island has a downtown city like neighborhood full of bars, nice restaurants, and museums for those who may be interested in low key experiences during the day. The island itself is not a gay destination, however it\u2019s by far one of the most gay friendly communities, which allows the island to draw away the stereotypes of being a gay resort while allowing both straight and gay couples to enjoy the overall feel of a getaway experience.<br><br>The gay Tahiti experience is one that is great and remember-able for first time visiting couples, as the population is gay friendly by being warm and welcoming and having some of the most kind, gentle, and open-minded people in the world. While the area may seem all business since it\u2019s the capital of the French Republic, People here are truly open to all cultures and lifestyles, and always try to focus their attention on the tranquility of island life.","filename":"obama_vacation__mstainerwashingtontimescom_1","ext":".jpg","w":2424,"h":1617,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491499699234,"time":1491499699,"md5":"JPhFKyDFXAgDtQNAOM+vAg==","fsize":1255918,"resto":119766125,"id":"Yd\/fZRK4","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119766498,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)13:28:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Will he ever set foot in the U.S. again?","time":1491499708,"resto":119766125,"id":"A39jBgRn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119766661,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)13:29:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119766498\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119766498<\/a><br>When he&#039;s arrested","time":1491499783,"resto":119766125,"id":"WVWD5Brh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119766918,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)13:31:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"There may not be an extradition treaty but what about muh Interpol?

But who is this 26 year-old Jeremy Lingvall, boyfriend to 66-year-old David &quot;Richest Man in Hollywood&quot; Geffen? And what the hell could he and Obama possibly have talked about over their heaping plates of arugula? (We can only assume that Barack and Jeremy are pretty tight, since the sole other complete couple at the table were Nancy and Paul Pelosi. John Kerry was there\u2014flying solo.)","filename":"obamacoconut","ext":".jpg","w":2700,"h":1993,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1491500679028,"time":1491500679,"md5":"ffF1ykeAyPgOBY1SnZQbOg==","fsize":1355909,"resto":119766125,"id":"Yd\/fZRK4","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

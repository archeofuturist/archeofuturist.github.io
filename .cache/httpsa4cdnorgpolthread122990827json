I believe that we are randomly born to a country, but people like me are spiritually connected to a country other than the ones we&#039;re born in. I loved the Turkish nation ever since I first learned about the Ottoman Empire and the Seljuk Turks.<br><br>There is Russian blood in my family, and I believe that I am of the same Altaic stock as the Turkish people. I have what the Turkish people would call &#039;Ruh&#039;; the spirit of a Turk. I like Oriental [near eastern] music, food, culture and although I&#039;m an Atheist [like the great Ataturk], I consider myself a cultural Muslim.<br><br>I&#039;ve taught myself Turkish and a little bit of Persian and Arabic. I&#039;ve applied to go to the prestigious Istanbul University where I will become a Poet and Turkicist. If I were born in an earlier age, I would have been a great Turkish bard, with my baglama I would sing tales of the steppe, of the great Khans, and Padishahs that brought us to Anatolia and hymns to Tengri the great lord of the sky, but alas, I am of the era of the Republics.<br><br>I mostly play Mount &amp; Blade: With Fire and Sword as the Crimean Khanate, and I love playing the Ottoman Empire in EU:IV. I&#039;m a long time 4channer, and I just wanted to say to everyone there are Turkophiles on this board, despite the endless memes. Shit like &#039;Remove Kebab&#039; really aren&#039;t funny. There&#039;s a reason the Turks had one of the largest, greatest and most illustrious Empires in history. You should have the same respect for them as most people do the Romans.<br><br>I just want to close by saying that Turkey shouldn&#039;t focus on Europe, but its Altaic brothers to the east. The Turkish people should reunite under a single banner, together they would be a greater force than Russia or Europe. Division makes the Turks weak, unity would make them strong.","filename":"fez","ext":".jpg","w":4320,"h":3240,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493265103557,"time":1493265103,"md5":"DmK\/4X2E\/\/BTY2yTDSSSLA==","fsize":1117908,"resto":0,"id":"U3Qowbs9","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"merhaba-thats-hello-in-turkish-int-i-am-a-19-yo","country_name":"Australia","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":7},{"no":122991001,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:53:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122990827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122990827<\/a><br>Recep tayyip erdogan pasa yasa","time":1493265186,"resto":122990827,"id":"ZFVVEyxb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122991415,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:56:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122990827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122990827<\/a><br>roaches gonna roach","time":1493265410,"resto":122990827,"id":"GsLN\/hn7","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122991699,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:59:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122990827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122990827<\/a><br><br>Blah blah blah.

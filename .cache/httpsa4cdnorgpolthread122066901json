It is true that unions often support democrats, almost exclusively as a matter of fact. Union workers, on the other hand, tend to be all over the political spectrum, at least here in the south. Union workers are also not lazy at all, I&#039;ve worked along side both union and non-union workers and it&#039;s about the same.<br><br>unions still serve a purpose and there is nothing wrong with collective bargaining. In the construction trades the contractors actually get quite a few benefits from being union. They can hire and lay off at will because of an almost unlimited supply of workers, this leads to less carrying costs. The workers they get are a known quantity, having to pass a practical test given by the union to make sure they are capable. The union handles a lot of the red tape regarding health insurance and the like. My union is in the south so it might be different up north, but I think the power balance is okay here. If anything, the employers still have too much power.","time":1492738160,"resto":122066901,"id":"LekhPW7f","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122076954,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:36:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122076237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122076237<\/a><br>South or North, the experience should be the same since union\/employer relations are handled at the Federal level, because states are corrupt as fuck.","time":1492738569,"resto":122066901,"id":"FSzsmmwC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122077165,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:37:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122076954\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122076954<\/a><br><br><a href=\"#p122076954\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122076954<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;union\/employer relations are handled at the Federal level, because states are corrupt as fuck.<\/span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; implying the federal govt isn&#039;t<\/span>","time":1492738671,"resto":122066901,"id":"TWorpFPr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122077320,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:39:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122076237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122076237<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is true that unions often support democrats<\/span><br>That alone is enough reason to scrap unions.

Alas, Dalai Lama being a self-professed Marxist, isn&#039;t someone who is particularly well-equipped for intelligent thought, let alone any thought at all.","filename":"3","ext":".jpg","w":120,"h":90,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":90,"tim":1490438721558,"time":1490438721,"md5":"MSpAnWDDk9NpNSsyCzi1eQ==","fsize":4677,"resto":0,"id":"+6zd2RoH","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-dalai-lama-is-retarded","country_name":"Australia","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":118213421,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:53:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118212842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118212842<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that any practitioner of violence is no longer a genuine Muslim<\/span><br>I agree with you on one count based on this. Who the fuck is he to say someone isn&#039;t a Muslim? Islam is structured in a way that there is not a single goddamn person short of Mo&#039;ham popping down from heaven or up from hell or crawling out of purgatory who can say that &quot;You are not muslim&quot; as long as you say you are. Nobody. Not braindead politicians, not dipshit libtards, not the Pope, not the fucking dalai lama.","time":1490439199,"resto":118212842,"id":"09nGQYHt","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118213474,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:54:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118212842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118212842<\/a><br>Dalai Lama is based, but imagine what could happen if he said bad word about islam.<br>Remember he has quite a number of devoted followers.

In my darkest hours, I can feel the flames already licking my heels. I pray the Lord, forgive my sins! I and pray for the ability for sincerity, so that I may know that the Lord knows my words aren&#039;t lies. But is it enough? I have abandoned the Church, so the Church has abandoned me to find the Lord in the wilds. No man can survive alone. Only to return to the Church and pray in the company of other sinners, and to confess our sins and beg to be forgiven, only then will the burns be healed. Ignore the problems of the present Church, they are problems of this world. In the infinity, the Church is and always was Holy. <br><br>Our sins are mirrored in our Nations. They are corrupt because we are corrupt. If we Repent and throw ourselves to the Mercy of the Lord, than all our political woes will disappear. Because it is not the City of Earth that we should strive to pledge our loyalty; we should only and always pledge our Loyalty to the City of God.","filename":"654654654489","ext":".jpg","w":364,"h":329,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":225,"tim":1490855341973,"time":1490855341,"md5":"o3IwrLUcPxnpjB568WKzoQ==","fsize":131067,"resto":0,"id":"KEC6K1xU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"repentance-is-what-is-best-for-the-nations-and-is","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

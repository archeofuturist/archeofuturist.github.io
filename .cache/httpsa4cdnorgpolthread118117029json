Heavy, painful periods that keep women down for three days or more are lightened and shortened by traditional birth control (pill). I&#039;ve seen it happen myself. My sister used to get periods so bad she would vomit for three days during the cramping, nearly non-stop. Couldn&#039;t keep any food or drink down, not even water. Sometimes she would be spewing from both ends. Normal pain relievers never helped, either, they just made her sicker quicker. She would need actual pain killers to help maintain the pain. There was nothing wrong with her either-ovaries had no cysts, tumors or whatever down there. She just had abnormally heavy periods.<br><br>When she started on birth control it was like night and day with her. So having seen that, I cannot say &quot;ban all birth control&quot;; there&#039;s too many women out there that deal with that kind of pain. And if you think it doesn&#039;t matter, think again-imagine you have kids with a woman like this. When it strikes what are you gonna do? Tell her to suck it up? It&#039;s not that easy. Bleeding constantly like that already tires a woman out; imagine all you can do is lie on the bathroom floor and vomit and hope you don&#039;t shit yourself in the process.","filename":"14101944_1164935820235999_1281065668_n (1)","ext":".jpg","w":630,"h":322,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":63,"tim":1490388714969,"time":1490388714,"md5":"OVDqTwnjGwrkeo\/de1MTvQ==","fsize":31218,"resto":118117029,"id":"XcMOwiYl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118129373,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)16:52:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118129251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118129251<\/a><br>*only banned for use in blocking actual pregnancy.","time":1490388762,"resto":118117029,"id":"XcMOwiYl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118129405,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)16:52:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"Judging by historical statistics, Americans and Western Europeans have always had relatively late age of marriage and not had kids until their late 20s to their 30s.

Less fuel; she can shop the sales; she can network with other moms; she can cook from scratch<br>5) Home school. No fundraisers, no &quot;buy 500 sets of crayons for everyone&quot;, not fees. Get a curricula from the local home school co-op for $200 and BAM! Your kids are better educated than private school kids<br>6) No public school? No peer pressure! No bullying! No Commie teachers telling your sons to take ritalin and your daughters to get a career.<br>7) Network with other homeschoolers. Protip - according to Yale, Harvard, and Oxford homeschooled kids are *better* socialized. Why? They don&#039;t spend 1,200 hours a year in a classroom where they are forbidden to talk, they spend more time with peers, adults, children, etc.as well as merchants, neighbors, on and on.<br>8) Tell them early that getting into, going to, paying for, and graduating college is *their* responsibility.

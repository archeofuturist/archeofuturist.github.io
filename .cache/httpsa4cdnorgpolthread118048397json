Nunes insists someone on the Donald Trump transition team was legally picked up on a wiretap that was targeted at someone else. And it appears the person incidentally surveilled was Vice President Mike Pence.<br><br>Based on Nunes\u2019 description, someone on the Trump transition team was picked up while speaking on the phone with someone who was the subject of a FISA warrant. Widespread media reports have long pegged four people in the Trump campaign\u2019s orbit as being under FBI investigation: Michael Flynn, Carter Page, Roger Stone, and Paul Manafort. These are the four who could realistically have been the subject of a judge-issued FISA surveillance warrant.<br><br>Of the four men, the only one who is known to have had phone conversations with anyone on the Trump transition team during the transition was Manafort. And the one person Manafort kept calling? Mike Pence (source: Daily Kos. The two have long been aligned; Manafort went to great lengths to ensure Pence was Trump\u2019s running mate. So it appears that Devin Nunes learned this week that Pence had been caught saying something disconcerting on Manafort\u2019s wiretap. And that may explain why Nunes did what he did from there.<br><br>It\u2019s not a secret that most Republicans in Congress, including Speaker Paul Ryan, view themselves as being more closely aligned with establishment Republican Mike Pence than with erratic outsider Donald Trump. So if Nunes came across evidence of Pence on a wiretap, it might explain why his first move was to panic and run to Ryan for advice. It would also explain why Nunes was of the belief that Trump himself might not have been aware of it, and felt compelled to take it to him.","time":1490334452,"resto":118048397,"id":"rCZartJw","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":118048477,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:47:40","name":"Anonymous","filename":"movement","ext":".png","w":332,"h":429,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490334460399,"time":1490334460,"md5":"R91f8L2tw2zo+e3Fg984gg==","fsize":213730,"resto":118048397,"id":"6wwafKhM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118048491,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:47:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"awoo","filename":"1469602597124","ext":".jpg","w":645,"h":645,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490334467895,"time":1490334467,"md5":"RX3PNPQ6mTHLLTrbg\/jJZQ==","fsize":223645,"resto":118048397,"id":"2MrveJkr","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118048494,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:47:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118048397\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118048397<\/a><br>The shills need to die already.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":402,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1490334470709,"time":1490334470,"md5":"EsywtRojUD+7a1tuib6pSw==","fsize":54675,"resto":118048397,"id":"Vcqd3zDR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118048496,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:47:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Obama&#039;s DOJ applies 3 times for warrants to spy on Trump and his campaign<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rejected by FISA court for too broad of scope and lack of evidence<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;apply for a warrant to spy on the server in Trump Tower using the argument &quot;the server is connected to the internet, Russia is connected to the internet, therefore the server is connected to Russia&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;FISA buys it, issues warrant<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;DOJ &quot;&quot;&quot;incidentally&quot;&quot;&quot; collects every communication from Trump and his campaign during the investigation<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;in blatant defiance of the law, they don&#039;t scrub the identifying information on the communications on American citizens, instead clearly attributing them to Trump and his team members by name<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the &quot;&quot;&quot;incidental&quot;&quot;&quot; communications and attached identifying information are then disseminated through multiple levels of government<\/span><br><br>That about right?","filename":"1487311177071","ext":".jpg","w":510,"h":388,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1490334472529,"time":1490334472,"md5":"Xk87JidCZ00jB+DOmGGr\/A==","fsize":72750,"resto":118048397,"id":"S0BtQ\/In","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118048509,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:48:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Reddit is back up.

Just one day after it was finally confirmed that Paul Manafort had indeed taken millions of dollars in payments from a Kremlin intermediary, as had long been suspected, additional information is coming to light about how that money was funneled from Russia to Manafort. And it turns out to have been facilitated by one of Donald Trump\u2019s Russian pals as well as one of Trump\u2019s cabinet members.<br><br>The Associated Press is now reporting that the money flowed from Russia to Paul Manafort by way of the Bank of Cyprus. If the name of this bank sounds familiar, it\u2019s because four weeks ago Palmer Report pieced together that Wilbur Ross and Dmitry Rybolovlev both have (or had) ownership stakes in that bank. Ross was also the vice chair of the bank.<br><br>Ross is now Donald Trump\u2019s Secretary of Commerce. Rybolovlev has had suspicious real estate transactions with Trump, and he keeps flying in on a private plane to meet up with him in various cities. And now it turns out that, going back as long as twelve years, Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign chairman Paul Manafort was funneling his secret payments from the Kremlin through this same bank. But there\u2019s much more to it.<br><br>As we reported six weeks ago, investigators for the state of New York busted Germany\u2019s Deutsche Bank for laundering money from Russia through Bank of Cyprus into the hands of clients in New York City. In fact U.S. Attorney Preet Bhahara was pursuing a parallel federal investigation into Deutsche Bank for that same Russian money laundering scheme, when Donald Trump fired him earlier this month.","time":1490334610,"resto":118048397,"id":"rCZartJw","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":118048750,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:50:27","name":"Anonymous","filename":"2017-03-20 15.19.34","ext":".png","w":605,"h":666,"tn_w":113,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490334627242,"time":1490334627,"md5":"nmlWDzj6p0dSa4fVHUaUWw==","fsize":44492,"resto":118048397,"id":"+FhlvOkm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118048756,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:50:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118045364#p118048452\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118048452<\/a><br>She&#039;s a literal goddess\/force of nature\/higher dimensional being. <br><br>She is known to those who seek.","filename":"1486678670993","ext":".png","w":900,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490334631142,"time":1490334631,"md5":"R6sORCUXWOeuhSU+JxW8vw==","fsize":1078939,"resto":118048397,"id":"c\/JU1ty8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118048759,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:50:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118048684\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118048684<\/a><br>Sharia\/10","time":1490334631,"resto":118048397,"id":"Rvr3gW1R","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118048769,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:50:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118048698\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118048698<\/a><br>Which one(s) were you?","time":1490334635,"resto":118048397,"id":"sh62yJnW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118048773,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:50:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118048599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118048599<\/a><br>Wrong, ya dumbie, I&#039;ve got a 10x10.","filename":"1489120133850","ext":".jpg","w":10,"h":10,"tn_w":10,"tn_h":10,"tim":1490334636832,"time":1490334636,"md5":"2Mh6lVsU\/7EbzNUwHEZfmg==","fsize":799,"resto":118048397,"id":"EWvyOAVD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118048780,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:50:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118048526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118048526<\/a><br>Aussie internet can&#039;t handle the Eternal Joe.","time":1490334641,"resto":118048397,"id":"Vcqd3zDR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118048782,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:50:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118048694\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118048694<\/a><br>This<br>Ryan needs to go.","time":1490334642,"resto":118048397,"id":"FQG5LrIT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118048785,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:50:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118048550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118048550<\/a><br>This is a test, you stupid shill.

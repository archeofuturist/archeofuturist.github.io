Let&#039;s take a film that that isn&#039;t even particularly subtle, remove all subtly, and explain all of the themes in play. Also, let&#039;s add an evil corporation as the big bad, that way we&#039;ll still be able to present our hero as &#039;anti-establishment&#039; for western audiences.&quot;<\/span><br><br>The acting was lousy. The charm was gone. You can tell they brought in Scarlett Johanssen to bring the normies into the theaters and dumbed down the narrative (which isn&#039;t even complex to begin with). <br><br>Nothing made sense, every fight scene was reproduced poorly while they avoided every iconic symbolic image from the original. <br><br>The guy who was hacked into thinking he had a wife and kid was so poorly done. In the anime, it was a very heavy scene when they reveal it to the guy. In this film, our &quot;heroes&quot; heartlessly reveal the truth to the guy, and then he is somehow able to kill himself in an interrogation room. I was thinking what the fuck? Why would they effectively hook this guy up to a noose? Why just have him die, a great deal of emotional impact from the first film was thinking this guy has to sort his shitty life out from this idealistic one he was tricked into believing in. Instead of caring about some random man caught up in the event, we&#039;re instead not concerned with this guy (who they treat like a bad guy) committing suicide as we parade on through the senseless plot and nonsensical action scenes. Yes! I saw her twist a man&#039;s arm, forcing him to shoot an ally before being slain himself by our ultra strong Major. This &quot;trick&quot; doesn&#039;t have to be performed in every fucking action scene, but it is.<br><br>The film does this with almost every scene. Removes meaning. No feels. Just awkward. I almost wish they didn&#039;t whitewash either, I&#039;m sure a Jap would have done better. It&#039;s like they told Johanssen &quot;You&#039;re a robot, so feel free to never emote ever.&quot; Her performance was painfully robotic.<br><br>If they ever try to do a live Eva, animefags will shoot up theaters across the nation.","filename":"Eva Angel Pepe","ext":".png","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491259543675,"time":1491259543,"md5":"qQieTxCgA9CGQM6OgdDeDA==","fsize":48694,"resto":119371709,"id":"3j1wkOqX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119392584,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)18:45:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119391449\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119391449<\/a><br>VERY RARE","time":1491259547,"resto":119371709,"id":"OsTKj\/OK","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":119392721,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)18:47:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119392559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119392559<\/a><br>No but really who are you quoting?

The least intelligent ten percent of whites have IQs below 81; FORTY PERCENT of blacks have IQs that low. Only one black in six is more intelligent than the average white; five whites out of six are more intelligent than the average black. You can argue about what IQ measures or how significant it is, but the fact is it measures something. And that something correlates with how people, regardless of race, behave, function and co-exist in society. For instance it means lower impulse control and lowered ability to delay gratification for an increased reward later. All of this and multiple other factors means an increased propensity for crime.

Just over 100 families with adopted children of white, black, and mixed racial ancestry are being studied in an ongoing analysis of the effects of being raised by white adopting parents of middle or higher social status.123 This famous transracial adoption study by psychologists Sandra Scarr and Richard Weinberg is the most comprehensive attempt yet to separate the effects of genes and of family environment on the cognitive development of American blacks and whites. The first reports (when the children were about 7 years old) indicated that the black and interracial children had IQs of about 106, well above the national black average or the black average in Minnesota, where the samples were drawn. This result pointed to a considerable impact of the home setting on intelligence. However, a racial and adoptive ordering on IQ existed even in the first follow-up: The mean IQs were 117 for the biological children of white parents, 112 for the white adoptive children, 109 for the adopted children with one black and one white or Asian parent, and 97 for the adopted children with two black parents.124 Altogether, the data were important and interesting but not decisive regarding the source of the B\/W difference. They could most easily have been squared with a theory that the B\/W difference has both genetic and environmental elements in it, but, with considerable straining, could perhaps have been stretched to argue for no genetic influence at all.","time":1493003475,"resto":122508765,"id":"bJ\/Umbp+","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122534022,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)23:11:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122533283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122533283<\/a><br>(contd from <a href=\"#p122533957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122533957<\/a> )<br>A follow-up a decade later, with the children in adolescence, does not favor the no-genetics case.125 The new ordering of IQ means was 109 for the biological children of white parents, 106 for the white adoptive children, 99 for the adopted children with one black parent, and 89 for the adopted children with two black parents.126 The mean of 89 for adopted children with two black parents was slightly above the national black mean but not above the black mean for the North Central United States. The bottom line is that the gap between the adopted children with two black parents and the adopted children with two white parents was seventeen points, in line with the B\/W difference customarily observed. Whatever the environmental impact may have been, it cannot have been large.<br>Scarr and Weinberg continue to argue that the results are consistent with some form of mixed gene and environmental source of the B\/W difference, which seems to us the most plausible conclusion.127 But whatever the final consensus about the data may be, the debate over the Minnesota transracial adoption study has shifted from an argument about whether the environment explains all or just some of the B\/W difference to an argument about whether it explains more than a trivial part of the difference.<br>Several smaller studies bearing on racial ancestry and IQ were well summarized almost two decades ago by Loehlin, Lindzey, and Spuhler.129 They found the balance of evidence tipped toward some sort of mixed gene-environment explanation of the B\/W difference without saying how much of the difference is genetic and how much environmental.130 This also echoes the results of Snyderman and Rothman\u2019s survey of contemporary specialists.","time":1493003503,"resto":122508765,"id":"bJ\/Umbp+","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122534306,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)23:14:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122534022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122534022<\/a><br>Apologies for the annoying citations as inline numbers.<br><br>If you want to read the book for free you have it here:<br>http:\/\/gen.lib.rus.ec\/search.php?re<wbr>q=bell+curve<br>Excerpt is from Chapter 13","time":1493003656,"resto":122508765,"id":"bJ\/Umbp+","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122534487,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)23:15:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122533665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122533665<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;being unironically this upset about people telling the truth about race and religion<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. bluepilled christcuck<\/span>","time":1493003741,"resto":122508765,"id":"E4MGURgt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122534889,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)23:19:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122534306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122534306<\/a><br>Consider though the asian test results.

His conclusion based on over 40 cases and 30,000 people within the United States is that, other things being equal, more diversity in a community is associated with less trust both between and within ethnic groups. Although limited to American data, it puts into question both the contact hypothesis and conflict theory in inter-ethnic relations. According to conflict theory, distrust between the ethnic groups will rise with diversity, but not within a group. In contrast, contact theory proposes that distrust will decline as members of different ethnic groups get to know and interact with each other. Putnam describes people of all races, sex, socioeconomic statuses, and ages as &quot;hunkering down,&quot; avoiding engagement with their local community\u2014both among different ethnic groups and within their own ethnic group. Even when controlling for income inequality and crime rates, two factors which conflict theory states should be the prime causal factors in declining inter-ethnic group trust, more diversity is still associated with less communal trust.<\/span>","time":1493008468,"resto":122508765,"id":"I\/K0t1eE","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122542904,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:34:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122542185\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122542185<\/a><br>Well, start with Robert Putnam&#039;s E Pluribus Unum. <br><br>http:\/\/www.aimlessgromar.com\/wp-con<wbr>tent\/uploads\/2013\/12\/j-1467-9477-20<wbr>07-00176-x.pdf<br><br>It&#039;s worth reading Bowling Alone by him before this but you can easily do without.

The first, usually labelled the \u2018contact hypothesis\u2019, argues that diversity fosters interethnic tolerance and social solidarity. As we have more contact with people who are unlike us, we overcome our initial hesitation and ignorance and come to trust them more...Evidence of this sort suggested to social psychologists, beginning with Gordon Allport in the 1950s, the optimistic hypothesis that if we have more contact with people of other ethnic and racial backgrounds (or at least more contact in the right circumstances), we will all begin to trust one another more. More formally, according to this theory, diversity reduces ethnocentric attitudes and fosters out-group trust and solidarity. If black and white children attend the same schools, for example, race relations will improve. This logic was an important part of the legal case that led the United States Supreme Court to require racial desegregation in the famous Brown v. Board of Education case in 1954. For progressives, the contact theory is alluring, but I think it is fair to say that most (though not all) empirical studies have tended instead to support the so-called \u2018conflict theory\u2019, which suggests that, for various reasons \u2013 but above all, contention over limited resources \u2013 diversity fosters out-group distrust and in-group solidarity. On this theory, the more we are brought into physical proximity with people of another race or ethnic background, the more we stick to \u2018our own\u2019 and the less we trust the \u2018other\u2019 (Blumer 1958; Blalock 1967; Giles &amp; Evans 1986; Quillian 1995, 1996; Brewer &amp; Brown 1998; Taylor 1998; Bobo 1999; Bobo &amp; Tuan 2006)...<\/span>","time":1493008661,"resto":122508765,"id":"NZp9nkvO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122543418,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:39:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122542185\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122542185<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122542904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122542904<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122543258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122543258<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The evidence that diversity and solidarity are negatively correlated (controlling for many potentially confounding variables) comes from many different settings:<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u2022 Across workgroups in the United States, as well as in Europe, internal heterogeneity (in terms of age, professional background, ethnicity, tenure and other factors) is generally associated with lower group cohesion, lower satisfaction and higher turnover (Jackson et al. 1991; Cohen &amp; Bailey 1997; Keller 2001; Webber &amp; Donahue 2001).<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u2022 Across countries, greater ethnic heterogeneity seems to be associated with lower social trust (Newton &amp; Delhey 2005; Anderson &amp; Paskeviciute 2006; but see also Hooghe et al. 2006).<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u2022 Across local areas in the United States, Australia, Sweden, Canada and Britain, greater ethnic diversity is associated with lower social trust and, at least in some cases, lower investment in public goods (Poterba 1997; Alesina et al. 1999; Alesina &amp; La Ferrara 2000, 2002; Costa &amp; Kahn 2003b; Vigdor 2004; Glaeser &amp; Alesina 2004; Leigh 2006; Jordahl &amp; Gustavsson 2006; Soroka et al. 2007; Pennant 2005; but see also Letki forthcoming).<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u2022 Among Peruvian micro-credit cooperatives, ethnic heterogeneity is associated with higher default rates; across Kenyan school districts ethnolinguistic diversity is associated with less voluntary fundraising; and in Himalayan Pakistan, clan, religious, and political diversity are linked with failure of collective infrastructure maintenance (Karlan 2002; Miguel &amp; Gugerty 2005; Khwaja 2006).<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u2022 Across American census tracts, greater ethnic heterogeneity is associated with lower rates of car-pooling, a social practice that embodies trust and reciprocity (Charles &amp; Kline 2002).<\/span>","time":1493008757,"resto":122508765,"id":"NZp9nkvO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122543440,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:39:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122543418\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122543418<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u2022 Within experimental game settings such as prisoners-dilemma or ultimatum games, players who are more different from one another (regardless of whether or not they actually know one another) are more likely to defect (or \u2018cheat\u2019).

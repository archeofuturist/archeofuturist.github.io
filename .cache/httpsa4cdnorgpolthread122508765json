The least intelligent ten percent of whites have IQs below 81; FORTY PERCENT of blacks have IQs that low. Only one black in six is more intelligent than the average white; five whites out of six are more intelligent than the average black. You can argue about what IQ measures or how significant it is, but the fact is it measures something. And that something correlates with how people, regardless of race, behave, function and co-exist in society. For instance it means lower impulse control and lowered ability to delay gratification for an increased reward later. All of this and multiple other factors means an increased propensity for crime.

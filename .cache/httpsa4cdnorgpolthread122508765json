He goes on to say the controversy over this is simply a &quot;moral panic&quot; on the left that this issue is even being discussed at all. <br><br>Of course this is all true and most people here already know that, but it&#039;s shocking to hear a public figure say it in 2017. I&#039;m not really a big Harris fan, but I certainly respect him more now.","filename":"1492983018786","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492990693188,"time":1492990693,"md5":"3fH1Di67wa34duuGGcTvsA==","fsize":14880,"resto":0,"id":"I\/K0t1eE","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sam-harris-takes-the-red-pill","country_name":"Canada","replies":26,"images":4,"unique_ips":19},{"no":122509626,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:44:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122508765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122508765<\/a><br><br>gad saad has a bunch of evolutionary psychologists on his show., and there&#039;s usually a moment with each one where they talk about if its in the best interest of science to look at at the difference in iq between populations. i&#039;d say 90% don&#039;t think we should look into it all because there is nothing to gain by it.<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Satos<wbr>hi_Kanazawa is the only redpilled of them, and his career was pretty much destroyed because of it.","time":1492991095,"resto":122508765,"id":"s9+9xSru","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122511002,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:54:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122509626\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122509626<\/a><br><br>Yeah it&#039;s the fallback argument.

So now instead they say &quot;We don&#039;t gain anything by pointing this out and we should just pretend it isn&#039;t there even if it is&quot;.<br><br>The problem is how it affects behavior. The least intelligent ten percent of whites have IQs below 81; FORTY PERCENT of blacks have IQs that low. Only one black in six is more intelligent than the average white; five whites out of six are more intelligent than the average black. You can argue about what IQ measures or how significant it is, but the fact is it measures something. And that something correlates with how people, regardless of race, behave, function and co-exist in society. For instance it means lower impulse control and lowered ability to delay gratification for an increased reward later. All of this and multiple other factors means an increased propensity for crime.

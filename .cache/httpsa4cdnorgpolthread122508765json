He goes on to say the controversy over this is simply a &quot;moral panic&quot; on the left that this issue is even being discussed at all. <br><br>Of course this is all true and most people here already know that, but it&#039;s shocking to hear a public figure say it in 2017. I&#039;m not really a big Harris fan, but I certainly respect him more now.","filename":"1492983018786","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492990693188,"time":1492990693,"md5":"3fH1Di67wa34duuGGcTvsA==","fsize":14880,"resto":0,"id":"I\/K0t1eE","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sam-harris-takes-the-red-pill","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122509626,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:44:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122508765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122508765<\/a><br><br>gad saad has a bunch of evolutionary psychologists on his show., and there&#039;s usually a moment with each one where they talk about if its in the best interest of science to look at at the difference in iq between populations. i&#039;d say 90% don&#039;t think we should look into it all because there is nothing to gain by it.<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Satos<wbr>hi_Kanazawa is the only redpilled of them, and his career was pretty much destroyed because of it.","time":1492991095,"resto":122508765,"id":"s9+9xSru","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

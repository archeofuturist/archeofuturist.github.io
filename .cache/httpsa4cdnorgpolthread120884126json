It seems like most people who are drawn to deism are of the lefty, bleeding heart variety, but I&#039;m a race realist and rational anti-semite. I want to have six white kids and raise them with the beneficial aspects of Christian culture\/myth, but also European culture\/myth as well, which wasn&#039;t so prominent in my own upbringing.

A bunch of real nazis whisper poison in your ears while becoming your only community - your only &quot;friends&quot; And they used multiples levels to make irony and bigotry more acceptable by drowning it in &quot;oh were just joking&quot; So you combine all this w\/ capitalising on isolated nerd dude resentment &amp; even deeper isolation bam nazi you can talk to any former &quot;chan&quot; boy &amp; they can tell you how it went from &quot;shitty shock humour&quot; to &quot;whites supremacist recruitment&quot; The only &quot;lol only norms care about hurting others attitude&quot; + the general nerdy male resentment of these communities Its prime fertile ground for actual nazis to grow. People talk about pol, but you need to see the various communities converge R9k&#039;s &quot;why won&#039;t woman fuck me&quot; bs &quot;anything goes &amp; anyone who gets mad is just a normie&quot; vs endless outbursts of anger at everything Pol here becomes less of an isolated phenomenon and more of a natural end point for all these circles crashing into one another &amp; pol, also being its own thing menas it it rolled back into those communities amplifying your worst aspect then roll it back into pol So essentially you have an online pressure cooker to turn you typical teenage nerdy bullshit into honest to god facism The surrounding of hateful ideas the detachment from the harm you do ? Turning them into &quot;just jokes&quot; becoming you only friends &amp; that just your community you can see it in many others but again your not a fucking mystery","time":1492071571,"resto":120884126,"id":"IYmdxnWC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120887132,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)04:25:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"You can join my cult if you sacrifice me your first born","time":1492071957,"resto":120884126,"id":"BspoKW66","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]}

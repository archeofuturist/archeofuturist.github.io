The audience which is filled with Democrats, laugh wholeheartedly at this statement.<br>2 media outlets in Maine have already refused to report on the video, if the source is not disclosed. Other outlets and independent media are now picking up the story and it is becoming viral. Time to genocide the Marxist.<br>When the Daily Caller inquired (((Fochtmann))) over his statements he chuckled and stated &quot;a joke&#039;s a joke isn&#039;t it?&quot;.<br>He went on to explain that; &quot;I&#039;m a white male. I&#039;m an old man, and i&#039;m appalled by what&#039;s happening to a lot of people my age, and their either lack of morality or whatever it is,&quot; he paused and continued. &quot;There&#039;s no big protest going on about the (implied Trump) administration.&quot;<br>&quot;It&#039;s anathema to me. I hear a lot of people out there espousing things about being good Christians, being patriots and what not. We just read different history books. Different Bible, everything.&quot;<br>&quot;I don&#039;t really know what to say,&quot; (((Fochtmann))) paused and then conceded. &quot;I thought the point of the joke is that it won&#039;t be long, and this won&#039;t be a majority white nation, and i think that&#039;s a good thing.&quot;<br>&quot;I think it&#039;s about time Americans come to terms with we are a melting pot,&quot; he clarified. &quot;We&#039;ve been calling ourselves a melting pot forever and ever and ever.&quot;<br>&quot;So there you are, you know, one of these days we&#039;ll be in a big melting pot stew and it won&#039;t predominantly be white people, and that&#039;s OK with me.&quot;","filename":"f0d9e10f3107a07aec93392caf1beb8ff89207efd6afa6e0bf6857e8b676d5f1","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":448,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492374222043,"time":1492374222,"md5":"3uAaOsPn1hNeIQ69PuyQLQ==","fsize":59757,"resto":0,"id":"rWJSU\/UH","country":"SI","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"maine-democrats-celebrate-white-suicide-rate","country_name":"Slovenia","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121408246,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:24:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121408155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121408155<\/a><br>The Maine Democratic Party ignored multiple requests for comment on the statements on the video.

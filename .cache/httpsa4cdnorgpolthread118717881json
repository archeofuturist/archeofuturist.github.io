When Holden exited the restroom himself, he learned that the man was a PAPD officer dressed in plainclothes who Holden believes targeted him because of his \u201cclothing, hairstyle, and jewelry,\u201d and later accused him in an affidavit of \u201cmasturbating,\u201d the complaint alleges.<br><br>In his holding cell later that day, Holden allegedly overheard the \u201cgay whisperer\u201d comment, which he understood as a reference to that particular officer\u2019s presumed \u201cpattern and practice of arresting men that he perceived as gay or gender non-conforming.\u201d The public lewdness and exposure charges against Holden were later dismissed and the court record sealed, according to the complaint.<br><br>Miguel Mejia\u2019s story followed a similar pattern.

You see, a civil union between a man and a woman is a marriage. But you guys like to expand the use of the word to describe people who are in a civil &quot;union&quot; like two faggots that eat each others asshole, or two muff divers that fuck about once per month with a fake dick. <br><br>Doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s a marriage (or a &quot;wiretap&quot;, technically), but we let you get away with it because what&#039;s the point in arguing linguistics with people who play fast and loose with definitions anyhow? <br><br>Seriously, get yourself a copy of Merriam-Webster from 1980. You&#039;d be amazed at how you cunts have fucked up our language.","time":1490210008,"resto":117790653,"id":"eJvRoU6W","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117808734,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)15:14:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117790653\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117790653<\/a><br>YOU CANNOT STUMP THE TRUMP MOTHERFUCKERS","filename":"1474326143984","ext":".gif","w":480,"h":271,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490210086679,"time":1490210086,"md5":"zGz98KtbauBjIze9Rh6cZg==","fsize":2139552,"resto":117790653,"id":"VgFDgveI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117809414,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)15:19:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117800748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117800748<\/a><br>Probably happened","time":1490210357,"resto":117790653,"id":"WG3Ecpq6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117809510,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)15:19:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117805715\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117805715<\/a><br>haha","time":1490210390,"resto":117790653,"id":"QGhycjxd","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117809704,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)15:21:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117797283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117797283<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Incidental means that they were spying legally on people outside the country, and US citizens were found talking to them.

It&#039;s hot and humid, people take religion as a major organizing force in the community, speak slowly and seem to genuinely care to get to know one another and demonstrate hospitality. The county I lived in was roughly 50\/50 black and white, and the white people seemed to wish that poorer black people would take better care of themselves, but ultimately did not squabble. Everybody&#039;s got family that has close friends\/marriages\/relationships with the opposite race, and though racial tensions in this area are certainly not non-existent, the overall level of crass racism was far less than in my native Boston. <br><br>Granted the south is a big place, this was a very rural county.

Also, people down south are way friendlier in everyday interactions. As far as race goes, I think southern demographics force us to get along with blacks better than the rest of the country. In an odd way we&#039;re both more racist and more tolerant because of our everyday interactions with black people. It&#039;s weird but it&#039;s true.

The thing with that is you studying it of course will give you a new view point from which you&#039;ll be able to look at this or that topic pertaining to Christianity\/Gnosticism but I suggest you study Christianity to the point where you have general clarity, since in as I understand in Gnosticism (and I didn&#039;t thoroughly study it yet) they demonize the father aspect of the Trinity ie the old testament God. The problem in that lies in the fact that it seems that many people back then and today try to rationalize what they do not fully understand, meaning the Gnostics as I heard probably thought the God figure of the old testament was an evil murderous being, yet the concept of holiness and strictly neutral reward and punishment in the bible goes way over their heads. It&#039;s kinda ironic how some as I&#039;ve heard participated in what the bible would call as highly immoral sexually degenerative behavior, mixing period blood with semen and possibly cannibalizing newborns. <br><br>Hence it can be said that views that the Gnostics had were in clear opposition of what your typical purehearted Christian should have. Now anyways I&#039;m not saying the knowledge they possed is inherently bad, yet I think they skewed off into what can be best described as &quot;left handed&quot; practices. And I don&#039;t know a lot about them so I might be wrong on this or that, probably not though. <br><br>So I suggest researching religion, take a lot of notes, be organized, and eventually you&#039;ll come across the Saturn conspiracy, take into deep consideration that the God Saturn was merely symbolized by the planet as I understand, yet I don&#039;t mean to demean the significant importance of the planet. Anyways I recommend listening to Santos Bonacci, google sun of saturn as well and don&#039;t fall for the materialistic meme.","filename":"Grand-Man-of-the-Zohar-J.A.Knapp","ext":".jpg","w":631,"h":928,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492557408577,"time":1492557408,"md5":"cPDYC0V3iuQ2YhJrmHhyiA==","fsize":180708,"resto":121742681,"id":"xI9zPiJO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121759058,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)19:17:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121757769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121757769<\/a><br>It&#039;s ok anon I am here with you.

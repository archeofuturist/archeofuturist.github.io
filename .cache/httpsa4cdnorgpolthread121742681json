Anyways you&#039;re probably interested in the overall syncretism that underlies practically all religions, if you will study that like I&#039;ve mentioned just now but don&#039;t forget not to hold onto to a certain viewpoint without fully understanding a conflicting one, and yes this is directly about having a materialistic view about the things to which syncretism and esoteric knowledge pertain to. Anyways I hope my words won&#039;t send you off on an incorrect track, as words do hold the capacity to deceive and kill. This was just some info, I have only the best intentions. <br><br>Lastly our word for soul in English in approximately pronounced the same as the word for sun in Latin. The concept of physical death and the proceeding rebirth\/transition and eternal life is a very ancient and old concept, pertaining to the Sun directly as I understand or has symbolic value associated with it, perhaps both, different viewpoints yield different answers. Anyways yeah, just wanted to help out.","filename":"3eb5d99e658cd08213ed29de5bd1262b","ext":".jpg","w":2560,"h":1600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492556156751,"time":1492556156,"md5":"Ss3J2nHYZLVAJXqXRQjdyA==","fsize":159138,"resto":121742681,"id":"xI9zPiJO","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121755988,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)18:56:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121755115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121755115<\/a><br>Your arguments are based in extreme rigid logic, most of which was written when the world made more sense; one you never lived in.

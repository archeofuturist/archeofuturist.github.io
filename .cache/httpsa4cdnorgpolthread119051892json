Apparently this had been happening for a while. Producers figured it was cheaper to bribe meat inspectors, than to pay for more sanitary production facilities. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tainted, was meat that was going bad, and in a lot of cases they use chemicals to make it smell, or look as if it was okay, and other cases... and there are actually jokes happening all around Brazil - because they have to make jokes of everything - of using cardboard around the meat in order to beef it up, and make it look that it&#039;s okay. <\/span><br><br>http:\/\/therealnews.com\/t2\/index.php<wbr>?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31<wbr>&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=18779","filename":"ai_que_del\u00edcia","ext":".jpg","w":2400,"h":1600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490963626332,"time":1490963626,"md5":"V4xxQ9PnuP5ugD1k+vXPDA==","fsize":395557,"resto":0,"id":"uMIxETZR","country":"BR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"brazils-tainted-meat-scandal-exposes-another","country_name":"Brazil","replies":13,"images":1,"unique_ips":13},{"no":119051974,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)08:34:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119051892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119051892<\/a><br>Brazil was a mistake.","time":1490963694,"resto":119051892,"id":"LGEYiShD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119052108,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)08:36:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"i just saw a german poster on here talking about how great some brazilian meat he got from the store was","time":1490963783,"resto":119051892,"id":"iZw0SGKw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119052171,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)08:37:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119051974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119051974<\/a><br>Racemixing was a mistake.<br><br>Whenever you are tempted to racemix, remember Brazil and stop right there.","time":1490963836,"resto":119051892,"id":"un39l+z2","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119052240,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)08:38:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Who cares, Brazilian cuisine is African tier.<br><br>Seriously, look it up.<br>Rice, a bunch of beans and a piece of meat, just awful.","time":1490963891,"resto":119051892,"id":"YtXvcSSD","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":119052361,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)08:39:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;his country doesn&#039;t have it&#039;s own meat industry<\/span>","time":1490963992,"resto":119051892,"id":"5\/SJ7e+k","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119052483,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)08:41:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119052171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119052171<\/a><br>Race mixing inevitably leads to steakmixing.

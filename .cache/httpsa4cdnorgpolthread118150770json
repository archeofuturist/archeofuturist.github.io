According to Lenin, companies in the developed world exploit workers in the developing world where wages are much lower. The increased profits enable these companies to pay higher wages to their employees &quot;at home&quot; (that is, in the developed world), thus creating a working class satisfied with their standard of living and not inclined to proletarian revolution. It is thus a form of exporting poverty, creating an &quot;exclave&quot; of lower social class.

The reason for this categorization is that financial markets exist in the Chinese economic system, which are absent in classic models of market socialism and in the market socialist literature; and that state profits are retained by enterprises rather than being equitably distributed among the population in a social dividend or similar scheme (which are central features in most models of market socialism). They conclude that China is neither a form of market socialism nor a stable form of capitalism.[8]<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socia<wbr>list_market_economy#Analysis<br><br>China is state capitalist because private companies and private property as well as foreign companies setting up operations there exist heavily now.<br><br>Market socialism does not permit private business for private profit or private property retard.

There is no pay gap, and it can be proven very simply by pointing out that you cannot lump &quot;all men&quot; into one group and then lump &quot;all women&quot; into another group and then compare their earnings. It&#039;s not that simple, at all. You&#039;d have to look at independent variables like:<br><br>1. Education<br>2. Years of education<br>3. Job\/career field<br>4. Years on job\/career<br>5. Years in a specific job<br>6. Number of hours worked<br>7. Skill level<br><br>In other words, how can you compare the incomes of a man with a Masters in Chemical Engineering with a woman who has a BA in Psychology? <br><br>Number 7 seems to especially elude women; or piss them off. <br><br>The men-earn-more-than-women trope is tired and worn out. It&#039;s patently ridiculous on the face of it. Many studies have shown this, but still the Wage Gap Myth persists. <br><br>A neat trick is to put this little thought experiment to people who hold this position in this form: &lt;if&gt; women earn less than men for doing the same work, &lt;then&gt; businesses would have it in their self-interest to hire ONLY women, to make more money. Do we see this happening? No. Why? Heh. Because women don&#039;t bring as much value to work as men. Heh. <br><br>Now.

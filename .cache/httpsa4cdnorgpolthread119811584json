Members of the Syrian Arab Army mutinied, forming the core of the Free Syrian Army (FSA)<br><br>2. Al-Qaeda In Iraq cross the border and fought in some places alongside and in some places against the FSA.<br><br>3. Al-Qaeda In Iraq broke into two. Half became &quot;al-Nusra&quot; (still literally al-Qaeda in Iraq). The other half became Islamic State, ISIS.<br><br>4. Al-Nusra fights completely alongside and never opposed to the FSA.<br><br>5. Most of the FSA is now in Germany. They fled. The units however still remain in some form or another largely made up of mercenaries and people without hope.<br><br>6. Due to the weakness of the FSA now, al-Nusra is the backbone of their military organization. They fight completely as part of them.<br><br>7. The FSA fights almost entirely against the Syrian Arab Army (&quot;Assad&quot;). They have only one active front against ISIS and fought in largely ineffective battles. They would take a village, film themselves doing it so they could send it to the Saudis &amp; Americans, and then flee the village overnight.<br><br>8. This one area is where the Turks intervened in support of the FSA units. The Turks are starting to discover just how useless they are.<br><br>9. al-Nusra renamed itself AGAIN and claimed it&#039;s no longer al-Qaeda two months ago.<br><br>tl;dr -- the Syrian &quot;rebels&quot; barely exist anymore and if the Americans began to bomb al-Nusra they would collapse tomorrow. They share almost no front lines with ISIS and rarely engage them in combat outside of one small area.","time":1491522350,"resto":119811584,"country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119817332,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:46:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119817170\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119817170<\/a><br>I gotta walk the dog, so in a bit.<br><a href=\"#p119817230\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119817230<\/a><br>what is this","time":1491522366,"resto":119811584,"country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119817362,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:46:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119817263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119817263<\/a><br><br>Oiiii, can ya do Australia flag m8?

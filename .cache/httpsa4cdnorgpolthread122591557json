Im guessing Turkey is doing the same thing after the FSA have been destroyed.","filename":"C-H1ZSNUIAA2DD9","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493051970204,"time":1493051970,"md5":"P9GDdGUP2d7gecsuiwvXEA==","fsize":66022,"resto":122591557,"id":"qI+6T9W0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122605584,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)12:40:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122604731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122604731<\/a><br>Weird.<br><br><a href=\"#p122605033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122605033<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u0627\u0644\u0635\u0647\u064a\u0648\u0646\u064a \u0643\u0630\u0627\u0628 \u064a\u0646\u0634\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062a\u0646\u0629 \u064a\u0627\u0635\u062f\u064a\u0642\u064a \u060c \u0633\u0639\u062f \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u064a\u0631\u064a \u0632\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0648\u0628 \u0641\u0642\u0637 \u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u0635\u0631\u064a\u062d \u0639\u0646 \u0647\u062f\u0646\u0647 \u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u062f\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u0631\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0644\u064a<\/span><br>Translation: The Zionist liar published sedition Yassdiqi, Saad Hariri visited the south only what was in a statement about his destruction with the Israeli enemy<br><br>Care to elaborate?","time":1493052045,"resto":122591557,"id":"OTj1SVOT","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":122605591,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)12:40:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122605347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122605347<\/a><br>that moab sure caused stability and security in afghanistan,didn&#039;t it?","filename":"assadwew","ext":".png","w":466,"h":371,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":99,"tim":1493052049212,"time":1493052049,"md5":"1CyLK\/5WIITEKufH\/advSA==","fsize":126017,"resto":122591557,"id":"RYw5Z0n8","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":122605658,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)12:41:25","name":"Syrian Geneal","com":"BREAKING Reports #Trump administration to issue new #Syria sanctions via @vmsalama @AP<br><br><br>classic neocon Trump riding that kike cock really hard","time":1493052085,"resto":122591557,"id":"wUtqPlt4","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":122605721,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)12:41:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122604743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122604743<\/a><br>i might be retarded but doesn&#039;t that video show that the isis position was being targeted? or am mistaking out going fire for incoming?","time":1493052115,"resto":122591557,"id":"ADFwd9Gq","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122605724,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)12:41:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Catholic State of Bulanda &amp; Kresy releases a picture of ducks","filename":"1493052053110-109654824","ext":".jpg","w":4160,"h":2340,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493052114958,"time":1493052114,"md5":"+RBAXzOsbI7hveFHqbGR3g==","fsize":1606061,"resto":122591557,"id":"zrYLpYQS","country":"PL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Poland"},{"no":122605740,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)12:42:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122605584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122605584<\/a><br>Don&#039;t bother with him or give him (You)&#039;s, he&#039;s a turbo autist P*lestinian nutcase.","time":1493052123,"resto":122591557,"id":"XKYTcyDU","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":122605828,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)12:42:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122605173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122605173<\/a><br>ylpe\u00e4 hurri","time":1493052163,"resto":122591557,"id":"ADFwd9Gq","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122606090,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)12:44:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122605332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122605332<\/a><br>I&#039;ve watched it after seeing it mentioned in Gilad Atzmon&#039;s &quot;The Wandering Who&quot; in a chapter where he talks about how young Israelis had grown disillusioned with Israel and how they had lost enthusiasm for the cause.<br>Idk after reading that chapter that movie made sense to me.

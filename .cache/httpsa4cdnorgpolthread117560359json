Embarking on a demythologizing trajectory, the article suggests that competitive sport fosters the emotional logic that is embedded in the will to power produced by the mythical union of an ever-expanding phallus and territorially enclosing anus\u2014these work together in sport in the desire to conquer the space of the other and protectively enclose the space of the self. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Drawing parallels, the violating phallus with the desire to win and the closed anus with the desire not to lose, the article deconstructs the emotional logic of sport as a celebration of patriarchal violation and homophobic resistance to penetration. As an immensely popular cultural spectacle and practice, therefore, competitive sport plays an important role in the reproduction of phallically aggressive and anally closed cultures of desire.<\/span>","filename":"Body Fascism book cover","ext":".jpg","w":685,"h":1027,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490056858872,"time":1490056858,"md5":"NnPrXjT6uwae9MAWMUm+dw==","fsize":83743,"resto":0,"id":"ohUQhvK+","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"it-turns-out-that-sports-players-are-faggots","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":117560474,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:41:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117560359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117560359<\/a><br>playing with balls is gay","time":1490056912,"resto":117560359,"id":"V6dlstsV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117560543,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:42:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117560359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117560359<\/a><br>Some quotes:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The practice of competitive sport itself can have homoerotic dimensions: the contact of the playing field, the spectacle of the partially clad body, the steamy environment of the showers and locker room...<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I argued that men&#039;s sport allows men and boys to exclude women and girls from their all-male environments, permits them to play with each other&#039;s bodies, to surround themselves with naked men in the showers and locker cooms, to enjoy that all-male contact, without suffering the vilification that usually comes from the open acknowledgment and pursuit of masculine erotic contact, the stigma of &quot;being homosexual.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I will argue that competitive sport... is embedded in the masculine colonizing will to conquer the space of an &quot;other&quot; while simultaneously protectively enclosing the space of the self...

Given that no penis can live up to its phallic boast, no matter how swollen it gets, phallocentrism finds other ways to territorialize the body: innocuously, possibly, in body building, and more despotically in the territorial violence of warfare and competitive sport, for instance.<\/span><br><br> <span class=\"quote\">&gt;Since one&#039;s participation in competition indicates one&#039;s commitment to phallic potency and one&#039;s defeat shows one&#039;s anal vulnerability and therefore phallic impotence, there is humiliation in defeat, in being penetrated by one&#039;s competitor.<\/span>","filename":"9780802077059-us-300[1]","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":437,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490057123661,"time":1490057123,"md5":"5udseHLzEowqBQAZIUJAeA==","fsize":22299,"resto":117560359,"id":"ohUQhvK+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117561128,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:46:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117560359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117560359<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Outta My Endzone<\/span><br>Top kek.<br><br>Though I gotta say, considering the amount of gay rappers\/R&amp;B\/pop singers, I&#039;m sure a hefty % of black athletes also love taking cock.","time":1490057213,"resto":117560359,"id":"F9fjujHn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117561486,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:49:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117561128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117561128<\/a><br>This should have been obvious to people ever since Magic Johnson got GAIDS, but I guess it&#039;s easier to be oblivious.","time":1490057374,"resto":117560359,"id":"ohUQhvK+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117561979,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:53:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117560359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117560359<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gay and queer<\/span><br><br>But why does it have to be an anus?

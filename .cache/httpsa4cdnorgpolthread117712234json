This claim has been made by Irving on several occasions including the launch of the English edition of the Leuchter report.

Irving argued that he cannot be termed a Holocaust denier since he has always accepted that a very large number of Jews were shot and killed by the Einsatzgruppen. Merely to question the accuracy of their reports as to the numbers shot does not make him a Holocaust denier. Irving pointed out that on one occasion in July 1995 he put the number of deaths of Jews in the Holocaust as high as 4 million (although he claimed that most of these deaths were due to epidemics). He argued that he cannot therefore be described as a Holocaust denier. Irving cited his biography of Goering as further evidence that he is not a Holocaust denier.

Whilst the Defendants do assert that these deaths are the result of deliberate genocidal policy on the part of the Nazis, they must of course be discounted in order to reach a correct estimate of the number of deaths in the gas chambers. Initial estimates, largely based on the capacity of the crematoria, ran as high as 4 million. As has been see the camp commandant, Hoss, gave varying estimates, ranging from 3 million to 1.1 million. However, analysis of the numbers of Jews transported to Auschwitz produced a lower estimate of around 1 million. Research carried out more recently, notably by Raul Hilberg and by Dr Piper of the Auschwitz Museum, has concluded that the true figure for the number of deaths at Auschwitz is in the region of 1.1 million of which the vast majority perished in the gas chambers. This figure has, according to the evidence of van Pelt and Longerich, been endorsed by the majority of serious, professional historians concerned in this field. The only significant exception is Jean-Claude Pressac, a French chemist and amateur historian, whose study concluded that the overall number of deaths was 630-710,000, of which 470-550,000 were gassed on arrival at the camp.","time":1490161158,"resto":117712234,"id":"gJ178NkL","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":117726442,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:41:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117726247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117726247<\/a><br>You think those gas chambers are real?","time":1490161301,"resto":117712234,"id":"cvQlOzXz","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117726541,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:42:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"&quot;I made a mistake when I said there were no gas chambers at Auschwitz, In no way did I deny the killings of millions of people by the Nazis.&quot;<br><br>David Irving","time":1490161376,"resto":117712234,"id":"gJ178NkL","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":117726599,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:43:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117726442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117726442<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ou think those gas chambers are real?<\/span><br><br>No not me....David Irving<br><br>&quot;I made a mistake when I said there were no gas chambers at Auschwitz, In no way did I deny the killings of millions of people by the Nazis.&quot;<br><br>David Irving","time":1490161416,"resto":117712234,"id":"gJ178NkL","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":117726601,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:43:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117725483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117725483<\/a><br>The thing with the gassing is that most of them didn&#039;t die by gassing.

He said there was no provision for gas-tight doors, and the chambers were not properly sealed to prevent leakage. People depositing Zyklon B pellets into vents would themselves fall victim to cyanide poisoning. He said there were no vents to introduce the gas into the chambers or to clear it once the gassing was completed.<br><br>Irving seized upon Leuchter&#039;s report as &quot;shattering in the significance of its discovery&quot;.

Van Pelt pointed out that Leuchter was neither a trained engineer nor forensic scientist. His evidence had been ruled inadmissible in the Zundel trial.<br><br>Leuchter&#039;s claim that there were no gas-tight doors was worthless given the evidence of SS officers who testified to their use. There was also documentary evidence of orders for gasketed doors and ventilation equipment, and Leuchter ignored testimony showing that gas masks were worn by guards administering Zyklon B.<br><br>In his judgment, Mr Justice Gray concluded: &quot;No objective fair-minded historian would have serious cause to doubt that there were gas chambers at Auschwitz.&quot;","time":1490162218,"resto":117712234,"id":"gJ178NkL","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":117727981,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:59:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117727784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117727784<\/a><br>Never heard of Rudolf Germar?","time":1490162348,"resto":117712234,"id":"cvQlOzXz","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117728052,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:59:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117727981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117727981<\/a><br>There was also documentary evidence of orders for gasketed doors and ventilation equipment","time":1490162394,"resto":117712234,"id":"gJ178NkL","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":117728246,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:02:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117728052\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117728052<\/a><br>Gotta kill lice somehow.","time":1490162534,"resto":117712234,"id":"cvQlOzXz","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117728339,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:03:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"None.","time":1490162593,"resto":117712234,"id":"U6m4p5bY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117728458,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:04:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117728052\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117728052<\/a><br><br>Well, the solution is very simple: show photographs of the gas chambers.","filename":"fun","ext":".gif","w":600,"h":664,"tn_w":112,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490162673840,"time":1490162673,"md5":"+C+w9TXLFHTWsGemoThoPw==","fsize":522760,"resto":117712234,"id":"xrsr9sQ6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117728571,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:05:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Over a trillion.","time":1490162750,"resto":117712234,"id":"5R4BPtPL","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117728584,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:06:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117712708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117712708<\/a>","filename":"1477439654292","ext":".jpg","w":577,"h":642,"tn_w":112,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490162761702,"time":1490162761,"md5":"Tj1ZTws82a7fVvj+\/G84OA==","fsize":146190,"resto":117712234,"id":"IXjCIuke","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":117728595,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:06:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117724983\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117724983<\/a><br>those jews have some big imaginations","time":1490162767,"resto":117712234,"id":"qeqFbET8","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117728656,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:06:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117727981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117727981<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Never heard of Rudolf Germar?<\/span><br>What is carbon dioxide?","time":1490162810,"resto":117712234,"id":"gJ178NkL","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":117728670,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:06:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117728595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117728595<\/a><br><br>Never underestimate their imagination.","filename":"1488651785045","ext":".png","w":725,"h":2650,"tn_w":34,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490162819481,"time":1490162819,"md5":"LPknhzCaL3hXUtjTOhIbMw==","fsize":207677,"resto":117712234,"id":"xrsr9sQ6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117728770,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:08:02","name":"sah gay","com":"this thread again","time":1490162882,"resto":117712234,"id":"8CzKBmFk","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117728795,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:08:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Not nearly enough.","filename":"1489025837780","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490162901980,"time":1490162901,"md5":"mDD3tG8\/XxoFJwLXfrBiHg==","fsize":198636,"resto":117712234,"id":"TZcH9\/4q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117728858,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:09:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117725347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117725347<\/a><br>he should have killled 6 million , but sadly I doubt even 400k died , honest to god","time":1490162949,"resto":117712234,"id":"Yq0RZDle","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117728862,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:09:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117712234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117712234<\/a><br>Died?

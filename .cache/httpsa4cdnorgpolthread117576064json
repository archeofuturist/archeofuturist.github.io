It&#039;s a somewhat plausible scenario for Dark Ages\/Early Medieval Europe, as they were there, and apparently many of them were Central\/East Asian in appearance. In fact, it is more possible for King Arthur to have had a Hun in his court or retinue of knights, than an African from below the Sahara Desert. At the very least, a Hun (or Avar, or Bulgar) could also fill in the racial diversity quota.

I can&#039;t stand the idea of coming home late after a day of meaningless work just to make some rich fuckers even richer. <br><br>I&#039;ve never felt any need of social recognition, I don&#039;t want any kind of wealth, I don&#039;t fit in any &quot;success track&quot;. All those kind of things that seems to drive others are just vain to me.<br><br>But moreover, I&#039;m sick and tired of people. I can count on one hand those who I concider worth talking with. The rest of the world is just a mass of stupid people. I&#039;ve faked it for years, I&#039;ve tried to fit in, but I feel happier when I&#039;m alone.<br><br>All I want is a quiet place to call mine and a comfy house. All I need is a garden far from chemical products and a few animals. <br><br>I&#039;ve done it in the past. Just left everything and lived in an abandonned mountain refuge for 5 months. I had to come back to civilization and pretend I was just depressed. Thing is, it was the best time of my life.<br><br>So \/pol\/, France is not for me anymore, I&#039;ve got to move on but I feel like everywhere I look there&#039;s the same old bullshit going on.<br><br>I&#039;m trying to talk my gf into it. I think it might work. I would be great to start something somewhere.<br><br>TL;DR Where can I find a warm place far from civilization, where I could live alone or create a small community without being bothered ?","filename":"lost","ext":".png","w":500,"h":644,"tn_w":194,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492991724948,"time":1492991724,"md5":"pJ7gTbXJPoUycqvanuNELA==","fsize":189829,"resto":0,"id":"0D1PW9DB","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-i-want-to-get-off-this-ride","country_name":"France","replies":9,"images":2,"unique_ips":8},{"no":122511209,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:56:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nowhere.","filename":"1489725438387","ext":".jpg","w":962,"h":694,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1492991784880,"time":1492991784,"md5":"AQecBDGPzN4h+YtsjuPSTw==","fsize":184837,"resto":122511075,"id":"mrD65oXg","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122511318,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:57:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122511075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122511075<\/a><br>make your own business and don&#039;t work for others, you stupid cunt.

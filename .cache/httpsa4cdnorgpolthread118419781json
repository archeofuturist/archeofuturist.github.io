Ian Mearns had nominated Cooper and Meacher, McDonnell and Abbott had done badly in their previous attempts.

He was asked by the Guardian why he was running. \u201cWell, Diane and John have done it before, so it was my turn,\u201d he replied. Corbyn told the Guardian that he was running only reluctantly: \u201cAll of us felt the leadership contest was not a good idea \u2013 there should have been a policy debate first. There wasn\u2019t, so we decided somebody should put their hat in the ring in order to promote that debate.

He sat in Paris, in salons listening to Kristeva, listening to Sartre, listening to de Beauvoir. And he imposed it implacably like the cretin he was. The family is immoral.

That the quarrel they keep up in public is very much of a put-up job, and that the way in which they perpetually play into each other\u2019s hands is not an everlasting coincidence. Gudge, the plutocrat, wants an anarchic industrialism; Hudge, the idealist, provides him with lyric praises of anarchy. Gudge wants women-workers because they are cheaper; Hudge calls the woman\u2019s work \u201cfreedom to live her own life.\u201d Gudge wants steady and obedient workmen, Hudge preaches teetotalism\u2014to workmen, not to Gudge\u2014Gudge wants a tame and timid population who will never take arms against tyranny; Hudge proves from Tolstoi that nobody must take arms against anything. Gudge is naturally a healthy and well-washed gentleman; Hudge earnestly preaches the perfection of Gudge\u2019s washing to people who can\u2019t practice it. Above all, Gudge rules by a coarse and cruel system of sacking and sweating and bi-sexual toil which is totally inconsistent with the free family and which is bound to destroy it; therefore Hudge, stretching out his arms to the universe with a prophetic smile, tells us that the family is something that we shall soon gloriously outgrow.<br><br>G.K.

Gen Y started with the phenomenon of commonplace technology in universities and jobs (ex: Compuserve in the 1980\u2019s up till mid 1990\u2019s) however it didn\u2019t become a household norm until the 2000\u2019s (every fag having a phone\/computer). To put in perspective, someone born in 1980 is still a borderline millennial. Being born in 1980 means you are only 13 years of age by 1993, in time for the election of Bill Clinton. Regular 13 year olds cannot vote, don\u2019t have a wide range of political knowledge and most certainly don\u2019t have global knowledge outside basic schooling simply due to the amount of years they\u2019ve been alive. In terms of \u201cchildhood\u201d, it is divided into baby, toddler (walking), early childhood, middle childhood and adolescence childhood (puberty-post puberty). Now most of you fuckers barely remember anything before age 8 so anything before toddler is eliminated. When people refer to their childhood, they usually mean school age aka early-middle childhood (kids aged 8-13) because in high school they become edgy faggots that call everything older than a year their \u201cchildhood\u201d. That\u2019s where \u201cchildhood is composed\u201d. Just because you watched a couple 90&#039;s cartoons and played with some colorful springs as a 10 year old doesn&#039;t mean you aren\u2019t a millennial. Unless you\u2019re in your late 20\u2019s - mid 30\u2019s, which let\u2019s be honest, most of you fags are college students or NEETs, you cannot start using millennial like it\u2019s a term exceptionally made for a special group of people outside of 4chan and irl. <br><br>We have the internet, the greatest invention in over 100 years and billions of improvements people back than would literally beg to have","filename":"526543545","ext":".jpg","w":937,"h":937,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493369629594,"time":1493369629,"md5":"TfrTnyh8Ka3j0kAVke+n0Q==","fsize":345671,"resto":123163361,"id":"rSt4omkr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123171761,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)04:54:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123163559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123163559<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hispanic<\/span><br><br>Too white for being hispanics","time":1493369672,"resto":123163361,"id":"3RkoVzoe","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":123171815,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)04:55:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123166587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123166587<\/a><br>Because he&#039;s one of those alpha omega tier white boys who, while fat, are averagly attractive with a douchbaggy attitude that rich white girls find funny to be with.

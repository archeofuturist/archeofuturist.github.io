One of my roommates, someone I considered a friend, got caught up with a girl and maybe threatened her at a party on Friday night. Whatever, right? Well she told campus safety he had a gun. Police came later that night to ask to search his room. Within 20 seconds he was on the ground dog piled and a struggle ensued, in which he allegedly reached for the gun.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;yes, he&#039;s a dindu<\/span><br><br>He&#039;s got a whole litany of charges for the guns, assault on police, and dealing drugs. I knew he maybe sold a dime here or there, but the gun was news to me. He&#039;s charged with 2x Agrivated Assault on police, Illegal possession of firearms on a college campus (it&#039;s penal code law, not just private property of the college), felony possession of marajuana etc etc. Total of 7 or 8 charges, 3 are felony.<br><br>Now his dindu friends are giving me shit for not wanting to go to his arraignment. They say I&#039;ve been &quot;acting weird&quot; etc. <br><br>I have to have police come and search our fucking common area for more shit; yes I&#039;m acting weird. I watched him get his shit rammed in by police at 4am in the morning. I was informed he carries a gun everywhere he goes.<br><br>What should I do to protect myself from his friends? We used to be close but now that this has happened they&#039;ve started being... aggressive. When I&#039;m not at a college I carry concealed. It&#039;s against state law to do so on campus, despite my pro-gunness.","filename":"1488747729596","ext":".jpg","w":599,"h":785,"tn_w":190,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491183738428,"time":1491183738,"md5":"gAEaPcwpsJNef04ZXSpY+Q==","fsize":71966,"resto":0,"id":"mC\/nGqBv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-know-this-aint-a-legaladvice-board-but-hear-me","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119275210,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:45:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119274919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119274919<\/a><br>Why not watch?

Though I have been trying to make backups\/alts though they get locked within minutes of creation, the 4th one made it through on a different browser. One was locked after uploading an avi with a sonnenrad in it, next one was locked after following pro european accounts, third one i didnt follow anyone got locked out after browsing pro european accounts. They keep demanding a phone number because i seem to be breaching terms of service. Ha no, they have been calling various places I find on google maps. My main has sonnenrad in avi and I have been following the pro-european crowd for some time. Explanation on whats going on? What triggers the lock on new accts and how long do these last?","filename":"nemi","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":640,"tn_w":195,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491180769026,"time":1491180769,"md5":"1sv47O\/lE7SmzRYxCo797A==","fsize":149261,"resto":0,"id":"Dnc5DHf6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wtf-twitter","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119270271,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)20:54:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119270152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119270152<\/a><br>Is that a political compass?","time":1491180849,"resto":119270152,"id":"KrRaQ4O9","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119270278,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)20:54:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119270152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119270152<\/a><br>Too many rural and suburban retards trolling city people with fake accounts, so they started banning them.","time":1491180852,"resto":119270152,"id":"iOt1CbL\/","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119270525,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)20:56:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119270271\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119270271<\/a><br>it&#039;s loss","time":1491180981,"resto":119270152,"id":"6xIcvHZo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119270654,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)20:57:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119270525\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119270525<\/a><br>I can&#039;t tell anymore tbhfam.

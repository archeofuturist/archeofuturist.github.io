That kid IS priveleged. It is a great privelege to have a hard working , decent father. They just don&#039;t understand a few things.<br>If you remember back in school when somebody who worked a lot less than you still got a better grade, that led to a certain degree to frustration.<br>Now sane people would understand that the world isn&#039;t fair and this result simply means you need to work harder to acheive something. You need to channel that frustration into action to better yourself. <br>Lefties are the same but with literally everything, but with the assumption that their level is the base level. So everybody has to be lowered to their plane of incompetence and bad luck, rather than improving themselves to better compete.<br><br>The second thing lefties don&#039;t understand is that &quot;be yourself&quot; is not good advice and &quot;who you are&quot; is constantly changing, and can be steered. <br>This retarded ideology of &quot;love yourself for who you are&quot; is just creating a bunch of literal retards with terrible personalities and shit habits that think they should just accept their current state of being instead of changing it for the better.","time":1490144299,"resto":117695626,"id":"iOXckKwb","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":117697544,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)21:03:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117695626\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117695626<\/a><br>((( egalitarianism )))","filename":"(((critical theory))","ext":".png","w":1377,"h":375,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":34,"tim":1490144627574,"time":1490144627,"md5":"dA3uZ1qXymSF4+WiHauUmg==","fsize":57065,"resto":117695626,"id":"kkOkh3qS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117698195,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)21:09:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117695626\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117695626<\/a><br>The left does not care at all about equality.

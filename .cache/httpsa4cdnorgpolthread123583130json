Girls have been pampered growing up, and given everything that they&#039;ve wanted; everything that they&#039;ve asked for. <br><br><br>This creates a huge problem for society later on. These women graduate college, move out of the house, and eventually have to get married and start a family. <br><br>Well, Who&#039;s gonna pay for all this shit now? Because I&#039;ll tell you what, their boyfriends and husbands won&#039;t be able to afford it. At least not at first.

If they want to be rich later on down the road. <br><br>So what do these girls do? They realize the true value of a dollar. Some of them get a degree and work hard. Some of them work hard and sacrifice. <br><br>But a far larger number of women these days don&#039;t do that. They become gold diggers. They go after rich guys with money instead of guys that truly care about them, and they get fucked over.

They become these man hating, selfish creatures all in the name of money. All in the name of greed. <br><br>And thus you see the state of society today.

I met a qt girl my senior year that fell for me for whatever reason, and I rejected her because I was too afraid of the heartache. She persisted and she became the closest thing to a gf I&#039;ve ever had. It lasted a month and I got my first kiss. She left me after finding another guy. She later admitted she was a cunt who liked moving from guy to guy, but it redpilled me on how shallow women can be. After high school I chased after some girls mainly out of horniness but never got far with any of them. Now here I am, a 23 year old virgin. I have never woken up next to a women. Never had one besides my mom cook and clean for me. Never had any deep female companionship in my life. What can I do when I just keep getting burned? Even my emotions have hardened up and I know I can&#039;t feel that way about another person again. Every sad song reminds me of my situation. I always daydream about the things I could have done differently. These guys they picked over me? None of them could have loved the way I could, and they didn&#039;t. I would have given my all to show my love. But that&#039;s not what women want. They want a man who can provide, and I simply could not do that. Even as an adult I can barely support myself and I live with parents. The empty feeling I&#039;ve had for so long is as familiar as my shadow. I don&#039;t know what it&#039;s like to feel any of the good things about love. I&#039;ve been high off love a couple times but it always turns into pain. I know I&#039;m probably stuck like this. Some wounds just go too deep and when there&#039;s a lifetime&#039;s worth of getting rejected, looked over, being compared to other guys, what can I even do at this point? I&#039;m too bitter now. Too jaded. I naturally distrust women. From my experience, women can&#039;t love the same way men can. And I know I can never care about someone the way I have in the past. It&#039;s just not in me anymore.","filename":"1491125759831","ext":".jpg","w":562,"h":490,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1493626202298,"time":1493626202,"md5":"YYBo95xm0WVOwAEjgob0Xg==","fsize":43025,"resto":123583130,"id":"tsmGzS8e","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123595645,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)04:12:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123584002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123584002<\/a><br>Fuck man do I know that feel.

Donald Trump is a substitute maths teacher. Donald scalds an Australian kid for sending so many letter demanding the US government releases all it knows about UFO\u2019s, Donald tells the Australian he is a juvenile time waster. Donald then tries to tell us about how to tie knots. I am quite surprised that this should turn up in maths class. Somehow I intuit that we need to know how to make straight pieces of string into closed circles.<br><br>Next scene - I am standing before an absolutely gigantic canyon separating what looks like Tuscany from Afghanistan. I am told that Donald has built the wall separating the two countries and that we are safe again. <br><br>I am walking through a carpark with a group of friends, I come to an old stone building. It looks like a 70s modernist monstrosity yet with a mysterious red, black and white doors guarding the entrance. I am told it has not been opened in millennia. Thanks to the coming of Donald it is opened. I go inside. I find myself in an ancient \u201cpacific temple of water\u201d. Ancient wooden vaults are opened and a ceremony is begun. We form a line while a blue light emerges from the vaults. The people are all full of excited expectation. We begin holding hands to form a solid circle - in order to complete the circle I hold hands with an unknown woman. I feel a transpersonal connection to everyone in the circle via the magic of the blue light, it lasts only too briefly. I am disappointed but not devastated. Suddenly the \u201cKing of the Pacific\u201d strides in. He is half naked with reddish brown skin, befitting the native of a warm tropical island, and he wears a huge feathered head-dress. He projects a presence which dominates the room regardless of his short stocky stature. His clothing and his fierce burning eyes elevate him. All eyes are fixed on him, and the circle is reconstituted by virtue of everyone directing their gaze at him. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The hero is the key to renewing your life.<\/span>","time":1493629173,"resto":123583130,"id":"+DdkKQG3","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123598948,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)05:03:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123586159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123586159<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Women are the ones consuming romantic movies and having all these romantic fantasies.<\/span><br><br>As a guy that&#039;s hopelessly idiotically romantic I&#039;ve never had any interest in romantic movies\/novels because of their absurdly unrealistic representation is almost insulting.<br>And of course they&#039;re entirely directed towards female consumers with often completely unrelatable male characters.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It actually causes me slight physical pain that no man might ever propose me\/genuinely want to marry me.<\/span><br><br>And it&#039;s quite fun knowing I&#039;ll never be find a good woman to propose to, even though all I&#039;ve wanted since I was 13 was the whole 9 yards of the nuclear family, white picket fence and everything.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I feel like that men here have the upper hand since they can just go and fuck new women and forget about the former one.<\/span><br><br>Yes of course since I&#039;m a man I just have pussy right on tap.<br>It certainly couldn&#039;t be that the vast majority of women simply don&#039;t even see me as worthy of having my existence acknowledged.<br>It seems like most women can never quite understand what it&#039;s like being a man because they&#039;ve never understood what it&#039;s like to be simply ignored entirely.

But the triggers for it are different.<br><br>A man&#039;s first attraction is physical. How she looks. From there if love develops its because the man finds traits other than the physical about her that he enjoys. Love for a man cements itself in the familiarity and comfort of her presence. <br><br>For a woman attraction starts emotionally. How he makes her FEEL. However this is only part of the puzzle. You can&#039;t be a slovenly NEET neckbeard because that type of man cannot provide worthy offspring, defend a family or provide for one.<br><br>The part that cements love for a woman is perfectly and horrifically simple: <br><br>How much Oxytocin can you cause her brain to dump on itself. Yes, the same chemical that bonds a woman to her children is what controls her ability to love.<br><br>Remember, female attraction has a huge emotional component. If you make her FEEL good, she will develop a major attraction to you. If the other factors are already in place she WILL throw it at you.<br><br>This is why men have to be such a well rounded package to be considered top tier. You have to tick all the boxes. If one is missing your SMV is lower because you are an incomplete puzzle.<br><br>There is a single foolproof, concrete way to force a woman&#039;s brain to drench itself in Oxytocin other than childbirth:<br><br>A mind shattering orgasm. You just have to earn your way there in order to give it to her.<br><br>If you fuck her brains out the first time you sleep with her, she will NEVER forget you. You will be one of her best masturbatory fantasies for the resf of her life.

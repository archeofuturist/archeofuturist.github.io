The Palestinian people believe that the conflict is about territory, not terrorism. The Palestinian people believe that they have a right to defend their property and the land of their ancestors, which territorial claim is also made by Israel.<br><br>THumP\u00ae disagrees with both sides of the conflict and maintains that the conflict is about both terrorism and territory. Each side terrorizes the other through violence, whether on the offensive or the defensive. Each side makes a claim to territory that should have nothing to do with religion, ideology, or anything else but humane and just principles.<br><br>Therefore, the Humanity Party\u00ae proposes the following long term solution:<br><br>The U.S. will continue to aid Israel if it is attacked in any way, by any means, but with its own military intervention, if Israel requires it. However, the U.S. will not give any money directly to Israel in support of its military power. Instead, the U.S. will give each Palestinian a HuMane Debit Card that will allow each person who receives a card to receive the Five Basic Necessities of Life: healthy food, clothing, housing, health and mental care, and education.&quot;<br><br>Excerpt from: http:\/\/voicehumanity.tumblr.com\/pos<wbr>t\/158856286694\/the-humanity-party-s<wbr>-solution-to-the-conflict-in","filename":"botharejerks","ext":".gif","w":611,"h":648,"tn_w":235,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490574369219,"time":1490574369,"md5":"ezXHxuH5bWXiLqFtH3H0yg==","fsize":74940,"resto":0,"id":"RtFB\/kEP","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-you-solve-the-israelpalestine-conflict","country_name":"United States","replies":126,"images":22,"unique_ips":58,"tail_size":50},{"no":118444442,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:30:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Don&#039;t slide my thread you stupid idiots.","filename":"threadsliders","ext":".jpg","w":952,"h":536,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490574652541,"time":1490574652,"md5":"11\/+CuuGaJHodnkvBcxbYg==","fsize":66739,"resto":118443830,"id":"RtFB\/kEP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118444696,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:32:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118444442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118444442<\/a><br>sheeeit almost got six in a row","filename":"republicofamerica","ext":".jpg","w":612,"h":575,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1490574775717,"time":1490574775,"md5":"Sf\/WKToscW1rGTjgF+eDTQ==","fsize":96814,"resto":118443830,"id":"RtFB\/kEP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118446301,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:46:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump for THumP","filename":"ChooseTheRight","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":250,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490575579924,"time":1490575579,"md5":"hHhjX2V1ZGjFD5YdaUGkyw==","fsize":22568,"resto":118443830,"id":"RtFB\/kEP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118447024,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:52:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"such a fair and reasonable approach causes cognitive dissonance for many \/pol\/tards.","filename":"dealwiththerealtruth","ext":".jpg","w":288,"h":362,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490575925671,"time":1490575925,"md5":"m8Vq4tl2FT6sDp8go5FrKg==","fsize":41007,"resto":118443830,"id":"RtFB\/kEP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118447027,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:52:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"Anyone who talks about terrorism of the Palestinians against the Israelis while justifying the terrorism of the Israelis against the Palestinians (paid for by the good goyim Americans) is a shill.","time":1490575928,"resto":118443830,"id":"r43LX0Jq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118447106,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:52:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Kill all Arabs.","time":1490575970,"resto":118443830,"id":"BvdbDNnW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118447324,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:54:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118447027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118447027<\/a><br>hell man i don&#039;t know who&#039;s shilling who anymore.","time":1490576081,"resto":118443830,"id":"RtFB\/kEP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118447485,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:56:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118447106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118447106<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kill all Arabs.<\/span><br>Let&#039;s just all kill each other and there won&#039;t be any problems.","time":1490576161,"resto":118443830,"id":"RtFB\/kEP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118447517,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:56:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118443830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118443830<\/a><br>literally just stop supporting either side and let things sort themselves out, rule of might","time":1490576185,"resto":118443830,"id":"TJOVo4Yv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118447852,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:59:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118443830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118443830<\/a><br><br>You don&#039;t.

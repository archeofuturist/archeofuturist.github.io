And it&#039;s hell to get citizen in a country you want to governed by.<br><br>But what if we entered into a faction based world? All children born go to normal education, and live in which ever faction of government their family is in, but upon graduation they have to take a test that decides which government is best suited for them. Factions could be all over the world, but each government is allowed to do their own thing without interference from other countries. You can retake the test for a fee at any time you are unhappy with your government. Etc etc.<br><br>And now that I wrote it all out, I see how this is looking like a world wide government type situation.","filename":"vNYUyda","ext":".png","w":4500,"h":2234,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492311564144,"time":1492311564,"md5":"qnvollW+KJebOhFXjg7IGg==","fsize":467063,"resto":0,"id":"pnmwVsY1","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"territory-idea","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Nobody knows how it ends, but it looks like gradual impoverishment of the low and medium income class.This is why for example, when GDP goes lower stocks go higher, because people expect more QE\u2026.","time":1493128531,"resto":122734368,"id":"EvG2khj\/","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"}]}

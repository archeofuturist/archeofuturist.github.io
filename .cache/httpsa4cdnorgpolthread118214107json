because consciousness seems to be the only thing outside of the all. consciousness is the observer in which the all can exist.<br>why would i call anyone or anything &quot;god&quot;? i&#039;d call something &quot;god&quot; if it has more power than me, but is there an ultimate power? if this power exists inside the all, it is already not outside the all, so it cannot be god, because god wouldn&#039;t be &quot;trapped&quot; into the all.<br>i believe this is the point of understanding when non-duality was &quot;discovered&quot;. kinda living without being identified, just observing.<br>but because i&#039;m not my body, i&#039;m not my thoughts, not my emotions, this means everything is ok. if i&#039;m still it&#039;s right, if i&#039;m angry it&#039;s right. the point is not to become &quot;enlightened&quot; or &quot;peaceful&quot;. the point is not to be identified so everything can flow and happen without the ego controling it.<br>it&#039;s basically an intellectual understand that you can&#039;t control your intellectual understanding. everything happens by itself and i&#039;m the consciousness experiencing it.<br>if i&#039;m not enligthened i believe to be the movie, but if i&#039;m awake i know i&#039;m the one who&#039;s watching the movie.<br>this doesn&#039;t mean the movie is not real, it just means i&#039;m not the movie.<br>to sum it up: the reality is that which is not in thoughts, ideologies.<br>everything is &quot;right&quot; the moment you are simply aware of the current situation.<br>but even to call something &quot;right&quot; is somehow polarized.<br>as i experience me writing this i can observe that there is no ending point in this thought process, my intelectual understanding will never reach completeness about it.<br>so i only can be, that&#039;s all there is.","time":1490442074,"resto":118214107,"id":"w\/By8CEZ","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

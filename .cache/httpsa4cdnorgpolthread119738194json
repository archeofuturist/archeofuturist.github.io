This is a common technique that intelligence agencies use to deceive the masses (I call that technique &#039;conspiracy misdirection&#039;): They promote a conspiracy theory that they KNOW is FALSE and want you to think you&#039;re red-pilled by believing that false conspiracy theory is TRUE while using that false conspiracy theory to hide a TRUE conspiracy theory related to it that has even MORE far-reaching implications than the false conspiracy theory. For example, the &#039;Moon landing hoax&#039; conspiracy theory is being used to hide the TRUE conspiracy theory that we went to the Moon and found artificial objects there (or we knew there were artificial objects there all along and went to the Moon simply to bring some of those artificial objects back to Earth). The official account of the Moon landing AND the Moon landing hoax conspiracy theory are BOTH FALSE.

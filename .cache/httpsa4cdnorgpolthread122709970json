Your so-called patriotism is null and void when you attempt to ignore these facts, which coincidentally only reveals your hypocrisy and cognitive dissonance. <br><br>1. He said he wouldn\u2019t bomb Syria and said it would be a &quot;big mistake&quot; if Barack Obama bombed Syria. You bought it. Then he bombed Syria. <br><br>2. He said he&#039;d build a wall along the border with Mexico and make Mexico pay for it. You bought it. Now his secretary of homeland security says &quot;It\u2019s unlikely that we will build a wall.&quot;<br><br>3. He said he\u2019d clean the Washington swamp. You bought it. Then he brought into his administration more billionaires, CEOs, and Wall Street moguls than in any administration in history, to make laws that will enrich their businesses.<br><br>4. He said he\u2019d repeal Obamacare and replace it with something \u201cwonderful.\u201d You bought it. Then he didn\u2019t.<br><br>5. He said he\u2019d use his business experience to whip the White House into shape. You bought it. Then he created the most chaotic, dysfunctional, back-stabbing White House in modern history, in which no one is in charge. <br><br>6. He said he\u2019d release his tax returns, eventually. You bought it. He hasn\u2019t, and says he never will.<br><br>7. He said he\u2019d divest himself from his financial empire, to avoid any conflicts of interest. You bought it. He remains heavily involved in his businesses, makes money off of foreign dignitaries staying at his Washington hotel, gets China to give the Trump brand trademark and copyright rights, manipulates the stock market on a daily basis, and has more conflicts of interest than can even be counted.<br><br>1\/2","filename":"IMG_2390","ext":".png","w":704,"h":459,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":162,"tim":1493106808049,"time":1493106808,"md5":"uzRrIW39uupBRix7OQTOcw==","fsize":268923,"resto":0,"id":"z7B\/G3x0","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"donald-trump-vs-barack-obama-first-100-days","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122710053,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)03:54:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"8. He said Clinton was in the pockets of Goldman Sachs, and would do whatever they said. You bought it. Then he put half a dozen Goldman Sachs executives in positions of power in his administration.<br><br>9. He said he\u2019d surround himself with all the best and smartest people. You bought it. Then he put Betsy DeVos, opponent of public education, in charge of education; Jeff Sessions, opponent of the Voting Rights Act, in charge of voting rights; Ben Carson, opponent of the Fair Housing Act, in charge of fair housing; Scott Pruitt, climate change denier, in charge of the Environmental Protection Agency; and Russian quisling Rex Tillerson as Secretary of State.<br><br>10. He said he\u2019d faithfully execute the law. You bought it.<br>Then he said his predecessor, Barack Obama, spied on him, without any evidence of Obama ever doing so, in order to divert attention from the FBI&#039;s investigation into collusion between his campaign and Russian operatives to win the election.<br><br>11. He said he knew more about strategy and terrorism than the Generals did. You bought it. Then he promptly gave the green light to a disastrous raid in Yemen- even though all his Generals said it would be a terrible idea. This raid resulted in the deaths of a Navy SEAL, an 8-year old American girl, and numerous civilians. The actual target of the raid escaped, and no useful intel was gained.<br><br>12. He called Barack Obama \u201cthe vacationer-in-Chief\u201d and accused him of playing more rounds of golf than Tiger Woods. He promised to never be the kind of president who took cushy vacations on the taxpayer\u2019s dime, not when there was so much important work to be done. You bought it. He has by now spent more taxpayer money on vacations than Obama did in the first 3 years of his presidency. <br><br>2\/3","time":1493106879,"resto":122709970,"id":"z7B\/G3x0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122710106,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)03:55:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"13.

The artist has cleverly woven a tale of Donald Trump&#039;s hypocrisies. Whether a supporter or not, &#039;Illegitimate President&#039; is well researched and can&#039;t be denied. <br><br>http:\/\/www.loupdargent.info\/2017\/02<wbr>\/donald-trump-has-just-been-hit-up-<wbr>in.html","time":1493106917,"resto":122709970,"id":"z7B\/G3x0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122710162,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)03:56:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122709970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122709970<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122710053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122710053<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122710106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122710106<\/a>","filename":"thiscementwasmixedwithyourtears","ext":".gif","w":450,"h":450,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493106970313,"time":1493106970,"md5":"8tSq85oJfoUl4sI6STy0HA==","fsize":1913716,"resto":122709970,"id":"1pSfEoWc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122710224,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)03:57:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"shill","time":1493107028,"resto":122709970,"id":"xS3jAKkR","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

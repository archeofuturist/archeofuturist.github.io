Since most of the fighting is done in small groups now a days what is the point of them, I mean i can understand generals since they give their input to the president, as well as make up the strategies for battles, but what is the point of the others. Even in World War 2 they had more use, such as my grandfather, who was Sergeant Master, he was a big part of the supplies for the allies invading France i believe, for at least his unit or whatever. But it seems that would all be kept on computers in today&#039;s world? I also understand ranks like captain in the Navy, but all of the others just seem pointless.","filename":"Map_of_participants_in_World_War_II","ext":".png","w":1480,"h":625,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":105,"tim":1490144060747,"time":1490144060,"md5":"APvDvFuGrJdg6GvQLCD6GA==","fsize":49794,"resto":0,"id":"LFckWB9X","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-there-any-point-in-officers-above-private-and","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

The island was discovered by an Englishman in 1690. It wasn&#039;t settled until 1764 by the French and then 1766 by the British. The French sold their colony to Spain in 1766 after the British colony was established. In 1774 the British withdrew from their settlement yet still laid claim to the island as one of its possessions. The western falklands where the former settlement laid was left empty. Soon after the island was left completely abandoned. The Argentinian governments only presence on the island was a small settlement in the ruins of the former Spanish settlement in 1829 and garrison which mutinied immediately after arriving. Right after in 1832 the British returned to the island and have ruled ever since. The British claim to the island is considerably stronger and the Argentinian government only had a presence on the eastern side of the island for barely all of 2 years and failed to even barely rule.","filename":"1452354486535","ext":".png","w":963,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491174050089,"time":1491174050,"md5":"UvOcL55dNmifUiceoQfSqA==","fsize":708382,"resto":119256400,"id":"tlq4SFvv","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119258899,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)19:04:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119258494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119258494<\/a><br>Interesting","time":1491174253,"resto":119256400,"id":"ZW1RyCNL","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":119258914,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)19:04:18","name":"T.

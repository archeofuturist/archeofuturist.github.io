Anons rooting for French to make a good decision. I must say that I also am more optimistic about her helping France over her opponent who already shown rather resigned attitude toward terrorism and islamist conquest while she stood up against that bullshit, as unpopular as her opinion may be in liberal Europe.<br><br>I talk with people, including French. I try to reach them but I am just a random schmuck with shitty connection and limited social media presence. I&#039;m sure fapping to anime is an important daily ritual, but please take a break from it, help spread the info and educate people about both candidates so they can make an educated decision in the second round of elections. Help me, help her and if you have any ties with French - help yourself. Those people will be grateful if you&#039;ll help them save themselves. Your dicks will be grateful for a few minutes of a break.","filename":"161114152205-marine-le-pen-france-flag-super-tease[1]","ext":".jpg","w":1100,"h":619,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493066775463,"time":1493066775,"md5":"XDhEXu7iME6uDzuWqxgBwA==","fsize":118086,"resto":0,"id":"JUZUBlrC","country":"PL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"anons-help-me-help-others","country_name":"Poland","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

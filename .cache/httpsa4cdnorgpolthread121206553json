You have to understand something about global WAR-ming and violence that is all over the world. It&#039;s encrypted under various gen IV narratives that sounds like comic books stories from Dr Evil diary or case load of Preet Bharara and his team. So ISIS narrative is being used as military deception to describe violence over the rainbow in the similar fashion as described in 1984. It&#039;s exactly same violence as another similar brand &quot;explaining&quot; all that violence in latin america as drug gangs battling out against each other. Femicide is another one. All that jazz is about pervertariat and rainbow fight clubs holocausting and genociding straight people preparing global warming towards climage of change towards acceptance of NAMBLA into your hearts and minds.","time":1492261697,"resto":121206553,"id":"761ucc3R","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":121208682,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)09:10:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ok","time":1492261838,"resto":121206553,"id":"leX6jRPz","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"}]}

THE KEKING OF LEFTISTS<br><br>Leftists worldwide have been pushing for some kind of intervention against Syria for years. Obama was a weak faggot as Trump has pointed out repeatedly, with his &quot;red line&quot;. <br><br>Now suddenly the hooker arrives and their dicks are limp. It was all a bit too much. They start backing away from their former stance. Trump and America confirmed for having mastodontic penis.<br><br>2. THE SUPPORT FOR TRUMP<br><br>Trump&#039;s been praised by McCain, Netanyahu, Schumer, Pelosi, various media cucks, even some faggot from New York Times. Even if they don&#039;t want to, they have to if they have backed action on Syria previously.<br><br>3. THE CONTINUED GOOD RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA<br><br>Trump warned Russia of this using the red de-escalation phone, no Russians killed<br><br>4. THE LACK OF AN IMPACT ON SYRIA<br><br>This was a barebones airfield in the middle of nowhere, most likely few if any casualties. It was a symbolic act.<br><br>5. SYRIA IS NOT TOO PISSED OFF<br><br>Syria said it&#039;s &quot;an act of aggression&quot;, notably not &quot;an act of war&quot;. <br><br>6. NO REGIME CHANGE YET<br><br>If there is regime change, it will be after ISIS is defeated and the country stable.

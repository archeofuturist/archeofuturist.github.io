There can be no in between. <br><br>Most of the &quot;redpilled&quot; commentary, blackpill doom porn, pseudo-intellectual analysis, etc. is nothing more than mental masturbation, distractions to keep you from actually committing yourself to anything. <br><br>I got off the carousal last year and got my shit together. I&#039;ve made peace with the fact that I&#039;m not made for politics, and while you could say that my end goal is political in nature, I&#039;m acting on the periphery and not bogged down in political drama. It&#039;s done wonders for my well-being. <br><br>I&#039;m not against politically minded people, but if you are one, commit to something. Even if it&#039;s amateur or anonymous, just take actual steps towards your desired end goal. But being a passive political lurker is fucking cancer for the soul, whether you want to be in politics or not.

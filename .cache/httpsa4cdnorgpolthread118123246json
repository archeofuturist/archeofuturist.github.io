Literal wiretapping is no longer a thing, so any denials based on the literal meaning of wiretapping are invalid. Get your stories straight, libs.<br><br>It is the IC&#039;s prerogative to investigate the executive branch. They ought to investigate the office of the president from time to time if they are doing their jobs correctly. If there is suspicion of impropriety with regards to Trump, let him be investigated. If he is guilty, let him face justice under the law.<br><br>Private industry is free to charge what they like for homes. If you don&#039;t like home prices, choose an alternative such as an apartment, a trailer, or building a kit home.<br><br>The states are free to fund education or food assistance programs as they please. There is no reason why cutting federal funding for education would reduce quality for the end-user long-term. The long-term result would be for costs and tax burden to shift from the feds to the states, which is fine.<br><br>Continent-bridging walls do not pop into existence instantaneously.

We may or may not have a plan at this time.<br><br>We are at war and China is a significant military threat in the medium-term. Our allies are weak and incompetent. These are problems that Trump inherited. Increased defense spending is not surprising.<br><br>The military raid succeeded. There were casualties due to leaks from staff Obama hired.<br><br>Why would we expect instantaneous success on Obamacare negotiations? It is a contentious issue. A deal could not be reached immediately, so Trump and Congress are tabling the matter for now and moving on to other business.

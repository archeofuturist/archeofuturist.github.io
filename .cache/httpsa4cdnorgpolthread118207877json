His body was sent to his widow in a casket four days later, with written instructions from the SS not to open it under any circumstances. Rudolf Hess visited the family a few days later to express condolences for the mistake and offer his widow a pension.[3] Schmid&#039;s widow, Kate Eva Hoerlin, later emigrated to the United States and became a US citizen in 1944.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Schmid&#039;s friend, the philosopher Oswald Spengler, commemorated him in a poem and letter in Reden und Aufs\u00e4tze (Collected Essays, published in 1937).<\/span>","filename":"WilliSchmid","ext":".jpg","w":394,"h":438,"tn_w":224,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490434141541,"time":1490434141,"md5":"WuqD2QwsgNxo6djLFAt6sQ==","fsize":63711,"resto":0,"id":"YuQ9ClIN","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"defend-this-nazis","country_name":"Australia","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118209342,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)05:51:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118207877\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118207877<\/a><br>Nobody will, clearly this is horrifying as ALL decent National Socialists will agree.<br><br>Sad situation.","time":1490435496,"resto":118207877,"id":"ouoDbC9y","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118209533,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)05:54:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118207877\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118207877<\/a><br>Well that sucks doesn&#039;t it, thanks for sharing?","time":1490435648,"resto":118207877,"id":"PtQt4HUE","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118210479,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:09:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118207877\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118207877<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sorry bro it was just a prank :^)<\/span>","time":1490436551,"resto":118207877,"id":"D5xyiMjM","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"}]}

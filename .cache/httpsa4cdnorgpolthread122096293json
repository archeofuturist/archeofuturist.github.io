Trump laments globalism, but says that Russia should take care of the situation in Syria; Trump laments globalism, but has outsourced much of his business for the length of his career. \u201cGlobalism\u201d has become just a slur for Trump\u2019s opponents, just as \u201cneocon\u201d was disconnected by the left from its roots in the left-to-right transitional figures like Irving Kristol and used as a club against anyone who supported the Iraq war (somehow George W. Bush, a lifelong Republican, became a \u201cneo\u201d \u2013 new \u2013 conservative). If you oppose Trump&#039;s agenda, you must disagree with his premise that America&#039;s interests come first -- you must be part of some sort of global conspiracy to overthrow American power.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;These slurs do nobody any good. They\u2019re not only inexact, they\u2019re meant to quash debate. But that\u2019s what the most ardent Trumpkins are all about these days: shouting \u201ccuck\u201d and \u201cglobalist\u201d at anybody who dares disagree with the Great Leader.<\/span>","filename":"5cc5e22a31127d807ff8af175d3cd566ec162b3f","ext":".jpg","w":1842,"h":901,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":122,"tim":1492749240767,"time":1492749240,"md5":"1BCYIEAX9wWSnK2Ah3e+ug==","fsize":82376,"resto":0,"id":"QODJwIGP","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-the-fuck-even-is-a-globalist","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":2,"unique_ips":7},{"no":122096415,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)00:35:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"globalism is a social construct","time":1492749324,"resto":122096293,"id":"QLI4dHNU","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122097635,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)00:48:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122096415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122096415<\/a><br>NOT WHAT I MEAN!","time":1492750109,"resto":122096293,"id":"QODJwIGP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122098785,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:00:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"FUCK!","time":1492750819,"resto":122096293,"id":"QODJwIGP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122098962,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:02:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122096293\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122096293<\/a>","filename":"rural and suburban retards","ext":".png","w":1306,"h":700,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":66,"tim":1492750936749,"time":1492750936,"md5":"GB0IJ98ViUdk9NA8o2Giog==","fsize":74554,"resto":122096293,"id":"g\/wA7\/b+","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122099193,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:04:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122096293\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122096293<\/a><br>He&#039;s right that it&#039;s used as a meaningless slur.<br><br>Cuck is actually a great meme that doesn&#039;t just apply to politics though.

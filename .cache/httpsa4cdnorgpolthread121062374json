The bottom line is that everything is heritable, an outcome that has taken all sides of the naturenurture debate by surprise. Irving Gottesman and I have suggested that the universal influence of genes on behavior be enshrined as the first law of behavior genetics (Turkheimer &amp; Gottesman, 1991), and at the risk of naming laws that I can take no credit for discovering, it is worth stating the nearly unanimous results of behavior genetics in a more formal manner.&quot;<br><br>The Three Laws are as follows: <br><br>? First Law. All human behavioral traits are heritable.<br><br>? Second Law. The effect of being raised in the same family is smaller than the effect of genes.<br><br>? Third Law.

Like all rightwing morons, you have a low IQ so you oversimplify everything. Most &quot;conservation&quot; is actually handled at the state level, and states are profoundly corrupt, because most of them lean hard right and want to destroy every wild place to benefit private corporations. Your precious pipeline has caused people to literally lose their land through imminent domain, because states feel it&#039;s okay to steal people&#039;s land if it benefits a corporation handing them cash. You deserve nothing but torturous, painful death. You are not misunderstood, you&#039;re not enlightened. You&#039;re wrong, stupid and evil and punishment is coming for you.

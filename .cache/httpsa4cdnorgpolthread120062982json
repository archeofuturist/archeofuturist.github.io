He brought on both Kushner and Stephen Miller onto his team, and even had his own daughter convert to Judaism. <br><br>They have begun to make their move. Fake attacks on Asad, fake power struggles between the &#039;good globalist jew Kushner&#039; and the evil nationalist Bannon, are all political theater. It is all designed to trick CIA and GOP insiders into giving them the information they need to finally take down the (largely Jewish) globalist establishment, and usher in a new era of prosperity and American exceptionalism.","filename":"HAPPENING","ext":".png","w":1626,"h":1818,"tn_w":223,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491615066907,"time":1491615066,"md5":"RvhW8WNo3UtFeFInFUtU9w==","fsize":1712349,"resto":0,"id":"hxcTkEH1","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"kushgate","country_name":"United States","replies":170,"images":32,"unique_ips":101,"tail_size":50},{"no":120063342,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)21:33:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120062982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120062982<\/a><br>kek","filename":"IMG_0550","ext":".png","w":247,"h":128,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":64,"tim":1491615213474,"time":1491615213,"md5":"POThcf0\/32TSa5YJFfIelQ==","fsize":55889,"resto":120062982,"id":"hIM7z3af","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120063413,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)21:34:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120062982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120062982<\/a><br>So Styx was right all along?","time":1491615243,"resto":120062982,"id":"kOTskNFR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120063669,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)21:35:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120063413\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120063413<\/a><br>Styx is never wrong","filename":"reallyquiteFunny","ext":".png","w":785,"h":546,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1491615344678,"time":1491615344,"md5":"S3Hvnk2FDUyBzj4r7gTw9w==","fsize":656079,"resto":120062982,"id":"hxcTkEH1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120063678,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)21:35:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120062982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120062982<\/a><br>Well this explains why The Daily Beast is trying to get us to hate him.<br><br>He&#039;s our guy.

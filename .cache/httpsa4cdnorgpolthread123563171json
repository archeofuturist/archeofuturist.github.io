The Whole World Is Now a Message Board","com":"For most of last year, it was hard to avoid the sensation that something had broken somewhere and the internet was leaking into real life. The world seemed to have taken on the punchy, disorderly, darkly playful quality of a message-board fight, in part because the president-to-be insisted on communicating mainly in tweets assembled from detritus found in a Breitbart-comments scrapyard. The subcultures and folkways of the internet had become powerful enough that the entire election apparatus was obligated to attend to and dissect them. In January, the Republican consultant Rick Wilson dismissed a portion of Trump supporters as \u201cchildless single men who masturbate to anime\u201d; by September, the Clinton campaign was concerned enough with the threat of meme warfare that itreleasedan explainer denouncing the cartoon frog Pepe under the title \u201cDonald Trump, Pepe the frog, and white supremacists: an explainer.\u201d When Election Night rolled around, it was hard to begrudge the exuberant 4chan poster, thrilling in his candidate\u2019s surprise victory, who bragged that \u201cwe actually elected a meme as president.\u201d<br><br>It was a shocking turn, and not just because Donald Trump had become president. Somehow the self-proclaimed losers and freaks of 4chan and its ilk had come to great political prominence. The gleaming new real-name internet of Facebook \u2014 not to mention the media companies and political machines relying on it \u2014 that was supposed to tame the wild territory of the Reddit-style web had instead been infected by it. It was almost a thrilling underdog story \u2014 the weirdos and outcasts had stood up for something and won \u2014 except that the thing they were standing up for was anti-Enlightenment, anti-democratic, anti-equality politics.<br><br>http:\/\/nymag.com\/selectall\/2017\/04\/<wbr>the-whole-world-is-now-a-message-bo<wbr>ard.html","filename":"Screenshot_2017-05-01-09-09-25_1","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1438,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493604861732,"time":1493604861,"md5":"tUm5sxVkFzya4c8taZoFgA==","fsize":123965,"resto":0,"id":"zPWE4BqR","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-have-you-done-pol-the-whole-world-is-now-a","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":123563207,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:14:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Whatever else the alt-right is, it is a movement born and incubated on the internet, and it couldn\u2019t have existed without that technology.

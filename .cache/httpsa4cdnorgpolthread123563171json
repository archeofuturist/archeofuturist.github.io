The Whole World Is Now a Message Board","com":"For most of last year, it was hard to avoid the sensation that something had broken somewhere and the internet was leaking into real life. The world seemed to have taken on the punchy, disorderly, darkly playful quality of a message-board fight, in part because the president-to-be insisted on communicating mainly in tweets assembled from detritus found in a Breitbart-comments scrapyard. The subcultures and folkways of the internet had become powerful enough that the entire election apparatus was obligated to attend to and dissect them. In January, the Republican consultant Rick Wilson dismissed a portion of Trump supporters as \u201cchildless single men who masturbate to anime\u201d; by September, the Clinton campaign was concerned enough with the threat of meme warfare that itreleasedan explainer denouncing the cartoon frog Pepe under the title \u201cDonald Trump, Pepe the frog, and white supremacists: an explainer.\u201d When Election Night rolled around, it was hard to begrudge the exuberant 4chan poster, thrilling in his candidate\u2019s surprise victory, who bragged that \u201cwe actually elected a meme as president.\u201d<br><br>It was a shocking turn, and not just because Donald Trump had become president. Somehow the self-proclaimed losers and freaks of 4chan and its ilk had come to great political prominence. The gleaming new real-name internet of Facebook \u2014 not to mention the media companies and political machines relying on it \u2014 that was supposed to tame the wild territory of the Reddit-style web had instead been infected by it. It was almost a thrilling underdog story \u2014 the weirdos and outcasts had stood up for something and won \u2014 except that the thing they were standing up for was anti-Enlightenment, anti-democratic, anti-equality politics.<br><br>http:\/\/nymag.com\/selectall\/2017\/04\/<wbr>the-whole-world-is-now-a-message-bo<wbr>ard.html","filename":"Screenshot_2017-05-01-09-09-25_1","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1438,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493604861732,"time":1493604861,"md5":"tUm5sxVkFzya4c8taZoFgA==","fsize":123965,"resto":0,"id":"zPWE4BqR","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-have-you-done-pol-the-whole-world-is-now-a","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":3,"unique_ips":14},{"no":123563207,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:14:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Whatever else the alt-right is, it is a movement born and incubated on the internet, and it couldn\u2019t have existed without that technology. Circulation, discussion, and debate are oxygen to political ideas.

The first stirrings of political organizing occurred in 2008, when Anonymous, the now mostly defunct hacker collective, arose out of 4chan to take on Scientology \u2014 mostly because the Church of Scientology was attempting to remove a funny video of Tom Cruise from the internet.

Posters and trolls wanted to reserve for themselves on the internet the power and freedom they couldn\u2019t find off it. And as the online and offline spheres slowly merged over the course of the 2010s, that sovereignty expressed itself as an abject refusal to resocialize \u2014 the reservation of a sacred right to be cruel. The puckish left-libertarianism that had characterized the early message-board political activity of groups like Anonymous transformed into a revanchism, seemingly intended to protect \u201cKekistan\u201d \u2014 the joking name, from the LOL-like word Kek, for the safe spaces of the frustrated men of the internet.<br><br>This was the sensibility galvanized in 2014 by \u2014 what else? \u2014 a depressed and frustrated man\u2019s rambling, 9,000-word post falsely accusing his game-developer ex-girlfriendZo\u00eb Quinnof exchanging sex for video-game reviews. Quinn came to stand in for all the women who were attempting to carve out roles in an industry where \u201cthree-dimensional female character\u201d traditionally referred to modeling breast physics in a graphics engine. That Quinn was innocent of the charges against her was irrelevant. She had become a meme: an endlessly replicable, endlessly remixable referent, a shibboleth for the quasi-religious systems of internet culture. Memes do not make for a particularly compassionate politics. As Whitney Phillips, a professor at Mercer University who specializes in internet culture, explains, \u201cWhen you\u2019re engaging with a meme, you\u2019re not engaging with a full narrative\u201d \u2014 much less with the real person on the receiving end.","time":1493604991,"resto":123563171,"id":"zPWE4BqR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123563999,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:20:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123563171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123563171<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the Reddit-style web<\/span>","filename":"1484532352901","ext":".png","w":300,"h":250,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1493605242538,"time":1493605242,"md5":"Prf\/VnoxkxA5130wTlorjA==","fsize":20050,"resto":123563171,"id":"gK2HhOtG","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123564315,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:23:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"what the fuck is this shit.","filename":"1437512431188","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":441,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1493605394741,"time":1493605394,"md5":"m11gwg\/zw4izoWPFvyCOyA==","fsize":61584,"resto":123563171,"id":"H67gkZsR","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123564500,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:24:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;another nu\/pol\/ wall of text<\/span><br>What is wrong with you idiots","time":1493605490,"resto":123563171,"id":"mz7qC6nA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123564830,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:27:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123563448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123563448<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a depressed and frustrated man\u2019s rambling, 9,000-word post falsely accusing his game-developer ex-girlfriendZo\u00eb Quinnof exchanging sex for video-game reviews<\/span><br><br>Except that wasn&#039;t the case.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Reporters in charge of reading primary sources<\/span>","time":1493605657,"resto":123563171,"id":"FexNiINd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123564904,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:28:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"We are post-sincerity.<br><br>Now we are post-post-irony metanauts.","time":1493605689,"resto":123563171,"id":"IiUAvEKh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123565015,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:28:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Theyre finally coming to terms with the fact that \/pol\/ are better magicians than the jewluminati.<br><br>I would loved to have seen their faces as it was explained to them that we actually mastered chaos magick and summoned a neter and fucked their plans.","time":1493605738,"resto":123563171,"id":"eiCEqiR7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123565373,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:32:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123565015\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123565015<\/a><br>remember that one image of \/x\/ trying to summon a succubus, and then someone taught \/pol\/ magick and we immediately started to try to kill Africa?<br><br>That was a great one.","time":1493605924,"resto":123563171,"id":"cI\/w19BX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123565533,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:33:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123563171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123563171<\/a><br>I made this youtube channel to praise kek and cleanse europe<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=oXW<wbr>gJSpvbic","time":1493605998,"resto":123563171,"id":"Ts092iWy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123565779,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:35:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123563171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123563171<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what have we done?<\/span><br><br>We shaped reality my friend.

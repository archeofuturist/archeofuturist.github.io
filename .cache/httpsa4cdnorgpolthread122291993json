Conservatives don&#039;t produce much culture. Liberals and progressives are much more creative and they flood media networks with their messages. And they celebrate each other with awards and tv shows. Conservatives have talk radio and a few websites. <br><br>But the right also has memes. I guess the Alt-Right is so creative because we are mostly disillusioned liberals. And we should use this power more often to produce culture the left is forced to react to.<br><br>One cultural topic we could focus on would be to celebrate successful men. The left constantly celebrates useless women and whiny men. And instead of raging over it we should celebrate the great successful men of our time. The Elon Musks, the Arnold Schwarzeneggers and Richard Bransons. The guys who give a crap about this whole gender talk and just go out there, make something happening and the world has to deal with it. Those guys deserve some recognition and celebration and we can do this through memes.<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9Ze<wbr>W5lGvN-w<br><br>post some great and successful men who deserve some recognition","filename":"RichardBranson","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1071,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":167,"tim":1492876920769,"time":1492876920,"md5":"DXttISnbBge01nP+kGQuFw==","fsize":299836,"resto":0,"id":"4ICJJCjA","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"meme-magic","country_name":"Germany","replies":14,"images":5,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122293670,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:15:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1492877730,"resto":122291993,"id":"4ICJJCjA","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122294251,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:20:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122291993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122291993<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Billionaire Richard Branson<\/span><br>You mean the same guy who has put up Obama on his own private island in Tahiti for the last month (while Obama dodges possible arrest)","filename":"branson obama","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":348,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492878027867,"time":1492878027,"md5":"07YbClLxmL5lPIpTTqJXdg==","fsize":28084,"resto":122291993,"id":"mfbPISzy","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122294522,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:22:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122291993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122291993<\/a><br>Judge a man by the company he keeps","filename":"branson soros","ext":".jpg","w":393,"h":567,"tn_w":86,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492878170382,"time":1492878170,"md5":"TmfJxuHqLQVW5NLQBvZjwg==","fsize":49435,"resto":122291993,"id":"mfbPISzy","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122294793,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:25:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122294251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122294251<\/a><br>Yes, but do you not understand the memetic power of the original image?","time":1492878321,"resto":122291993,"id":"kMIsW7oP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122294816,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:25:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122294251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122294251<\/a><br>I don&#039;t care about his politics or the people he invites to his parties.

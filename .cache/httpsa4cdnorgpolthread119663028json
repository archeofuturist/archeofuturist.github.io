Because I rightly believe in holding ones leaders to account and then a couple of minutes later I was banned.<br><br>I must say I was not surprised. I expected as much because it is indeed plebbit after all. I looked through their posts and it was nearly identical to \/pol\/. If someone expresses a differing opinion on r\/the_donald they are called a shill and such. The same thing has been happening here recently. <br><br>We&#039;re infested with reddit. It doesn&#039;t matter if they support the same person as you because at the end of the day they have the reddit mentality. You know, how they like to have a circlejerk in their hugbox. Free from an opinion that would challenge their beleifs.<br><br>They have absolutely destroyed \/pol\/. It reminded me of Britain, the colonisers have become the colonised. Something seriously has to be done about this because they are destroying the boards culture and I am just sick of it.","filename":"plebbit","ext":".png","w":874,"h":288,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":82,"tim":1491429802058,"time":1491429802,"md5":"eWozCYaSUQe0bwzc4y0\/Pg==","fsize":14697,"resto":0,"id":"5XauiWmy","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-just-as-a-little-experiment-i-went-to","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":8,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119663202,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)18:04:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119663028\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119663028<\/a><br>give it some time and things should balance out","time":1491429888,"resto":119663028,"id":"O5cS3Vx5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119663464,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)18:06:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119663202\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119663202<\/a><br>They have had sometime to integrate and they haven&#039;t.","time":1491430012,"resto":119663028,"id":"5XauiWmy","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119663510,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)18:07:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119663028\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119663028<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OP uses reddit spacing<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OP claims we&#039;re being raided by reddit<\/span>","filename":"03a","ext":".jpg","w":261,"h":194,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1491430030198,"time":1491430030,"md5":"ivDUaZJwGl6nsdlk6ved5A==","fsize":9462,"resto":119663028,"id":"AL0wrqiH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119663674,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)18:08:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119663510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119663510<\/a><br>Hello r\/the_donald.

The agreement stated that it wouldn&#039;t break the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia, but since Yugoslavia doesn&#039;t exist anymore, this creates a loophole in the law. Kosovo at the current state isn&#039;t able to go on an open war against Serbia, and because of this sometimes has to bend the knee, because even if this loophole allows them their -autonomy-, it isn&#039;t as simple in the eyes of te west. If however it were Serbia to declare war, again, Kosovo would immediately gain full indipendence.

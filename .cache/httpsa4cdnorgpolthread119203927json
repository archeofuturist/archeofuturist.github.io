She may have won the popular vote and that would have worked in the U.K. as it&#039;s system uses the popular vote count but the US uses the electoral college. This prevents densely populated areas from &quot;stuffing the box&quot; for a single candidate. It forces the candidate to canvas the &quot;fly over states&quot; and this way the whole system works for everyone and not just the large metropolitan areas. Let&#039;s face it. The man is not a diplomat, he&#039;s a businessman. He is used to getting his way and he has just had a reality check with the attempted repeal of Obamacare. The next thing will be immigration and there will be dozens more failures to come but this is the President that was chosen. There was every opportunity to get rid of him before he was elected but the fates saw it a different way. <br>So before you start ranting that Clinton was the popular choice and hence should be President, read a book or just use fucking Google to get the facts.","time":1491146135,"resto":119203927,"id":"uxnmr3qc","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119209314,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)11:20:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119203927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119203927<\/a><br>Sage I saw the same thread being posted by a brazilian","time":1491146401,"resto":119203927,"id":"rdFbCcvO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119211092,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)11:39:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119203927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119203927<\/a><br>So how many times does someone with basic understanding of the electoral process in America have to explain to you how the election process works, honeycunt?

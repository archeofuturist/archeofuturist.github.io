There was this idea, all misfortune happening in the country was done by the invisible facist roaming around the whole country. An incident in a factory - fascist doing etc. Eventually even the sense of patriotism was twisted. For every misfortune was blamed the west, and the fascist. Thus even nowadays most people blame either USA, European Union, or Russia for out government failures.<br><br>tl;dr, the answer u will get from a true communist will be:<br>Fascists","time":1492970080,"resto":122454427,"id":"sPyqb0VO","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"}]}

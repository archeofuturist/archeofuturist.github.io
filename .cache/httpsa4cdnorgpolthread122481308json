WE HAVE TO MAKE THIS THE CORE OF THEIR PREOCCUPATIONS.<br>2) <br>some Melenchon voters don&#039;t want the TAFTA, the CETA, the EU, and the big business to evade taxes. REMEMBER THEM VOTING FOR MACRON MEANS SUPPORTING THIS.<br>3) <br>Marine is now THE ONLY ANTI-SYSTEM candidate. When you think macron dared to present himself this way it&#039;s hilarious. EVERY PERSON REMOTELY ANGRY AT THE PAST GOVERNMENTS MUST REALIZE MACRON IS A PUPPET OF THIS &quot;SYSTEM&quot;.<br>4) <br>The &quot;WE ALREADY WON&quot; effect will mean less dedication from Macron voters.

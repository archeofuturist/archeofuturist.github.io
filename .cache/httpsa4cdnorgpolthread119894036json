I don&#039;t care for what most people say to bash Trump. I&#039;m not some loon who looks to put him on a pedestal but I wholeheartedly believe that he is the best option for america purely because of his ability to make strategic decisions such as this. If he keeps this up, dems will go to war for him at some point. I guarantee it.","time":1491544792,"resto":119894036,"id":"NIZo95Rd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

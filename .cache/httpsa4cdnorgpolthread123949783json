Over 90% of what you believe comes from FBI agents from Stormfront, CIA honeypots like Reddit, KGB disinfo that was repurposed after the Cold War, Tsarist era propaganda, Nazi propaganda, Right Wing Mcarythite (Deep State) propaganda and of course private intel ops which astroturf Reddit, Facebook, 4chan, et al.<br><br>Some industries that are conveniently never discussed in great detail on these websites: Metal and Extractions, Biotech, Chemicals, Defense, Aerospace, Private Intelligence, Oil (unless Rothschilds can be connected), Real Estate (unless Jews or the Chinese are involved) and so on.<br><br>Who are the biggest winners from Trump&#039;s victory and also happen to be the biggest benefactors of the Military-Industrial-Intelligence-Te<wbr>ch nexus? Spoiler alert, it ain&#039;t you baying morons. It&#039;s the aforementioned industries. Who is the new Sec. of State? Exxon Mobil. Who is the Treasury Sec.? Goldman Sachs. Who is already seeing increased profits from the Trump presidency? Again, it&#039;s the aforementioned industries. The Obama\/Clinton\/Blair brand of Third Way unideological neoliberalism was pushed out existence by the reactionary arm of the Deep State in a relatively silent coup because they know another crash is coming, one far worse than 2008, and they know the only way to crush its attendant political disquietism is to, well, literally crush it. As history plainly illustrates, fascism is what capital gets up to when it&#039;s in very serious crisis. <br><br>So congratulations \/pol\/. You&#039;ve let your brains turn to mush at the behest of the deep state and the whims of capital. You&#039;ve unwittingly helped the intelligence community ruin the alt-media movement of the past 15 years and the truly radical political currents it was developing. Good work.","filename":"9b5","ext":".jpg","w":611,"h":404,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1493839550531,"time":1493839550,"md5":"bblDMBRNBdXfvXip5MyoSw==","fsize":38635,"resto":0,"id":"vc7SHHu+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"daily-reminder-that-this-board-is-a-honeypot-and","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

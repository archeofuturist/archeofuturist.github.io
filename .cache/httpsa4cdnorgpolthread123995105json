Choi\u2019s father, Choi Tae-min, had developed a close bond with the President after her mother\u2019s death. A Wikileaks diplomatic cable from 2007 referred to rumors among the South Korean public that Tae-min was a \u201cRasputin\u201d type figure with \u201ccomplete control over Park\u2019s body and soul during her formative years.\u201d The New York Times reported in 2016 that Mr. Choi was the founder of an obscure sect based on Buddhism, Christianity and Chondogyo called the Church of Eternal Life who befriended Ms. Park, 40 years his junior, soon after her mother was assassinated in 1974. Media reports stated that after Choi Tae-Min\u2019s death in 1994, his daughter Choi Soon-sil became a close advisor for Park and that during this time there were rumors (firmly denied by the president) of shamanist rituals being performed in the Blue House. Korean news outlet The Hankyoreh revealed that Soon-sil exercised extreme levels of control over Park, to the extent that she was dictating the president\u2019s own policy.&quot;","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-05-03 at 7.58.13 PM","ext":".png","w":527,"h":351,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493860120524,"time":1493860120,"md5":"CI\/1W1YxW7wpihm\/SPm\/1Q==","fsize":232100,"resto":0,"id":"OBklzmsm","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"south-korean-8-goddess-scandal-sk-pres-accused-of","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":7,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123995437,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:11:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"&quot;Despite official denials, there was a clear pattern of official acceptance of shamanism during Park\u2019s presidency. In 2016, South Korean paper Kukmin Ilbo reported that shamanistic ritual sacrifices were performed in the National Assembly Proceeding Hall where South Korea\u2019s legislature convenes. The ceremony was attended by over 200 people, including politicians, supermodels, doctors and shamanists. It drew the ire of Korean pastors and theological teachers who condemned the National Assembly\u2019s official endorsement of the event. The Korea Times also noted that the public was increasingly interpreting official events and the president\u2019s remarks in religious terms.<br><br>After the sinking of the Sewol, South Korean media speculated the incident had been intentional and meant to mark the twentieth anniversary of the death of Choi Tae-min, which fell near the date of the Sewol disaster. Al-Jazeera wrote that Park was: \u201cforced to deny rumours that she was participating in a ritual to mark the anniversary of the death of Choi Tae-min, the founder of a Christian sect to which she had ties.\u201d The Korea Times also described claims that the accident was related to a sacrificial ritual and that the victims were \u201cofferings.\u201d So controversial were the accusations against Park and Choi Soon-sil, that practitioners of shamanism in South Korea claimed their reputations were being tarnished by the scandal.&quot;","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-05-03 at 8.10.55 PM","ext":".png","w":770,"h":566,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1493860284542,"time":1493860284,"md5":"pIfXXFPPdBh7Tssxk3VowQ==","fsize":463030,"resto":123995105,"id":"OBklzmsm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123995635,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:13:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","filename":"Image6-10","ext":".jpg","w":585,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":64,"tim":1493860380100,"time":1493860380,"md5":"w5C9uiUA3p5F3+CLgP+ohA==","fsize":24621,"resto":123995105,"id":"TC4b7hbD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123995696,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:13:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123995105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123995105<\/a><br>Oh boy.

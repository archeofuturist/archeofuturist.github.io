Choi\u2019s father, Choi Tae-min, had developed a close bond with the President after her mother\u2019s death. A Wikileaks diplomatic cable from 2007 referred to rumors among the South Korean public that Tae-min was a \u201cRasputin\u201d type figure with \u201ccomplete control over Park\u2019s body and soul during her formative years.\u201d The New York Times reported in 2016 that Mr. Choi was the founder of an obscure sect based on Buddhism, Christianity and Chondogyo called the Church of Eternal Life who befriended Ms. Park, 40 years his junior, soon after her mother was assassinated in 1974. Media reports stated that after Choi Tae-Min\u2019s death in 1994, his daughter Choi Soon-sil became a close advisor for Park and that during this time there were rumors (firmly denied by the president) of shamanist rituals being performed in the Blue House. Korean news outlet The Hankyoreh revealed that Soon-sil exercised extreme levels of control over Park, to the extent that she was dictating the president\u2019s own policy.&quot;","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-05-03 at 7.58.13 PM","ext":".png","w":527,"h":351,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493860120524,"time":1493860120,"md5":"CI\/1W1YxW7wpihm\/SPm\/1Q==","fsize":232100,"resto":0,"id":"OBklzmsm","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"south-korean-8-goddess-scandal-sk-pres-accused-of","country_name":"United States","replies":95,"images":37,"unique_ips":43},{"no":123995437,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:11:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"&quot;Despite official denials, there was a clear pattern of official acceptance of shamanism during Park\u2019s presidency.

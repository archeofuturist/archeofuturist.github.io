There are only some good police officers like Darren Wilson but even he had some anti social behavior patterns and became a pussy att the end leaving his job. <br><br>I personally blame all the crime in the United States committed by niggers and muslims and liberal antifa all on the local police department for being incompentant disconnective anti white cunts. I&#039;d be more than happy to have actual nazi police officers or soviet police officers that are nicer and more connective and passionate then our current police officers that act very pathologically. <br><br>Also I think we should make our prisons like that of the harden in Norway.","filename":"IMG_0416","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":374,"tn_w":167,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492660021865,"time":1492660021,"md5":"9EQWmIc72t7m2lTiSmfc1g==","fsize":22565,"resto":0,"id":"lLWfiuF6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-dont-americans-want-to-reform-our-prison","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121948579,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)23:57:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121947381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121947381<\/a><br>Because we feel good when people we perceive as bad get punished instead of rehabilitated, although in the case of niggers and spics rehabilitation is off the table because they are culturally inclines to pursue crime. We like to hear a child molester got shanked and beaten by other prisoners. We like to hear about a serial killer getting executed. We like to hear about thugs getting raped in the showers. If it means prisons can turn a profit at the same time by continuing a cycle for criminals to be incarcerated, punished, released and then they commit a crime again because they have no other options but either an hero or steal to eat then we&#039;re glad to go along with it as long as the thief ends up behind bars more often than outside. Some people are not worth saving, and some people are simply dangerous to society and must be killed for the greater good, as long as the greater good is fine with it. <br><br>The police are different from the prison system, for starters.","time":1492660643,"resto":121947381,"id":"fPzTu6hy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121949234,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:03:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121948579\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121948579<\/a><br>Police are meant to enforce the law, and that can lead to cocky idiots with a badge being jumpy or paranoid cops who don&#039;t want to end up being another Dinkheller. <br><br>Cops don&#039;t contribute to the sentencing or rehabilitation process. The process is what is most fucked up, as it doesn&#039;t aim to truly rehabilitate, it aims to hinder the convicted into a state of helplessness in feeling that it&#039;s only crime or death for them, for many some of that truly is the case but they don&#039;t want to live with the truth that they are worthless or worse, a negative impact in society, while a rare few embrace their destructive nature. <br><br>The issue you seem to have with police is just human nature. Cops are still afraid of being shot, and they never know who&#039;s packing because of spics and niggers hiding anything in their asses (literally) and they could end up dead if they aren&#039;t in control of the situation. A lack of control can anger some sociopaths, and they can find their way into a precinct with a gun and badge to their name. Cops can suffer from poor judgement just as many others in other occupations do. It&#039;s human faults amplified with a gun and sense of authority that makes it worse when cops get cocky.","time":1492661018,"resto":121947381,"id":"fPzTu6hy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121949875,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:09:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121949234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121949234<\/a><br>Police in the US are also pretty shitty in that they ask you to report events you see, but in a large city some things take precedence and a burglary may be put off while a gang shooting gets investigated. Police take into consideration who&#039;d instigated a fight, and who&#039;s part of it all. They have to observe that all parties have rights in the matter, and even if a scumbag threw a punch, it&#039;s the guy who instigated the fight who gets hauled off too. If you get physical with little to no provocation, they will come after you for sure.<br><br>Cops also have no incentive to be a preventive measure against crime, only a response to it because while on patrol, they can be lazy or otherwise &quot;out of their jurisdiction&quot; in events. Cops are pretty shitty all around the world since it&#039;s human nature to abuse what little authority you&#039;re granted. If they can get a better position or find an easy way through life, most people will take that. Cops are in the mindset that they are serving the people, and thus they should have some special privileges, and they certainly do while in uniform or driving in a cruiser and being able to drive in HOV lanes even when alone because who&#039;s going to call out a cop on that?","time":1492661362,"resto":121947381,"id":"fPzTu6hy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121949894,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:09:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121948579\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121948579<\/a><br>I&#039;m saying is that the police are not doing their jobs by allowing niggers and spics and muslims to have sex with children gang banging and enabling thug culture instead of them correcting it and murder anyone as long as the victim is white (much like in South Africa). <br><br>Nigs and spics and muslims complain that the police are oppressing them yet the police kill more white people than any other race in the country. <br><br>Also I don&#039;t want to be put into prison because I defended myself against a Iranian sand nigger faggot touching my shit or using my gun defend myself in a gun restricted place.

That&#039;s not to say nigs didn&#039;t get unfair treatment in the past even though they did commit a lot of crimes back then as well of different calibers, but they get preferential treatment now in a ridiculous amount thanks to media painting them as innocent when they probably have a rap sheet as long as the drive from a detention center to county.","time":1492661788,"resto":121947381,"id":"fPzTu6hy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

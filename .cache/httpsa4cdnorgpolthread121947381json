There are only some good police officers like Darren Wilson but even he had some anti social behavior patterns and became a pussy att the end leaving his job. <br><br>I personally blame all the crime in the United States committed by niggers and muslims and liberal antifa all on the local police department for being incompentant disconnective anti white cunts. I&#039;d be more than happy to have actual nazi police officers or soviet police officers that are nicer and more connective and passionate then our current police officers that act very pathologically. <br><br>Also I think we should make our prisons like that of the harden in Norway.","filename":"IMG_0416","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":374,"tn_w":167,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492660021865,"time":1492660021,"md5":"9EQWmIc72t7m2lTiSmfc1g==","fsize":22565,"resto":0,"id":"lLWfiuF6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-dont-americans-want-to-reform-our-prison","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121948579,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)23:57:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121947381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121947381<\/a><br>Because we feel good when people we perceive as bad get punished instead of rehabilitated, although in the case of niggers and spics rehabilitation is off the table because they are culturally inclines to pursue crime. We like to hear a child molester got shanked and beaten by other prisoners. We like to hear about a serial killer getting executed. We like to hear about thugs getting raped in the showers. If it means prisons can turn a profit at the same time by continuing a cycle for criminals to be incarcerated, punished, released and then they commit a crime again because they have no other options but either an hero or steal to eat then we&#039;re glad to go along with it as long as the thief ends up behind bars more often than outside. Some people are not worth saving, and some people are simply dangerous to society and must be killed for the greater good, as long as the greater good is fine with it. <br><br>The police are different from the prison system, for starters.","time":1492660643,"resto":121947381,"id":"fPzTu6hy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

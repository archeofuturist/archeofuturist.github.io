As for where I&#039;ve been and what I thought.<br><br>Disclaimer - they were short summer touristy trips with groups from school, so I didn&#039;t get to really experience the countries.<br><br>-England (London): It&#039;s a nice city. It&#039;s expensive. People speak English though so 10\/10<br>-France (Paris): Cool architecture. Place smells of urine and cigarettes. Shittiest drivers I&#039;ve ever seen in my life. Got accosted by a group of arabs mocking us for being Americans and kept following the girls in our group making pussy-licking noises. Also it was more expensive than London. Remove kebab and then we&#039;ll see.<br><br>-Spain (Madrid): Chill city. People were chill. I got a burger there because ya know. Went to Toledo and loved it. Tons of architecture from different eras. Multiculturalism must look nicer after a few centuries I suppose. I couldn&#039;t tell which guys were Mexican and which were Kebab, but there were lots of sword shops there. 10\/10 would go back and buy more swords.<br><br>-Greece (Athens, Mykonos, Rhode): Figuratively chill. Literally hot as balls. Much lamb. I geeked out on the classical architecture as one does. Score pending upon paying debts.<br><br>-Italy (Rome, Florence). Rome is a city. It has Roman stuff which is cool. The people, as is the case in most cities, are assholes. Don&#039;t think I&#039;ll be going back. Florence rocked. Much history. Absolutely beautiful city. 10\/10 would return.<br><br>Russia (Moscow, St. Petersburg): Moscow was like being in any city half the time and the other half S.T.A.L.K.E.R. in real-life. Go there if you&#039;re a normalfag and like clubbing. Hide your American dollars because they&#039;ll literally try and grab them from your wallet. Food is awful. Too much Soviet-era architecture too. The Metro however is amazing.

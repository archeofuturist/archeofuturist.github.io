It&#039;s deceptive. The tears, the music, the title based on exposed baldfaced fucking lie. It&#039;s nothing short of propaganda, and it&#039;s aimed directly at those poised to begin occupying positions of authority in the next decade or two. <br><br>It&#039;s so disturbing to watch this shit, knowing how utterly misleading and manipulative it is, how intellectually dishonest, and also knowing that the vast majority of your peers will buy into it&#039;s message so instantly and so deeply that it occupies the same space in their minds right alongside the incontrovertible laws of nature.<br>So deeply that the prospect of questioning its validity never even flickers amongst their conscious thoughts. <br>So deeply that anyone who does have the nerve to question it is not only wrong, but can only be comprehended as an individual motivated purely with a heart filled to the brim with hate and malice. <br><br>That&#039;s what they think of us. We&#039;re the ultimate bad guys. Their righteous mission is to eradicate our miserable existence from the world and from history altogether, so a true utopia can finally be brought about. <br><br>And there&#039;s nothing we can do to stop it.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-03 at 5.41.54 AM","ext":".png","w":689,"h":531,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":192,"tim":1491212556891,"time":1491212556,"md5":"ux17UCTYwBHRamZ9G92Rqg==","fsize":49691,"resto":0,"id":"oLgBLlgZ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-rage-you-lose","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119311792,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)05:45:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;work at buzzfeed<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;keep making controversial videos to lure people into watching them<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;don&#039;t care about downvotes or negative comments , it&#039;s all about the views cause those are convertable to shekels.<\/span>","time":1491212750,"resto":119311623,"id":"7yAISGyP","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119312415,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)05:55:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119311792\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119311792<\/a><br>Even if they&#039;re just doing it for profit, which is probably the case, they&#039;re indoctrinating the next generation of leaders to place higher priority on emotional reaction than sound logical thinking.<br><br>It&#039;s incredibly perverse.They&#039;re peddling extremely volatile political and social ideology to young people that could change the course of history for the worst, simply to make money off of impressionable minds.<br><br>It&#039;s the pinnacle of nihilism masquerading as compassion.","time":1491213348,"resto":119311623,"id":"oLgBLlgZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

If it&#039;s a personal email, they&#039;ll usually send it to a secretary for some copypasted reply, but handwritten, personal letters still carry a helluva lot of weight.<br><br>In the minds of a politician and their staff: A person who is angry enough and motivated enough to sit down and write out a lengthy, personal letter to their representative about an issue that concerns them is someone who&#039;s angry enough and motivated enough to actually do something about it if they don&#039;t see their representative making an effort to seriously address it. The kind of people who take the time to write letters are the kind of people who volunteer for campaigns and go to city council meetings and get involved in the political process. Those aren&#039;t the kinds of people you want to piss off over a minor issue, because<br>a) They&#039;re the kind of people who can just as easily rally support for your opponent and<br>b) If one person was angry enough about your stance on an issue to write about it, how many hundreds or thousands are still angry, but didn&#039;t make that extra effort?","time":1493650986,"resto":123619984,"id":"veOCOX8M","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123630140,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:03:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123629015\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123629015<\/a><br>The whole reason that this would work is that Republicans right now are absolutely dominating Democrats because they are off the deep end.<br><br>It is also critical now because demographics will make &#039;conservatism&#039; as we know it obsolete in 10 years, and it&#039;s their own fault for not closing the floodgates on 3rd worlders.<br><br>However, targeting strategic seats would be an important way to start.

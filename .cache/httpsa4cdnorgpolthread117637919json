Just the best EDM, it&#039;s absolutely fantastic. You&#039;ve never heard anything like it, they think they have good beats in Europe but I&#039;ve got them beat bigly. My record collection is yuge, just a big beautiful wall of music all sorted by month of release with subcategories split by color. My son, Barron, he keeps it tidy for me. Such a smart boy, he really took a shine to this stuff after we had him vaccinated. But the problem with having such a yuge collection...really, it&#039;s fantastic...but the problem is I get a lot of loose discs just lying around, and then I can&#039;t put them back because I lose the sleeves. I have so many empty unmarked CD cases.

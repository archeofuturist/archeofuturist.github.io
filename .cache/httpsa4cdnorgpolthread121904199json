Keep it up, Donald.\u201d<br><br>Graham began by saying, \u201cI think we dodged a bullet with healthcare. I\u2019m not so sure the House bill would have done much better fixing Obamacare. It was probably Obamacare-lite, some people say. I would let it collapse because it will. It\u2019s so poorly designed. I would tell the Democrats, you created this mess, let me help you fix it.\u201d And \u201cWhen it comes to taxes, we better cut your taxes, or we\u2019ll pay a price in 2018. If you can\u2019t get all Republicans on board for a tax idea, then we\u2019re going to have to maybe marry it up with infrastructure.\u201d<br><br>When the discussion turned to foreign policy, Graham stated, \u201cI am like the happiest dude in America right now. We\u2019ve got a president and a national security team that I have been dreaming of for 8 years. So, in 80 days he\u2019s done more to correct the world \u2014 President Trump \u2014 than Obama did in 8 years. We sent a letter to our good buddy the Ayatollah, hey, knock it off. \u2026 North Korea, if I were Kim Jong-un, whatever his name is, I would listen to Mike Pence. The fact that the vice president of the United States went to the DMZ, looked across the way, and said, we\u2019re watching you. Donald Trump is not going to let this nutjob in North Korea get a missile to hit America, and if I were North Korea and China, I\u2019d start thinking anew about the president of the United States.\u201d<br><br>He added, \u201cI am really pleased what he\u2019s done to rebuild our military, to restore our standing.&quot;<br><br>http:\/\/www.breitbart.com\/video\/2017<wbr>\/04\/19\/gop-sen-graham-im-happiest-d<wbr>ude-in-america-with-trumps-foreign-<wbr>policy-i-am-all-in\/","filename":"1480816482402","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":451,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1492640539177,"time":1492640539,"md5":"tUPYXgdk+qSy\/XeWlplH4w==","fsize":75661,"resto":121904199,"id":"urHmWUTW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121906876,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:22:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121906750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121906750<\/a>","filename":"1485772580603","ext":".png","w":1079,"h":568,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1492640550995,"time":1492640550,"md5":"1peLQ0qB5OOjwztqpvwL1A==","fsize":7492,"resto":121904199,"id":"h84gcQMD","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121906901,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:22:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121906775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121906775<\/a><br>Doesn&#039;t start for like 3 hours","time":1492640560,"resto":121904199,"id":"VdIoMrC3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121906967,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:23:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Malik knows what&#039;s up","filename":"malik","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":344,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":69,"tim":1492640590947,"time":1492640590,"md5":"nh32DdcWEUUzgqP6AYcNBQ==","fsize":49302,"resto":121904199,"id":"tlfHICa7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121906972,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:23:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"What will Trump do to end the triglyceride pay gap?","filename":"1492621053693","ext":".jpg","w":990,"h":1280,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492640592485,"time":1492640592,"md5":"d9mnxZqZSf+PrSHUrcP8sQ==","fsize":213660,"resto":121904199,"id":"mo5rKqyA","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121907005,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:23:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121906256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121906256<\/a><br>Is Watters 7 feet tall?

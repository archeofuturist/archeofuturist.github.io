The correlation with a composite of total violent crime was higher with skin color (r = .55), a more biologically influenced variable than with GDP (r = \u2212.17), a more culturally influenced variable. These results corroborate and extend those found at the international level using INTERPOL crime statistics and at the county, provincial, and state levels within countries using local statistics. We interpret the cross-cultural consistency from an evolutionary life history perspective in which hierarchically organized traits culminate in a single, heritable, super-factor. Traits need to be genetically organized to meet the trials of life\u2014survival, growth, and reproduction. We discuss brain size and the g nexus as central to understand individual and group differences and we highlight melanin and skin color as a potentially important new life history variable.<\/span>","time":1492212205,"resto":121128981,"id":"T+VJ9sCs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121131355,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:24:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121131273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121131273<\/a><br>rape, crime, std and skin color connections<br><br>http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/scienc<wbr>e\/article\/pii\/S0160289609000592<br><br>Abstract<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;National differences in murder, rape, and serious assault were examined in 113 countries in relation to national IQ, income, skin color, birth rate, life expectancy, infant mortality, and HIV\/AIDS. Data were collated from the 1993\u20131996 International Crime Statistics published by INTERPOL. Violent crime was found to be lower in countries with higher IQs, higher life expectancies, lighter skin color, and lower rates of HIV\/AIDS, although not with higher national incomes or higher rates of infant mortality. A principal components analysis found the first general factor accounted for 52% of the variance. Moreover, the correlations were significantly higher with skin color, a more biologically influenced variable, than with measures of national income, a more culturally influenced variable.

We find that higher levels of IQ are significantly correlated with lower levels of happiness inequality. This relationship is highly statistically significant even when we control for the level of economic development and a large set of control variables including economic freedom and social capital. We furthermore find suggestive evidence that economic development has a happiness equalizing effect, but this effect is, at least partially, mediated by the level of intelligence. Nations with higher levels of economic development and low IQ tend to experience less equal distribution of happiness compared to nations with higher levels of economic development and high IQ. The results are robust for a panel of 50 US states from 1972 to 2012 that uses alternative measure of intelligence from the US General Social Survey.<\/span>","time":1492212275,"resto":121128981,"id":"T+VJ9sCs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121131501,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:25:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121131067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121131067<\/a><br>Just leave.

State demographic information including the gross state product, pupil\/teacher ratio, and percent Black, Asian, and Hispanic were included in the correlational analyses. State IQ was significantly and negatively correlated with the violent crimes of murder, aggravated assault and robbery as well as the property crimes of motor vehicle theft, theft and burglary. Additionally, regression analyses were conducted for each crime significantly related to state IQ, controlling for significant state demographic variables. In general, results suggest that the prevalence of both violent and property crimes is associated with lower state IQs.<\/span>","time":1492212332,"resto":121128981,"id":"T+VJ9sCs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121131648,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:26:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121128981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121128981<\/a><br>A few rapings, slashings, gropings and murders is a small price to pay for all of this vibrant diversity.<br>I&#039;m a world citizen","filename":"1490829958929","ext":".jpg","w":5312,"h":2988,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492212397839,"time":1492212397,"md5":"l86sAYbfrwPiFjOYTCQMog==","fsize":3819410,"resto":121128981,"id":"al6U+x62","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121131655,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:26:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121128981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121128981<\/a><br>the worst thing, is they&#039;ll probably blame it on males in general with muh feminism.","time":1492212406,"resto":121128981,"id":"K6AySqx3","country":"CO","country_name":"Colombia"},{"no":121131711,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:27:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121131526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121131526<\/a><br>The association between county-level IQ and county-level crime rates<br><br>http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/scienc<wbr>e\/article\/pii\/S0160289610001340?via<wbr>%3Dihub<br>Abstract<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;An impressive body of research has revealed that individual-level IQ scores are negatively associated with criminal and delinquent involvement. Recently, this line of research has been extended to show that state-level IQ scores are associated with state-level crime rates. The current study uses this literature as a springboard to examine the potential association between county-level IQ and county-level crime rates. Analysis of data drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health revealed statistically significant and negative associations between county-level IQ and the property crime rate, the burglary rate, the larceny rate, the motor vehicle theft rate, the violent crime rate, the robbery rate, and the aggravated assault rate. Additional analyses revealed that these associations were not confounded by a measure of concentrated disadvantage that captures the effects of race, poverty, and other social disadvantages of the county. We discuss the implications of the results and note the limitations of the study.<\/span>","time":1492212441,"resto":121128981,"id":"T+VJ9sCs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121131733,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:27:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121128981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121128981<\/a>","filename":"stoptheblacks","ext":".png","w":555,"h":718,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492212453046,"time":1492212453,"md5":"NKI5pEVwZDdJshhuXXw9lQ==","fsize":107481,"resto":121128981,"id":"vYBpGP18","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121131824,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:28:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121128981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121128981<\/a><br>Bump for visibility.","time":1492212505,"resto":121128981,"id":"ZyPOZkSL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121131852,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:28:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121128981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121128981<\/a><br>she relaxed","time":1492212519,"resto":121128981,"id":"RL4Xc5wZ","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":121131860,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:28:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121131711\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121131711<\/a><br>Crime stats","filename":"1488008505329","ext":".png","w":1370,"h":3313,"tn_w":51,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492212522269,"time":1492212522,"md5":"AFXK+0RFZxej774UzMg\/Ig==","fsize":264746,"resto":121128981,"id":"T+VJ9sCs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121131946,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:29:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121131860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121131860<\/a><br>thank you for your posts anon","time":1492212560,"resto":121128981,"id":"e1EQkqei","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121131999,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:29:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1492212583,"resto":121128981,"id":"Ru695SCg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121132018,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:29:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;white girl<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jewish<\/span><br><br>hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm<wbr>mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm<wbr>mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm<wbr>mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm<wbr>mmmmmmmmmmmmm","time":1492212594,"resto":121128981,"id":"KLeg4Lds","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

The view out his front window, unlike Aziz himself, had gotten brighter and newer over the two decades he&#039;d owned the pawnshop. Old brownstones had aged and crumbled, then been demolished and partially replaced with bright yellow brick apartment homes, and three years ago those had given way to a &quot;modern living and shopping space,&quot; a six-story blue glass and chrome monster that sprawled across two city blocks. The Upper Devos Homeporium (a development of the Vorvarts group) had assured the merchants in the area &quot;increased foot traffic in your neighborhood, bringing more business and property value to the area,&quot; and Aziz along with the others on the Upper Devos Business Council had voted to approve the development.

Aziz&#039;s business had fallen off; few of these people were hard up enough to have to pawn their possessions, or interested in buying someone else&#039;s memories. If he hadn&#039;t expanded into online sales years ago, he would have had to close this shop.

He&#039;d run into married male couples before, and they always made him feel wary but with a vertiginous fascination. Of course, sexual contact with males was haraam, but the couples he knew weren&#039;t Muslim. Normally when he encountered a non-Muslim eating pork, for example, or drinking alcohol, or even cheating at cards, he felt only a sense of being other, and not one that bothered him. But back in his home country of Madiyah, homosexual behavior was punishable by death, often brutal and public. This had been an immutable fact of Aziz&#039;s life until he was past twenty and stepping off a plane in the States.<br>Here he had found a different world. He read the newspapers and watched the increasing acceptance of gay people and couples with the memory of his uncle&#039;s flight always in his mind. And so, perhaps, he did not look for those people and couples in his everyday life. When the two female fennec foxes who owned the organic grocery store down the block had announced their marriage, he&#039;d been surprised. &quot;You didn&#039;t know they were a couple?&quot; Halifa had said with amusement, and Aziz had responded stiffly that he didn&#039;t look for such things.

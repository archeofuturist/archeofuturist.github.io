There has defineately been a big push lately to associate flat earth with truthers and conspiracy theorists. It seems obvious that it&#039;s designed to make any persons advocating legit credible theories (like jfks assassination for example) with bash it crazy flat earthers to make them seem less credible, so any laypersons would be less likely to listen to what they have to say. And yet I see so many youtubers pushing the flat earth thing so hard. It&#039;s disturbing to say the least.","time":1492814764,"resto":122196755,"id":"RISTDuFk","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122197629,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:48:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122197385\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122197385<\/a><br>yeah it feels forced and something that would be a topic for a long time if it was true. <br>and the amount of spy-ops lately have not been small.","time":1492814887,"resto":122196755,"id":"leeqox+i","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122197800,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:49:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump, i need answers","time":1492814986,"resto":122196755,"id":"leeqox+i","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122198146,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:52:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122196934\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122196934<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i cant find any evidence that kills the theory <\/span><br>Look at a globe model, now imagine you are a boat captain circumnavigating the Antarctic, so you put the coast on the left side of your boat and set sail.

I&#039;ll tell you the VAST majority of homeless men fall into this group. However a sizeable portion of them got onto the streets from dumb luck (no.1), instead of working hard to get off the streets they settled into life on the streets, and part of that life is alchohol and\/or drugs. <br>-what&#039;s amazing is how many of these people are happy with their lives on the streets.<br>-they all have foodstamps, which they usually sell for booze\/drugs or a few nights in an inn a month, sometimes all of the above.<br>-Even if you sober them up, they probably will go back to life on the streets as they could never and never want to hold a job<br>-the most violent and filthy homeless people are in this group. You can spot them panhandling if they look like they sleep in a dumpster. People in group 1 and 3 keep themselves cleaner.<br><br>3. Cripples\/Mentally Ill\/Abused -&gt; most of the women fall into this group eventually, then a few years later are part of group 2 instead.

Example: I go a week of eating healthy\/lifting. I gradually get stressed out about this throughout the week. On my weekend I allow myself the &quot;reward&quot; of gorging myself on pizza donuts and ice cream. Afterwards instead of feeling happier\/less stressed I actually feel let down and depressed.<br><br>If my goals are things like: go to college, get fit, effectively use my time, create art, then why are my dopaminergic reward systems not tied to those goals, and are instead associating that behavior with stress or anxiety? I TRULY want those things. I truly want to be that person. So why are my emotions not tied into those things the way you would expect? Does my brain require more time to rewire itself? I don&#039;t understand why my brain is associating the things I actually want in life with negativity. Does part of me not believe I can actually DO it, and therefore has a sort of phobia associated with positive behavior?","filename":"jordan peterson","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":168,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493872604317,"time":1493872604,"md5":"I0iS+q+p8+t5U9PxFNovnQ==","fsize":6353,"resto":0,"id":"yqWJZabi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-last-few-weeks-since-i-started-watching","country_name":"United States","replies":60,"images":7,"unique_ips":39},{"no":124019395,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:39:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"reward days are for middle-aged women","time":1493872780,"resto":124019134,"id":"gU3gHkfP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124019661,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:42:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124019134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124019134<\/a><br><br>Nice blog","time":1493872948,"resto":124019134,"id":"YmANDeWc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124020356,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:48:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124019134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124019134<\/a><br>Your brain is mad that all your goals are to reward society instead of yourself.","time":1493873335,"resto":124019134,"id":"PGKYZP\/C","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124020436,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:49:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"He addresses this issue in his lectures on personality.<br>He specifically says that your dopamine circuits will defeat your own will in many cases, this is why addiction exists.

You have to make a deliberate effort for that to happen. Start with basic conditioning, every time you do something that advances your goals, reward yourself with something nice. Reserve that reward just for this purpose. If you fail to take action or sabotage your own goals, punish yourself. Any punishment will do, throw away money, eat something you hate, ask someone to punch you in the stomach. Do this consistently. <br><br>The next step is to modify your patterns of thinking. First you need to rationalize why you want what you want and why you are doing what you are doing. The best way to approach this is through self-authoring exercices. Write about your past experiences, write about your present feelings, write about various future scenarios. There&#039;s a very high chance your views and goals will change during this process. Learning about yourself is an ongoing exercise, you never really stop doing it, but it&#039;s the only way to build pull motivation (when you can&#039;t help but want to work on something at all times) instead of push motivation (brief spurts of effort like the one you described working out).","time":1493876534,"resto":124019134,"id":"Vv41gLKb","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":124026101,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:44:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124025233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124025233<\/a><br>and? if you&#039;re a black man born in America you will be lucky to see 65.

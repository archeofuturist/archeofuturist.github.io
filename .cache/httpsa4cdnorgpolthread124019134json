Example: I go a week of eating healthy\/lifting. I gradually get stressed out about this throughout the week. On my weekend I allow myself the &quot;reward&quot; of gorging myself on pizza donuts and ice cream. Afterwards instead of feeling happier\/less stressed I actually feel let down and depressed.<br><br>If my goals are things like: go to college, get fit, effectively use my time, create art, then why are my dopaminergic reward systems not tied to those goals, and are instead associating that behavior with stress or anxiety? I TRULY want those things. I truly want to be that person. So why are my emotions not tied into those things the way you would expect? Does my brain require more time to rewire itself? I don&#039;t understand why my brain is associating the things I actually want in life with negativity. Does part of me not believe I can actually DO it, and therefore has a sort of phobia associated with positive behavior?","filename":"jordan peterson","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":168,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493872604317,"time":1493872604,"md5":"I0iS+q+p8+t5U9PxFNovnQ==","fsize":6353,"resto":0,"id":"yqWJZabi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-last-few-weeks-since-i-started-watching","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":124019395,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:39:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"reward days are for middle-aged women","time":1493872780,"resto":124019134,"id":"gU3gHkfP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124019661,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:42:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124019134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124019134<\/a><br><br>Nice blog","time":1493872948,"resto":124019134,"id":"YmANDeWc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

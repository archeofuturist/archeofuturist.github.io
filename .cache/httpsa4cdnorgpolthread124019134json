Example: I go a week of eating healthy\/lifting. I gradually get stressed out about this throughout the week. On my weekend I allow myself the &quot;reward&quot; of gorging myself on pizza donuts and ice cream. Afterwards instead of feeling happier\/less stressed I actually feel let down and depressed.<br><br>If my goals are things like: go to college, get fit, effectively use my time, create art, then why are my dopaminergic reward systems not tied to those goals, and are instead associating that behavior with stress or anxiety? I TRULY want those things. I truly want to be that person. So why are my emotions not tied into those things the way you would expect? Does my brain require more time to rewire itself? I don&#039;t understand why my brain is associating the things I actually want in life with negativity. Does part of me not believe I can actually DO it, and therefore has a sort of phobia associated with positive behavior?","filename":"jordan peterson","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":168,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493872604317,"time":1493872604,"md5":"I0iS+q+p8+t5U9PxFNovnQ==","fsize":6353,"resto":0,"id":"yqWJZabi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-last-few-weeks-since-i-started-watching","country_name":"United States","replies":139,"images":18,"unique_ips":81,"tail_size":50},{"no":124019395,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:39:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"reward days are for middle-aged women","time":1493872780,"resto":124019134,"id":"gU3gHkfP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124019661,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:42:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124019134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124019134<\/a><br><br>Nice blog","time":1493872948,"resto":124019134,"id":"YmANDeWc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124020356,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:48:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124019134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124019134<\/a><br>Your brain is mad that all your goals are to reward society instead of yourself.","time":1493873335,"resto":124019134,"id":"PGKYZP\/C","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124020436,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:49:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"He addresses this issue in his lectures on personality.<br>He specifically says that your dopamine circuits will defeat your own will in many cases, this is why addiction exists.

You have to make a deliberate effort for that to happen. Start with basic conditioning, every time you do something that advances your goals, reward yourself with something nice. Reserve that reward just for this purpose. If you fail to take action or sabotage your own goals, punish yourself. Any punishment will do, throw away money, eat something you hate, ask someone to punch you in the stomach. Do this consistently. <br><br>The next step is to modify your patterns of thinking. First you need to rationalize why you want what you want and why you are doing what you are doing. The best way to approach this is through self-authoring exercices. Write about your past experiences, write about your present feelings, write about various future scenarios. There&#039;s a very high chance your views and goals will change during this process. Learning about yourself is an ongoing exercise, you never really stop doing it, but it&#039;s the only way to build pull motivation (when you can&#039;t help but want to work on something at all times) instead of push motivation (brief spurts of effort like the one you described working out).","time":1493876534,"resto":124019134,"id":"Vv41gLKb","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":124026101,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:44:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124025233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124025233<\/a><br>and? if you&#039;re a black man born in America you will be lucky to see 65.

We aren&#039;t biologically equipped to deal with it. Ever wonder why cuckoldry has become so popular nowadays? Think about it. Masturbating to porn (watching another man, fuck the woman you&#039;re fantasizing about) is creating that sexual connection in your mind. Each different type of porn (each different &quot;fetish&quot;) creates a corresponding kink. Kinks aren&#039;t normal or healthy. I realized for example, that I had premature ejaculation issues because I always masturbated to pictures of women, so I had trained myself to orgasm just at the sight of a nude woman, so I was practically cumming just at the sight of my girlfriend nude. <br><br>There are so many different &quot;kinks&quot;, and I don&#039;t think anyone has deeply delved into the deep psychological effects of training yourself to orgasm to different types of stimulus, but the effects seem to be pretty profound, and we know almost nothing about it. Pornography in general isn&#039;t natural. We&#039;re playing with a deep rooted, extremely important part of our psyche every time we engage.","time":1493890828,"resto":124019134,"id":"kMrDCrQj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124043727,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)05:45:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124042799\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124042799<\/a><br>yeah, but they don&#039;t seem to have any of the sting that &quot;racist&quot; &quot;sexist&quot; &quot;bigot&quot; have. people aren&#039;t really called &quot;traitor&quot; or &quot;unpatriotic&quot; as a term of abuse here - it sounds weird to most probably<br>we don&#039;t have much of a religious right or neocons the way the US had\/has - our conservative politicians have always been to the left of their Democrat politicians in every case, so we naturally have much less of that.<br>using negative labels as a tactic to avoid debating ideas entirely is in my political sphere, currently an entirely left-wing phenomenon.","time":1493891110,"resto":124019134,"id":"GjHoMRBS","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124043733,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)05:45:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124037540\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124037540<\/a><br>if you recognize that you are weak, worthless, stupid, embarrassing, etc, and you hate yourself enough, then it&#039;s time to change. start by making small changes, like going for a 20 minute walk every day before breakfast or setting the alarm clock at 15.00 every day and stop playing videogames or whatever you were doing for a full hour. find something that you can do that you have never done: bake bread, learn weird knots, play with legos, it doesnt matter if you are terrible at it, just spend some time every day doing things that you never do. change your life one small step at a time.<br><br>its very important to recognize that you are in a terrible situation and its because you are shit. you won&#039;t get out of it by a miracle, it will take years and you will never get completely fixed, but you must walk towards the light, even if its slow and painful. otherwise, what will your life be in 5 years?","time":1493891114,"resto":124019134,"id":"OhmxAOiD","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":124043742,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)05:45:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124043022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124043022<\/a><br>He talks about it a lot.

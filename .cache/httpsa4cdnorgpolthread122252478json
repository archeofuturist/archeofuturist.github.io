Without guns how does one defend themselves from the tyranny of the government. Or to a lesser degree, the darkies that may or may not frequent your cities. This is coming from an anon who owns guns but in my state is not allowed to carry unless your an ex-president or something to a ridiculous degree. Yes, burger status here. My question is basically if you carry or feel the need to carry weapons besides your fisticufs when you are out and about on your travels what are you packing and how do you feel about what or what doe government allows you to carry? <br><br>These are a few of mine, which get a bit tiresome to carry all at once.","filename":"weapons2","ext":".jpg","w":1604,"h":1037,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":161,"tim":1492847563620,"time":1492847563,"md5":"CFVbpSqtRzd1buNDgp8Fgg==","fsize":435051,"resto":0,"id":"NGSfJL0h","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-antigun-country-polfags-defnd-themselves","country_name":"United States","replies":24,"images":6,"unique_ips":17},{"no":122253204,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:04:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122252478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122252478<\/a><br>We have fairy bread","filename":"Aussie Bogan cookie","ext":".jpg","w":525,"h":350,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492848276421,"time":1492848276,"md5":"s69u6cVTRfBj72HVGD3cGg==","fsize":49995,"resto":122252478,"id":"9DRXVq6H","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122253288,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:06:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122252478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122252478<\/a><br>tfw when everything in that photo is illegal in this country","time":1492848364,"resto":122252478,"id":"Mnt8kLND","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122253931,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:16:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122252478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122252478<\/a>","filename":"1489859336773","ext":".jpg","w":460,"h":500,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492848961481,"time":1492848961,"md5":"KvGAbKTAYdF1agXhIolISQ==","fsize":55049,"resto":122252478,"id":"py7oVpZa","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":122253975,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:16:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122253288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122253288<\/a><br>that&#039;s what you get when you don&#039;t tell King George to get fucked","filename":"spare bedroom","ext":".jpg","w":3072,"h":2304,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492849003343,"time":1492849003,"md5":"svfAHXAkpF+fsI57sy3e+w==","fsize":737943,"resto":122252478,"id":"0jyh\/kgV","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122254050,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:17:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"machete, knife, some baseball clubs.","time":1492849072,"resto":122252478,"id":"wD3C9CCw","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":122254089,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:18:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"t.

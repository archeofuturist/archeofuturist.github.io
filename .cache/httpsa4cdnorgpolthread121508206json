If you can get a downright traditional girl who is close to her family you should be fine, but everyone that I have met here in the States from Lithuania is mostly nutso. They are either crazy materialistic, vain, or domineering in a very controlling way and only really mellow out once they hit their 50s or so. If they have kids they tend to mellow out earlier but that itself becomes an icy river to cross using a 50 ton truck. Obviously not all of the girls are that nuts and there are good ones that make excellent mothers, but you&#039;re mostly going to find the crazy ones who are just after your money.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What are Lithuanian people in general like?<\/span><br>Depressed and constantly drinking, at least in Lithuania itself. The youth are constantly moving out or studying abroad because the pay is at least double what you&#039;d get if you sat in Lithuania and it would be in a far more city-oriented environment. In the States most of the ones I&#039;ve met that come from Lithuania are spoiled rotten or vain. Half American\/Lithuanians are really a mixed bag as well, you can get some real basket cases at times.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thinking of getting the fuck out of 60%land.<\/span><br>Are you going to be a farmer and speak exclusively Lithuanian or be a professional translator? Because if not then you&#039;re an idiot, the amount of job prospects and money you would make doing even minimum wage work here in the States is a better prospect than most of what you could get over there. Pretty much all of my Lithuanian relatives are farmers or welders of some sort, and the few that aren&#039;t are abroad in the UK or America studying and eventually planning to take up permanent residence there.","time":1492426414,"resto":121508206,"id":"ISm3Vnni","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121512112,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)06:53:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121512010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121512010<\/a><br>You can chose to study second foreign language in like 5th grade between German\/Russian sometimes French, most kids chose Russian because their parents can do homework for them.","time":1492426414,"resto":121508206,"id":"PSps9oQk","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":121512179,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)06:54:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121508206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121508206<\/a><br>muh heritage<br>i&#039;m 1\/56 cherokee<br>1\/64 iroquois<br>1\/49 algonquin","time":1492426465,"resto":121508206,"id":"7j5TL2wn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121512242,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)06:55:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121512010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121512010<\/a><br>Only when helping nazi","time":1492426508,"resto":121508206,"id":"8dWSzD0M","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":121512264,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)06:55:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121511739\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121511739<\/a><br>Is this a pasta?","time":1492426524,"resto":121508206,"id":"UtVEuk\/L","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":121512265,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)06:55:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121512099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121512099<\/a><br>this is 4chan you moron, you argue over everything here<br>go somewhere else if you want meaningful conversation","time":1492426525,"resto":121508206,"id":"IFX\/Pgiq","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121512395,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)06:57:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121512110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121512110<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;farmers or welders of some sort<\/span><br><br><br>While I agree with most of what you&#039;ve said, your relatives aren&#039;t exactly the smartest bunch if they best they could do is get trade school tier education.","time":1492426622,"resto":121508206,"id":"PSps9oQk","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":121512463,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)06:57:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121511448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121511448<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ignoring common sense<\/span><br>wew","filename":"\u0421\u043d\u0438\u043c\u043e\u043a3","ext":".png","w":1059,"h":315,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":37,"tim":1492426676157,"time":1492426676,"md5":"49MwdKenKRWy1gQch5VBJw==","fsize":29307,"resto":121508206,"id":"LCdGqRig","country":"BY","country_name":"Belarus"},{"no":121512515,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)06:58:33","name":"\u25b6","com":"<a href=\"#p121512265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121512265<\/a><br>Jesus I just don&#039;t understand the interest you Eastern Europeans show in petty bantzing over shit like roads.

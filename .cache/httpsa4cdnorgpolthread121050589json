He also has a facebook account (as Wira Thu) where he is shitposting, for example a photo of a toilet bowl with muslim books inside. <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=v4r<wbr>vtnTThq0<br><br>On a sidenote, isn&#039;t it interesting that monasticism has only been developed in Europe and east Asia?

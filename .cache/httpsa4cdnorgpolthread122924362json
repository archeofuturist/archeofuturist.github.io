Compare that to the Russian or Chinese elite and you see far fewer pedo related things.

Very small groups that limit how many can climb to the top to stop overcrowding.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He mentions that deals would happen with every group, and they were all dirty, secret services included were criminal organizations that also dealt in people.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What led to his exit from this world was an experience at a satanist &#039;or luciferian&#039; church where they were practicing child sacrifice, and he was asked to take part. He said he couldn&#039;t do it, and had to refuse some of his future jobs as a result since it involved children, and that made him problematic.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He was able to get out, but was tortured physically by other members of the circle as a warning not to ever expose anyone else within the circle. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He talks about waking up in the intensive care unit, and having visions of seeing the doctors working on his body. And that he realized his body was a vessel in some way, and not his actual self. <\/span><br><br>Take the last bit how you will, but that&#039;s the summary. Lots of dirty money at the top, no naming names of anyone in the circle. <br><br>Oh and another part I forgot,conflicts are entirely known to everyone in the circle, and they&#039;re all on the same side regardless of who they&#039;re providing for. Also what you see on the news is usually to spin people in the wrong, or a completely unknown direction, even if whats happening is a result of one of their deals.

The past couple of years have been shit, Im barely making around $100k, but Im STILL forced to pay her $11k a month because of my income that one year and total assets. And we didnt even have kids, She is now unemployed and living the grand life with my money and has been living with the same guy for 4 years (I am convinced the only reason they havent married is because I wouldnt have to pay her anymore) and i have been trying to get the alimony reduced or thrown out, but the dried-up cunt kike judge is refusing to take into account that my income has changed. Meanwhile, my ex-wife has already brought and is renting out THREE houses even though she doesnt have a job, ALL with my money, and somehow she still needs my payment to &quot;maintain her lifestyle.&quot; We dont even have kids together either.<br><br>Why is this allowed in Burgerland?","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":780,"h":438,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493497068752,"time":1493497068,"md5":"To3L5T4oLA+V5edBM4QhcQ==","fsize":35527,"resto":0,"id":"EaGiN9v\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-to-fix-the-alimony-problem","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":1,"unique_ips":11},{"no":123375988,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)16:18:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123375880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123375880<\/a><br>uhhh maybe stop hating women?","time":1493497115,"resto":123375880,"id":"Zkmw6c5w","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":123376138,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)16:19:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123375880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123375880<\/a><br>Plant drugs on her and call the cops on her.","time":1493497185,"resto":123375880,"id":"IuDK2Po1","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123376141,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)16:19:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123375880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123375880<\/a><br>Topkek.

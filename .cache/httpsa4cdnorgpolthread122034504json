They are spiritual obstacles receiving their existence from God only in an external, rather than internal manner. Divinity in Judaism connotes revelation of God&#039;s true unity, while the shells conceal holiness, as a peel conceals the fruit within. They are therefore synonymous with idolatry, the root of impurity through ascribing false dualism in the Divine, and with the Sitra Achra (\u05e1\u05d8\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d0 &quot;Other Side&quot;), the perceived realm opposite to holiness. They emerge in the descending Seder hishtalshelus (Chain of Being) through Tzimtzum (contraction of the Divine Ohr), as part of the purpose of Creation. In this they also have beneficial properties, as peel protects the fruit, restraining the Divine flow from being dissipated. Kabbalah distinguishes between two realms in Kelipot, the completely impure and the intermediate.","filename":"thereitis","ext":".jpg","w":405,"h":597,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492736486460,"time":1492736486,"md5":"xnL7MFSdxMypUeKd\/lToJA==","fsize":148579,"resto":122034504,"id":"QPgMovxP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122073173,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:01:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122073002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122073002<\/a><br>belief is a tool.","filename":"1490409786872","ext":".jpg","w":265,"h":249,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1492736508402,"time":1492736508,"md5":"rHmP488p7yCEGqrX8U7RNA==","fsize":46849,"resto":122034504,"id":"BPYQEil1","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122073319,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:03:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122073173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122073173<\/a><br>A Jewish tool?","time":1492736587,"resto":122034504,"id":"Zd0ew1mp","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122073413,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:04:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122073137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122073137<\/a><br><br>Final destination.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;God-ammit<\/span><br><br>The ancient Egyptian goddess Ammit (also known as Ammut and Ahemait) was the personification of divine retribution.

Based solely on my personal experience and the interaction with others I believe that Alcoholism\/ addiction is a final result of some deeper character flaw that needs to be acknowledged and brought to light. Calling it a disease is a technicality - addiction often times ends in decreasing health and\/ or death. They call it a disease so that we stop beating ourselves up during early recovery. This takes the power to change out of my hands and gives it to a higher power, home group, sponsor, etc. i do not have a disease that makes me drink.","time":1493863293,"resto":123999631,"id":"hpV\/N4qa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124002073,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:06:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Addiction is a symptom of our current world order . with the reality of life its not suprising people want to get high and stay there lol really","time":1493863603,"resto":123999631,"id":"QE2o4S0+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124002764,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:12:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123999631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123999631<\/a><br>In most cases people under extreme stress or depression turn to drugs to the point of addiction.<br>So in most cases it&#039;s but a symptone of an underlying illness caused by a harmful enviroment.<br>A small portion gets addicted for shits and giggles, and their disease could be called idiocy.","time":1493863963,"resto":123999631,"id":"EE04BK2\/","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":124002961,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:14:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123999631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123999631<\/a><br>I guess, but even if it was it is a self-inflicted disease.

Id agree with you if this has only been happening for only a few decades, but now its been going for so long that Its probably ingrained in our culture. Theres a good chance that this trend will continue for another few decades. Its already predicted that 40 percent of women born after 1990 will never get married. Each decade, the marriage rate decreases by 7 to 10 percent. If this continue, I dont think we&#039;d have wait for the 2100s to see the collapse of the institution marriage. By the 2050s, the majority of women in the west will probably die alone. Unless we reverse the whatever triggered this marriage crisis, which I doubt we could, it looks like we are entering the post marriage era,","time":1491297353,"resto":119449257,"id":"\/wLkyJQL","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119453249,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)05:47:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119449257\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119449257<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not replacing the ovarian jew with the iron womb<\/span><br>Simple evolution, really.<br>A shitstorm is brewing, and females will pay the price of all their bullshit.

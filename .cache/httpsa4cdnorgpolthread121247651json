But in their haste to build a firewall between social justice and corporate capitalism, Pepsi\u2019s haters have missed the ways in which the two are not merely compatible, but in many ways mutually reinforcing.<\/span><br>More Woke Than Coke<br>Flashback to 1940, just a couple years after Walter S. Mack Jr. assumed the reins as CEO of Pepsi-Cola Company. At the time, Pepsi was struggling in the shadow of the Coca-Cola behemoth, whose sales outnumbered Pepsi\u2019s twenty-five to one. But Mack, who described himself as \u201can unrepentant capitalist and a liberal,\u201d was up for a fight.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the pre-civil rights era, companies like Coca-Cola systematically refrained from advertising to African-American populations. Mack\u2019s insight was to see this as an opportunity, not just to make money, but to break down barriers. Risking a backlash from white conservatives, he built an all-black team of sales representatives who traveled across the country, often riding on segregated trains or in private cars that shielded them from harassment.<\/span>","time":1492285436,"resto":121247651,"id":"d\/5cKpuo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121250765,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)15:46:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121247651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121247651<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This insight is the inspiration for the Twitter hashtag #NLSJ, or \u201cNeoliberal Social Justice.\u201d One part tongue-in-cheek, one part utterly serious, #NLSJ is a small but growing movement of people who have embraced social justice as the telos of commercial culture and global capitalism, and the corporate aesthetic that comes with it.<\/span><br>Lol","filename":"IMG_6476","ext":".jpg","w":462,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1492285605162,"time":1492285605,"md5":"2g8hnI4qEPIGD2i0zRi+nw==","fsize":43833,"resto":121247651,"id":"pntst2XQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121251142,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)15:49:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121247651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121247651<\/a><br>Obviously capitalism is the biggest promoter of SJW and multiculturalism and open borders.","time":1492285773,"resto":121247651,"id":"J5yYa0r5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121251189,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)15:49:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121250765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121250765<\/a><br>Das it mane","time":1492285795,"resto":121247651,"id":"d\/5cKpuo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121251373,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)15:51:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121247651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121247651<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;capitalism facilitates SJW horseshit<\/span><br>No it doesn&#039;t <br><br>http:\/\/io9.gizmodo.com\/marvel-vp-bl<wbr>ames-women-and-diversity-for-sales-<wbr>slump-1793921500<br><br>https:\/\/www.thecollegefix.com\/post\/<wbr>32003\/<br><br>http:\/\/www.ibtimes.com\/mass-effect-<wbr>andromeda-news-bad-reviews-reflect-<wbr>bioware-bro-culture-says-former-dev<wbr>-2513917<br><br>http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/entertainmen<wbr>t\/2017\/03\/15\/amy-schumers-netflix-s<wbr>pecial-slammed-by-viewers.html","time":1492285879,"resto":121247651,"id":"pntst2XQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121251536,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)15:52:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121247651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121247651<\/a><br><br>Capitalism promotes tranny-ism, too.","filename":"dove-tranny","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492285952955,"time":1492285952,"md5":"SI0ClpDzFHImzBTaPnJ+EA==","fsize":23188,"resto":121247651,"id":"d+6RGpCM","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121251627,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)15:53:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121251373\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121251373<\/a><br><br>Than why did communist countries have much better cultural values than western nations? <br><br>Truth is the Capitalists will betray there own race if they can make a nickel more.","time":1492285991,"resto":121247651,"id":"xP+RBDGf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121252165,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)15:57:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121251142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121251142<\/a><br>It really is.

Their latest Generations event will put some of the classic (largely white and male) characters back into circulation, and they think this will solve the problem. While it may result in boosted sales, at least for a little while, it will come at a cost. It again bloats the market, which has been Marvel\u2019s biggest problem for awhile, and it runs the risk of alienating newer fans who came in precisely because Marvel was taking risks. Bringing back older characters doesn\u2019t inspire confidence that Marvel cares about continuing the newer ones. Marvel Comics have a lot of problems. Diversity is just the easiest one to blame.<\/span><br>2nd link:<br>lol so a few dorms get shut down over major SJW disruptions? Its&#039; not like the uni is shutting down. SJWs are a byproduct of Capitalism and Capitalism is eating itself.<br>From the 3rd link:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It\u2019s also worth recalling that some key departures from the Mass Effect: Andromeda team are well documented. At the end of 2015, studio development director Chris Wynn left the company. He was followed by writer Chris Schlerf the following February. Schlerf had only been involved with Andromeda for about four months before calling it quits. Senior editor Cameron Harris said goodbye to all of gaming last April. Cycling of employees is common in the games industry, but it\u2019s symptomatic of bigger problems when it\u2019s happening to higher-ups in the middle of a massive endeavor.<\/span><br>While the extent of BioWare\u2019s apparent disorganization is unknown, the reviews of Mass Effect: Andromeda aren\u2019t exactly a reflection of unity. The game has an average rating of 75 on Metacritic, and the title\u2019s odd facial animations reached meme status hours after an early access preview went live last week.<br>4th:<br><span

The chap would sooner throw money down the drain than lend it to a \u2018friend\u2019, even though his interest and capital were guaranteed. In this he bases himself on the view that he ought to live the life of a Jewish baron, or Jew created a baron (no doubt by the countess). Just imagine! This fellow, knowing about the American affair, etc., and hence about the state of crisis I\u2019m in, had the insolence to ask me whether I would be willing to hand over one of my daughters to la Hatzfeldt as a \u2018companion\u2019, and whether he himself should secure Gerstenberg\u2019s (!) patronage for me! The fellow has wasted my time and, what is more, the dolt opined that, since I was not engaged upon any \u2018business\u2019 just now, but merely upon a \u2018theoretical work\u2019, I might just as well kill time with him!

Lassalle had him conjure 300,000 men out of thin air \u2014 with whom, of course, the Piedmontese army joined forces. And then, in accordance with a plan approved, so he says, by Mr R\u00fcstow, a detached corps was to make, or rather set sail, for the Adriatic coast (Dalmatia) and incite Hungary to revolt, while, heedless of the Quadrilateral, the main body of the army under Garibaldi marched from Padua to Vienna, where the population instantly rebelled. All over in 6 weeks. The fulcrum of the action \u2014 Lassalle\u2019s political influence, or his pen, in Berlin. And R\u00fcstow at the head of a corps of German volunteers attached to Garibaldi.

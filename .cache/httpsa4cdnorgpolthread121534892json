Are you worried about Venezuela being a socialist shithole? Ataturk&#039;s modernisation was a failed attempt to integrate Turkey into Europe. A century later they are still islamic, poor, backwards and corrupt so why pretend they should keep on trying? A quick trip between the Greek and Turkish sides of Cyprus is the best lesson on why they aren&#039;t and never will be Europeans.","time":1492441475,"resto":121534892,"id":"+3mDqKVA","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121535628,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:06:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121535456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121535456<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Secular rule never works with muzzies<\/span><br><br>it worked for albania","time":1492441581,"resto":121534892,"id":"O63SKMj3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121535774,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:07:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121534892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121534892<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is there a person on earth with less of a spine than this cunt?<\/span><br>I don&#039;t think so.<br><br><br><a href=\"#p121535628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121535628<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Albania<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;working<\/span>","time":1492441672,"resto":121534892,"id":"rYOTrrq1","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121535904,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:08:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121535628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121535628<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it worked for albania<\/span><br>Yeah it &quot;worked&quot; for Turkey too and look at what&#039;s happened.<br><br><a href=\"#p121534892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121534892<\/a><br>Mutti should be flogged.","time":1492441734,"resto":121534892,"id":"IltCpsM2","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121535961,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:09:33","name":"T.O.A.N.","com":"<a href=\"#p121534892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121534892<\/a><br><br>So that means she&#039;s going to go, come the election... right???","time":1492441773,"resto":121534892,"id":"5lk9jHnX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121536157,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:11:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121534892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121534892<\/a><br>Yeah well, every country gets the leader it deserves.

Klocke denied the allegation and claimed that the student had made unwelcome sexual advances toward him. After denying the student\u2019s advances, Klocke claimed that the student became hostile. Klocke claimed that he grew concerned that the student would file a report against him for sexual harassment, and his prediction proved true. The student submitted a formal complaint to the university claiming that Klocke had called him a \u201cfaggot,\u201d and that he had threatened to kill him.<br><br>According to Ashe Schow of the Texas Bureau Watchdog, the accuser sought assistance from Associate Vice President of Student Affairs Heather Snow, an administrator with whom he had a friendly relationship.

That one actor was right when he said it&#039;s like 30s Germany, referring to how liberals are acting. The physically attack, publicly shun, ban, and intensely hate anyone who likes President Trump or who thinks different than their radical progressive agenda. Sure, conservatives didn&#039;t like Obama, no problem with that, but conservatives didn&#039;t act like this at all towards Obama supporters, or even Hillary supporters. Antifa are fascists (you know what I mean, authoritarian, not its strict definition). A lot of these deranged people would not help a Trump supporter if they were dying on the side of a street, meanwhile a Trump supporter would help a liberal that is. What&#039;s worse is that radical liberals have infiltrated academia\/education and are brainwashing people to think their intolerant way. Educators should promote the diversity of ideas and opinions, and healthy debate. Instead, they indoctrinate and ban differing views.

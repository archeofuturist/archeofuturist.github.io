Most religious texts can be debunked in a number of ways. However, thus far, all we&#039;ve done is offer an &quot;origin story&quot; that&#039;s closer to reality.<br><br>But origin stories aren&#039;t the sole purpose of the Church, or really, even the main one.<br><br>The Church, in any form its taken in human society, has served to regulate culture and behavior in ways that Government can&#039;t. Take something like the views on premarital sex in Abrahamic religions. <br><br>Objectively, &quot;No sex until marriage&quot; is the most optimal way for a society to treat sexuality. Previous partner count is predictive of likelihood to cheat and divorce. Those things undermine the family unit, tank birthrates and lead to increases in single motherhood. All of those consequences are extraordinarily dangerous for ANY society.<br><br>The reason I left the church, aside from it not making much sense, was the fact that it couldn&#039;t enforce its own doctrines any more; however, I&#039;m beginning to come to the realization that most people aren&#039;t perfectly rational capable of looking at data and adjusting their behavior.<br><br>Is there any way for Atheism to have a cultural &amp; behavioral regulatory agency outside of the State itself? How do you propose to go about it? Are we just doomed to deal with the poor choices of people who wanted to tear down morality and replace it with nothing but nihilistic hedonism?<br><br>Additionally, with the dismal state of Atheism (Atheism+ etc.) are we better off just going back into the closet and trying to join hardline churches?","filename":"FedoraSymbol","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":1000,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490472309079,"time":1490472309,"md5":"t5hsstNyt4sgdrIhhTWXQA==","fsize":209833,"resto":0,"id":"okj50nq+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-to-the-other-atheists-on-this-board-i-have-a","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

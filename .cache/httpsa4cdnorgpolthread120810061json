Conquest. How any European Empire was started or any empire for that matter. However, after the Anschluss, Austria was from then on part of what the Germans called Gro\u00dfdeutschland. <br><br>The territories in dark red were annexed by Germany and considered part of Germany. Half of Poland was invaded. I am not saying Poland was a Nazi State, however, all ethnic Germans in Europe except those in Sud Tirol were annexed into the German empire, even if that meant conquering some Slavs. <br><br>You seem to have a problem with the German peoples being united. I personally think it is a great thing that needs to happen again and you need not to let cuckery and multikulti rule the roost. Yeah the Nazi shit happened, but it&#039;s only frowned upon because you lost. Not saying I agree with it whole heartedly, I don&#039;t, but it shouldn&#039;t define the entire future course of your nation. I do like the Idea of a united German nation across Europe that is not ashamed of who they are.","time":1492041520,"resto":120810061,"id":"sZoTaTyN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120833539,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)19:58:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120833133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120833133<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;violent yanks<\/span><br>Hahahaha yes I&#039;m sure you get real violent in your beer pong basement parties.

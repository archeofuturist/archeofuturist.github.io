A thousand signs tell us; but it suffices to recall the Apocalypse of John, the most wanton of all literary outbursts that vengefulness has on its conscience.

For the Romans were the strong and noble, and nobody stronger and nobler has yet existed on earth or ever been dreamed of: every remnant of them, every inscription gives delight, if only one divines what it was that was there at work. The Jews, on the contrary, were the priestly nation of ressentiment par excellence, in whom there dwelt an unequaled popular-moral genius: one only has to compare similarly gifted nations \u2013 the Chinese or the Germans, for instance \u2013 with the Jews, to sense which is of the first and which of the fifth rank.\u201d<\/span>","time":1490163855,"resto":117713662,"id":"kA6eMNaX","country":"KR","country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":117730152,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:24:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117730111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117730111<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cWhich of them has won for the present, Rome or Judea?

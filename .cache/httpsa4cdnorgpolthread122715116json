She doesn&#039;t say anything about the economy, the future and the whole vast amount of things in her care. It&#039;s just &quot;you don&#039;t like foreigners - vote for me&quot;. And then what? All these new nationalists are the same. They don&#039;t even give any concrete ideas what they will do to the foreigners. They all say they will &quot;deport&quot; them and when pressed, to get votes from the less hard, they admit they just mean deporting dangerous people. And the states already fucking do that! Le Pen will deport isis-linked people. The French police and shit already fucking does it.<br><br>And then she gives her stupid commie economic program and you&#039;re supposed to give her all that power just because she says stuff you like about foreigners. Guess what happens when she gets elected? Jack fucking shit, because she never actually said she&#039;d do anything.<br><br>...And then we come to the point. Which is that these new nationalists hijack nationalism, patriotism and conservativism and start representing them. So when they inevitably fail, the idea of protecting your country and people gets discredited. Look at Trump. Before he came into office leftism was dead. Nationalism was hard on the rise. Now nationalism is treated as the philosophy of fucking drones who accept him hiring Goldman Sachs and still love him. <br><br>And in the end (((they))) win. Because you can either elect Macron, who will continue the rape of your nation but also the building of support or Le Pen who will curb it a little while destroying resistance heavily from within.","time":1493119405,"resto":122715116,"id":"IBMlq5UT","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":122723878,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:24:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122722627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122722627<\/a><br>Have the 2015 numbers.","filename":"France Deprano Map","ext":".jpg","w":1500,"h":2000,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493119477902,"time":1493119477,"md5":"NKFM5ddowaYH2t\/tMdioVg==","fsize":746886,"resto":122715116,"id":"aJXFG4W+","country":"FR","m_img":1,"country_name":"France"},{"no":122723947,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:25:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122723808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122723808<\/a><br>Trump won the election on his economic program moron<br>Take a look at which states flipped red","time":1493119536,"resto":122715116,"id":"tP5U5n9K","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122723956,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:25:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122722487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122722487<\/a><br>Yes, because Britain hasn&#039;t been importing shitskins for decades before anyone else ever did.

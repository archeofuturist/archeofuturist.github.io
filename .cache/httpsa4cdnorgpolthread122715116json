All these new nationalists are the same. They don&#039;t even give any concrete ideas what they will do to the foreigners. They all say they will &quot;deport&quot; them and when pressed, to get votes from the less hard, they admit they just mean deporting dangerous people. And the states already fucking do that! Le Pen will deport isis-linked people. The French police and shit already fucking does it.<br><br>And then she gives her stupid commie economic program and you&#039;re supposed to give her all that power just because she says stuff you like about foreigners.

Now nationalism is treated as the philosophy of fucking drones who accept him hiring Goldman Sachs and still love him. <br><br>And in the end (((they))) win.

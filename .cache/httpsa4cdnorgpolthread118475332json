Youngest is a spoiled brat in his 30ies now, no responsibility at all, jackass to everyone, no friends. This stems from childhood.

No gf, no kids. His brothers have settled. <br><br>Another one<br>3 brothers here too. I still remember the little shit always causing shit, going to his mother, then we would all get bitched for shit we hadn&#039;t done, because for her, he&#039;s still the baby.

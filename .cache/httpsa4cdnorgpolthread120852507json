He\u2019s still being Trump, you\u2019re just now realizing that Trump was never actually the Trump you actually idealized. You projected this sort of false, idealistic vision of Trump as a golden fuhrer onto him, and now that your illusion is dispelled, you\u2019re pissing and moaning. You\u2019re realizing that realpolitik doesn\u2019t mean giving you everything you want.<br><br>Sessions is still reformatting the DoJ to remove taco, 4 thousand Somalis are getting deported, and we got Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch, meaning that the Second Amendment is going to be safe. The wall is coming along smoothly, and NATO members are going to start taking their share of the burden. Trump is fulfilling his campaign promises, and you idiots are crying because he blew up an easily fixable airstrip as a show of force.","filename":"tru","ext":".jpg","w":594,"h":549,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":231,"tim":1492050101325,"time":1492050101,"md5":"0mlgfHKEOiYZA1aEAI2r0A==","fsize":110821,"resto":0,"id":"R+LbD8a9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"did-you-actually-expect-trump-to-be-hitler-20-hes","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":6,"unique_ips":9},{"no":120852610,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:22:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120852507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120852507<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You projected this sort of false, idealistic vision of Trump as a golden fuhrer onto him, and now that your illusion is dispelled<\/span><br><br>Except that&#039;s wrong asshole","time":1492050150,"resto":120852507,"id":"6bHiN0xo","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120852794,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:23:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120852507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120852507<\/a><br>No one is crying except plebbit and d&amp;c shills.<br>Although it would be funny as fuck for moar habbenings.","time":1492050238,"resto":120852507,"id":"P1jpEqSR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120852833,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:24:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120852610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120852610<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;leaf<\/span>","filename":"chris","ext":".png","w":127,"h":129,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492050251377,"time":1492050251,"md5":"KfYyUNKUmNJ+x+JCpH0X4g==","fsize":42526,"resto":120852507,"id":"R+LbD8a9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120852928,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:24:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120852507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120852507<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s your fault for believing Trumps lies<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You only have yourselves to blame when he does the opposite of what he said<\/span><br>No ones crying that he hasn&#039;t set up mexican concentration camps faggot","filename":"1491880287618","ext":".png","w":565,"h":648,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492050295882,"time":1492050295,"md5":"lRfb0TzcUmm8M+PKDQZWHw==","fsize":290188,"resto":120852507,"id":"e6brvF5P","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120852982,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:25:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120852507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120852507<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;did you actually expect Trump to be Hitler 2.0?<\/span><br>with how much it was forced down my throat by libs and msm, yes","time":1492050323,"resto":120852507,"id":"P\/m8RzmB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120853050,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:25:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120852982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120852982<\/a><br>good point desu","filename":"chris2","ext":".png","w":291,"h":247,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":106,"tim":1492050354257,"time":1492050354,"md5":"baDSUUCdVECLI7m8ZML1Zw==","fsize":120279,"resto":120852507,"id":"R+LbD8a9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120853074,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:26:02","name":"$7 Daddy","filename":"4chan complainer","ext":".png","w":1052,"h":460,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":54,"tim":1492050362941,"time":1492050362,"md5":"8CUQo+wdnAXHtsrZuxEKuw==","fsize":34488,"resto":120852507,"id":"75b10FP0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120853653,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:31:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120852507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120852507<\/a><br>Drumpf is a Jewish puppet.<br>https:\/\/thezog.info\/who-controls-do<wbr>nald-trump\/","filename":"space merchant","ext":".png","w":480,"h":508,"tn_w":118,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492050663872,"time":1492050663,"md5":"SS6gptDcvuhqMsQyPo5njQ==","fsize":248086,"resto":120852507,"id":"dY0E13+r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120853886,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:32:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"We were always pretty cognizant that he seemed to be a civic nationalist.

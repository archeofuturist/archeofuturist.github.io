A lot of people might not agree with me but I think Trump is a smart guy so I don&#039;t know why he is doing this. The best guess I have is that he is being emotionally manipulated by his daughter. This doesn&#039;t excuse his mistakes though, the president needs to be strong enough to act in the best interest of the country. I think Trump is politically shrewd so I don&#039;t understand how he doesn&#039;t see that this will destroy him.","time":1492849003,"resto":122230051,"id":"6zKBrLm7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122253989,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:17:02","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1492848551984","ext":".png","w":630,"h":472,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492849022901,"time":1492849022,"md5":"B8cYvxzBs2kSlYdza2IfUQ==","fsize":501512,"resto":122230051,"id":"9hKGDAXR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122254036,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:17:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122230051\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122230051<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;NeoConDon<\/span><br>Can&#039;t believe I voted for this guy","filename":"1445020221685","ext":".jpg","w":454,"h":453,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492849052020,"time":1492849052,"md5":"orI7V+IO1\/jGQ+566WYygw==","fsize":27100,"resto":122230051,"id":"CU3Ovxr1","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122254106,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:18:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122253840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122253840<\/a><br>I get it, though none of these things surprise me at all.

There are about 550 million European Christians. Even if ALL of them became atheists, Christianity would still be the king religion by far. We have 2.7 billion members, Islam has 1.6. The Christian global birthdate is 2.7, the Muslim one is 3.0. Eventually, if nothing changes, yes there might be more Muslims on earth, but we&#039;d still be two titanic faiths. All of sub Africa is Christian, so the niggers have at least some faith and bridge to us. They also have a massive population boom coming, so we&#039;ll likely get another 700million Christians out of Africa alone. Nigeria by itself is set to become the 4th most populated country on earth, 55% of people are Christian there. Christianity is on the rise in China, with 70million members already. Latin America is beating you fuckers day and night, with some countries at 95% Christian compared to America&#039;s lame 72%. <br>What you also have to remember is that these areas are all going through population booms. Literally the only places on earth the religion is dying is Europe and U.S. Even without them, Christianity is still king at 2 BILLION so calm down. I&#039;m Lebanese, and there are plenty of Arab Christians. Yes it&#039;s true were leaving our homelands for now, but we&#039;re not all dead. Most Arab Christians are diaspora like myself, there&#039;s millions. <br>To sum it up: places with falling white birth rates, the whites are becoming less Christian. America will become more Christian if more Mexicans come, they&#039;re more religious than most of you imbeciles. Latin America, Asia, and Africa are hitting population booms which means Christian numbers will explode in size in the next 30 years. The lying media is only saying its dying because it&#039;s dying in non-Slav or Med white places. Get your shit together, but Christianity isn&#039;t going to die with Europe.

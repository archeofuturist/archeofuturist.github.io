My church is actually quite full but you cant say the same for the rest of the country, i don&#039;t want to live in a secular Britain or God forbid a Islamic Britain. What can we do to reverse this because i think about it a lot and it depresses me. With every census every ten years Christianity dips by about 10% whilst Islam is on the rise. What can we do to stop it?","filename":"101309","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":350,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":148,"tim":1492347974685,"time":1492347974,"md5":"Kjr2GYqNX08u6ttfA39ysA==","fsize":50678,"resto":0,"id":"\/E7JCIBl","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"christianity-is-dying","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":121356619,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)09:09:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121356311\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121356311<\/a><br>Nothing.

Many of these stars are likely to have planets circling around them. A fair fraction of these planets will have liquid water on their surface and a gaseous atmosphere. The energy pouring down from a star will cause the synthesis of organic compounds, turning the ocean into a thin, warm soup. These chemicals will join each other to produce a self-reproducing system. The simplest living things will multiply, evolve by natural selection and become more complicated till eventually active, thinking creatures will emerge. Civilization, science, and technology will follow. Then, yearning for fresh worlds, they will travel to neighboring planets, and later to planets of nearby stars. Eventually they should spread out all over the Galaxy. These highly exceptional and talented people could hardly overlook such a beautiful place as our Earth. - &quot;And so, &quot; - Fermi came to his overwhelming question, - &quot;if all this has been happening, they should have arrived here by now, so where are they ? &quot; - It was Leo Szilard, a man with an impish sense of humor, who supplied the perfect reply to the Fermi Paradox: - &quot;They are among us,&quot; - he said, - &quot;but they call themselves Hungarians.&quot;","filename":"hungary_flag_background_symbol_texture_50897_1920x1080","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493662159027,"time":1493662159,"md5":"qdIr8bZEajpGiFFJjbSvyA==","fsize":1138787,"resto":123645494,"id":"SE+VTDuM","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123650569,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:09:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123645494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123645494<\/a><br><br>they are garbage, everyone hates them,plz just kill all of them.","time":1493662165,"resto":123645494,"id":"rBD1TAga","country":"UA","country_name":"Ukraine"},{"no":123650573,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:09:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"If Hungary would stop whining about transylvania maybe we can do something about our shared problem","time":1493662167,"resto":123645494,"id":"DpVcqZ9k","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123650675,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:10:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123650412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123650412<\/a><br>Slav fooled by gypsys HA","time":1493662224,"resto":123645494,"id":"p9rHDkU1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123650897,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:12:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"why is edy talent not a 4chan meme yet<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1Yb<wbr>Dngz3aL8","time":1493662332,"resto":123645494,"id":"U5+D64Uw","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123650909,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:12:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123650539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123650539<\/a><br>Where the fucking shit do you get those numbers?<br>I live in Iasi(one of the bigger cities) and that number seems right, but there tend to be fewer gypsies in the rural areas.","time":1493662336,"resto":123645494,"id":"Fnzn4sIt","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123650930,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:12:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123650412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123650412<\/a><br>You have to be a special kind of idiot to come in contact with any kind of shitskins on the street","time":1493662347,"resto":123645494,"id":"WDH2TcN+","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123650955,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:12:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hungarians are Uralic language friends and also bretty cool despite getting unfairly divided in the Treaty of Trianon.","filename":"1493388715293","ext":".jpg","w":812,"h":727,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":111,"tim":1493662357986,"time":1493662357,"md5":"Ml\/iEyZSx5BGb2rCYZczBA==","fsize":133061,"resto":123645494,"id":"aPf3Z6zD","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":123651058,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:13:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"puneti linku de discord tiganilor ce sunteti","time":1493662407,"resto":123645494,"id":"TN2COZTW","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123651064,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:13:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123650955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123650955<\/a><br>mongols unite","filename":"14913499936289","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":572,"tn_w":109,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493662407581,"time":1493662407,"md5":"MIrhIPXSxnmk+mHaASBqrQ==","fsize":385439,"resto":123645494,"id":"WDH2TcN+","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123651191,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:14:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123650930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123650930<\/a><br>Civilised people like to converse with people","time":1493662476,"resto":123645494,"id":"p9rHDkU1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123651230,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:14:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123650675\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123650675<\/a><br>Not all slavs are gopniks.

Many of these stars are likely to have planets circling around them. A fair fraction of these planets will have liquid water on their surface and a gaseous atmosphere. The energy pouring down from a star will cause the synthesis of organic compounds, turning the ocean into a thin, warm soup. These chemicals will join each other to produce a self-reproducing system. The simplest living things will multiply, evolve by natural selection and become more complicated till eventually active, thinking creatures will emerge. Civilization, science, and technology will follow. Then, yearning for fresh worlds, they will travel to neighboring planets, and later to planets of nearby stars. Eventually they should spread out all over the Galaxy.

But the context in which he made his assertion is copletely moronic. <br>He argues that state owned and regulated internet would achieve the same quality as Romanian internet. However, Romanian&#039;s internet is the product of a deadly competitive market based combined with a highly skilled workforce. So Romanian internet is a product of unregulated capitalism. Romania&#039;s internet is virtually free of OFFICIAL violations of the public&#039;s privacy, meanwhile your hero is going to sign a law approving of companies to sell your data for profit. Don&#039;t try to argue about internet quality. It is the only aspect of Romanian infrastructure that excels. You are net inferior when it comes to internet speeds.

Development of behavioral gender dimorphism begins in prenatal life. In female fetuses, a protein called alpha-fetoprotein (sp?) binds estradiol, rendering it inert. Although estradiol has a feminizing effect in post-natal life, the opposite is true for fetuses: both testosterone and estradiol cause a fetus to develop masculine neuroanatomy. It&#039;s the absence of of those steroid hormones that makes female fetuses exhibit the feminine phenotype later greater attraction to neonatenous features in children, aversion to risk-taking behavior, submissive behavior etc).","time":1493137430,"resto":122747061,"id":"gdN7ZWAl","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":122751536,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:24:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"you guys really need to get over yourselves and get with the program. it&#039;s happening. we live in an increasingly urban society where vagina fetishists have become an economic and social problem. whether you want to help us or not, we are phasing out cis women. we have been for 15 years plus. we cannot afford them as a society goIng forward. so help us and accept us, or get the fuck out of the way while we pave a better future.","time":1493137466,"resto":122747061,"id":"QmcdzEJA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122751591,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:24:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122747061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122747061<\/a><br>Its p simple.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; let people identify and act how they want as long as its not in bad taste<\/span><br><br>Makes sense to anyone who isnt a nu-pol wanna nazi<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; burn down everything science has eatablished over thousands of years cause youre too lazy to make up your own terminology<\/span><br><br>Fuck off <br><br>Chromosomes and biology arent subjective.

Social Justice politicizes the personal. They love their pet phrase, &quot;The personal is political.&quot; But the personal is not political, the personal is private. Social Justice is personally invasive, identity obsessed, and downright psychologically codependent. Social Justice creates conflict, strife and misery by refusing to respect healthy boundaries. <br><br>There is no such thing as human gender, only human sex. The matters secondary to chromosomal sex, like hormone balances, as you described, are secondary. They don&#039;t alter a human&#039;s sex, they accent it, diversifying human individuality. Social Justice is obsessed with categorizing identities, because it is totalitarian, so its proponents don&#039;t like the idea that people might just mostly be uncategorizable individuals. They hunt for -- and manufacture -- any excuse to shove people into categories in order to steal their voices away and &quot;represent&quot; them FOR them.<br><br>Social Justice is deeply anti-individualistic. This is why the idea of plain simple XX\/XY human sex makes them uncomfortable. They think that if people are only categorized in this simple way, that means people are also being forced to adhere to strict, simple XX\/XY definitions, but that&#039;s not true at all. Keeping categorizations simple allows people room to be individuals otherwise. But SJWs are authoritarians. They can&#039;t conceive of human individuality or freedom. So they keep trying to create more and more categories (identities) for people to adhere to, in order to give them freedom by diversifying the restrictions, but this actually does the opposite. It creates more restrictions. If they could understand that we aren&#039;t naturally constricted in the first place, that we&#039;re all individuals, they would see this.","time":1493137726,"resto":122747061,"id":"DrADBgp8","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122752003,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:28:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122747415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122747415<\/a><br>Looking into treatment options for that autism.

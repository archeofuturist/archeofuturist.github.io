I recently discovered a male friend of mine isn&#039;t as male as I thought. He was born as a girl.<br><br>I used to be conservative about trans but he made me realize that trans people can truly be who they want to be, even if genitals don&#039;t align and chromosomes don&#039;t align.<br><br>Many people say: CHROMOSOMES, XY = MAN, XX = WOMAN. SO YOU WILL ALWAYS BE MAN\/WOMAN.<br><br>That is true, but there&#039;s a difference between being man and being male\/masculine. Same goes for female\/feminine. Allow me to explain by using science. No SJW bullcrap, pure biology. <br><br>Chromosomes can&#039;t change. Everybody knows that. But chromosomes are not everything. If you really work in the field of genetics or neurology you might have heard of the neuron group INAH-3. Depending on it&#039;s size it defines how masculine or feminine you are. INAH-3 is observably larger in men than women. Research of Simon Levay has shown us that when a man has a small INAH-3 they are more likely to be homosexual or mtf transgender. Thesame way around for females who have a bigger INAH-3; they tend to be lesbians or ftm transgender.<br><br>Are Genes the only factor? Apparently not.<br>Is INAH-3 the only sidefactor? Not at all, there are even more genes and neuron groups that define your sexuality and gender identification. <br><br>There are hormone concentrations that vary throughout your body. Some males have high testosterone of themselves, other suffer from a deficiency. Et cetera, et cetera.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; TL;DR There is much more to science about transgenders than just chromosomes. There are neuron groups, hormones and many more structures affecting what gender you feel like.<\/span>","filename":"51oXhJJ8FoL._SX355_","ext":".jpg","w":355,"h":214,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":150,"tim":1493135039242,"time":1493135039,"md5":"VTHrjEEYOTcRRWnADwes7A==","fsize":10711,"resto":0,"id":"aAAtKwzZ","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trannies","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

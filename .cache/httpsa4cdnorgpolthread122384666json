They also tried to have the scientists and their families flown out of Iraq for the interviews, which saddam denied. So in essence, the inspectors could only talk to select scientists with a government minder present.<br><br>Site inspections were limited with certain military installations being off limits to un inspectors, and others with restricted areas forbidden to inspectors. <br>But yeah, he let UN inspectors into his country. <br><br>Semblance of order also came from shifting Iraqi units away from their hometowns where they could fight without fear of reprisals on their families. <br><br>Proxy war. Your right in the sense that both Iran and Saudi wanted as much of Iraq as possible, but Isis didn&#039;t get underway until after we left, Iran funded Shia militia had died down after the surge, and reemerged after US pull out.","time":1492932414,"resto":122384666,"id":"eUU7qJUp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122395685,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)03:27:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122395495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122395495<\/a><br>Whatever, homo.

Very young. My mom let me watch &#039;Jacob&#039;s Ladder&#039; with her, and it opens with VietNam solders vomiting from an attack. My mom told me that Saddam was capable of DOING THAT to our town. I was scared af for months. <br><br>Gulf War, youngfags won&#039;t understand, but you watched the night vision bombs, scuds and shit on Live TV --it was a huge deal then, but seemed abstract to me, like vidya. <br><br>Iraq Invasion --I was at uni in South Florida. Lots of (((students))), I was friends with many there, all limo liberals, and it really bothered me how they were in favor of invading, killing Saddam, buying the lies about WMDs\/9\/11 connection. These were smart kids, I was deeply troubled by it, not be Jew-wise, not giving a thought about Israel, which they thought was funny...until the invasion. <br><br>I&#039;d speak very aggressively about NeoCons in class discussions ---not knowing it basically meant Zionist Republicans. Called them traitors etc. Jewish students, never forget how offended some of them got. A Jewish friend told me privately to chill out, but I still didn&#039;t get it. I thought Jewish power was a meme. Didn&#039;t meet any until college. <br><br>I&#039;ll also share that one of my first encounters with Jewish kids at uni was in 2001 before 9\/11. They lived in a dorm, but they looked older than fresh\/soph. They were running a shit load of ecstasy, across campus and the city. I only knew they were Jewish because they wore skull caps. Anyway, I read many years later Mossad tracked Saudi hijackers in SoFla, lived right beside them. And that ecstasy sales were used to fund shadier parts of their operations --seen this stated on \/pol\/ in fact. Israel controls ecstasy in the US is my understanding.<br><br>I also remember Jewish professors calling Pat Buchanan an antisemite for condemning neocons\/Iraq\/Jewish lobbying. Totally went over my head back then. But I&#039;ve been changed to the bone by the Iraq lie, redpills, Greater Israel.

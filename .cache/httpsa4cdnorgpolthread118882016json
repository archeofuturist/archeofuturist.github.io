It is a self-serving argument designed by an ill willed mind who seeks to justify his actions through deferring the responsibility on to an imaginary concept.<br><br><a href=\"#p118888988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118888988<\/a><br>Agnosticism is an argument based on a theistic claim, it is a theistic claim by extention. You are a slave to the undefined concept of god to humour it. There is no difference between the following claims: There may exist a god beyond the universe. There may exist a tree where cars grow instead of roots beyond the universe. The difference is not in the argument, but in you. You believe in the divine claim to be different from the insane claim because you have been successfully brainwashed.<br><br><br><a href=\"#p118890058\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118890058<\/a><br>The power you speak of is the power over your mind, you have been successfully brainwashed. You have given over the sovereignty of your inner self. This allows people to speak to you as if they have a truly close connection to some higher power, and command you to do their nefarious bidding. The moment you reject that power, they lose control over you, and you become free. This is what they fear. The power of the crowd can be felt at any large concert. People as far as the eyes can see giving in to the collective ecstasy. If the band members siezed that power, they would control you. The difference between a band and the clergy is that you cannot get close to or understand the clergys claim. You are as brainwashed as scientologists buying E-meters and chanting in a ring for nothing more than you to accept that they have power over your mind. You are sheep without resistance to the mind shepherds.","filename":"1484284432857","ext":".jpg","w":1111,"h":719,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1490853544279,"time":1490853544,"md5":"PpxApLO9BO1E+EPSI2OrSA==","fsize":77636,"resto":118882016,"id":"C\/QZ4OKv","country":"SE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118891145,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)01:59:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118882016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118882016<\/a><br>What&#039;s the point of life if you believe in God?","time":1490853586,"resto":118882016,"id":"AAMZQv8t","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":118891251,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)02:00:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118883358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118883358<\/a><br>you live like a stupid animal, shame yourself.","time":1490853658,"resto":118882016,"id":"AAMZQv8t","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":118891413,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)02:03:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118891096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118891096<\/a><br>you just explained my entire story in another way and added more details. im the sheep because you dont understand. but thats alright friend","time":1490853786,"resto":118882016,"id":"Pkw6wMDQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118891705,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)02:06:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118882016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118882016<\/a><br>What is the point of doing anything good if you believe you are subservient to the creator of all evil?","time":1490854001,"resto":118882016,"id":"CsHLSFM6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118891934,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)02:09:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118891705\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118891705<\/a><br>because it wasn&#039;t just evil that was created","time":1490854178,"resto":118882016,"id":"Pkw6wMDQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118891947,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)02:09:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118882016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118882016<\/a><br>Buddhaism is a nice way of looking at life yet its very very hard to handle or practice.","time":1490854184,"resto":118882016,"id":"EE3znWKy","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":118892028,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)02:10:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118891096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118891096<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You believe in the divine claim to be different from the insane claim because you have been successfully brainwashed.<\/span><br><br>well, that&#039;s where you&#039;re wrong. the concept of god is unfalsifiable like you stated here:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is no difference between the following claims: There may exist a god beyond the universe.

A religious person will perform a good deed because there is an entire concept of otherworldly reward behind it. No matter how good the deed is, no matter how pleasing the sight is to them, the motivation for religious reward will always be there as a major subtext in their faith.","time":1490850622,"resto":118882016,"id":"wgZPD5P2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118886521,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)01:10:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118882016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118882016<\/a><br>what&#039;s the point of believing in a god?","filename":"GW5","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":496,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1490850647517,"time":1490850647,"md5":"t4B\/HjvsUBuBX+r3iw\/D3g==","fsize":142878,"resto":118882016,"id":"+8QiT9Ks","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118886540,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)01:11:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118883180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118883180<\/a><br>very very spooky","filename":"pepe max stirner","ext":".png","w":218,"h":231,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490850662346,"time":1490850662,"md5":"b7k94euPew1Ak0JDzxAnqw==","fsize":8441,"resto":118882016,"id":"moVvnbhI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118886638,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)01:12:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118886110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118886110<\/a><br>Better?

Christianity and islam were created by the jew to give the illusion of choice, and also as a way to identify those who belong to the chosen people. They are the most ingenious group to exist in the world, as they have successfully brainwashed billions into perpetuating the world to believe our existence to be as they believe it to be. You only believe there to be a god because of them. They play on your fears of your own insignificance, and the fear of death. They will tell you of the [greater plan], that after death comes bliss and love but only if you believe. Only if you give them your money and perpetuate the state of existence of god. You&#039;re a puppet being played like a fiddle. They fear only one thing, that you will open your eyes to the world and abandon their cause. God is the jew icon, the brand, the company slogan.

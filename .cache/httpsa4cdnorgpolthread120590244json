Back in July Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban became the first leader of an E.U. or NATO country to formally endorse Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign, describing the candidate as \u201coutstanding.\u201d \u201cTrump would be better for Europe and for Hungary,\u201d he said<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cI have to tell you that he made three proposals to halt terrorism, and as a European, I could have hardly expressed what is best for Europe any better than he did,\u201d Orban gushed, explaining that the three elements of Trump\u2019s policies he most agreed with were that migrants pose a security risk, that national security apparatuses must be expanded, and that the West must stop trying to export democracy to other parts of the world.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Orban welcomed President Trump\u2019s inauguration as the \u201cend of multilateralism,\u201d and praised Trump\u2019s inaugural statement as a \u201cbig change\u201d that would usher in an era of \u201cbilateralism.\u201d \u201cWe have received permission from, if you like, the highest position in the world so we can now also put ourselves in first place.

In a sign of closer ties, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto spoke by phone with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last month in a significant departure from recent U.S. policy, where the Hungarian government had largely been starved of such senior-level engagement with Washington officials. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to local press reports of the call, Szijjarto told Tillerson that the Trump Administration has such more in common with Hungary\u2019s political aspirations than with American Democrats. He was duly invited to visit Washington, D.C. a couple of weeks later to attend a gathering of foreign ministers focused on countering the Islamic State.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A political alliance between Trump and Orban should be alarming for human rights activists and defenders of democratic institutions in both countries. In September 2016, the top U.N. human rights official, High Commissioner Zeid Ra\u2019ad al-Hussein, bracketed Trump and Orban with other radical right-wing European politicians who breed \u201can atmosphere thick with hate,\u201d which \u201cmay descend into violence.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Meanwhile, former Hungarian government official and Orban advisor Sebastian Gorka has now become Trump\u2019s top White House advisor on counterterrorism. Gorka\u2019s links to Hungarian extremist and antisemitic groups have come under increasing scrutiny, raising alarming questions about how far the Hungarian far right reaches into the Trump White House.<\/span>","time":1491912833,"resto":120590244,"id":"iJLfPgrF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120590496,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:15:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;In mid-March the story broke in Budapest that the Hungarian group \u201cHistorical Vit\u00e9zi Rend,\u201d which seeks to glorify the rule of Hungary\u2019s antisemitic, Nazi-aligned Regent Miklos Horthy, claims Gorka as a formal member.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The U.S. State Department has designated the original Vit\u00e9zi Rend group as collaborators with Nazi Germany during World War II.

Tens of thousands of people protested in Budapest on Sunday against the closing of the Central European University, known for its academic independence. It was the largest anti-governement demonstration in Hungary for years.

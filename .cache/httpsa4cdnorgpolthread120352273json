All people are equal and they should be treated equally.<\/span><br>The greatest lie that any society has taught itself is that everybody&#039;s self-esteem should be protected at all times. Let&#039;s make no mistakes here; people are not in fact equal. While it can be hard to stomach for a newfag or a normie, the truth is that evidence shows that different human races- be it white, black, asian, hispanic- are fundamentally different in ways aside from physical and cultural. Natural selection in different environments saw to that.<br><br>Undeniable proof comes in the example of social and technological development over history; even though they didn&#039;t really arrive at largely different times to each continent, Europeans in the 18th century were a sophisticated culture with high technology and social developments. The African culture of that time was still largely tribal, with very few developments compared to those of the Europeans, and at a much slower pace. One can bitch about isolation in this point, but it doesn&#039;t matter; just look at Japan and China, who were isolated from the West and still developed large, advanced cultures without European influence until recently in history. One has to look at these and wonder, &quot;could there be a reason?&quot; That&#039;s a simple answer: blacks are fundamentally inferior to whites and asians, and largely depended upon forcible integration into other cultures. Things like slavery in the American South integrated blacks into Western culture for practically the first time on a large scale. Had it not been for these racists, America today would lack a large black minority; the blacks would have received their Westernization in the form of late 19th century imperialism, which would have gone far worse.","filename":"dindu","ext":".jpg","w":780,"h":3524,"tn_w":55,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491778703106,"time":1491778703,"md5":"GCNzsrHYHj2\/x6ikKTgXnQ==","fsize":638578,"resto":0,"id":"PBBD6heS","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"itt-liberalnormie-arguments-and-rebuttals","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

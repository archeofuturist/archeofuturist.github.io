They lost 3\/4 of the men who entered in Portugal, but the attrition warfare fucked us over real bad too. Because of this, our retard of a king went to Brazil and said Rio de Janeiro was capital, making everything worse in Europe. Plus, the absolute retarded ideas of the French Revolution became popular in Portugal too (fucking frogs), and in the 1820-1830s Portugal fell into civil war. When it ended in 1834, we had 17 years of failed liberal and unstable governments. So, all in all, the period between ~1795-1851 was completely lost.

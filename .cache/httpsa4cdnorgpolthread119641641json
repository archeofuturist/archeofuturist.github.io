However, from September 1941 onwards, the war with the Soviet Union would have only gotten much harder to win as Stalin was marshaling together huge armies and was moving a great deal of Soviet industry to the Urals out of the Luftwaffe&#039;s or the Wehrmacht&#039;s reach. <br><br>There is no feasible scenario that Hitler would have stood by and not invaded the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union was the antithesis of Nazi ideology and it was demanded that the ideological war must be fought and won against the dirty Bolshevik Slav. Lebenstraum was an important factor in this as well as Hitler desired to wipe out the Russian state by exterminating the Slavs and settling the new lands with the German Volk. <br><br>Victory Scenario 1: Operation Barbarossa begins on June 22nd, 1941. The timetable of Nazi Germany was already thrown off by a few months as Yugoslavia and Greece required attention earlier in the year. If Germany had invaded a few months earlier as planned, Hitler would have had a greater chance of reaching Moscow before General Mud and General Winter slowed down the panzer armies. However, the invasion begins on June 22nd. The Soviet Union&#039;s army is badly damaged but not crippled from the German onslaught. Hundreds of thousands of Red Army troops are gathering in the area of Kiev, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. Historically, Hitler diverted the path of Army Group Center and Army Group South to enclose the Red Army around Kiev and destroy them utterly, scoring a major tactical victory in September 1941. However, this further slowed down the German advance and gave Stalin valuable time to organize the defenses on the road to Moscow. <br><br>Instead in this scenario, Hitler allows Army Group Center to ignore the Soviet threat on their right flank and continue on to Smolensk.","filename":"Operation Barbarossa","ext":".png","w":600,"h":869,"tn_w":86,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491426388143,"time":1491426388,"md5":"KOAZasWlwpyPf30mBjrWyA==","fsize":1095009,"resto":119641641,"id":"BxqckPy9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119656081,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)17:06:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Not fighting on 2 fronts would be a good start.","time":1491426396,"resto":119641641,"id":"q5moIMtg","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119656118,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)17:06:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119641641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119641641<\/a><br>Axing funding to all other wonder weapons but rockets and moving said funding to nuclear weapons.

Stalin decides to evacuate (which he was on the border of doing but changed his mind when he arrived at the train station). This collapses Soviet morale in and around Moscow, and the city soon falls under German pressure. <br><br>The consequences of the swastika being raised over Moscow is huge. Moscow is the hub of transportation and industry in central Russia, and reinforcements to the Red Army are not as easily delivered to the front. With Army Group Center having accomplished their goal, Army Group North as a result is able to reduce and take Leningrad since the railroads to Karelia have been cut and the Red Army no longer thinks that Leningrad is a feasible city to defend. This also in turn encourages the Finns to do something and push towards Murmansk and Arkhangelsk. Like a snowball, with the collapse of Leningrad and Moscow and the reduction of pressure on the eastern front, German reinforcements from the north are switched to the south with the aid of the important Moscow railroad hub. The Red Army morale begins to collapse and you will likely have a Russian settlement for peace by the end of 1941 as Stalin realizes that the weight of German reinforcements to south Central Russia and Ukraine will soon overwhelm Red Army defenses there. <br><br>The Soviet Union settles for a bitter peace and Germany is granted most of European Russia in exchange for peace. With the Germans in the oil-rich Caucasus and land access to the Middle East through British-occupied Persia, the panzer armies will soon kick Britain out of the Middle East and possibly even India. However, I think that a decisive German victory in the Middle East by conquering Iraq, Syria, and Jordan will force the British to settle for peace. The Soviet Union has been beaten and the British gives up their Middle East colonies, including Egypt.","filename":"The Final Victory","ext":".png","w":798,"h":518,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1491427357294,"time":1491427357,"md5":"24m2czsJ9y8QzIdhv7p9HA==","fsize":337281,"resto":119641641,"id":"BxqckPy9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119657908,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)17:22:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119641641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119641641<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stopping advance at Dunkereque<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bombing London instead of airfields and factories<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not using Slavic minorities in the USSR who hated communism as soldiers immediately<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not pressing Japan to invade USSR from the east<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;declaring war on the U.S.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;focusing research on complicated offensive weapons like V-2 instead of cheaper and more useful AA missiles like Wasserfall<\/span>","time":1491427361,"resto":119641641,"id":"B5+rAIkP","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":119657931,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)17:22:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"not invading russia, the moment he opened two fronts he lost.....<br><br>And the japs starting a war with US didn&#039;t help either","time":1491427378,"resto":119641641,"id":"hMaGbm5N","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":119657973,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)17:23:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119657210\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119657210<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;five-year plan meaning their military was back in good shape<\/span><br>All the soviets had were numbers, and their weaponry were inferior compared to the Germans (only exception being the T34).<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Germans&#039; tactics and strategies were primarily offensive not defensive<\/span><br>They were because Germany needed to take control of the surrounding European countries.

And pertaining to race, it condemns it as a concept while it maintains it&#039;s usefulness in leveraging guilt, deceit and manipulation to destroy traditional and mostly healthy\/essential institutions and arguments. This combined with the low social trust, a bi-product of this unchecked pluralism, this state-enforced multiculturalism, you ironically validate your opposition, their arguments and fail to see the irony in it. This is because your morality was never truly formed. It was an accident. And this same morality has created these circumstances. <br><br> I see no honesty in your intellectual approach.

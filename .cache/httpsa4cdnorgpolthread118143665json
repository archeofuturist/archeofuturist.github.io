If man were given the option of codifying these principles himself than anything and everything would be permissable given any variety of circumstances. Why do we hold the $ in high esteem and why does it have value? Why do we have faith in it? Why do we feel it is a virtue to have it and have alot of it? Why do so many put it above life? Why? Because it&#039;s accepted as so. Just because it is does not cleanse it. Acceptance of it does not make it correct nor justified. The sin nature of sodomy takes into regard that the act of sexual intercourse has a primary and specific function. That being the joy of procreation. It is primarily functional and secondarily pleasurable. The transferance of the seed to the egg to spark the creation of life. The seed is not intended to be intentionally squandered through any form of promiscuity and it especially doesn&#039;t belong deposited in someone&#039;s anus. Procreation is one of the reasons we&#039;re put on the planet. It&#039;s why we exist. But, that is not to say we&#039;re under an obligation to do it.

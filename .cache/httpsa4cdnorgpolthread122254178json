The industry and capital of the Western Russia is enough to sustain and modernize Western Russia to EU levels. Why doesn&#039;t that happen?<br><br>Because first of all, the biggest issue of Russia - security. The Western Russia is forced to spend huge amounts of their capital on the security of the vast lands of the rest of Russia, because all of them are prone to invasions by technically any country on Earth due to their lack of natural defenses and openness - they&#039;re the worst territory you could possibly choose to defend, and it&#039;s quite fucking huge on top of that, meaning you need even more defense. Then comes the problem of transportation between both sides, increased corruption the farther you go away from the capital, social services costing more due to poor people being concentrated there, so on. If we take two scenarios - one of Western Russia joining the EU and their huge market, and another of the entire Russia remaining as it is, it is far more desirable for Western Russia to join the EU and cultivate its own territory over spilling their capital to the Eastern region which they will eventually lose anyway.<br><br>And then comes the second biggest issue - the artificially-inflated price of oil due to the geopolitical tool it is, and the inevitable collapse of it in 10 to 20 years. Russia is a gas station. You crash oil - you bankrupt the entire Russia. They must diversify NOW, and the closest source of diversification to them is letting go of the East and joining the EU.","time":1492864084,"resto":122254178,"id":"2J1dbPfd","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"}]}

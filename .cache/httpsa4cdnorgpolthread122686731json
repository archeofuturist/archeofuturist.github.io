It&#039;s important that they don&#039;t let this event change them for the worse, and in this regard I support a quick death with little fanfare and out of the public&#039;s eye.

Any other criminal should spend their time doing hard labor, and only the most promising prisoners should be in some form of rehabilitation before their release so they&#039;re ready to reintegrate.<br><br>I think everyone should be given a life number based on the life expectancy.

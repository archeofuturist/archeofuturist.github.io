We&#039;re being manipulated to support Assad at this point because Trump has gone beyond their control and is now a threat. We were pushed into supporting Trump because they thought he would be weak but he has proved he&#039;s got balls. Even now, they are recruiting young users in my very own country into their network of operations. And rather than say nothing and let these younger people believe the shilling on here is indicative of right thinking and that they&#039;re on the right side, I want to tell them that the walls have been breached. Go out and think for yourselves. Look for the currents under the surface of things and fight for what YOU believe in. Don&#039;t be someone&#039;s puppet. Do you really think the man who is the source of all these god damn refugees is our friend? Do you think the Russians supporting him don&#039;t realize that the influx we have to deal with makes us weaker and draws attention from their other advances across Europe? There I&#039;ve said my piece.","filename":"pmeB7JMj","ext":".png","w":252,"h":252,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491714187755,"time":1491714187,"md5":"MNa933YcpYGQ19xBMDw46g==","fsize":116752,"resto":0,"id":"9QOwnGSN","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-think-its-really-time-to-acknowledge-that","country_name":"Canada","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":120241434,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:04:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120241269\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120241269<\/a><br>Its time for you to back to red dit OP.

With a displacement of 70,000 tonnes, the carrier is slightly heavier, with a similar length and width. Like the Liaoning, the Type 001A will incorporate a ski-jump launch system for aircraft and will not feature an advanced catapult-assisted launch system. As with the Liaoning, the airwing of the 001A will comprise up to 36 Shenyang J-15 multirole fighters.<\/span><br>http:\/\/thediplomat.com\/2017\/04\/chin<wbr>as-first-domestically-built-aircraf<wbr>t-carrier-may-launch-any-day-now\/","filename":"crc","ext":".png","w":599,"h":374,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1493030341304,"time":1493030341,"md5":"Q54yby26ZPZxL98E0Xir6Q==","fsize":361013,"resto":0,"id":"7sbHELV8","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-you-scared-yet-pol","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":15,"images":3,"unique_ips":16},{"no":122572255,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)06:40:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122572183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122572183<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A FUCKING RAMP<\/span>","time":1493030408,"resto":122572183,"id":"DU5neHve","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":122572315,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)06:41:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122572183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122572183<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A fucking ramp<\/span>","time":1493030474,"resto":122572183,"id":"QtBgPeMn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122572376,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)06:42:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122572183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122572183<\/a><br>Welcome to the club China.

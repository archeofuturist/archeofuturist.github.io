They were published sixteen years ago, and ever since then they have corresponded to the world situation and today they still dictate its rhythm.&quot; In a sense, we can speak of a prophetic premonition. In any event, the value of the document as a working hypothesis is undeniable: it presents the various aspects of global subversion (among them, some aspects that were destined to be outlined and accomplished only many years after the publication of the Protocols)<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This document was purported to be a protocol stolen from a secret Judeo-Masonic organization and allegedly reveals a plan that was devised and implemented with the subversion and the destruction of traditional Europe in mind. Regarding the authenticity of the Protocols a rabid and complex debate has erupted, which can be dismissed, however, by Gu\u00e9non&#039;s correct observation that a truly occult organization, no matter what its nature, never leaves behind written documents or &quot;protocols.&quot; Thus, in the most favorable hypothesis, the Protocols could have been the work of someone who had contacts with some representatives of this alleged organization. However, we cannot agree either with those who wish to dismiss this document as a vulgar mystification, forgery, and work of plagiarism. The main argument adduced by the latter is that the Protocols reproduce and paraphrase in many parts the ideas found in a short book written by a certain Maurice Joly during the period of Napoleon&#039;s Second Empire. Allegedly, mysterious provocateurs of the Czar&#039;s secret police were responsible for writing the Protocols.<\/span>","filename":"evola-1_0","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":274,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1492233648468,"time":1492233648,"md5":"C9q0E6Dl6w8YS89SB8uYOw==","fsize":20189,"resto":121172981,"id":"Ig\/ZqHAl","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121174932,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:28:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121174291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121174291<\/a><br>Conclusion<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; It is therefore logical that the role of a central guiding force of global subversion in this last period will no longer be played by Judaism or Masonry and that the main current may turn against both of these groups, as if they were residues to be liquidated once and for all; after all, this can be seen in countries in which regimes controlled by the Fourth Estate (i.e., Marxist regimes) are beginning to be consolidated, even though Jews and Masons contributed to their advent.<\/span><br> <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But then again, as far as the general radical Jewish-Masonic conspiracy thesis upheld in some milieus is concerned, the actual situation shows its inconsistency. It would be a real abandonment to fantasy to suppose that the leaders of the great conflicting powers \u2014 the United States, the USSR, and Red China \u2014 receive orders from an international center of Jews and Masons (almost nonexistent in China), and act accordingly in view of the same goal. Again, it is necessary to refer to a wider horizon of influences and to look elsewhere.<\/span><br><br>You gotta dig deeper than &quot;IT\u00b4S THE JOOS!!&quot;","filename":"evola-3_0","ext":".jpg","w":350,"h":483,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492234097836,"time":1492234097,"md5":"mdZCkPREBPGMxHk3umtLqQ==","fsize":67463,"resto":121172981,"id":"Ig\/ZqHAl","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"}]}

Evidence that was obtained with a FISA warrant, with the permission and knowledge of both the Executive and the Judiciary Branches.<br><br>If I were Trump&#039;s defense, the only way the evidence becomes inadmissable in a court of law is if it was illegally obtained. So of course those involved in the unlawful collusion with Russia will try to argue that the evidence of such collusion is inadmissable.<br><br>What they don&#039;t realize is that Congressional Hearings and Impeachment don&#039;t work exactly like Criminal Court. The Truth is the Truth, no matter the origin. So attacking the messenger to kill the message is futile, which is Trump&#039;s go-to defense. He hasn&#039;t figured this out yet, so part of him is still convinced that anything less than 100% transparency in this matter is going to be accepted by the Congress. Even a Republican Congress. <br><br>It won&#039;t be. And if someone lies under oath to Congress about inappropriate or unreported contacts with a foreign nation, they will probably go to jail. That&#039;s why Nixon resigned rather than be Impeached by Congress... he knew he was guilty and it was the only way to be pardoned.<br><br>There exists the possibility that Trump has unwittingly been a useful idiot for the FSB and FSB sympathizers in America without knowing it. That&#039;s possible, I can swallow that, because Trump has probably never been exposed to an FSB-tier psyop. <br><br>I plan to let the evidence lead me to the conclusion instead of trying to fix the facts and intelligence around a preexisting desire for a certain outcome. <br><br>I&#039;m sure Congress will also.","time":1491446863,"resto":119680028,"id":"Yj8x0Cjh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119694189,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:48:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;ll call.

I have been lurking this thread for the last year after my son introduced me to it. I find it very informative and entertaining. Really a place for freedom of speech. It can get a little wild but that whats make this place so great.<br><br>I have a question for all of you here. Why do you think so many leftwing atheist keep attacking Christians here and their belief in God? They try so hard in asking you about so many different questions. I am actually very impressed with the answers given. I figure you guys are young and the answer given is really deep. It truly is impressive, I figure the youth would not be that informed. <br><br>I always find it weird that these left wing atheist come here of all places and try to attack the Christian right. Why do they care if you believe or not.","filename":"Discovery Institute DiscoveryCSC Twitter","ext":".jpg","w":281,"h":435,"tn_w":161,"tn_h":249,"tim":1493093816699,"time":1493093816,"md5":"jxGmWInDQFaCUkpj3uy1aw==","fsize":38770,"resto":0,"id":"c\/dI22aK","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-impressed-with-the-new-old-right-wingers-here","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":0,"unique_ips":9},{"no":122691146,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:19:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122690926\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122690926<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;showing your dad \/pol\/<\/span><br>wat","time":1493093949,"resto":122690926,"id":"7S5Fy+a4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122691293,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:20:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122691146\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122691146<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;My whole family browses and posts on \/pol\/<\/span><br>What&#039;s the problem nigger?","time":1493094051,"resto":122690926,"id":"t1OMarFl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122691414,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:22:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122690926\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122690926<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/pol\/ is a Christian board<\/span><br>You should have lurked more, most are atheist here, we just support and respect Christian values and tradition. <br>The bible is still one of the Jewish fairytales","time":1493094125,"resto":122690926,"id":"jj+CPGWs","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122691582,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:23:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122691414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122691414<\/a><br>Most of us here in the US are at least culturally Christian, though.","time":1493094224,"resto":122690926,"id":"t1OMarFl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122691623,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:24:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122691414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122691414<\/a><br>Ok thanks - I am still new to all of this.

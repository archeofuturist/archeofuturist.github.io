ALmost all of them have heard the calls for all the whites to be gotten rid of, but if you harp on the inherent inferiority of all blacks and how AA looks to solve that, then you&#039;re repackaging an argument they agree with in new terms which will hopefully start them down the path of questioning AA and all this dumbassery.","time":1492016535,"resto":120776432,"id":"0we+qJ6e","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120779794,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)13:18:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120778094\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120778094<\/a><br>True, but I think most normies already suspect that Blacks are inferior to Whites. Blacks themselves understand this, which is why you see the constant WE WUZ KANGS shit flying around. They need to block our their own insecurities with flights of fancy. Even liberals know blacks are inferior, they just have a hard time admitting this to themselves. <br><br>The reason I recommend replacing the entire MIT staff with Black females is to get MIT invested into their own bullshit. Too often, the people who promote &quot;diversity&quot; don&#039;t have skin in the game, so they don&#039;t have to pay for their own bad decisions. So, I want MIT to pay, and pay hard, for their own bad ideas. It&#039;s the only way to get them to adopt good ideas and, finally, shun SJWs.","time":1492017503,"resto":120776432,"id":"jcWXAuhD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120780478,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)13:24:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120776432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120776432<\/a><br>The family unit is a social construct, and it breeds heteronormative, transphobic and homophobic opinions.

Even if we all get genocided by the jews or the muslims or whatever fucking savages exist on this Earth, our race built civilization from anarchy and made the whole world bow to our feet.<br><br>I just want you to know: it was worth it. You guys make the pain bearable when I have to hold my tongue in public, when I can&#039;t speak out against zionist tricks, when I have to pretend to be normal when I feel a burning rage deep in my heart.<br><br>I love you. Each and every one of you. Our ancestors have fought countless wars against one another, but today in the twilight of white civilization, we are all brothers against the barbarians. Should we perish, let us die together fighting. Should we succeed, let&#039;s finish the job and make sure this can never happen again.<br><br><br> Thank you, each and every one of you.","filename":"300","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":375,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1492474779352,"time":1492474779,"md5":"FkaPiV0UxBb129ZlbBK6qw==","fsize":69539,"resto":0,"id":"fIypZERF","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-we-get-a-white-bortherhood-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":3,"unique_ips":5},{"no":121608311,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)20:22:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"They called me a dreamer.","filename":"1482103001787-pol","ext":".jpg","w":4076,"h":1896,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":58,"tim":1492474958587,"time":1492474958,"md5":"7lqvijYDWf0PNOH1yn5KgQ==","fsize":1591582,"resto":121607973,"id":"3B3u2z+w","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121608313,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)20:22:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"Kek vult","time":1492474961,"resto":121607973,"id":"faeohloS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121608378,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)20:23:16","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IMG_5265","ext":".jpg","w":3100,"h":1656,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":66,"tim":1492474996754,"time":1492474996,"md5":"1KWlb9zwgHMedghXG\/8NsA==","fsize":762980,"resto":121607973,"id":"Lv+jPpZp","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121608592,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)20:25:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ever watch those nature documentaries on the cable?","time":1492475106,"resto":121607973,"id":"m69+y+0I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121608671,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)20:25:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121608311\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121608311<\/a>","filename":"wolf","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":697,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1492475151591,"time":1492475151,"md5":"0pabYWlj9gVKJo8\/e6UT6w==","fsize":126869,"resto":121607973,"id":"fIypZERF","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

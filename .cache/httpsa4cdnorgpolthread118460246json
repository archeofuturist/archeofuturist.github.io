We use it because it has all the prophecies regarding the Messiah. The Catholic and Protestant Bibles do not use it, but use the Jewish Masoritic Text, which was completed around 1000AD by Jews and altered deliberately to &quot;disprove&quot; Christ as the Messiah. So Psalms, ages of people, and Prophecies were corrupted purposfully. Hence why the Septuigint is best, it&#039;s older and literally the same Scripture Christ and the Apostles used in the Temple, those that weren&#039;t gentiles.","time":1490587080,"resto":118460246,"id":"XsLxrwmA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Whatever the original Christian faith actually was probably 75% or more was replaced by the most powerful people at the time rewriting it to be the Roman state religion by deliberately appealing to every other faith - mostly by including some element of it. <br><br>Yet, it&#039;s been a painful process realizing how much better a Christian community is than an atheistic one which is vulnerable to degeneracy and the international Jew. I feel like a man who&#039;s watched most of his open-minded leftist friends be brutally Stroggified on the leftist assembly line. You know, until I was finally rejected from something I really wanted and worked very hard to get for being white, just because some &quot;PoC&quot; cunt could get away with it. I didn&#039;t believe until the knife was in my back - that&#039;s my shame but also why I am saved from having my personality and desires stripped away to be replaced with guilt, true intolerance and complacency\/acceptance of Zionism and the international Jew. I used to think Christians were the most dangerous people in the world but now I see they&#039;re actually the best, I unironically moved to a rural town and joined their church - my life was transformed by this, saved. I went back to school, I lost tons of weight, I learned to do things in the real world and I had real people, trustworthy people, at my side because of their faith in Christ. There&#039;s no &quot;fortress of I don&#039;t give a fuck about you&quot; in these communities, there&#039;s no projective identification, no hatred. <br><br>The society leftists want to create in cooperation with the international Jew is objectively inferior for human health and happiness, it is inherently degenerate and generative of further degeneracy.

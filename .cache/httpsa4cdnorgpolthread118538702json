I didn&#039;t believe until the knife was in my back - that&#039;s my shame but also why I am saved from having my personality and desires stripped away to be replaced with guilt, true intolerance and complacency\/acceptance of Zionism and the international Jew. I used to think Christians were the most dangerous people in the world but now I see they&#039;re actually the best, I unironically moved to a rural town and joined their church - my life was transformed by this, saved. I went back to school, I lost tons of weight, I learned to do things in the real world and I had real people, trustworthy people, at my side because of their faith in Christ. There&#039;s no &quot;fortress of I don&#039;t give a fuck about you&quot; in these communities, there&#039;s no projective identification, no hatred. <br><br>The society leftists want to create in cooperation with the international Jew is objectively inferior for human health and happiness, it is inherently degenerate and generative of further degeneracy.

These assembled sons of the local universe, the creatures of Michael, did this on their own responsibility; Gabriel had not assembled them. By midnight they had arrived at the conclusion that the creature could do nothing to facilitate the resurrection of the Creator. They were disposed to accept the advice of Gabriel, who instructed them that, since Michael had \u201claid down his life of his own free will, he also had power to take it up again in accordance with his own determination.\u201d Shortly after the adjournment of this council of the archangels, the Life Carriers, and their various associates in the work of creature rehabilitation and morontia creation, the Personalized Adjuster of Jesus, being in personal command of the assembled celestial hosts then on Urantia, spoke these words to the anxious waiting watchers:","time":1490645440,"resto":118538702,"id":"85YPLY0n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118555123,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)16:11:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118555074\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118555074<\/a><br>189:0.2 (2020.2) \u201cNot one of you can do aught to assist your Creator-father in the return to life.

That which you observe is the mortal transit of Jesus of Nazareth from life in the flesh to life in the morontia. The spirit transit of this Jesus was completed at the time I separated myself from his personality and became your temporary director. Your Creator-father has elected to pass through the whole of the experience of his mortal creatures, from birth on the material worlds, on through natural death and the resurrection of the morontia, into the status of true spirit existence. A certain phase of this experience you are about to observe, but you may not participate in it. Those things which you ordinarily do for the creature, you may not do for the Creator. A Creator Son has within himself the power to bestow himself in the likeness of any of his created sons; he has within himself the power to lay down his observable life and to take it up again; and he has this power because of the direct command of the Paradise Father, and I know whereof I speak.\u201d<br><br>189:0.3 (2020.3) When they heard the Personalized Adjuster so speak, they all assumed the attitude of anxious expectancy, from Gabriel down to the most humble cherubim.

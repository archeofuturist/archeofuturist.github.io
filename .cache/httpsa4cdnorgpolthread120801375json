But in a lot of places the indigenous people resisted the cultural change and ultimately shot it down in favor of their culture- but they happily took all of the innovations and adopted them as their own of course. I think Europe was the only place the Aryans were able to survive in in the end, and that&#039;s why in other places where they may have been for even longer they didn&#039;t make such an impact. In Europe it seems they bred with each other and created what we see as modern Europeans- less robust and swarthy like the indigenous, but less Archaic and severe like the indo Europeans too.","time":1492031824,"resto":120801375,"id":"ipY+WHdz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120810825,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)17:19:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120808137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120808137<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;price of gold confirming<\/span><br><br>gold and silver are priced out of washington DC by computers trading derivatives on margin,<br>you can&#039;t tell shit by the price as they are totally manipulated <br><br>not saying buy silver and bitcoin at today&#039;s prices compared to where they will be soon though isn&#039;t a steal, it is the smartest move fiscally for individuals","filename":"420 blaze it","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492031966188,"time":1492031966,"md5":"C4Cmv99tLLR1n4vJxck9Ag==","fsize":109563,"resto":120801375,"id":"6w5Y1mGW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120810903,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)17:19:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120809352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120809352<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;even neanderthal had red and blond hair and light eyes<\/span><br><br>These were separate genetic mutations from the light hair and light eyes in homo-sapiens.

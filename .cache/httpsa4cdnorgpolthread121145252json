(Of particular note are Guy Debord, &quot;killed by the spectacle he sought to expose&quot;, and now I&#039;ve just read Mark Fisher, the guy who wrote &quot;Capitalist Realism&quot; also killed himself in January. I&#039;m still going through a backlog of his blog-posts. Then you&#039;ve got the likes of Dominique Venner on the right doing the same thing. It&#039;s very disturbing.)<br><br>It wouldn&#039;t seem too outlandish a hypothesis to me to say that anyone who comes to realize the true depth of our social and political mire would be overcome by it. <br><br>And then you realize most people blot out half their analysis: The left-guys tend to have less focus on migration or demographic concerns (Which isn&#039;t to say they necessarily enjoy it, it&#039;s just on the periphery of their interest. The same with the right and economic concerns about neoliberalism, which many will support because of the way it dismantles or renders useless the social-democratic welfare state.), while both analyses actually have merit. In other words, knowing 50% of how bad things are could be enough to make you suicidal, god knows where a synthesis leads you.","time":1492218864,"resto":121145252,"id":"c8pEth4I","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121145739,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)21:15:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"sobered up boyos. karen a shit.

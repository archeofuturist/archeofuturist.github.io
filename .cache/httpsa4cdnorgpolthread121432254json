Plus taxes each year and other fees. <br>And this is if you dont go all out. Then you need cash to go shopping plus food and other things. This can cost you 5k-10k per day. Lets say 3 Mil per year. Your Car fleet A few Supercars maybe a Bugatti and you need a few Rolls Royce at every location you go to. Say 10-15 Million plus another 1.5 Million yearly for maintainenace and garage costs. <br><br>A Yacht can cost you 100 Million easy plus 10 Million per year for personel fuel and a place to dock. You need this so you can drive around Ibiza and Monaco. <br><br>Trust me with 500 Million you will have to limit yourself severly so its not gone after a decade. Also rich people usually are too afraid to loose everything so often they invest everything and never touch the actual sum.

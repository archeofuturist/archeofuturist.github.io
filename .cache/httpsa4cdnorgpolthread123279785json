There was an Aryan mystic and the first Aryan prophet who conceived of a single all-good God, who was wise and compassionate. The Aryan was called Zoroaster, his God was called Ahura Mazda. Zoroaster also invented the concept of &quot;dualism&quot; meaning there is also an all-evil entity who fights against the God and mankind. Sound familiar? It should ;) His name in Greek was Zoroaster, and his religion is called Zoroastrianism, and it was created roughly 500 years before the Jews stopped worshiping clay idols. The ancient Aryans spread this religion throughout the Middle East and the Jews learned about it while in Babylonian captivity. The early Semites who would become the first Jewish priests took the religion of Zoroaster and twisted it to benefit only the Jewish people. Even the concept of Globalism was invented by Zoroaster and was originally a very good political system. The Jew has twisted everything and claimed it all for himself. He has deceived you by saying that the Jew first conceived of one God, and as a result, you only know a perverted form of the one God.<br><br>Want more or nah?","time":1493433533,"resto":123279785,"id":"dAUUUkpi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123284915,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)22:40:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123284654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123284654<\/a><br>You don&#039;t think you worship something?

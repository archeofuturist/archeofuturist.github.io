There was an Aryan mystic and the first Aryan prophet who conceived of a single all-good God, who was wise and compassionate. The Aryan was called Zoroaster, his God was called Ahura Mazda. Zoroaster also invented the concept of &quot;dualism&quot; meaning there is also an all-evil entity who fights against the God and mankind. Sound familiar? It should ;) His name in Greek was Zoroaster, and his religion is called Zoroastrianism, and it was created roughly 500 years before the Jews stopped worshiping clay idols. The ancient Aryans spread this religion throughout the Middle East and the Jews learned about it while in Babylonian captivity. The early Semites who would become the first Jewish priests took the religion of Zoroaster and twisted it to benefit only the Jewish people. Even the concept of Globalism was invented by Zoroaster and was originally a very good political system. The Jew has twisted everything and claimed it all for himself. He has deceived you by saying that the Jew first conceived of one God, and as a result, you only know a perverted form of the one God.<br><br>Want more or nah?","time":1493433533,"resto":123279785,"id":"dAUUUkpi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123284915,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)22:40:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123284654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123284654<\/a><br>You don&#039;t think you worship something?

The individual churches are independent but in general are politically far right, extremely opposed to women pastors, fags marrying, are evangelical, sola scriptura, sola fide, and believer baptist - without all the pentecostal snake bs. <br><br>If you go to one of the services, it&#039;ll depend on whether the church is city or rural. the more rural have alot of baptist hymnal singing\/choirs etc, the city churches might have a paid organist, pianist, to do music. Personally, i disklike all the newage Christian songs and prefer stuff like:<br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/zSif77IVQdY during the service. The sermons are usually 30-40 minutes and heavily biblical. Whereas some sermons i&#039;ve seen from other denominations are hardly even sermons but a few short passages getting read with no discussion.","time":1493437034,"resto":123279785,"id":"OTrM9XGK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123290579,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)23:37:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123290226\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123290226<\/a><br>BAIT<br>A<br>I<br>T","time":1493437071,"resto":123279785,"id":"74cyePoe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123290710,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)23:39:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123279785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123279785<\/a><br><br>Rescue your father","filename":"IMG_6834","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":465,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493437153786,"time":1493437153,"md5":"x2APkolhAj2ZtQiAArXNKA==","fsize":82556,"resto":123279785,"id":"7A98f8rE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123290746,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)23:39:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123290226\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123290226<\/a><br>hey there<br>i actually had a bug chaser friend when i was going to music school in SF<br>i mean- these people are super rare, but- however few of them there may or may not be- they exist<br>and by bug chaser- i&#039;m talkin, he went on 3-4 grindr &quot;dates&quot; every week without any regard for his impending doom","time":1493437181,"resto":123279785,"id":"AQ9kekeZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123290923,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)23:41:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"i think everyone is posting more than normal because we&#039;re all excited about getting to post<br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;123456789<\/span><br>we&#039;re yearning for kek&#039;s will<br>good stuff","time":1493437294,"resto":123279785,"id":"AQ9kekeZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123290989,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)23:42:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123290710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123290710<\/a>","filename":"jp in the belly of the whale","ext":".jpg","w":2448,"h":2448,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493437335290,"time":1493437335,"md5":"iIaZD+4jXgBf\/7ACPcD12Q==","fsize":1091038,"resto":123279785,"id":"ATAnD0pJ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123291003,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)23:42:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123288551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123288551<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123289843\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123289843<\/a><br><br>Another thing I forgot to mention is that even though the pope is &quot;The head of the church&quot; he does not choose how the church works, there are key traditional doctrines that he has, nor should have any control over.

This migration marked the terminal exodus of the Andites from their homelands in Turkestan.<br>79:4.2.The early Aryan centers were scattered over the northern half of India, notably in the northwest. These invaders never completed the conquest of the country and subsequently met their undoing in this neglect since their lesser numbers made them vulnerable to absorption by the Dravidians of the south, who subsequently overran the entire peninsula except the Himalayan provinces.<br>79:4.3.The Aryans made very little racial impression on India except in the northern provinces. In the Deccan their influence was cultural and religious more than racial. The greater persistence of the so-called Aryan blood in northern India is not only due to their presence in these regions in greater numbers but also because they were reinforced by later conquerors, traders, and missionaries. Right on down to the first century before Christ there was a continuous infiltration of Aryan blood into the Punjab, the last influx being attendant upon the campaigns of the Hellenistic peoples.","time":1493438325,"resto":123279785,"id":"JsNSQZbg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123292827,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)00:01:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123281965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123281965<\/a><br><br>I&#039;ll also make a plug for Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod (LCMS).

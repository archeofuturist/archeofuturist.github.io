It&#039;s great fun and they never do anything about it because there&#039;s nothing to do. Worst case scenario they cancel their card and get some grainy chink footage from a 30 year old camera to show to the police.<br><br>You know what&#039;s fucking amazing? Icura. The salmon eggs. They&#039;re fucking delicious. My favorite thing to do though is to order like fifteen things of Tomago, and then keep asking waitresses what kind of fish it is. They&#039;re so cute when they think they&#039;re talking to retards. &quot;Nooooo, is an egg,&quot; then you ask what kind of fish egg it is. &quot;Noooooo! Is chicken egg!&quot;<br>Then you act confused and say you thought sushi was raw fish. They get embarrassed. You say you won&#039;t forgive them unless they go out with you. Works every time. Japanese girls are the best.","time":1490517318,"resto":118338973,"id":"0FUISZH\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118339466,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)04:36:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118338973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118338973<\/a><br>Wait how does this even happen?

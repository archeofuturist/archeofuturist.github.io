It&#039;s great fun and they never do anything about it because there&#039;s nothing to do. Worst case scenario they cancel their card and get some grainy chink footage from a 30 year old camera to show to the police.<br><br>You know what&#039;s fucking amazing? Icura. The salmon eggs. They&#039;re fucking delicious. My favorite thing to do though is to order like fifteen things of Tomago, and then keep asking waitresses what kind of fish it is. They&#039;re so cute when they think they&#039;re talking to retards. &quot;Nooooo, is an egg,&quot; then you ask what kind of fish egg it is. &quot;Noooooo! Is chicken egg!&quot;<br>Then you act confused and say you thought sushi was raw fish. They get embarrassed. You say you won&#039;t forgive them unless they go out with you. Works every time. Japanese girls are the best.","time":1490517318,"resto":118338973,"id":"0FUISZH\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118339466,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)04:36:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118338973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118338973<\/a><br>Wait how does this even happen?

Back in the early aughts I was a staunch Bush supporter because I didn&#039;t yet know how much of a kike-owned neocon shill he was (I only blame myself for my ignorance) and once, I was on television with Amy Goodman of Democracy Now! which, if you don&#039;t know, is the most left-wing weasel cuck program on the fucking planet.<br><br>Anyway they billed me as a neo-nazi. I was a hammerskin at the time, which is a sort of skinhead music scene. It&#039;s hard to describe but the beats were tight as fuck and the community was great. I got on with this Jew rat, and instead of talking about Hitler or niggers or anything, I launched into this diatribe about G.K. Chesterton and the case for a Catholic society, because I was drunk off my ass and I thought Goodman was actually kind of hot in a &quot;sexy grandma&quot; sort of way.<br><br>So we have this conversation which eventually strays into talking about His Dark Materials (Golden Compass atheist propaganda) and The Chronicles of Narnia, and why Christian culture is objectively better than secular culture, and they turn the cameras off like ten minutes into it because I&#039;m blowing her the fuck out so hard that they don&#039;t want to film it anymore.<br><br>Eventually it&#039;s just me and this lady talking on the stage, and finally after two hours they have to get two guys to escort me out of the building because I refused to leave until she admitted that I was right.<br><br>I fucking fought these two limp-dicked liberal retards for like fifteen minutes. There was one guy with a goatee, I have seriously never seen someone get up that many times after getting knocked out. The other guy just sat down eventually because he was done getting hit in the face but this kid got up EVERY time. Eventually I started feeling bad for him and asked him if he wanted a drink. We went to the Dunkin&#039; Donuts in Santa Cruz CA, and ate like fifteen buttermilk bars. He was a good kid, we walked in there with our faces covered in plasters, and talked about House.","time":1490519817,"resto":118338973,"id":"0FUISZH\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118342510,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)05:17:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118338973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118338973<\/a><br>who the fuck is that and how can anyone make THAT MUCH MONEY with JUST HER NAME?","time":1490519825,"resto":118338973,"id":"qa79R1z2","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118342677,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)05:19:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw she probably donated money to &quot;muslim war orphans&quot; from one of those emails.<\/span>","filename":"1446177956406","ext":".jpg","w":346,"h":427,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490519943440,"time":1490519943,"md5":"iTKeCoYgvmV42Dr2v1F8wg==","fsize":57564,"resto":118338973,"id":"HWHFwWn8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118342699,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)05:19:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118339339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118339339<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sushi shop<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;owned by japanese<\/span><br>I knew this was pasta from the look of it but I I didn&#039;t know you would have had almost got me until that point.","time":1490519956,"resto":118338973,"id":"qa79R1z2","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118342900,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)05:21:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118338973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118338973<\/a><br>wtf I&#039;m sorry I voted drumph now","time":1490520096,"resto":118338973,"id":"c8Fmv3zy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118342916,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)05:21:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118342492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118342492<\/a><br>Anyway, to make a long story short I gave the guy a job at my fabrication shop, and married his sister.

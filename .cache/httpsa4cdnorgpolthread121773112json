What makes you think she&#039;ll be successful a second time. We&#039;re not dumb, we see them racking up 2, 3, 4 husbands, trying to find that magic combo that will let her be a good wife AND mother, with the least effort on her part. We know how most women are. We know why most marriages end these days. Again - we&#039;re not stupid. It&#039;s relationship red pill. We know the odds are stacked against us - and we have to go through unacceptable amounts of effort to make a relationship work, because of her failure to be a half of a successful marriage.

I get to skip the dating part, like romantic trips with just you two, the months of monkey sex in every room at all hours of the day, the time getting to know each other, bonding, sharing. I get to give up all that - and take on what honestly is a burden, just to be able to get laid? Fuck that.<br><br>Dating is to see if the other person is the right match - not to jump past all that and take on a role nobody involved knows is right for you.

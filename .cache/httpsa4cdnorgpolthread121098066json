When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1480606481750","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492196679727,"time":1492196679,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"GAOb+V2J","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":72,"images":38,"unique_ips":35},{"no":121098238,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)15:06:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"As an Incel, I&#039;m frankly appalled at the capitalistic nature of the sexual order in Western society. <br><br>First off, you have the fucking Chads which are the sexual equivalent of the Bourgeois. The fucking Chads are the males that have extreme attractiveness, a tall height (usually ranging from 6&#039;2 to 6&#039;6), aggressive attitudes, frivolous sexual lives, and have a strong disrespect for ladies.<br><br>Despite the blatant neglect they have for the personalities and well-being of the women of which these fucking Chads fornicate with, they still manage to be extraordinary rich with sexual encounters that involve only the most gorgeous of women. The fucking Chads are also bound to be tremendously successful in their career pursuits as their attractiveness yields the confidence to obtain their dreams.<br><br>When a fucking Chad decides to put an end to his horny tomfoolery and settle down with one of these beautiful, cultured ladies, the newly-wedded couple will purchase a living space, live in it together, and eventually procreate to produce equally attractive offspring. Thus, the cycle continues.<br><br>On the contrary, you have us, the Incels, the sexual equivalent of the Proletariats. Incels are the males who are *genetically* condemned to short height and *morbid obesity*. It is because of our unattractive complexion that we are harassed by the ruthless fucking Chads business-wise and sex-wise. Incels lack the confidence to pursue their ambitions because we aren&#039;t favored by the opposite sex unlike the fucking Chads. Ergo, we end up working in manual labor, low-wage jobs forced to serve under the high-ranking, high-wage fucking Chadmen, the sexually deviant tycoons.<br><br>Then of course, they manage to usurp us sexually as they are notorious female-hoarders. This forces us Incels to marry unattractive women, of which then we will purchase a living space with, live in that living space together, then procreate to produce an equally unattractive child.

Even if she doesn&#039;t find you attractive in any way possible, she will still have to have to have intercourse with you. This applies to marriage as well.

A non-economic good (a quantity of timber in a virgin forest, for example) does not attain value for men since large quantities of labor or other economic goods were not applied to its production. Whether a diamond was found accidentally or was obtained from a diamond pit with the employment of a thousand days of labor is completely irrelevant for its value. In general, no one in practical life asks for the history of the origin of a good in estimating its value, but considers solely the services that the good will render him and which he would have to forgo if he did not have it at his command...The quantities of labor or of other means of production applied to its production cannot, therefore, be the determining factor in the value of a good. Comparison of the value of a good with the value of the means of production employed in its production does, of course, show whether and to what extent its production, an act of past human activity, was appropriate or economic. But the quantities of goods employed in the production of a good have neither a necessary nor a directly determining influence on its value.<\/span><br>- Carl Menger<br><br>Labour theory a shit,get a job.","filename":"1491762297769","ext":".png","w":554,"h":380,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":85,"tim":1492198622150,"time":1492198622,"md5":"NTm7+ezZiXyCs7qr20ZbuA==","fsize":160417,"resto":121098066,"id":"pCHCBpbR","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121103680,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)15:49:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121098238\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121098238<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;polish flag<\/span><br>Every time<br><br>It&#039;s just like japan after we nuked em.

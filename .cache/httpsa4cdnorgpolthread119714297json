Their primary goal is to gain economic and political support from the West. In the past it has even been proven to be the rebels, being the ones using the toxins. If Assad falls, we will have a second Iraq. This is assuming the Russian dont come in and start WWIII before the West can overthrow Assad. Some people in D.C. want the war to go on, and fear Assad will be the one to drive the terrorist out of his region. This threatens the war economy, and several politicians wallets.","filename":"civilians-killed-in-terrorists-chemical-attack","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":350,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":145,"tim":1491459788068,"time":1491459788,"md5":"bvhAmbnf0x3PtBUfVbnBmw==","fsize":169048,"resto":0,"id":"o9txsQSi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-syrian-rebels-are-attempting-to-use-chemical","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":2,"unique_ips":11},{"no":119714759,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)02:30:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119714297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119714297<\/a><br>Have had an article up about this since yesterday, and seen some others spreading the news.<br>MSM is going all out on blaming Assad though.","time":1491460224,"resto":119714297,"id":"v23b5EYW","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119714949,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)02:33:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Just like the last Syrian false flag gas attack<br><br>Same shit different day under the zionist thumb.","time":1491460425,"resto":119714297,"id":"tLloibAx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119715082,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)02:36:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119714759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119714759<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;v23b5EYW<\/span><br>Very odd the MSM would take stance \/s","time":1491460574,"resto":119714297,"id":"o9txsQSi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119715101,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)02:36:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119714297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119714297<\/a><br><br>first will be war against syria next will be war against russia.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;my fighting goyim army <\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=2pO<wbr>MCmVc3wY","time":1491460588,"resto":119714297,"id":"bE86c3s4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119715282,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)02:39:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119715082\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119715082<\/a><br>Not really.

Their primary goal is to gain economic and political support from the West. In the past it has even been proven to be the rebels, being the ones using the toxins. If Assad falls, we will have a second Iraq. This is assuming the Russian dont come in and start WWIII before the West can overthrow Assad. Some people in D.C. want the war to go on, and fear Assad will be the one to drive the terrorist out of his region.

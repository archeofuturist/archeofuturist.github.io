He promised he would do things, then when he tried to do them they kind of fell apart (travel ban, repeal obamacare, get mexico to pay for the wall, etc).<br><br>You can look at this two ways:<br>1. Trump is incompetent and severely misjudged what he can actually do as president. He was cocky and thought just marching into the oval office meant he could do anything he wanted with no resistance. He thought things in DC work like his real estate deals, and that was not the case.<br><br>Or<br><br>2. He knows exactly what he&#039;s doing and doing what he&#039;s been doing strategically. Basically playing the long game. He can say that he tried to deliver on his promises and the &quot;swamp&quot; shut him down. At that point the people that voted Trump in will be more riled up and demand that the people stopping his progress either play along or get voted out of office. This does require that Trump&#039;s supporters stay loyal, and that the people who hate him don&#039;t decide to become more more active in local politics, though, which makes it a risky gamble. If Trump seems weak and ineffectual, he risks losing supporters and driving the left in America to get much more serious about getting him out of office\/getting democrats in the house and senate\/trying to impeach him, etc. However, if Trump does retain followers and the left stays shattered and cucked, this has the possibility of getting him more power as people vote out anyone who doesn&#039;t tow the line with Trump. Basically it&#039;s a pretty fucking huge gamble, something trump is known for.","time":1490502563,"resto":118317688,"id":"ugLSQ9e0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

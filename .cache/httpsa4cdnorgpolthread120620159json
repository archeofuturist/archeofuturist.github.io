Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx

A communist system would thus free individuals from alienation in the sense of having one&#039;s life structured around survival (making a wage or salary in a capitalist system), which Marx referred to as a transition from the &quot;realm of necessity&quot; to the &quot;realm of freedom.&quot; As a result, a communist society is envisioned as being composed of an intellectually-inclined population with both the time and resources to pursue its creative hobbies and genuine interests, and to contribute to creative social wealth in this manner. Karl Marx considered &quot;true richness&quot; to be the amount of time one has at his or her disposal to pursue one&#039;s creative passions. Marx&#039;s notion of communism is in this way radically individualistic.","filename":"7f9777c7aa921c0d165505ffaed788b9df7f798715b9d66637af0f3cc2bd1928","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":933,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491931673827,"time":1491931673,"md5":"cAPHLuA35v6eT85c3T8vaw==","fsize":292634,"resto":120620159,"id":"9mgmfAg1","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":120624994,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)13:28:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120624917\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120624917<\/a><br>Hah Whoa Kewl Anime My Bro","time":1491931708,"resto":120620159,"id":"k9o4Bhna","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120625034,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)13:28:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120624692\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120624692<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A communist economic system would be characterized by blablablabla<\/span><br>Actually, it brought you death by couple patriotic Finns<br><br>Suojeluskunnat Suomenmaassa<br>j\u00e4rjestyst\u00e4 vaatii,<br>kaikki ryss\u00e4t maasta pois<br>ja alas punakaarti.<br><br>Hei!

Petty-bourgeois culture is capitalistic, fixated on the defence of the old order and on a mass education which will conform to the interests of the propertied classes. The petty-bourgeois mentality tends, above all in politics, to separate action from the word: the word is conceived as an antagonist to action or as a false substitute for it (compare the \u2018 symbolic gestures\u2019 practised by French radicalism). The bravest souls of the Russian middle classes, who sympathized with the revolution long before it became a reality, thought it should be confined to the bourgeois revolution which would open an era of sound reforms. Proletarian revolution appears to them like an invasion of barbarians, a collapse into anarchy, a blasphemy against the idea of revolution itself.The middle classes wanted the bourgeois revolution to inaugurate a democratic re-public in which they would have constituted the administrative classes and where capitalist development would have proceeded unchecked: this conception was particularly firm among the Mensheviks and the S-Rs who at this time were the most conscious ideologists of the petty-bourgeoisie.<br><br>The Utopianism of this class was also shocked by the reality of the revolution: the harsh, bloody reality that was so different from the romantic idyll they had often dreamed of. The workers and the soldiers had quite another approach here, accustomed as they were to living among harsh and bloody realities, enduring necessities in all their naked brutality, brought up in the school of repression and imperialist war.<br><br>To the enlightened middle classes, the October Revolution seemed like a putsch engineered by a handful of fanatical doctrinaires with the support of a frightful, anarchic movement of uncivilized commoners.<br><br>Victor Serge: &#039;Year One of the Russian Revolution &#039; (1930)","time":1491932704,"resto":120620159,"id":"+lrEZFaO","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":120627514,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)13:47:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120627048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120627048<\/a><br>if thats not proof of mental illness i dont know what is","time":1491932854,"resto":120620159,"id":"V5qRZEkJ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120627743,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)13:49:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120627048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120627048<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if you don&#039;t follow this Jewish ideology then we should make it a thread for Israeli puppet<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Israeli wars are our wars<\/span><br>lol","filename":"1491724147064","ext":".jpg","w":211,"h":211,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491932957729,"time":1491932957,"md5":"Ub03NM0rTwj7v25S0nzzbA==","fsize":35354,"resto":120620159,"id":"UndZeJ\/i","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120628096,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)13:51:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120620159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120620159<\/a><br>Communism is garbage.

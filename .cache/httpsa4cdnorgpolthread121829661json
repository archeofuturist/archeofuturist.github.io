Maybe he didn&#039;t come to lithuania and it&#039;s a sign or evidence of activity of intelligence community weapons of mass destruction operations where credit card carding is one aspect of it. Think of Wells Fargo scandal with 2 million fake identities. Notice the bank in question folded right after Breivik escapades. Lithuania government had to hire shit martini stirrers from rainbow donut in London to come to clean up their mess. <br>Incidentally bank was called &quot;snoras&quot;. The word that means nothing in lithuanian or english, but it means something very interesting snowden related in Swedish language.","filename":"54NIKELWBNM1","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492599500895,"time":1492599500,"md5":"+vYg7ElZDf11sGCNAuqzJg==","fsize":100949,"resto":121829661,"id":"gs5tEMD4","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":121831959,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:06:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121829661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121829661<\/a><br>I have no idea, but I think about it whenever I masturbate","time":1492599979,"resto":121829661,"id":"t74iNui0","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121832144,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:08:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121831405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121831405<\/a><br>I don&#039;t know what you&#039;re on about you crazy bastard, but I&#039;m intrigued","time":1492600134,"resto":121829661,"id":"\/iamLQeN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121832466,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:13:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121829661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121829661<\/a><br>everytime he jerks off in his private modern and expensive prison bathroom.","time":1492600398,"resto":121829661,"id":"qPw2wP5O","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121832772,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:17:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121832466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121832466<\/a><br> Being a prisoner in Norway is better than being on welfare in the US.","time":1492600653,"resto":121829661,"id":"51sqM7Bp","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121833441,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:26:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"does anyone have some screenshots of what \/pol\/ looked like on that day?","time":1492601176,"resto":121829661,"id":"uCyYvjeU","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121834445,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:39:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121833441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121833441<\/a><br>\/pol\/ didn&#039;t exist but I remember being on \/new\/ that day.

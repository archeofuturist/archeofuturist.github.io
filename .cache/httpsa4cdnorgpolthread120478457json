Holmes tells us which churches these men attended and how often, so far as the records tell, and whether or not they took communion. With evidence from letters and journals about their personal religious feelings and acts of devotion, Holmes highlights the names for God these men invoked, and the changes that occurred in their religious beliefs and behaviors over the course of their lifetimes. Contrary to the picture drawn by the first president&#039;s early mythographer Parson Weems, Holmes reveals George Washington to have been a Deist who attended Episcopal worship in times of crisis but avoided communion and numerous opportunities for confirmation. Holmes presents John Adams as an avid Unitarian. Thomas Jefferson remained an Episcopalian throughout his life but rejected miracles, sacraments, and priestly authority. James Madison attended church infrequently during and after his presidency, avoided communion, and was never confirmed. James Monroe was the least religious of all. Although his wedding and funeral were conducted in Episcopal churches, there is little evidence that he attended church with any frequency or had much interest in religion.","time":1491858678,"resto":120478457,"id":"RjHDhayy","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120491747,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:11:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120478457\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120478457<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Daily reminder that Catholicism is Jewish infiltration of Christianity.<\/span><br><br>American education...<br><br>Protestantism in its first forms was thought as comeback to the original christian spirit which was at the time strongly influenced by judaism; most of its leaders were jews, thus the nowadays contemplation of protestants for Israel, the fact that they refer themselves to the old testament so much (which jews do too), in Brazil they even built a chuch that is a copy of the temple of Salomon.

Relying heavily on the term &quot;Christian orthodoxy,&quot; he uses it as a foil against which the Deism of most of the Founders can clearly be discerned. Many historians of Christianity would not align their own interpretive framework so firmly as Holmes does with that of the theological victors at Nicea. While Holmes succeeds in making his point about the Founders&#039; Deism, his insistence on a normative definition of Christianity deflects attention away from the considerable role that Protestant Christianity played in the historical development of Deism, and away from the Founders&#039; understanding of Christianity as a religion of nature and history. By making &quot;orthodoxy&quot; so much a part of his argument, Holmes plays into the theological warfare that evangelicals love, even if he defeats them in a skirmish over the Founders&#039; feeling for the mystery of the Trinity. Evangelicals like LaHaye are more interested in the Founders&#039; sense of America&#039;s divine destiny anyway, and Holmes does not dispute or even address the Founders&#039; Christian sense of American nationhood.<br><br>Leaving theological battle over the Founders aside, historians owe a great debt to David Holmes for laying out the Founders&#039; religious beliefs and practices so clearly and meticulously, and for showing how significant the influence of Deism was in America prior to the upsurge in evangelicalism known as the Second Great Awakening.","time":1491858723,"resto":120478457,"id":"RjHDhayy","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120491842,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:12:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120478457\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120478457<\/a><br>All of Christianity was created by jews, even the christian god is a jew lmao","time":1491858724,"resto":120478457,"id":"0d7+Fa92","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120491909,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:12:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120491411\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120491411<\/a><br>The fact that Jews are responsible for the death of Christ was part of the Catholic dogma until Vatican II.","time":1491858751,"resto":120478457,"id":"4HtsnB4J","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":120491925,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:12:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120478457\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120478457<\/a><br>A question for Protestants?

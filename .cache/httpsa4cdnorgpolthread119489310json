They say that this is a controversy, it shows that she has done something wildly out of the bounds of normalcy. Is this business as usual for a national security adviser to ask for a name to be revealed, an American name, if she wants to know more or is this some sort <\/span><br>of a controversy?\u201d<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;McCAIN: \u201cI think the circumstances indicate that there\u2019s a possibility that that request could have been politically motivated. But we need to get to the bottom of it. As I\u2019ve said, and I\u2019ll probably say many more times because I\u2019m kind of boring, this is a centipede. A shoe will drop every few days, the latest the meeting in Seychelles. This is a requirement, in my view, why we need a select committee in order to get through all this because there\u2019s lots more shoes that will drop. I can\u2019t make a judgment on what I just heard. She did have the authority to do it. What was the motivation for doing it, I think is the question.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CAMEROTA: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve heard from the reporting, is that if she saw a masked name that said American number one had these conversations with Russians at the same time that President Obama had imposed sanctions, wouldn\u2019t that arouse some curiosity on her part?\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;McCAIN: \u201cAll I can say, Alisyn, is that I don\u2019t know enough to reach a conclusion except to say this is another aspect of this multi-dimensional scandal.&quot;<\/span>","time":1491325575,"resto":119489310,"id":"AjhQ0gY6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119489699,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)13:06:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"CNN should be taken off the air as a matter of national security.","time":1491325590,"resto":119489310,"id":"w36Krh2V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119490190,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)13:11:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"TL:DR <br><br>CNN is telling people it&#039;s a fake story and telling people to ignore it while they refuse to cover it like professional journalists. <br><br>Meanwhile MSNBC interviewed Susan Rice is also in Damage Control and saying she did not break the law and was &quot;doing her job&quot; <br><br>The liberal media is a joke.","time":1491325901,"resto":119489310,"id":"AjhQ0gY6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119490499,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)13:14:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fuck me.

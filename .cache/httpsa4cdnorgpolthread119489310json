They say that this is a controversy, it shows that she has done something wildly out of the bounds of normalcy.

But I suppose I should expect nothing else from the dullest franchises in the history of movie franchises. Seriously each episode following the boy wizard and his pals from Hogwarts Academy as they fight assorted villains has been indistinguishable from the others. Aside from the gloomy imagery, the series\u2019 only consistency has been its lack of excitement and ineffective use of special effects, all to make magic unmagical, to make action seem inert.<br><br>Perhaps the die was cast when Rowling vetoed the idea of Spielberg directing the series; she made sure the series would never be mistaken for a work of art that meant anything to anybody, just ridiculously profitable cross-promotion for her books. The Harry Potter series might be anti-Christian (or not), but it\u2019s certainly the anti-James Bond series in its refusal of wonder, beauty and excitement. No one wants to face that fact. Now, thankfully, they no longer have to.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a-at least the books were good though<\/span><br>&quot;No!&quot;<br>The writing is dreadful; the book was terrible. As I read, I noticed that every time a character went for a walk, the author wrote instead that the character &quot;stretched his legs.&quot;<br><br>I began marking on the back of an envelope every time that phrase was repeated. I stopped only after I had marked the envelope several dozen times. I was incredulous. Rowling&#039;s mind is so governed by cliches and dead metaphors that she has no other style of writing. Later I read a lavish, loving review of Harry Potter by the same Stephen King. He wrote something to the effect of, &quot;If these kids are reading Harry Potter at 11 or 12, then when they get older they will go on to read Stephen King.&quot; And he was quite right. He was not being ironic. When you read &quot;Harry Potter&quot; you are, in fact, trained to read Stephen King.","filename":"potter","ext":".jpg","w":1596,"h":2850,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491333209036,"time":1491333209,"md5":"18UHPhXvkYHfAyNAG6C\/Dw==","fsize":1236233,"resto":119489310,"id":"zHOxYH5W","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119503416,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:15:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119502848\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119502848<\/a><br><br>I&#039;m honestly surprised we haven&#039;t been pulled into another war from the stupidity of the Dems.<br><br>It&#039;s like they cant stop lying and Fucking up","time":1491333313,"resto":119489310,"id":"AjhQ0gY6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119503446,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:15:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119489485\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119489485<\/a><br>Old people hanging out at McDonald&#039;s in the morning","time":1491333326,"resto":119489310,"id":"S+pmlF1J","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119503534,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:16:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119501461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119501461<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119498286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119498286<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119498091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119498091<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119497649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119497649<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119495368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119495368<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119498207\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119498207<\/a><br><br>Do it, faggots.","filename":"1478147140887","ext":".png","w":1090,"h":1074,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1491333371913,"time":1491333371,"md5":"5FOFA8nVtZCA1MH373Hnyg==","fsize":3518833,"resto":119489310,"id":"nFx8KVAL","country":"SE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119503602,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:16:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119502848\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119502848<\/a><br>I&#039;m happy desu senpai.<br><br>If the Susan Rice story is so toxic that CNN can&#039;t risk talking about it, that tells you that it&#039;s damaging in a way that we haven&#039;t imagined yet.<br><br>Think about all the absurd shit you&#039;ve heard CNN or Lemon say in the last 18 months.

That&#039;s Trump modus operandi: read something on fauxnews or breitbart and then retweet it. Fox News and Breitbart are EVEN MORE politically motivated than liberal news outlets. <br><br>Weeks ago during the House hearing on Russian interference, Dems pursued questions on Russian inference while Reps asked questions about fucking leaks. Trey Gowdy even had his &quot;suspects&quot; list (around 7 ppl) and asked Comey and the NSA director about whether theses individuals might have the credulity to unmask names. Susan Rice was on that list. Present day, it seems that the right wing have found their witch (possibly chosen by how skillfully Reps misled Americans on the Benghazi) as she&#039;s proven to be a simple, easy, and useful scapegoat for them. Also, most of those names Gowdy mentioned had all been used by conservatives in their disinfo campaigns about the Obama administration.<br><br>Which brings us to CNN. The right wing are conflating several issues to confuse Americans. The leaking of Americans to the press was illegal, but unmasking is not. Saying someone with the credentials to unmask someone isn&#039;t indicative of a crime and the right wing has yet to prove any assertions regarding their allegations about the previous admin.<br><br>The WH turned the word wiretapped into &quot;wiretapped&quot; and then &quot;surveillance&quot;. The goal post keeps moving and as it does, Trump loses credibility- not like he had much to begin with. Nothing that comes out of the WH can be trusted. They are wholly political and looking for an entity to obfuscate how they&#039;ve implicated themselves regarding Russia.","filename":"1491288993959","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":540,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491336941483,"time":1491336941,"md5":"rxUHBiJXIYywja3PzzuHuA==","fsize":50761,"resto":119489310,"id":"Xwd8+HMu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119510455,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:15:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119510249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119510249<\/a><br>http:\/\/www.zerohedge.com\/news\/2017-<wbr>04-04\/house-intel-panel-asks-susan-<wbr>rice-testify","time":1491336950,"resto":119489310,"id":"3b4Tx+0W","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119510610,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:17:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119510437\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119510437<\/a><br><br>If you actually believed that Obama literally wiretapped Trump you are a Fucking retard.","time":1491337038,"resto":119489310,"id":"AjhQ0gY6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119510734,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:18:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119510455\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119510455<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Zerohedge<\/span><br><br>Idk anon they are not my go to for credibility.","time":1491337099,"resto":119489310,"id":"AjhQ0gY6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119510740,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:18:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119510455\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119510455<\/a><br><br>nice","time":1491337101,"resto":119489310,"id":"nXD+rdBV","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119510781,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:18:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119510610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119510610<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119510610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119510610<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If you actually believed that Obama literally wiretapped Trump you are a Fucking retard.<\/span><br><br>So Trump is a &quot;fucking retard&quot; then?

What we learned in vault 7 is easily 1000x worse than what the founding fathers went to war over. Complete revolution is the only reasonable reaction to what we now know, but is that what we did? No. We complained about it a bit until we got bored. There wasn&#039;t even a riot. Now nobody even talks about this complete betrayal that the government pulled on it&#039;s people. This dystopian nightmare is just considered the norm now. I think that America is beyond saving if we won&#039;t take up arms over this travesty.","filename":"Cia-lobby-seal","ext":".jpg","w":1330,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1493095848987,"time":1493095848,"md5":"oVoEt4iEnPspA47DanUjyQ==","fsize":594630,"resto":0,"id":"ZvqqOISb","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-seriously-dont-understand-why-america-isnt-in-a","country_name":"United States","replies":29,"images":2,"unique_ips":27},{"no":122694480,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:53:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Can I get a quick rundown?","time":1493096023,"resto":122694225,"id":"AXvjgeq1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122694575,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:54:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"America is too divided.

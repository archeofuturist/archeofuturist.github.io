Pretty much all of the Christian sources I&#039;ve listened to over the years are of the Meek and Mild ChristCuck variety as that&#039;s what seems to be insanely popular in America right now. However, that&#039;s such a disservice as we know that virtues such as Honesty, Morality, Loyalty, Respect, and Family are fundamental pillars to NatSoc and Christianity heavily emphasizes such teachings but is often glossed over for more feminine, &quot;safe&quot; teachings in order to appeal to larger audiences.<br><br>I&#039;m tired of the Cucks that unemotionally beat around the bush, clergy that are clearly extorting their crowd for profit and care only for numbers, and pastors that try to sound profound pulling messages and sermons out of passages just because. All of the required reading and prominent traditional Alt-Right material has been fine up until this point and probably still will be for some time, but I wonder if there&#039;s anyone, or even an entire church, that fills this specific nich\u00e9 yet? Are there any good Red Pill Christian sources and content out there right now?<br><br>One pastor I really like to listen to throughout the years was Mark Driscoll, but I haven&#039;t kept any recent tabs on him and I never recall if he went far enough.

Pretty much all of the Christian sources I&#039;ve listened to over the years are of the Meek and Mild ChristCuck variety as that&#039;s what seems to be insanely popular in America right now. However, that&#039;s such a disservice as we know that virtues such as Honesty, Morality, Loyalty, Respect, and Family are fundamental pillars to NatSoc and Christianity heavily emphasizes such teachings but is often glossed over for more feminine, &quot;safe&quot; teachings in order to appeal to larger audiences.<br><br>I&#039;m tired of the Cucks that unemotionally beat around the bush, clergy that are clearly extorting their crowd for profit and care only for numbers, and pastors that try to sound profound pulling messages and sermons out of passages just because. All of the required reading and prominent traditional Alt-Right material has been fine up until this point and probably still will be for some time, but I wonder if there&#039;s anyone, or even an entire church, that fills this specific nich\u00e9 yet? Are there any good Red Pill Christian sources and content out there right now?<br><br>One pastor I really like to listen to throughout the years was Mark Driscoll, but I haven&#039;t kept any recent tabs on him and I never recall if he went far enough.

They are lustful, rapacious, greedy, perfidious bandits, pests of the universe. Indeed, an entire day would not suffice to tell of all their rapine, their avarice, their deception of the poor, their thievery, and their huckstering. Are they not inveterate murderers, destroyers, men possessed by the devil? Jews are impure and impious, and their synagogue is a house of prostitution, a lair of beasts, a place of shame and ridicule, the domicile of the devil, as is also the soul of the Jew. As a matter of fact, Jews worship the devil: their rites are criminal and unchaste; their religion a disease; their synagogue an assembly of crooks, a den of thieves, a cavern of devils, an abyss of perdition! Why are the Jews degenerate? Because of their hateful assassination of Christ. This supreme crime lies at the root of their degradation and woes. The rejection and the dispersion of the Jews was the work of God and because of His absolute abandonment of the Jews. Thus, the Jew will live under the yoke of slavery without end. God hates the Jews, and on Judgement Day He will say to those who sympathise with them: \u201cDepart from me, for you have had doings with My murderers!\u201d Flee, then, from their assemblies, fly from their houses, and,<\/span><br>far from venerating the synagogue, hold it in hatred and aversion\u2019 (St John Chrysostom, Sixth Homily Againstthe Jews).","filename":"StJohnChrysodomJews","ext":".jpg","w":733,"h":375,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":63,"tim":1493606945023,"time":1493606945,"md5":"2rdAtSpfUfGnR4NpVEFDGg==","fsize":255343,"resto":123544004,"id":"upLiJi2h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123567426,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:49:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123567133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123567133<\/a><br>Don&#039;t read that dualistic garbage.

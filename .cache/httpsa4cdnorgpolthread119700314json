In the discussion of sustaining causation there are two major views:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Divine Conservation: That things ultimately do rely on something outside of itself for its own existence constantly. Details of what that is and why that is are derived from the individual arguments themselves.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Existential Inertia: That things ultimately move and exist on their own and don&#039;t need outside causation. How that works and why that is are derived from individual arguments themselves.<\/span><br><br>I would say, as would others, that the Divine Conservation position is actually fleshed out and sound, unlike the opposite view which usually has little to no argument for itself but amount to just a denial of Divine Conservation in everything I&#039;ve read on the topic.<br><br>I&#039;ll have a formal proof for it in my next post that is the argument in full detail.<br><br>Part 1\/3","filename":"IT NEVER ENDS","ext":".jpg","w":2700,"h":6826,"tn_w":49,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491455659312,"time":1491455659,"md5":"oAXFB7KQep2cxyE33wBguQ==","fsize":1904908,"resto":119700314,"id":"KqbcO7g7","country":"US","m_img":1,"trip":"!!tuOwy1ct2dy","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119708816,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:14:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119708674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119708674<\/a><br>It&#039;s kind of true that humans wouldn&#039;t understand god, because the very idea of the biblical &quot;God&quot; breaks the laws of physics.","time":1491455675,"resto":119700314,"id":"xCT7Z0oO","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119708850,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:14:57","name":"WOLFSHIEM","com":"<a href=\"#p119708788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119708788<\/a><br>This is a retelling of Aquinas&#039; old format. To show the age.<br><br>1. Causation exists.( Empirical Premise)<br><br>2. Act and Potency are classic terms we can use to explain causation: When something is in Potency it has the capacity to become something else, but is not it yet. A fertilized egg has the potency to turn into a chick, an unfertilized egg does not. When a potency is realized, it is actual. To actualize a potency is to take a property that something had in potency and make it actually inhere in the thing. The same thing, in this case, for things within an instant. While they are simultaneous they are still essentially ordered.<br><br>3. When we find an instance of causation in the world we find some potency being actualized.<br><br>4. Something that is only in potency cannot actualize anything.<br><br>5. For some potency to be actualized something actual must actualize it.<br><br>6. If A is actualized by B, then B must first be actual.<br><br>7. Either something must have actualized B from being in potency to be in actuality. Or B is either necessarily actual, having never been in potency before. ( A v B)<br><br>8. If the left disjunct \u201cA\u201d is true then premise 7 applies to a new cause C.<br><br>9. If disjunct \u201cB\u201d is true there is a \u201cfirst\u201d uncaused cause that is pure actuality.<br><br>10. If disjunct \u201cB\u201d is never the case then there is an infinite series of actualizations. And we can apply 7 to C, then to a new cause D, and so forth. With every being having its actuality derived from another being.<br><br>11. If \u201c10\u201d is the case then there can be no actualization, as every being in the series has its actuality derived from another being, but there is no being with actuality on it&#039;s own to derive the actuality from.<br><br>12.

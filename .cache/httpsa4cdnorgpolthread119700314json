In the discussion of sustaining causation there are two major views:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Divine Conservation: That things ultimately do rely on something outside of itself for its own existence constantly. Details of what that is and why that is are derived from the individual arguments themselves.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Existential Inertia: That things ultimately move and exist on their own and don&#039;t need outside causation.

Act and Potency are classic terms we can use to explain causation: When something is in Potency it has the capacity to become something else, but is not it yet. A fertilized egg has the potency to turn into a chick, an unfertilized egg does not. When a potency is realized, it is actual. To actualize a potency is to take a property that something had in potency and make it actually inhere in the thing. The same thing, in this case, for things within an instant. While they are simultaneous they are still essentially ordered.<br><br>3. When we find an instance of causation in the world we find some potency being actualized.<br><br>4. Something that is only in potency cannot actualize anything.<br><br>5. For some potency to be actualized something actual must actualize it.<br><br>6.

This is the standard Apostolic Christian (Catholic\/Orthodox\/Coptic) view to this day. This is opposed to the view Theistic Personalism, which is God as a kind of individual and anthropomorphic to some degree. This is constantly popular between all laypeople for easy understanding and became popular between Protestant scholars since modernity.

Given your girlfriend&#039;s response to you, it seems she has a conception of &quot;religion&quot; and Christianity specifically that will be baggage for the relationship but it would be important to discover if that baggage is simply preconception that you can show is not the case or something more excessive that she&#039;s just not sharing at the moment. The latter will lead to problems down the line when things get more serious and your positions will more effect her. If you think it is workable, I&#039;d recommend it. But if she wishes to resist, do not make life a hell for you both. You do have other options out there. The best you can do for a person is let them be free to decide for themselves. <br><br>And of course realize when they accept God&#039;s grace and virtue in life without accepting it in name.<br><br>God bless you anon.

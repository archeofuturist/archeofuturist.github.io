Because the elites won&#039;t worry about the gradual mass unemployment, since as long as they are in power, it&#039;s a self resolving problem. <br><br>Let&#039;s say in the near future, you&#039;ve just lost your job to a robot, there&#039;s no UBI, and you&#039;re too old\/poor to switch to a shrinking list of careers. What are your options?<br><br>1) Kill yourself and your family before starvation<br>2) Turn to crime, eventually ending in incarceration or killed<br>3) Join radical politics, see above<br><br>Given automation will occur over a span of decades, the process is akin to the boiling frog analogy. Mass unemployment won&#039;t happen overnight, the elimination of the middle\/working class will just progress on its own, until there&#039;s only two types of humans left on earth: the elite class, and the dying class of employees with the skill sets that the elites keep around to sustain their wellbeing, such as security, law enforcement, engineers, software devs, surgeons, high class escorts etc.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But if most humans are gone, who&#039;s gonna buy all the products to keep the elites going lol<\/span><br><br>Before the consumer\/labor class is entirely eliminated, a fully automated workforce will allow the elites to become fully self sufficient. Why worry about revenues, when your private, automated farms, factories and mines will make sure your kind live long enough to turn the entire planet into a depleted wasteland.<br><br>In summary, your only ticket to survive the future, is to gain an employable skill so valuable, someone like Warren Buffet will care enough to learn your name<br><br>Automation = depopulation","filename":"IMG_2413","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":711,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":222,"tim":1490150358821,"time":1490150358,"md5":"OtuTQ3rpWNC7NsdGXRfgYQ==","fsize":127021,"resto":0,"id":"\/TyRZ7oP","country":"TW","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-see-the-future-of-automation-and-its-not-pretty","country_name":"Taiwan","replies":3,"images":2,"unique_ips":3},{"no":117708548,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)22:43:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117708069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117708069<\/a><br><br>I can&#039;t be replaced by a robot. my job requires too much contextual judgement.<br><br>even if they automated all factoy jobs tomorrow, it would take at least 40 years for robots to be able to do my job.","time":1490150585,"resto":117708069,"id":"2X13nA\/1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117708605,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)22:43:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117708069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117708069<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There won&#039;t be a basic income.<\/span><br>Aha.

People who think of the existence of God as a ridiculous notion, presumably by choice, imagine Him as some limited being who&#039;s unlikely to exist by definition. God is generally defined as being omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent, transcendent, and ultimately incomprehensible. Imposing purposely silly definitions on Him (or any definition), aside from being an appeal to ridicule, does not function as a valid reduction to absurdity because any and all imposed definitions conflict with His actual definition. For example, a &quot;flying spaghetti monster&quot; is either not omnipotent by definition, or its form isn&#039;t necessary and therefore arbitrary and non-definitive. If or when the intention is merely to show God is &quot;as ridiculous&quot; as any fantastical thing using false analogies, it is only a redundantly-fallacious appeal to the stone. It&#039;s also akin to saying &quot;Look, I can make things up. Therefore your God is made up,&quot; and yet these are the kind of unsophisticated arguments atheists use, presumably all because they refuse to conceive of possibility outside our comprehension, lest they have to admit we may be held accountable to something outside ourselves.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We have landed on the moon and invented the Internet<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying these are objectively accomplishments or that &#039;accomplishments&#039; have anything to do with truth<\/span><br>You might as well try to argue that God &quot;obviously&quot; doesn&#039;t exist because we invented the VCR.

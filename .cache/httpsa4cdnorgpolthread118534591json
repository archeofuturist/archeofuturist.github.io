If you marry till death, it&#039;s the best for both and the family that the roles are split. Your children will have better education, more amotional support, you save money, your home is always comfy and your wife can relax.<br><br>Don&#039;t let yourself fall for the jewing out of the housewife into the work place. That&#039;s jewish capitalism.","filename":"16722778_1621975917830622_7806589273205232070_o","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1365,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490638193920,"time":1490638193,"md5":"I4TJSKlGLHrtWXCkWSBzUw==","fsize":421734,"resto":118534591,"id":"2Ih9\/I4U","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118540051,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)14:13:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118539226\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118539226<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t.

I think the ideal &quot;family life&quot; should be equally split between both the man and women. For example, when t the husband has to work, the wife stays home with the kids. Then when she has to work, it&#039;s his turn to stay home with the kids. That way they can both spend enough quality time with their children, make a stable income, and each get more time to relax.","time":1490638618,"resto":118534591,"id":"scllkLK+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118542019,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)14:28:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118540521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118540521<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but what about the men out there who don&#039;t make enough money to support an entire family<\/span><br>Scale down your lifestyle. I&#039;m serious. You don&#039;t need most shit you posses. Even in germany you can live well in a middle sizes town for ~600\u20ac renting a middle sizes house or big flat and spending 400\u20ac for four family members (without extra expenses like holidays or such). You don&#039;t have to container through the last week of the month, just get a woman which knows her shit and will invest the time to get the bets deal for the lowest price.<br><br>EVERYONE can have a family. But (((some))) will tell you that commercial shit is more important and that you can&#039;t live without such luxuries although yo would be even happier coming home to your wife and two or three kids after work.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wouldn&#039;t it be a great idea for the wife to get a part time job then and make some money on the side?<\/span><br><br>Maybe, if the kids are old enough and she is bored. Otherwise there should always be something to do. A community can only flourish if enough people care for charities and there like. That&#039;S one of the reasons we don&#039;t have any real communities today. All people work till they die. Nobody has the time to better yours. Ask yourself, do you really NEED the money? Wouldn&#039;t it be better to look out for a cheaper house or miss a expansive holiday?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also, I don&#039;t thinks it&#039;s healthy to be cooped up in a house 24\/7. <\/span><br><br>See above, a women idealy should be the glue for ones community which means she will have more than enought to do and time being outsides with other people.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Then when she has to work, it&#039;s his turn to stay home with the kids. <\/span><br><br>That&#039;s why women shouldn&#039;t work.

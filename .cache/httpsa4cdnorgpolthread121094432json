He said he\u2019d faithfully execute the law. You bought it. Then he said his predecessor, Barack Obama, spied on him, without any evidence of Obama ever doing so, in order to divert attention from the FBI\u2019s investigation into collusion between his campaign and Russian operatives to win the election.<br><br>11. He said he knew more about strategy and terrorism than the generals did. You bought it. Then he green lighted a disastrous raid in Yemen- even though his generals said it would be a terrible idea. This raid resulted in the deaths of a Navy SEAL, an 8-year old American girl, and numerous civilians. The actual target of the raid escaped, and no useful intel was gained<br><br>12. He called Barack Obama \u201cthe vacationer-in-Chief\u201d and accused him of playing more rounds of golf than Tiger Woods. He promised to never be the kind of president who took cushy vacations on the taxpayer\u2019s dime, not when there was so much important work to be done. You bought it. He has by now spent more taxpayer money on vacations than Obama did in the first 3 years of his presidency. Not to mention all the money taxpayers are spending protecting his family, including his two sons who travel all over the world on Trump business.<br><br>13. He called CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times \u201cfake news\u201d and said they were his enemy. You bought it. Now he gets his information from Fox News, Breitbart, Gateway Pundit, and InfoWars.","time":1492195906,"resto":121094432,"id":"aPhq\/CY7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121096569,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:51:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121096201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121096201<\/a><br>Considering the fact that Kim currently has less than 10 a-bombs in his arsenal and producing them isn&#039;t easy for them, I&#039;d say it wouldn&#039;t be too difficult to denuclearise them","time":1492195910,"resto":121094432,"id":"6npab94c","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121096632,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:52:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121096463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121096463<\/a><br>Pls go back","filename":"1491730283996","ext":".png","w":680,"h":881,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492195949929,"time":1492195949,"md5":"rtVSwacInaM28Fy4w6gGhg==","fsize":1089372,"resto":121094432,"id":"0muRBwKm","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121096637,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:52:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121095725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121095725<\/a><br>Please do!

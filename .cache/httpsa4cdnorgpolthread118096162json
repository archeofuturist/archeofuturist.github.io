The Ashkenazim and their fabled intellect came into exisence in the Rhineland, over centuries of co-existence with Germans (including more than a little DNA contribution from them).<br><br>Late 1800s Germany decides it wants to form itself as a country out of a large collection of smaller states. The powerful of England, France, and America all hate this as it makes Germany a powerful economic adversary, and changes the balance of power. This is the most deeply-seated and under-reported cause of World War I. The MONEY people of the world - men of hubris - thought they they had the right to decide the fate of nation of people. World War I is made to happen. Just as Germany is on the brink of winning it, Zionists use their leverage to get a promise for the creation of Israel. In return they bring in America and a bunch of money to win it for Britain. After World War I, witht he Treaty of Versailles, crushingly egregious conditions are placed on Germany, and it was impoverished to the point of desperation. International Jewry started buying EVERYTHING up while it was on its knees. Like, picking its carcass. Meanwhile the German culture was being deliberately steered into degeneracy. When Germans finally started organizing themselves again, International Judaea publicly declared war on Germany, in 1933, which is what really tipped things into the direction where nasty shit was unavoidable.<br><br>So, the question isn&#039;t: &quot;why did the Germans hate the Jews so much?&quot;<br><br>The question is: &quot;why did the powerful Jews of the world hate the people who hosted them for a thousand years and allowed them to flourish so much?&quot;","filename":"versailles","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":641,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1490374474126,"time":1490374474,"md5":"3TaPM2g5+8VxigaZ0UqqUA==","fsize":103775,"resto":118096162,"id":"4CcioUUS","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118101371,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:02:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118096162\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118096162<\/a><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/qTYSv_YQOVo<br>Got you covered senpai.","time":1490374945,"resto":118096162,"id":"+zrJxFyB","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":118101588,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:04:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118096162\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118096162<\/a><br>germans have always hated jews, it&#039;s part of our nature<br>you better deal with it and btw you have many germans in america who also hate jews, because they are german<br>trump is trying hard to cover the fact up that he hates jews","time":1490375074,"resto":118096162,"id":"WqcN\/OIn","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118101732,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:05:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118096162\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118096162<\/a><br><br>We didn&#039;t hate jews more than other European countries before Hitler came to power.

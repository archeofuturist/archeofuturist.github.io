Tell them they are going to Hell. They will be punished in eternal Hell, all those who abuse My children and babies, and those who sacrifice them to Satan. Oh how My anger burns hot against those who abuse My children and babies, and sacrifice them to the enemy Satan, and eat their flesh, drinking their blood in Satanic rituals. Oh how My anger burns hot against those evil scoundrels who abuse My children, it will have been better than they had never been born. Oh the punishment in store for all eternity in Hellfire for those who abuse My children and infants. I will punish them forever, Brian, and few will escape My wrath and be saved in their lifetime. Few will make it to My Heaven, My son. They prefer sexual pleasure to living holy and pure, Satanic sacrifices and orgies to My gain. Oh how My wrath burns against them. The country will be destroyed because of them. Expect Washington and New York destroyed by nuclear fire, and the rest rounded up and executed throughout the land by lynch mobs, the angry public motivated by My anger and rage. Oh how few will escape the lynch mobs, to escape with their lives to other lands. Brian, this evil must be cleansed from the land, I will make sure of it. Many will be executed publically for molesting My children, and sacrificing them to Satan. Many will perish because of them, the angry public will perform the job of cleansing the land. Oh the stench of sin reaches the Heavens, and America won\u2019t last much longer in its present state, for the pedophiles will be rooted out of the land, and apathy will be no more. Few will make it to My Heaven, and the slain of the Sword of the LORD will be many. Expect it! The LORD of Hosts has spoken.

And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the midst of them, And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name receiveth me. But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh! Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off, and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire. And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire. Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in heaven. Matthew 18:1-10<br> <br>And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea.

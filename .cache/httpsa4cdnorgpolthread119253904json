While attending college, he worked as an intern for National Public Radio member station KLCC in Eugene, Oregon. He moved to Portland, Oregon soon after. He wrote for the local newspaper for a short while, and then began working for Freightliner as a diesel mechanic, continuing until his writing career took off. During that time, he wrote manuals on fixing trucks and had a stint as a journalist, a job to which he did not return until after he became a successful novelist. After casually attending a seminar held by an organization called Landmark Education, Palahniuk quit his job as a journalist in 1988.[8] He performed volunteer work for a homeless shelter and volunteered at a hospice as an escort, providing transportation for terminally ill people and bringing them to support group meetings.","time":1491172291,"resto":119253904,"id":"OZlKcSlP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119255420,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:32:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119255242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119255242<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The movie ends with a bunch of credit card companies blowing up<\/span><br>Communist","time":1491172339,"resto":119253904,"id":"OZlKcSlP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119255484,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:32:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119253904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119253904<\/a><br>The end of The Human Centipede 3<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This is exactly what America needs<\/span>","time":1491172363,"resto":119253904,"id":"GujZdwy1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119255487,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:32:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=a1T<wbr>f5uuGvjs","time":1491172365,"resto":119253904,"id":"9DoXvbdE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119255542,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:33:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119255303\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119255303<\/a><br>He&#039;s not redpilled he essentially disowned the movie when he saw what he created","time":1491172388,"resto":119253904,"id":"uj7jb2QM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119255570,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:33:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119255242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119255242<\/a><br>Nah, it end with him in an asylum while his brainwashed drones remind him that they will continue working on the prject and they await his (Tyler) come back","time":1491172401,"resto":119253904,"id":"syjBzgKj","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119255684,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:34:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119255420\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119255420<\/a><br>(((Credit Card Companies)))","time":1491172464,"resto":119253904,"id":"uj7jb2QM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119255820,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:35:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119255420\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119255420<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anarcho-primitivist<\/span><br>Ftfy<br><a href=\"#p119255309\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119255309<\/a><br>No it&#039;s about masculinity and anarchy, you dumb fuck.","time":1491172541,"resto":119253904,"id":"\/zHq7llO","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":119255945,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:36:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119253904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119253904<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uZT<wbr>DgfQmWiU","time":1491172605,"resto":119253904,"id":"dcH62uxe","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119256060,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:37:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119253994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119253994<\/a><br>At least they fixed the cover, I remember seeing one that featured a T-90 which is a Russian tank.

They have fitted the world situation up to this time.

They attempt to direct internal dissent into outward hostility.<br><br>Reminder if Russia falls completely, the USA will be the next rhodesia. We will have no friends in the world that aren&#039;t outright jewish puppets. We will have no options if a European nation breaks the chains before us, because our slave government, shepherded by the intelligence services and media, will just bomb them into submission and import third worlders into the ruins. Then, in turn, we will have no recourse if they decide the grip has slipped too far and attempt to Samson us.<br><br>We NEED the russian people on our side. We NEED Russia as our eternal ally.<br><br>Atleast there&#039;s a chance the Russian people can break free of the shell, but we need to work together.

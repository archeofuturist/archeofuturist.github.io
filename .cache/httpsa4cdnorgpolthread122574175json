These fainting-couchers view women as fragile creatures who need safe spaces and trigger warnings to protect them from the big, bad world. Their main goal is not equality with men; it&#039;s protection from them.<br><br>As an equity feminist from the &#039;70s, I see this new feminism\u2014which is more heavily influenced by Marxism than anything else\u2014as a setback for women. We are not children. We are not fragile little birds.<br>Sure, there are standard (justifiable) feminist demands like affordable childcare, but the mission statement also calls for ending war, free migration for trans people, and an end to police militarization.<br><br>It even protests gender bias in the criminal justice system, which is ironic because there is a clear bias in criminal justice\u2014against men. Ninety-four percent of prisoners are male and, as Michigan Law Professor Sonja Staff found, even when men and women commit the same crime and have similar criminal histories, men usually get longer sentences.<br><br>Basically, the mission statement was a grab-bag of random, sometimes dubious causes.","filename":"1491394804075","ext":".png","w":640,"h":1136,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493032080869,"time":1493032080,"md5":"PKdTDB+zC7S6QZTj4nTXHQ==","fsize":773511,"resto":0,"id":"V0Q6FKmu","country":"IL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"feminisms-goal-is-not-equality-with-men-its","country_name":"Israel","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":122574384,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)07:11:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;equity<\/span><br>dropped","time":1493032271,"resto":122574175,"id":"7bu\/4ifw","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":122574438,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)07:11:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"televised segregation experiment when?","time":1493032315,"resto":122574175,"id":"N4CSBMhX","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122574501,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)07:12:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"test","time":1493032376,"resto":122574175,"id":"75xzSRED","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122574574,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)07:14:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Feminism&#039;s actual effect is to remove any protection society afforded women from themselves.","time":1493032446,"resto":122574175,"id":"7opWVxA2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122574700,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)07:16:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122574574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122574574<\/a><br>Quite a few rich women in the West don&#039;t marry, they only buy sperm.

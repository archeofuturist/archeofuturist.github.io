Because the first one to fracture loses forever.","time":1490197352,"resto":117764872,"id":"978aOJS9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117778540,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:55:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fucking his shit up YET AGAIN <br> <br> This board is a miracle!","filename":"IMG_7438","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":960,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490198100331,"time":1490198100,"md5":"8LBno\/d4tVuJwgJMxK2RQg==","fsize":271090,"resto":117764872,"id":"cCZZZfYT","country":"LV","m_img":1,"country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":117778793,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:56:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/117764847#p117764847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117764847<\/a><br>How about you faggots come bump a thread that actually needs it instead of shitty slide threads","filename":"1476720207175","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":469,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":122,"tim":1490198189610,"time":1490198189,"md5":"kFSyFLgyfLSoeuHeW6pp7w==","fsize":31025,"resto":117764872,"id":"Dy2lBSLH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117778934,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:57:20","name":"Machine Jerk","com":"id delete all my futa porn to keep pence from zapping me","time":1490198240,"resto":117764872,"id":"4EY0oT3n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117779071,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:58:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117764872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117764872<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;impeached for Russian connections<\/span><br><br>russian connections aren&#039;t illegal<br><br>also proofs are required","filename":"1470183785766","ext":".jpg","w":602,"h":604,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490198286284,"time":1490198286,"md5":"7sY\/wdKXWCnwxRveVXF0NA==","fsize":50135,"resto":117764872,"id":"BxKWD4Qw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117779238,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:59:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117765036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117765036<\/a><br>This.","time":1490198343,"resto":117764872,"id":"ahdNq1\/N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117779585,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)12:01:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117779071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117779071<\/a><br>yeah op doesn&#039;t understand that connections \/= collusion","time":1490198466,"resto":117764872,"id":"yf8KAcTo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117779725,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)12:02:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117764872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117764872<\/a><br>He won&#039;t.","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1400,"h":2300,"tn_w":76,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490198523582,"time":1490198523,"md5":"oj8JKZmmaQN+KnGDd1Z4Cg==","fsize":305323,"resto":117764872,"id":"5GnViq1w","country":"RU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":117780524,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)12:06:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"All these retards saying &quot;war&quot; are so naive.

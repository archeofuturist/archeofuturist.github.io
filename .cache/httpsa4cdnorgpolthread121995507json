When he sells bits of his business, those little bits are called shares or stocks. The market in which you buy and sell little bits of businesses is called the stock market. It&#039;s essentially just the same as a fish market: it&#039;s bigger than a fish market, and more efficient, but it&#039;s the same thing, except for little bits of businesses rather than fish.

Being well connected really helps, for example. If you know a guy who works for a gold mining company, and at Shabbat dinner he lets slip that they&#039;ve struck gold, then you go and buy that stock. When the company makes an official announcement that they&#039;ve struck gold, then the stock price goes up a lot and you make a lot of money. This is called insider trading. There&#039;s also frontrunning: if you&#039;re a stockbroker who has just received a very large order to buy a certain stock, you first buy the stock with your own money, and then place the very large order for your client. The large order increases the demand for that stock, which pushes the price up. Then you sell, having made a tidy profit. There&#039;s lots of little tricks like this, and not all of them are totally illegal.<br><br>tl;dr: The stock market is necessary and not inherently evil, but kikes use their nepotism to fuck goys over in the stockmarket just like in everything else.<br><br>t. stockbroker.","time":1492698564,"resto":121995507,"id":"zhyKeuHJ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121999741,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:30:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121998621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121998621<\/a><br><br>There are many things that happen in the financial services industry<br><br>Make business loans, buy and sell bonds<br>Stock IPOs, buy and sell stocks<br>Invest in privately owned businesses, buy and sell those businesses (Investment bankers are basically real estate agents but for businesses instead of houses)<br>Run transactions and money transfer services for businesses<br>Offer consumer financial products like checking \/ savings accounts <br>Offer consumer credit such as credit cards, mortgages, auto loans<br>You could just say &quot;it&#039;s nothing but jewry and it should be banned&quot; but if you had started a small business from the ground up, built it for 40 years and wanted to retire and wanted to find a buyer, you would change your mind pretty quickly about making it illegal for anyone to be in business of helping you.

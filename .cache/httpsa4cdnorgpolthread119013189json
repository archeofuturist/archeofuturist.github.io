In any case, I think S especially ESTP is all about reaction, quick to think quick to say, we get pretty damn excited to talk about things that interest us and speak it like a powerful image. Trump is ESTP as well. For the most part I&#039;ve always been a realist, I&#039;ve never been a really ideological person. I started out as a left libertarian then got into economics and politics more and learned that it was basically a meme (more naturally inclined towards the individualist libertarian philosophy) and then moved into right libertarianism. I&#039;ve never been politically correct, ever. Maybe the S is just that way for certain types but as for me, no. I believed in individualism and a &quot;necessary evil&quot; government for a long while and felt this was the way to go until I started reading into traditionalism and fascist collectivism and what happens with cultural deficiency and multiculturalism in a society. I began a fast track from there towards fascism. I accept truth easily, when it makes sense. I never chose fascism because of what I saw on its cover, only when I actually began to read into it did I fully understand its ideals, anti-communism, fighting cultural marxism, stopping the spread of parasitic leftism in its tracks, all the problems we have today from a multi-party democracy and the need for a nationalist collectivist conservative society with a unified goal. I don&#039;t understand why we should give people a voice if all they want to do in the end is take ours away. The spread of false ideas is worse in the end because of feeble minded people who buy into it. Democracy wasn&#039;t meant for everyone, and politics is much more than just something the average voter should have the power to vote on.","time":1490933111,"resto":119013189,"id":"a\/efNwQ6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119017728,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)00:09:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119013425\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119013425<\/a><br>INTJ checking in","filename":"1486078475959","ext":".jpg","w":748,"h":844,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490933369636,"time":1490933369,"md5":"LaHpM82QVrIfq8brCWCFmQ==","fsize":80845,"resto":119013189,"id":"Txtufpbs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119017794,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)00:10:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119017313\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119017313<\/a><br>Much appreciated anon.","time":1490933420,"resto":119013189,"id":"4xotw51f","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119017894,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)00:11:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"I tested INTJ when I was 19, then I took LSD and took the spirtualitypill, now I am INFP.<br><br>Whateva","filename":"1488497844862","ext":".jpg","w":506,"h":375,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1490933485942,"time":1490933485,"md5":"GI4AIxf25a4AHZV6O3muxg==","fsize":180754,"resto":119013189,"id":"xBkvkWUf","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119017945,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)00:12:02","name":"Anonymous","filename":"national","ext":".png","w":1053,"h":459,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":54,"tim":1490933522786,"time":1490933522,"md5":"M0LH7aOzUfSVMxdnk49gfQ==","fsize":55036,"resto":119013189,"id":"a\/efNwQ6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

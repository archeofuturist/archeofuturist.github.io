Before you call me a shill or troll, just really considering what I am saying here. By constantly stressing Christianity, you are:<br><br>-Making it seem like your ideology is based off of faith and not science, which will always get you labelled as the anti-intellectual side<br>-Associating yourself with a religion that has a history of denying evolution. This means that one of the best arguments for right-wingers now - racial realism - is now totally off the table. If you&#039;re not willing to argue that evolution has impacted isolated groups of human beings differently, then you have pretty much no grounds to stand on. In order for Western nationalism to succeed in the modern age you need to argue from a position of science, not religion.<br>-Giving the left the excuse to call themselves the &quot;pro-science&quot; side and thus they will always have the appeal of the intelligentsia and educational sector<br>-By being against abortion due to faith, you are alienating practically all modern women. If right wing parties want to have success they will need many more votes from women. 53% of white women will not be enough in the coming years.<br><br>So please, I don&#039;t get it. I understand that Christianity was significant for western civilization, but it really feels like we are dooming ourselves by holding on to it so passionately.","filename":"jesus-christ","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":1138,"tn_w":175,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493084246218,"time":1493084246,"md5":"VmAXhrTEq3VTgdD60loffw==","fsize":84339,"resto":0,"id":"7H9YA7Lz","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"please-explain-to-me-how-advocating-for","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":5,"unique_ips":10},{"no":122672588,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)21:39:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Christianity is the final redpill on the JQ.","filename":"oyvey thodox","ext":".png","w":674,"h":234,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":43,"tim":1493084366957,"time":1493084366,"md5":"WEnvB8Hegn3QrJ6fo3e+RA==","fsize":81830,"resto":122672352,"id":"XT31D0R1","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122674538,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)21:56:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122672352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122672352<\/a>","filename":"IMG_2889","ext":".jpg","w":733,"h":926,"tn_w":98,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493085375061,"time":1493085375,"md5":"C75\/LN+kFQVYPvdvOuSjXQ==","fsize":78193,"resto":122672352,"id":"m17XzzH5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122675024,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)22:00:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122672352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122672352<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Muh science<\/span><br>*tips Fedora","time":1493085624,"resto":122672352,"id":"3Sf74ZvT","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122675050,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)22:00:34","name":"Anonymous","filename":"image","ext":".png","w":722,"h":622,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":107,"tim":1493085634256,"time":1493085634,"md5":"Wkm8XyddbGg9QATSwQzpRw==","fsize":34183,"resto":122672352,"id":"m17XzzH5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122675120,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)22:01:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122672352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122672352<\/a><br><br>I actually agree with you. Also if the Christian god was all knowing and could see the problems in the future that would come from people not having a definitive version of the bible all at once why didn&#039;t Jesus a known tradesman build a printing press? The funny thing about printing presses. Several other bronze age cultures created clay tablet printing presses, they just lacked removable type. Either way it seems like the mistake illiterate goat herders would make and not the avatar of an all knowing being. Oh not to mention the Bible both supports and denies free will exists.","time":1493085666,"resto":122672352,"id":"zIW50Jvc","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122675131,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)22:01:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"take off your fedora","filename":"image","ext":".png","w":615,"h":485,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":98,"tim":1493085670736,"time":1493085670,"md5":"X5zODmvcPFNBg+pmbQNIYQ==","fsize":26668,"resto":122672352,"id":"m17XzzH5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122675496,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)22:03:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122672352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122672352<\/a><br>Great question!<br>Agree 100%","time":1493085836,"resto":122672352,"id":"92xxatKX","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122675510,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)22:04:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122674538\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122674538<\/a><br>KEK<br>If it wasn&#039;t for Mexicans then Trump would&#039;ve won +60% of Catholics.","time":1493085845,"resto":122672352,"id":"ZJok63we","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122676367,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)22:11:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122672352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122672352<\/a><br>simply because it is a position of objective morality, that there is a way things ought to be that isn&#039;t our whim or preference, but that of a higher authority, if it were even appropriate to describe in that way.<br><br>It&#039;s simply the split between relativism and an objective reality.

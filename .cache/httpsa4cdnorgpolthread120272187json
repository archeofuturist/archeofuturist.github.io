Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491736885862,"time":1491736885,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"FbMTiWG9","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":5,"images":2,"unique_ips":5},{"no":120272364,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)07:23:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;atheism<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;religion<\/span><br>pick one<br><br>also sage","time":1491737022,"resto":120272187,"id":"Pz3PWZfv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120272584,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)07:26:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120272187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120272187<\/a><br>Nice repost from yesterday<br><br>Nice photoshop, without even fixing the error everyone pointed out that made it obvious<br><br>also sage","filename":"edgy","ext":".png","w":450,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491737196752,"time":1491737196,"md5":"4oGgjpTPdamRdPq0iquR1Q==","fsize":155028,"resto":120272187,"id":"BQAPYFTM","country":"CN","country_name":"China"},{"no":120272607,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)07:26:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;120272558<\/span><br>ni hao","time":1491737213,"resto":120272187,"id":"oH2fNCUg","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":120272655,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)07:27:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;120272558<\/span><br>woo slow internet <br><br>also sage<br><br><a href=\"#p120272607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120272607<\/a><br>hi bump fucker","time":1491737248,"resto":120272187,"id":"BQAPYFTM","country":"CN","country_name":"China"},{"no":120272788,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)07:28:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120272187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120272187<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This pasta again<\/span><br>Baptized on your face.","filename":"14916497544770","ext":".gif","w":202,"h":360,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491737334725,"time":1491737334,"md5":"qfINKwVE+QuhAgGJYtL\/vQ==","fsize":1375052,"resto":120272187,"id":"bNxpgUFU","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"}]}

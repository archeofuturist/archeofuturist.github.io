Read a history book, every single massive empire has it&#039;s &#039;golden age&#039; (America&#039;s was from 1946-1964) and then inevitable decline. <br><br>Look at the facts: Unsustainable debt, unaffordable healthcare, education, and costs of living. All of this happening at a time when the climate is radically shifting to fuck over crop cycles. Oh, let&#039;s also talk about how we are draining the water tables dry. Am I painting a nice enough picture for you?<br><br>There is only one way America is going, and that is down, with the rest of the world. As a civilization we failed to take into account that having a socioeconomic system that is predicated on infinite growth won&#039;t work on a planet with 7.5 billion people. There aren&#039;t enough resources for it, and America has been using up more resources per capita than the rest of the world for a long time.<br><br>There is still much to be happy about in terms of creature comforts, but as a society I would say things are worse than ever. People like to use the argument that &#039;the poor in America today live better than the kings of 200 years ago&#039;, and in terms of material comfort, they are correct. But just because you have an iPhone doesn&#039;t mean the society you live in is moral or just in anyway whatsoever.<br><br>Just some thoughts from some faggot, take it for what you will.","time":1491862298,"resto":120498483,"id":"IS0tQNd2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120501337,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)18:18:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120500456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120500456<\/a><br>I&#039;d say 1918-1989, to be honest.","time":1491862699,"resto":120498483,"id":"Uv1d97AM","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]}

Here&#039;s what Harmeet Dhillon, the lawyer representing said in the press conference.<br><br>&quot;I will say that the Berkley chief counsel letter that I got on Friday said a number of things that were false, they are falsely claiming for example they just found out about this event from the news.

That&#039;s quite possible I know that I sometimes as a lawyer are misinformed by my clients and I&#039;m happy to be educated that I wasn&#039;t saying something correct. So now they can read our 27, or 30 page complaint and see what the facts are. the facts are buttressed by attachments that are e-mails from university deans, university administrators saying fluffy and warm things about the ability to get a room until boom, you can&#039;t have a room because this policy applies and now their main offering to the students is grief counseling over the controversy.

California was once part of Mexico without being Mexican.<br><br>The Spanish didn&#039;t even have a presence here until 1769. San Francisco was established in 1776. Most settlements were limited to the coast. About half the Californio families came directly from Spain. Only the pueblo at San Diego had poorer Mexican colonists. And there weren&#039;t many of them. California only became Mexican in 1822 after the Mexican Revolution ended. Most Californio&#039;s had expected a Spanish victory. Mexican rule only lasted until 1846 with the Bear Flag revolt and the arrival of US forces under Fremont and Sloat. So Mexican rule only lasted 24 years. The estimate is that the Californios and the poorer Mexicans of the San Diego pueblo together numbered somewhere between 8,000 and 10,000 people. This compared to a native population estimated roughly between 30,000 and 150,000 people. Even given the most generous possible numbers, Mexicans can&#039;t have been more than 1\/4 the population of Alta California.<br><br><a href=\"#p123174840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123174840<\/a><br>My apologies my Olmec amigo.","filename":"1920_Alta_California_mission_trail","ext":".jpg","w":751,"h":1444,"tn_w":65,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493372402193,"time":1493372402,"md5":"FPi7NeMQLLSEFxtTy0F59g==","fsize":108564,"resto":123159101,"id":"sZRzcMMg","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123175564,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)05:44:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123175255\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123175255<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Olmec amigo<\/span><br><br>American education.","filename":"US should thank us","ext":".png","w":1246,"h":918,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1493372645105,"time":1493372645,"md5":"x4eS66KXDuPL8e6erGdcvA==","fsize":1041201,"resto":123159101,"id":"\/YQH4kpZ","country":"MX","m_img":1,"country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":123175623,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)05:45:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m almost looking forward to when the Norks nuke this hellhole of the face of the earth<br>At least they&#039;ll take the hollywood shitehole and 50 million spics with one missile","time":1493372708,"resto":123159101,"id":"KEUMaKtz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123175671,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)05:45:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123175255\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123175255<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Californio<\/span><br><br>You meant Mexican.","filename":"GeorgeZimmerman","ext":".jpg","w":982,"h":683,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1493372750179,"time":1493372750,"md5":"xxGYDASTVRaSUSTC0e4PmA==","fsize":84849,"resto":123159101,"id":"\/YQH4kpZ","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":123175817,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)05:48:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123175564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123175564<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123175671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123175671<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;come from Spain<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;go to California<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mexican<\/span>","filename":"83795-full","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493372885266,"time":1493372885,"md5":"Qul+mgha0oQiDLfymJA8dg==","fsize":133885,"resto":123159101,"id":"sZRzcMMg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123175857,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)05:48:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123162218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123162218<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;despite all the farmers being republicans, they&#039;re anti-trump because he&#039;s a jew cock sucking globalist retard<\/span><br>fixed","time":1493372924,"resto":123159101,"id":"neUSMTWR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123176050,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)05:51:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123175817\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123175817<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;come from Spain<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;go to California<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mexican<\/span><br><br>We are their sons, LMAO.<br><br>California is not Anglo, its Hispanic, get over it.<br><br>Studies of the general Mexican population have found percentages with European ancestry of 56%[82] 60%,[83] 64%,[84] and 78%.[77]<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/White<wbr>_Latin_Americans","filename":"del toro","ext":".jpg","w":827,"h":1000,"tn_w":103,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493373087651,"time":1493373087,"md5":"sd4\/Ih5XfRNGRVNt580FJw==","fsize":107796,"resto":123159101,"id":"\/YQH4kpZ","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":123176250,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)05:54:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123159101\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123159101<\/a><br>I hate living in Commiefornia , raise gas taxes to build a bullet train nobody&#039;s going to use","time":1493373257,"resto":123159101,"id":"IbnGHQBf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123176330,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)05:55:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123176250\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123176250<\/a><br>noice.

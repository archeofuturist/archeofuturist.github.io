More slap together shit housing. My city is trying to cram more indian\/chinese\/middle eastern kids in your high schools. Coming next semester we are expected 900 extra for freashman. They shit all over the fucking floor while the mexican cunts wipe their asses and stick the shit paper in the sanitary boxes. Indians wash in the bathrooms via sinks, mostly their damn feet or young children. Chinese buy up old houses and price guage the fucking market. All the whites in the hills are refusing to sell their houses to them and rather sell to nice starting out white couples or general ranch people. Best thing right now is no longer seeing mexicans hang out in front of home depot and if they piss you off with their obnoxious children, just call ICE because at least one of their family members are illigal.

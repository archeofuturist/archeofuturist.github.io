But she never declared much. According to her filings, she earned just 121,000 rubles (US$ 3,800) during the whole of 2012, the year before the villa was purchased. In 2011, she declared 424,000 rubles ($14,000), and in 2009 she declared just 582 rubles ($18). In the 2010 declaration - a pre-election year during which the reporting requirements were stricter - her filings showed savings of 8 million rubles ($270,000). The Putin family\u2019s declared property - consisting of two apartments, a plot of land, a garage, and three cars - remained with her husband, President Putin, after their divorce. At least, they did not disappear from his declaration afterwards.<\/span>","time":1491411306,"resto":119625365,"id":"ARltxUjN","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119626859,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:02:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1491411746,"resto":119625365,"id":"ARltxUjN","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]}

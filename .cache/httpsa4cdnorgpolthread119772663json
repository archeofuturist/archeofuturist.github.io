We want a system where labour is appreciated by its social utility, not its financial or commercial profit. Therefore, we demand:<br><br>Free and universal access to health, education from primary school through higher education and housing for all human beings, through appropriate policies to get this. We reject outright the privatization of public services management, and the use of these essential services for private profit.<br>Full respect for children\u2019s rights, including free child care for everyone.<br>Retirement pensions so we may have dignity at all ages. Mandatory universal sick leave and holiday pay.<br>Every human being should have access to an adequate income for their livelihood, so we ask for work or, alternatively, universal basic income guarantee.<br>Corporations should be held accountable for their actions. For example, corporate subsidies and tax cuts should be done away with if a company outsources jobs to decrease salaries, harms the environment or the rights of workers.","filename":"IMG_2745","ext":".jpg","w":578,"h":944,"tn_w":153,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491502811529,"time":1491502811,"md5":"wilgctrtbn0tv4WX74wj6w==","fsize":85458,"resto":0,"id":"IXP3HprN","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"13","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

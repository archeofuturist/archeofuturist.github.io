Why do I care? I want to know if I wuz kang or not. <br><br>First of all, let&#039;s agree that there is no such country as Moldova; it is just a post-Soviet creation. I know that Moldova used to be part of Romania before 1812 and that after that the territory was ceded to Russia, who named it Bessarabia. After WW1, Romania took advantage of the European destabilization and convinced Bessarabia to unite with them. Later, in 1940, the Red Army came and annexed Bessarabia, following by a Romanian and German liberation in 1941. In 1944, the Red Army pushed the Romanians and Germans out, and Bessarabia became part of the Soviet Union. <br><br>Despite years of russification and Soviet oppression, Moldovans somehow still speak Romanian and uphold their traditions. How could this be? <br><br>Also, getting into German raciology, what sub-race are we? We&#039;ve been heavily fucked by Turks and Russians, so there has been a lot mixing. Would you say we are Dinaric?","filename":"Moldova-Map-Flag[1]","ext":".png","w":1784,"h":2236,"tn_w":199,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492686341259,"time":1492686341,"md5":"4vc1bHD9iXxAQ5zr8VPxiQ==","fsize":184015,"resto":0,"id":"EjnJCFUJ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"since-there-seem-to-be-many-romanians-and","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121983256,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:08:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121983053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121983053<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How could this be?<\/span><br>lol","time":1492686489,"resto":121983053,"id":"JVucMkFd","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":121984387,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:22:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1492687342,"resto":121983053,"id":"EjnJCFUJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121984598,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:25:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1492687500,"resto":121983053,"id":"MNJLYtrB","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

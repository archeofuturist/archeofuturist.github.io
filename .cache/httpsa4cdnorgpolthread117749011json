Use your intuition. Look at how water is universally flat without exception everywhere on earth. The horizon is flat. You will never, in your life, experience the horizon curve. Ever. You will simply never see this, because it&#039;s fucking flat.<br>Look outside at the horizon and tell me you think that somehow, eventually that perfectly level line will begin to somehow curve. Your brain can&#039;t do it. Your brain cannot picture the horizon eventually curving because it doesn&#039;t. Try it.<br><br>There is nothing in nature that suggests whatsoever the earth curves. Absolutely nothing.<br> <br>The moon gives off it&#039;s own light that is colder than shade by comparison. You can test this at home. The moon does not reflect shit. The earth and the moon are the same size. Look at the sun&#039;s rays shining down through a cloud and tell me you believe the source of those rays is 180 MILLION MILES AWAY, while the moon that appears to be almost the exact same size is supposedly only 350,000 miles away. <br><br>Gravity is bullshit, on a plane there is no need for gravity. We&#039;re not floating in space. We are everything, this plane is everything. <br><br>No one has been to the moon, no one is going to the moon, anyone with half a brain can see the entire moon landing was utter cringeworthy fabrication. NASA is nothing and do nothing, they receive billions a year and DO NOTHING. <br><br>Any piece of proof or evidence you present regarding why you &quot;think&quot; the earth is a globe meaninglessly hurtling through infinite space can be debunked. No evidence put forward by people who know the earth is flat can be debunked. Nothing.

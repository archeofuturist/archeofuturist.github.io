Wars of aggression, even in the name of liberation, will never be supported by the party. Alliances will not be taken lightly thus, meaning some current agreements may require reconsideration in regards to the risk and reward factor that it poses the state. Due to the isolationist stance, an overwhelming military like that of the current United States will not be necessary, though the nation will never disarm or leave itself weak in contrast to neighbors or other powerful spheres of influence. With the modest military format, the draft will always be opposed by the national libertarian party on the basis of individual liberty unless there are enemy forces amassing on our sovereign soil.","filename":"Oxen","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":814,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":226,"tim":1493813649368,"time":1493813649,"md5":"\/l26rwhSj\/QxL\/aIYQECcQ==","fsize":128389,"resto":0,"id":"BomBvlms","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"national-libertarianism-a-balance-between-the","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":123906266,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)08:14:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anti-Immigration<\/span><br>The national libertarian party will support closing the borders of the state to immigration save for those explicitly skilled in positions deemed empty and unfillable by nations.

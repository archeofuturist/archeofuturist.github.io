The reason why it will not happen in our generation is simply because evolution has not made us different enough. While many of you may say things like &quot;thats not true, blacks have lower iq&#039;s than whites, different cranial structures, different behavioral patterns&quot; and i would agree, but it&#039;s just not as significant as the differences in birds for example. We still look almost entirely the same in terms of bone structure, only under closer examination and measurement will we find slight differences in size and shape. It is nowhere NEAR as significant as birds for example. Why is this so? Why is it that a penguin is significantly different than a pigeon, or a hawk? one glance at two different birds and everything from their diet to color, wingspan, skeletal structure, beak size, head to body ratio, talon size, is immediately visible, not just color and hair texture like in us humans. This is because humans are fairly young compared to birds. we&#039;ve been around for 5-10 million years where as birds have evolved over the course of 150 million years. <br>Give another hundred million years and we will be as diverse as the birds, and there will be much greater differences in us that are nearly impossible to avoid. And it will be just like in halo, the spartans vs the covenant, except niggers will not be as developed intellectually.","filename":"wtfbirdwarnow","ext":".gif","w":450,"h":513,"tn_w":219,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492755141864,"time":1492755141,"md5":"ELM225zCl4DRaSYLBD9PKQ==","fsize":20461,"resto":0,"id":"0JbQz28Y","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"it-will-happen-inevitably-and-nothing-else-can","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122105686,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)02:16:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122105328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122105328<\/a><br>Youre fucking retarded.<br><br>The only thing that makes humans superior to all other species is our enhanced intelligence.

This has lead to a wide range of differences in people around the world. The main push behind most these changes have been CLIMATE and MOVEMENT. Northerners developed strength and incredible intelligence in order to survive in the harsh climate and hunt mammoths. Many groups (ex. Mongols) developed traits to aid them with their nomadic life (the ability to adapt). <br><br>In Africans, this was not necessary. They didn&#039;t need to move, so the pygmies happened. They didn&#039;t need to deal with seasons, big game hunting, and a slough of other factors. Africans didn&#039;t develop stuff because they didn&#039;t NEED to. Compare it to you not making a spear because you don&#039;t need one. This does not reflect intelligence.<br><br>BUT, throughout all this, humans have retained similar diets (with the sole exception of the Inuit\/Eskimos). We are all omnivores. This has caused a lot.<br><br>I personally believe in race equality, but ignore the commies pushing &quot;There is no differences between genders\/races!&quot;. I agree with Richard Dawkins on this issue entirely.","time":1492755721,"resto":122105328,"id":"NVconb24","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

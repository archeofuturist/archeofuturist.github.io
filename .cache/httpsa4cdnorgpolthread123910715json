Idris Elba is not a good actor. Hollywood is pushing him, and they&#039;re pushing him into white men&#039;s roles (there was talk for a while about making him James Bond). Do they think that if we see less white men on the big screen, somehow white women will just start swooning over the BBC? <br>I&#039;m not sure if that&#039;s how it works, but I&#039;d love to hear your thoughts, \/pol\/","filename":"the dark tower","ext":".png","w":611,"h":358,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":146,"tim":1493817181779,"time":1493817181,"md5":"Vylm344szD9vP1Ny7Le3Xg==","fsize":263249,"resto":0,"id":"V0WPBWcu","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-wuz-gunslangerz","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

He&#039;s getting maybe 40 delegates tops, and that&#039;s being generous, according to what Nate Silver writes on project538.com. After 8 years of Obama, people want someone who&#039;s got a proven record of having consistent conservative values and who hasn&#039;t alienated half of the voter base with his divisive comments and demagogic rhetoric.<br><br>I think maybe Jeb! has the best chance of winning, or maybe someone like Rubio. Can you imagine someone like Klumpf getting the nuclear codes?<br><br>I can&#039;t support Klumpf especially after he&#039;s turned out to be just another neocon Jewish puppet. Trump is fucking finished, he&#039;s not recovering from this. This really was the last straw. All the credible news outlets estimate his approval rates at something like 40% anyway, that&#039;s lower than any other president at this point.<br><br>Do you HONESTLY think that Klumpf can recover after launching the nuclear missile codes at based Assad? I mean, do you even read the \/sg\/ threads? Everyone knows you cannot Mossad the Assad. There even was a Turkish minister who said that he didn&#039;t like Assad in 2011 and he has since then resigned and is no longer the minister. There is clearly a curse associated with people who try to Mossad the Assad.<br><br>I&#039;m telling you man, Klumpf will not recover from this, he&#039;s not getting the nuclear codes anymore. He&#039;s finished, just ask Nate Silver.<br>Literally all the prominent intellectuals who used to support Klumpf and helped him win the election like Stefan Molyneux and also Jared Taylor have repudiated Klumpf, and no longer want him to have access to the nuclear codes.<br>I&#039;m telling you man, Klumpflets are delusional if they think they can keep the nuclear codes. Klumpf will get impeached any second now. It&#039;s just a matter of time.","time":1491856580,"resto":120485651,"id":"HEvH2i67","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120487122,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:37:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;So now that we know Russia knew about the gas attack beforehand<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;somehow the Russians are still the good guys in this scenario<\/span>","filename":"noway","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491856673677,"time":1491856673,"md5":"6DW7sX2eJD8\/\/IKuMYqNZw==","fsize":8182,"resto":120485651,"id":"EwIt2E6E","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120487503,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:40:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120486926\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120486926<\/a><br>Seriously just ask Nate Silver, munpf is gonna get impeached.

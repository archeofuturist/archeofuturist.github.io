Too many people are out for blood, and it&#039;s only going to keep getting worse. Imagine what will happen in 90-100 degree heat if some big political upheaval rocks the country. Maybe they will try to impeach trump. What will the result on the streets be? We can&#039;t just assume that things are going to continue as they are or get better. Remember, as long as trump is president, millions of people, including the media establishment are going to be rearing to oppose him and his supporters. If the media declares a street war against &quot;fascism&quot;, it will happen.

And that&#039;s the most pessimistic view. If anything was going to come out on him that would force a republican House to move on impeachment proceedings, it would have happened by now. The Deep State and the (((establishment))) did all they could before the inauguration and in the weeks after he took office, and it wasn&#039;t enough to unseat him. Trump is solidifying his control on the executive and making any revelations from the IC less and less likely with each passing day. The &quot;Russian connection&quot; is being kept on life support by the democrats, because they have nothing else on him. And they&#039;re frantic because he&#039;s basically going to undo what they&#039;ve spent the last three or four decades putting in place. As to that 2018 thing, that&#039;s in the extraordinarily unlikely event that the House and Senate flip with a supermajority in the Senate to convict on the Articles of Impeachment. Which is unlikely. Next scenario is trump is defeated for re-election in 2020, Anything is possible, but historically, all he needs is to keep his approval ratings in the 40% range and he&#039;ll win re-election. As to OP&#039;s question, the only answer I can give is personal one. Full disclosure, I&#039;m a white male who turns 49 this year. I&#039;ve voted Democrat in the last six out of seven elections. I viewed the Left as more compassionate and inclusive. I thought even when they were wrong, their hearts were in the right place. Being told by celebrities campaigning for Hillary Clinton that I was evil simply for existing and that they wanted to wipe me, and everyone like me, out, made me change my mind. I voted Trump. The Left I thought existed either changed or was really a monster in disguise in the first place. Either way, never again. And I&#039;m not alone. I believe the Left unmasked this past election cycle and can never go back. The mask is off. Never again.","time":1492491465,"resto":121625299,"id":"mhOsfQ+o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121640990,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:57:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"The more crazy and vocal the left gets, the more the silent majority moves right.<br><br>Some feminist bitch screaming about literally nazis is off putting to the average joe, who surprisingly enough doesn&#039;t like to be called such a thing, especially by someone who could almost be his daughter and has no life experience.","time":1492491474,"resto":121625299,"id":"Mtq7K3eA","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121641152,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:59:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121625299\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121625299<\/a><br>Reactionary.

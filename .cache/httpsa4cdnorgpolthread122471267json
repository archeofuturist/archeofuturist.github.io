Your shit stinks too. I am glad a few of you are productive and I thank you for that. I know the community is diverse but the idea of freedom of speech is the impression I am left with. Sure a lot of you just take advantage of your free speech to spout stupidity but I know many of you aren&#039;t like that. The community doesn&#039;t have an consensus on issues but you guys need to work on some shit. One thing I&#039;ve noticed is that even though you guys seems to be against antifa as a majority, a lot of you are just spamming anti-antifa boards or chats with nonsense. Kinda diminishing the chat or the message that is trying to be shared. <br><br>Again, everyone&#039;s shit stinks, get off your high horse you ton of moochers.","filename":"RUST","ext":".png","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492975620196,"time":1492975620,"md5":"tXuKeHIUJhMHJuHKIgzcMQ==","fsize":460611,"resto":0,"id":"vmFiBSwL","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"4chan-users","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122471523,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)15:28:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122471267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122471267<\/a><br>Reddit sucks especially leftypol, don&#039;t you agree op?","time":1492975715,"resto":122471267,"id":"eBqCj4Qk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122471635,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)15:29:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122471267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122471267<\/a>","filename":"t3_61mq3t","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":920,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492975756094,"time":1492975756,"md5":"w7EbyCtBM2tGGsaQ2sDx\/w==","fsize":195782,"resto":122471267,"id":"UbkyUnLU","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]}

I&#039;ve been a big Genesis fan ever since the release of their 1980<br>album, Duke. Before that I didn&#039;t really understand any of their<br>work, though on their last album of the 1970s, the concept-laden<br>And Then There Were Three (a reference to band member Peter<br>Gabriel, who left the group to start a lame solo career), I did enjoy<br>the lovely &quot;Follow You, Follow Me.&quot; Otherwise all the albums<br>before Duke seemed too artsy, too intelleotual. It was Duke, where Phil Collins&#039; presence became more<br>apparent, and the music got more modern, the drum machine became<br>more prevalent and the lyrics started getting less mystical and more<br>specific (maybe because of Peter Gabriel&#039;s departure), and complex,<br>ambiguous studies of loss became, instead, smashing first-rate pop<br>songs that I gratefully embraced. The songs themselves seemed<br>arranged more around Collins&#039; drumming than Mike Rutherford&#039;s<br>bass lines or Tony Banks&#039; keyboard riffs. A classic example of this is<br>&quot;Misunderstanding,&quot; which not only was the group&#039;s first big hit of<br>the eighties but also seemed to set the tone for the rest of<br>theiralbums as the decade progressed. The other standout on Duke is<br>&quot;Turn It On Again,&quot; which is about the negative effects of television.<br>On the other hand, &quot;Heathaze&quot; is a song I just don&#039;t understand,<br>while &quot;Please Don&#039;t Ask&quot; is a touching love song written to a<br>separated wife who regains custody of the couple&#039;s child. Has the<br>negative aspect of divorce ever been rendered in more intimate terms<br>by a rock &#039;n&#039; roll group? I don&#039;t think so. &quot;Duke Travels&quot; and &quot;Dukes<br>End&quot; might mean something but since the lyrics aren&#039;t printed it&#039;s<br>hard to tell what Collins is singing about, though there is complex,<br>gorgeous piano work by Tony Banks on the latter track. The only<br>bummer about Duke is &quot;Alone Tonight,&quot; which is way too<br>reminiscent of &quot;Tonight Tonight Tonight&quot; from the group&#039;s later<br>masterpiece Invisible Touch and the only example, really, of where<br>Collins has plagiarized himself.","time":1491765103,"resto":120320195,"id":"AbGueAG3","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":120320933,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)15:12:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Abacab was released almost immediately after Duke<br>and it benefits from a new producer, Hugh Padgham, who gives the<br>band a more eighties sound and though the songs seem fairly<br>generic, there are still great bits throughout: the extended jam in the<br>middle of the title track and the horns by some group called Earth,<br>Wind and Fire on &quot;No Reply at All&quot; are just two examples. Again the<br>songs reflect dark emotions and are about people who feel lost or<br>who are in conflict, but the production and sound are gleaming and<br>upbeat (even if the titles aren&#039;t: &quot;No Reply at All,&quot; &quot;Keep It Dark,&quot;<br>&quot;Who Dunnit?&quot; &quot;Like It or Not&quot;). Mike Rutherford&#039;s bass is obscured<br>somewhat in the mix but otherwise the band sounds tight and is once<br>again propelled by Collins&#039; truly amazing drumming.

Though it<br>could easily come off any of Phil&#039;s solo albums, because the themes<br>of loneliness, paranoia and alienation are overly familiar to Genesis<br>it evokes the band&#039;s hopeful humanism. &quot;Man on the Corner&quot;<br>profoundly equates a relationship with a solitary figure (a bum,<br>perhaps a poor homeless person?), &quot;that lonely man on the corner&quot;<br>who just stands around. &quot;Who Dunnit?&quot; profoundly expresses the<br>theme of confusion against a funky groove, and what makes this<br>song so exciting is that it ends with its narrator never finding<br>anything out at all.","time":1491765166,"resto":120320195,"id":"AbGueAG3","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":120321105,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)15:13:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hugh Padgham produced next an even less conceptual effort, simply<br>called Genesis, and though it&#039;s a fine album a lot of<br>it now seems too derivative for my tastes. &#039;That&#039;s All&quot; sounds like<br>&quot;Misunderstanding,&quot; &quot;Taking It All Too Hard&quot; reminds me of<br>&quot;Throwing It All Away.&quot; It also seems less jazzy than its<br>predecessors and more of an eighties pop album, more rock &#039;n&#039; roll.<br>Padgham does a brilliant job of producing, but the material is weaker<br>than usual and you can sense the strain.

It might be about growing up and accepting<br>adulthood but it&#039;s unclear; at any rate, its second instrumental part<br>puts the song more in focus for me and Mike Banks gets to show off<br>his virtuosic guitar skills while Tom Rutherford washes the tracks<br>over with dreamy synthesizers, and when Phil repeats the song&#039;s<br>third verse at the end it can give you chills.","time":1491765190,"resto":120320195,"id":"AbGueAG3","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":120321256,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)15:14:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"&quot;Illegal Alien&quot; is the most explicitly political song the group has yet<br>recorded and their funniest. The subject is supposed to be sad - a<br>wetback trying to get across the border into the United States - but<br>the details are highly comical: the bottle of tequila the Mexican<br>holds, the new pair of shoes he&#039;s wearing (probably stolen); and it all<br>seems totally accurate. Phil sings it in a brash, whiny pseudo-<br>Mexican voice that makes it even funnier, and the rhyme of &quot;fun&quot;<br>with &quot;illegal alien&quot; is inspired. &quot;Just a Job to Do&quot; is the album&#039;s<br>funkiest song, with a killer bass line by Banks, and though it seems<br>to be about a detective chasing a criminal, I think it could also be<br>about a jealous lover tracking someone down. &quot;Silver Rainbow&quot; is<br>the album&#039;s most lyrical song. The words are intense, complex and<br>gorgeous. The album ends on a positive, upbeat note with &quot;It&#039;s<br>Gonna Get Better.&quot; Even if the lyrics seem a tiny bit generic to<br>some, Phil&#039;s voice is so confident (heavily influenced by Peter<br>Gabriel, who never made an album this polished and heartfelt<br>himself) that he makes us believe in glorious possibilities.<br>Invisible Touch is the group&#039;s undisputed<br>masterpiece.","time":1491765255,"resto":120320195,"id":"AbGueAG3","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":120321259,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)15:14:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Phil Collins is a nigger","time":1491765255,"resto":120320195,"id":"OIdG+2fs","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120321297,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)15:14:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s an epic meditation on intangibility, at the same time<br>it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums.<br>It has a resonance that keeps coming back at the listener, and the<br>music is so beautiful that it&#039;s almost impossible to shake off because<br>every song makes some connection about the unknown or the spaces<br>between people (&quot;Invisible Touch&quot;), questioning authoritative<br>control whether by domineering lovers or by government (&quot;Land of<br>Confusion&quot;) or by meaningless repetition (&quot;Tonight Tonight<br>Tonight&#039;.

Take the lyrics to &quot;Land<br>of Confusion,&quot; in which a singer addresses the problem of abusive<br>political authority. This is laid down with a groove funkier and<br>blacker than anything Prince or Michael Jackson - or any other black<br>artist of recent years, for that matter - has come up with. Yet as<br>danceable as the album is, it also has a stripped-down urgency that<br>not even the overrated Bruce Springsteen can equal. As an observer<br>of love&#039;s failings Collins beats out the Boss again and again,<br>reaching new heights of emotional honesty on &quot;In Too Deep&quot;; yet it<br>also showcases Collins&#039; clowny, prankish, unpredictable side. It&#039;s the<br>most moving pop song of the 1980s about monogamy and<br>commitment. &quot;Anything She Does&quot; (which echoes the J. Geils Band&#039;s<br>&quot;Centerfold&quot; but is more spirited and energetic) starts off side two<br>and after that the album reaches its peak with &quot;Domino,&quot; a two-part<br>song. Part one, &quot;In the Heat of the Night,&quot; is full of sharp, finely<br>drawn images of despair and it&#039;s paired with &quot;The Last Domino,&quot;<br>which fights it with an expression of hope.

As for the people who say this is all fake and done by the globalists I doubt that, Assad is an ass hole and anyone who doubt that is just retarded. The thing is what the fuck would you replace that ass hole with? ... Yeah that&#039;s right, there are NO alternatives to him. ASSAD must stay there. Anyone who&#039;s against Trump for showing his strength yesterday don&#039;t know what they&#039;re talking about. ALTHOUGH, if Trump starts playing the real globalist card which is throw down Assad, like General Matis wants, then only, it will be time to turn against TRUMP.","time":1491585110,"resto":119983064,"id":"aGxrhHQ4","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119984254,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)13:14:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119983064\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119983064<\/a><br>No. <br>The guy hold the line for 6 years. <br>What would he have to gain from this? <br>You have to think Anon.

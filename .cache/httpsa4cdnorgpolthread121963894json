Stealth is mainly about reducing the radar&#039;s signal-to-noise ratio to make the aircraft unresolvable amongst background noise (which I suppose might include geese, but also includes ground clutter, chaff, stray radio signals, jamming noise, hardware electrical\/electromagnetic interference and even echoes of the big bang). Even a non-stealthy aircraft can achieve this at extremely long distances, but a stealth aircraft, by reducing the amount of signal reflected back at the hostile radar (typically by a factor of ~10,000 or more over other aircraft), dramatically reduces the range at which it will be resolvably detected. Inversely, at extremely close ranges, even a stealth aircraft (or a goose) can produce a strong enough return to be tracked, but ideally a stealth aircraft should be able to avoid this through avoidance, low flight and, if necessary, jamming\/ECM.<br><br>Here&#039;s a super-basic overview of RCS factors, not that I expect you to understand it anyways: http:\/\/www.microwaves101.com\/encycl<wbr>opedia\/Navy%20handbook\/4.11%20Radar<wbr>%20Cross-Section%20(RCS).pdf<br><br>So no, stealth doesn&#039;t make you impossible to detect... but on the other hand; no, you can&#039;t defeat stealth simply by SPAAG&#039;ing every goose you see on the scope either.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. \/k\/<\/span>","filename":"Screen Shot 2014-01-28 at 11.10.05 AM","ext":".png","w":1107,"h":699,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492675355490,"time":1492675355,"md5":"NYYRzJ3NNNGVkhKqykPdiw==","fsize":151767,"resto":121963894,"id":"vJmrLfSJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121970325,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)04:02:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121963894\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121963894<\/a><br>protip if a bomber was spotted but they dindu any bombing then it&#039;s just a show of force.<br>It&#039;s fucking nothing, call me when there are fighters or bombers who actually BOMB something","time":1492675356,"resto":121963894,"id":"8edour0A","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":121970338,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)04:02:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Could America beat Russia in a conventional war?<br><br>I mean these are the guys that lost to some goat farmers hiding in tunnels and trees","time":1492675366,"resto":121963894,"id":"25xfhGMW","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121970344,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)04:02:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121970124\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121970124<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ever getting into range of engagement<\/span><br>What part of CRUISE MISSILE did you not understand?","time":1492675374,"resto":121963894,"id":"kUFEA6MJ","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121970377,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)04:03:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121968432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121968432<\/a><br>It&#039;s body looks too small compared to the rest.","time":1492675430,"resto":121963894,"id":"gvm0VUKy","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121970381,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)04:03:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121970322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121970322<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you can&#039;t defeat stealth simply by SPAAG&#039;ing every goose you see on the scope either.<\/span><br>But I really wanted to.","filename":"1478228830537","ext":".jpg","w":392,"h":495,"tn_w":98,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492675438976,"time":1492675438,"md5":"gbBcZCRjn2Xju8A+LKS3Bw==","fsize":122742,"resto":121963894,"id":"xyCEm0b7","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121970442,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)04:05:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121963894\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121963894<\/a><br>Russians were the first white people to settle on Alaska and the whole west coast.

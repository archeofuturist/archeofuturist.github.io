Job), and you can commit whenever you feel you have found what is best for you. Then you go off to school to learn the necessary skills for the rate you chose, after which you will be stationed elsewhere. And if nothing ends up interesting you, then you can stay as a non-rate for all 4 years of your contract and go your separate ways, and still have been able to do some traveling and learn some new things while you were in..

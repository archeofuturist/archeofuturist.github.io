When it comes to any other task in the world, people are always seeking help, seeking advise, training, educating themselves on the subject to end up doing a good job. BUt when it comes to parenting all of a sudden everybody is a God, they dont need no help, no advise, no knowledge, experience, they know whats best, they do what they feel like, they got this. And this mentality is encouraged by the media. <br><br>I see alot of people shocked by the new Dove commercial that features a trans mother, https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AQB<wbr>hQYfJrrc and as fucked up as that is, what shocks me the most is how they are pushing this narrative that they alone know whats best for their kids, fuck grandma and her experience, whatever they feel like its best to raise their kids is what they should do.","filename":"Bad+bad+parenting_268002_4502737","ext":".jpg","w":597,"h":800,"tn_w":186,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492244892011,"time":1492244892,"md5":"HeifQ8KR0Cf7zx68PutBuQ==","fsize":100102,"resto":0,"id":"xW0DEsaW","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-reason-why-the-world-is-fucked-is-because","country_name":"United States","replies":19,"images":5,"unique_ips":16},{"no":121188608,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)04:28:46","name":"Donald J.

It took a few generations of wars killing off the strongest men in foreign lands while employing the women at home and introducing propaganda promoting war fatigue to make the betamale draft dodgers and females (both of who are more influenced by &quot;feelings&quot;) feel &quot;guilty&quot;. Mix that with a rising increase of popularity for psychoactive drugs creating a &quot;rebellious&quot; youth (the boomers and gen x of today) who were even more susceptible to mind control through indoctrination for the right setting to arise.

It&#039;s no small wonder that some kids today feel like they are having to constantly clean up after their parents past mistakes all while being blamed for the situation. Unfortunate kids today are growing up and actively being indoctrinated with the misconception that after having children your life turns to shit all because they witness the shit show that was their own and every other kids parents&#039; marriage fall apart (if they were lucky to be born into a family for some time and not just to single mothers, these are the kids who have it the hardest). It&#039;s still happening to this day and it&#039;s hitting the white populations the hardest because to the white populations the family is the cornerstone to everything. This was all engineered to break up white people from their families.","time":1492245067,"resto":121188584,"id":"AYn\/BKUy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121188777,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)04:31:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121188584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121188584<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Post<\/span><br>Toilet paper not on dispenser<br>Why is this bitch tskingvan ass shot with her kid? <br>Sad","filename":"tmp_1684-14888626798392076676080","ext":".jpg","w":375,"h":375,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492245111533,"time":1492245111,"md5":"6gKrSTp\/YWgtDMl1Sacbog==","fsize":35117,"resto":121188584,"id":"mSQZeM0u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121188955,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)04:35:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Huh, never thought about this <br><br>Bumping, because OC is quite rare in this board, and I like your ideas","time":1492245305,"resto":121188584,"id":"DuifWikR","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":121189060,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)04:36:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121188777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121188777<\/a><br>Gotta find a new babby father","time":1492245418,"resto":121188584,"id":"NQpV2mR6","country":"UY","country_name":"Uruguay"},{"no":121189111,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)04:37:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Also, a question for you, OP<br><br>Since very few people have been raised by an actual functional family (divorce rates are over 50%, and many non-divorced families are dysfunctional), does this mean that the white race (and therefore, humanity) is completely doomed?

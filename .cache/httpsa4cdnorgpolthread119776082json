Now we have a government that thinks so too, unless I&#039;m wrong and all governments think this way (why else would a person proceed into government?) but I am firm only in the belief that there will be no grand designs from this era, rather our democracy will become full fledged and it will be a tyranny of absolute mediocrity. My reasons for believing this are completely anecdotal and not hard facts, but what is a fact is that this nation has abandoned not only God, but the idea of God, and so also the idea of truth, and of the sanctity of the individual. What can follow for us? A roguish young man fears not, but logically, and even without any deducion who dares say that we have a bright future? Only an imbecile who perceives the world from indoors. He perceives his imagination only.

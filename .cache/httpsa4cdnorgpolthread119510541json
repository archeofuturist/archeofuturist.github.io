(((Our government))) used him to contain Iran, a country that &quot;&quot;&quot;we&quot;&quot;&quot; also supported though surreptitiously. In my view the Iran-Iraq War was intended to bloody the two biggest players in the Middle East. And we know just (((who))) benefited from this. Flash forward, Iraq and Kuwait had an intramural squabble over loans, slant drilling, and the propriety of having a tiny coastal state. Our ambassador to Iraq indicated to Saddam that it was none of our business- and GHWB rushed in at the chance to run roughshod over a relatively weak power. The alleged Iraqi army massing in the desert preparing to invade Saudi Arabia was made up, along with the &quot;babies thrown from incubators&quot; lie that a high powered (((PR))) company invented.

Jews were rounded up because they have proven themselves to be subversive shitstains who would have actively sabotaged the Reich during the war. It wasn&#039;t to kill them. It was to keep them on lock-down. The facilities they were given were not terrible.

I think the red cross numbers put it at 300k, IIRC. But the reason they died wasn&#039;t gas chambers. They died because of allied bombing raids and because the german war machine was started to crumble. Supply lines were destroyed, and the camps weren&#039;t getting the supplies they needed. People starved, and there were typhus outbreaks. This is why there were so many spooky skeletor survivors. <br><br>The gas chambers and ovens story is simply ridiculous.

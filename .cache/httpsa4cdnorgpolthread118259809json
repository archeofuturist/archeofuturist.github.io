They are expensive. If you cut that investment, you will see short term growth and long term stagnation.<br><br>Around Japan&#039;s industrial boom they began admitting women into the work force to follow in the misguided footsteps of the west. Women in the work force make investing in kids less likely. Women have to care about work. They want a man who makes more than them. More workers mean less wages per worker. Men cannot support a family. Women don&#039;t need the support of men.<br><br>Result is less families. Less families less children. Less children, less investment in the future.

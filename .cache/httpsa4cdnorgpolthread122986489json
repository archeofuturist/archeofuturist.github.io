The elites are pretty fucking good at pushing for *just* enough bullshit that it never seems to push anybody over the edge. It&#039;s slow and gradual to the point where nobody will ever bother doing anything to stop it. I feel like with Hillary, we would have just experienced the same, slow, gradual decline that we&#039;ve experienced for the past several decades, and nobody would have done anything about it. <br><br>Furthermore, a defeat for Trump would have been a crushing blow to the entirety of the right-wing (from generic conservatives to many far-right individuals) that threw their weight behind him. He, in essence, had to win, for better or for worse. So many people were interested in right-wing politics for the first time because of Trump, and had he lost, we probably would have seen a lot of people drop out of politics as we did when Bernie lost and his supporters just said &quot;fuck it&quot;. Right wing ideas would be so incredibly shamed and browbeaten (that&#039;s not to say that they aren&#039;t now, but people don&#039;t give a fuck because we won), that I feel like the surge of right wing sentiment we see these days would have been stopped dead.<br><br>And I mean, with regards to what we&#039;re seeing now, the right-wing has become the new counter culture. Whether they&#039;re being genuine or they&#039;re being edgy, far-right ideas are a part of this counter-culture, and therefore, are beginning to enter the public consciousness. Over time, the people that ironically say &quot;Hitler did nothing wrong!&quot; are unironically saying it. Watching the left double down on their disgusting trash and get violent about it (i.e. antifa) is redpilling a ton of people, and the overuse of the words &quot;nazi&quot;, &quot;racist&quot;, etc., are making people more comfortable with identifying as those labels.","time":1493265010,"resto":122986489,"id":"+pQBfBeQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122991647,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:58:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122986489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122986489<\/a><br>You did not have time to let another leftist increase your numbers.

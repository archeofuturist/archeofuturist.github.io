They developed a culture around the Talmud of taking the Torah and then twisting and deconstructing the Law until there was nothing of its essence remaining and then reconstructing it to be whatever they wanted. They would do this to get away with doing things that were forbidden, such as sacrificing their children to Molech....they reasoned ways it would be ok. Here&#039;s a great example: the command is given to wear a blue thread on the wings of your garments. Well, they took wing to mean corners and thus even blankets have corners that they reasoned would then also need the fringe. Well, they reasoned if one were to cut the blanket such that one of the corners of it were rounded, it would only have 3 corners instead of 4 and thus you would not have to add fringes to if. This is what they do and why they have developed such a high verbal IQ and why they excel in the legal field. That is also why our justice system is absolute shit. It&#039;s become a game for Jews of trying Jew the other Jew lawyer in court such that their sophistry has escalated to astronomical levels of absurdity. It now requires a ridiculous amount of education and cleverness to succeed which makes legal costs insanely high. This has meant that legal action by deep pocketed individuals can be used to intimidate and ruin in ovens people with little means to pay because legal fees alone irrespective of the merits of the case can ruin people. This is also why technicalities and reinterpretation of words are so common. They reinterpret the Constitution to mean whatever they want without having to go through the standard process of changing it (see: definition of militia and well-regulated in 1780s). This is also why legislation has to be so assininely specific and bills have to be hundreds to thousands of pages long. Because Jews are going to pick it to pieces for loophiles and average people can&#039;t understand it so they can&#039;t hold anyone accountable. <br><br>It&#039;s Jews.","time":1490145439,"resto":117674625,"id":"8LAG38Cw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

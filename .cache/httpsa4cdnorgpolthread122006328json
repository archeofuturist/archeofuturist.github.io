She has also been interviewed in many talkshows and news broadcasts about immigration and refugee issues. She also housed refugees and other homeless in her own home. <br><br>Now this is where things get interesting..","filename":"marjaana-toiviainen","ext":".jpg","w":752,"h":423,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492702933944,"time":1492702933,"md5":"ZFfO0AsmAY6V2qAIQv3qZQ==","fsize":84404,"resto":0,"id":"OWv5xp5B","country":"FI","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-story","country_name":"Finland","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":122006387,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)11:42:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Lately there has been a lot of public discussion about deportation of refused asylum seekers. She has gradually gotten more and more involved in this, and the viral pro-refugee movement has gained some momentum, and with ample support from the media, they&#039;re bashing our (by Finnish standards) &quot;right-wing&quot; government with full force at every possible opportunity.<br><br>There was an individual case of forced deportation of some Afghani asylum seekers, which got filmed and leaked to the media. This priestess was there live, going very verbal against the police, trying to stand in front of the police van and yelling that they&#039;re running her over etc. She was doing all this while in her uniform and doing her job. Needless to say the public thinks this is very controversial.. is it okay for the tax payer funded church to openly oppose the police who are simply doing their job?<br><br>This caused a big spark into discussion of cucked church vs. the government, that is still raging in the media. <br><br>She got so much shit she claims to be fed up with Finland, and says it is impossible to live in this fascist nation. Now she is moving to Tanzania, and this is the number 1 news of whole country today. Now every cucked blogger and opposition politician is going all out about how Finland has fallen to the point the &quot;good people&quot; are branded &quot;extremist&quot;, and forced to leave the country or face the right-wing violence and possible death. <br><br>This timeline is incredible.","filename":"Marjaana-Toiviainen","ext":".png","w":634,"h":306,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":60,"tim":1492702965825,"time":1492702965,"md5":"0OXcCcGXPxdRaIAs3Qgbdg==","fsize":335447,"resto":122006328,"id":"OWv5xp5B","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"}]}

The difference is the stupid do not pursue their questions out of interest, but of humour and\/or social acceptance. <br><br>Also, I do believe alluding to people that you&#039;re actually stupider and weaker than what you really are is an evolutionary advantage.<br>If people think you&#039;re weak then they won&#039;t be suspicious and cautious around you; if people think you&#039;re weak and they come into conflict with you, then they&#039;ll come unprepared. I think a good example of this is Hitler and the Munich Putsch; the Bavarian Triumvirate saw Hitler as irrelevant and weak, so they lied to him and told him they&#039;d help him give power: they underestimated him. Similarly, President Hindenburg and his social circle saw Hitler as weak and stupid, and thought that they could use Hitler as a puppet: they underestimated him too. <br>What I&#039;m saying is that appearing to be weak and stupid can cause people to underestimate you, which can lead to your advantage.","time":1491789147,"resto":120337610,"id":"chd5Cth0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120373757,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:54:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120373513\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120373513<\/a><br>You&#039;re trying to socialize ya sperg lol.

I also get that many of them engage in regressive politics due a collectivist culture present in the gay community. But if a gay individual lives a modest life style and seeks to develop genuine relationships with other gay people and not be a whore and doesn&#039;t fall trap to regressive politics, while living a productive life for his\/her community, what logically could be wrong with that? <br><br>Being homosexual is an innate characteristic of someone that is not subject to genuine change, best to accept it and allow them to be happy in a healthy way to provide in what ways they can while alive. Many gay people have done this throughout history, like Peter Thiel, likely Leonardo Da Vinic, Alexander the Great engaged in bisexual behavior, Hadrian, Alan Turing, etc ,etc. Hell, even the stormfags can look to Ernst Rohm who was pivotal in beginning of the Nazi Party. What are your guys and gals thoughts?","filename":"Happy_Pepe","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":729,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":247,"tim":1490112856180,"time":1490112856,"md5":"y2YSdmma064DSLqd9Yr2MA==","fsize":46720,"resto":0,"id":"JmqM7Twl","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"disscussion-on-homosexuality","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":117639148,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)12:16:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117638909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117638909<\/a><br>I don&#039;t care about gays as long as they lean towards the preservation of western society.<br>I have a friend who&#039;s a right leaning gay.

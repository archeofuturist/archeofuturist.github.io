They still pretend they can do so, but are increasingly viewed merely as shrill partisan scolds pushing political agendas which are harmful to the white Western mainstream.","time":1493174541,"resto":122829517,"id":"7LDZxD\/E","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122830770,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:43:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122829517\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122829517<\/a><br>Yeah, it&#039;s dumb to do it, no one cares about politics and you taking it seriously and externalizing it might ruin your career","time":1493174626,"resto":122829517,"id":"8BPT3EW0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122830865,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:44:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122829517\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122829517<\/a><br>Animeright?

That was Jontron&#039;s mistake, he courted politics yet refused to jump in. In the end he has neither an audience for gaming or politics. Also folks, no one talks about it, but education matters. If all you have done is funny gaming compilations then I really think theres something missing - I am no academic elitist, but read a book once in a while, some of these guys go from zelda to breitbart and think that there &#039;anti-sjw&#039; supremacy is somehow good enough. I long for academics who are too informed to take simplistic opinions and don&#039;t care about whether this or that purple hair coloured fool agrees with them. An idiot is an idiot and time is the great revealer.","time":1493174913,"resto":122829517,"id":"IYb4oUG4","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122832374,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:56:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122830593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122830593<\/a><br>sounds like he got BTFO, mate:<br><br>http:\/\/compete.kotaku.com\/overwatch<wbr>-pros-racist-tirade-ends-his-career<wbr>-1794595720","time":1493175406,"resto":122829517,"id":"H6mdCj71","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122832467,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:57:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122831350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122831350<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That was Jontron&#039;s mistake, he courted politics yet refused to jump in.

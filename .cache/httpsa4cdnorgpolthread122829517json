That was Jontron&#039;s mistake, he courted politics yet refused to jump in. In the end he has neither an audience for gaming or politics. Also folks, no one talks about it, but education matters. If all you have done is funny gaming compilations then I really think theres something missing - I am no academic elitist, but read a book once in a while, some of these guys go from zelda to breitbart and think that there &#039;anti-sjw&#039; supremacy is somehow good enough. I long for academics who are too informed to take simplistic opinions and don&#039;t care about whether this or that purple hair coloured fool agrees with them.

They hear this all the time when they play. People get mad and shout rude shit. They want to watch the very best compete, not just the pool of guys who never slip up and rant like an angry gamer.<br><br>More and more, mainstream corporations are going to have to pick a side. Sticking to the old rules is choosing to side with the left, to help leftist politics, and that&#039;s increasingly going to cost them business as people recognize that they&#039;re not just being neutral and inoffensive themselves, they&#039;re actively policing other people&#039;s speech and punishing people for going against the left.","time":1493176289,"resto":122829517,"id":"7LDZxD\/E","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122835579,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:24:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122832467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122832467<\/a><br>why do people cite subscriber numbers - they dont turn into views or money - its like when people say pewdiepie has 54 million subscribers - find me one video of his that has anything even close to that - mostly it idles at about 10% views to subscriber (at best). Also I gotta say Im a fan of jontron, he was the first youtuber who I found inspiring to make youtube content - but one, he screwed it with that destiny debate, he screwed it with the star wars dealio he had one or two years ago and what actually gets me pissed is he hasnt released a video this entire year - like I release several videos a week about politics history and comedy and I&#039;m almost at the point of giving up cause I have had no receptive audience. Theres lots of youtubers who are starting to really annoy me, cuz they have a following but do nothing with it - like frankjavcee. Im a big fan, but seriously where&#039;s a new video bro? If they dont have something to post, why dont they plug other channels?","time":1493177070,"resto":122829517,"id":"IYb4oUG4","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122836111,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:29:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122833068\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122833068<\/a><br>yeah I feel really bad for him because he was just about to immortalize himself without that yooka laylee game which would have been kinda lame, but also historic and special, something that he would be proud of in 50 years. But now you&#039;re right, people are just waiting for him to trip up, and for everyone else, he has already shown that you cant confidently support him cuz he might go further than his knowledge can take him - like those first few vids with him and sargon talking shit were funny af - but then he got over confident and honestly it played out like someone exiting their echochamber and definitely proved that there are chambers on the right as well.","time":1493177352,"resto":122829517,"id":"IYb4oUG4","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

Bush and Blair spent a good deal of time and money legitimising war against Saddam by framing the conflict as &#039;the people vs the dictators&#039; which is far easier for the people back home to digest, so as to avoid the minefield legacy of the Vietnam war. The problem being that not only is it a lie, but Western powers in the ME have been amazingly incompetent at every turn and we have to spin every failure into a victory. the war in Iraq is still pouted as a victory even though the country is almost completely destroyed and mad what was a bad situation into hell, same goes for Libya and Afghanistan.<br>The issue now is that Syrians aren&#039;t farting about the desert in incredibly sparse villages and hauling out of Syria, hoping to find refuge in a developed nation which is a bad situation because Syrians aren&#039;t the goat fucking, drooling, sand people that the Iraqis and Afghans were easily portrayed as because they&#039;re just normal people who, by virtue of being in Eruope, will tell you. <br>Id would be great if all the syrians and muslims were ISIS because you can justify bombing them. The fact that Assad&#039;s regime, and his fathers, was so morally dubious (added with the neocon&#039;s hatred of all things stable), the &#039;moderate&#039; rebels decapitations and dealings with al-nursa and the absolute fireburned hellscape that is the Islamic state is causing the west a huge headache, because they can&#039;t frame it simply enough. The result is that they overexpose ISIS, demonise Assad and coverup the Rebels which makes Syrians (and considering the vast majority of people in the west couldn&#039;t point to Syria on a map pre-2011) looks like absolute savages. <br><br>Shits fucked","time":1491322713,"resto":119471506,"id":"z2ORNSD7","country":"GB","country_name":"United

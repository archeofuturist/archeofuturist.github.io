The flood of responses range the gamut and can sound extremely crazy to those that have not done the research. He is attempting to allow the pizzagate research community to discredit itself. If you dont know the deal, it does make the entire thing sound absolutely crazy reading all those comments. Its all so unbelievable to begin with, and they know it. The time it takes to get up to speed requires more than the average person is willing to invest into such gruesome material. Sad but true. This is a desperate approach but I can see it working for the normies who have no idea what any of this stuff is about beyond MSM disinfo campaigns. Pretty brilliant actually. Watch now for these fucks to start coming after citizen journalists based upon the latest focus on &#039;mental health issues&#039; (ala-Stevie Stephens shooter storyline) The new theme is &#039;mental health&#039;. Something like: &#039;People with mental health issues can turn into facebook shooters&#039; so lets get them rounded up on 51\/50&#039;s so they dont kill anyone like Stevie did.<br><br>This is a lead in to address &#039;mental health issues&#039; in this country. 51\/50&#039;s to follow for the most prolific of researchers and respondents to these tweets.

I can see what they are doing here, building a storyline through all the regular channels.<br><br>These tweets play right into it. A larger strategy is rolling out.

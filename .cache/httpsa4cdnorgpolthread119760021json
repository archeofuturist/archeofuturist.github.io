It trivializes the protests curently happening or have happened as they are serious political events and only in the effort to promote a product. It also trivializes the concern of Police Abuse by simply saying, &quot;If you give a cop a Pepsi, they won&#039;t harass you.&quot; This one is an insult to both the left and right.

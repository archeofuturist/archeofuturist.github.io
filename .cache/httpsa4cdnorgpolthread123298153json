It was pretty advanced for its time. <br><br>X.com was created because Musk figured out how to make a shitload of money off manipulating currency, but no one was willing to do it. He was going to become a banker around this time. However, as the internet continued to become ever more popular and no bank was willing to act on his plan, he decided that he&#039;d make his own bank - online. Unfortunately Thiel came up with PayPal and started to act, not in the capacity of a bank, but merely an intermediary for transactions. Which is what X.com also did, and it eventually forced the merger, and then killed off the whole digital bank thing. Which sucks because Musk was actually toying with crypto-currency ideas way before Bitcoin. <br><br>NASA? He didn&#039;t invent NASA, but if you mean SpaceX. Okay. SpaceX was founded as a cheap way to get rockets into space. This was the entire basis of the Falcon 1. Problematically, they couldn&#039;t find enough people who needed a launch vehicle of that size. The market simply didn&#039;t exist as they thought it did, which forced them into changing the Falcon 1 into the Falcon 9 and becoming company focused on launching medium payloads into all orbits, and heavy payloads into LEO. Then they expanded this into the FH. <br><br>Electric Cars is actually why Musk went to Yale. He was going to go work on a double degree in Physics and Engineering because he liked supercapacitors. However, his brother convinced him to drop out and start Zip2 with him. <br><br>Solar Energy wasn&#039;t his idea, it was his two cousin&#039;s. He just recognized there was a lot of converging elements between the battery tech for the cars, and the solar energy market. <br><br>Then he helped found OpenAI after talking to a few ex-Google employees and Nick Bostrom. And he bank rolls them accordingly. This is his second biggest concern, next to getting people to Mars. The Mars dream stretches all the way back to when he sold Zip2.","time":1493445403,"resto":123298153,"id":"XZEYmDDY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

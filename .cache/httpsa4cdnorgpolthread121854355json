It would be explicitly ethnonationalist insofar as it is a sort of &quot;Volksdeutscher Bund&quot; but we would keep outright racism, fascism or wehrabooisms to a minimum. <br><br>What do you guys think? <br>inb4 &gt;muh heritaaaage<br>fuck off this isn&#039;t the time for petty rivalries between German Americans and BRD \/ CH Germans. We&#039;ve already seen our kin disappear from Europe, and our own ethnic identity effectively erased in the USA after WW2. We are cousins at the least, and need to help eachother out.","filename":"DAB","ext":".png","w":666,"h":400,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":150,"tim":1492614912500,"time":1492614912,"md5":"l7sor7dKE+IpJH06g2TexQ==","fsize":66840,"resto":0,"id":"1Ypn5L1T","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lets-discuss-a-new-german-american-bund","country_name":"United States","replies":20,"images":14,"unique_ips":6},{"no":121854568,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:17:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"muh last stand of implicit kraut identity","filename":"dabmap","ext":".png","w":1190,"h":810,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1492615051125,"time":1492615051,"md5":"63uwcqrsHOpUqJzfrm5XLA==","fsize":679577,"resto":121854355,"id":"1Ypn5L1T","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121854738,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:19:08","name":"Anonymous","filename":"kentuckyrifle","ext":".jpg","w":675,"h":758,"tn_w":111,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492615148480,"time":1492615148,"md5":"IX33NuCC6bFiOjN5HkMwBw==","fsize":213728,"resto":121854355,"id":"1Ypn5L1T","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121854868,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:20:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Would love to maintain this type of aesthetic, but it&#039;s almost too explicitly fascistic.

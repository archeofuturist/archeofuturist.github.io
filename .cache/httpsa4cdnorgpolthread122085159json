However, recent revelations have been made to me.<br><br>1. Christianity and Islam are some of the most widespread religions, with stable cultural footholds.<br>2. Said religions have been violent and zealous throughout their history.<br>3. All less fanatic or even passive religions are either restricted to certain areas or relegated to myth.<br>4. The only types of atheists I see today are either zealously liberal and self destroying or notice the threat of Islam yet refuse to spread their beliefs around.<br><br>Therefore, zealotry is a good thing. I&#039;d go as far as calling it a virtue. In addition, the only way for Atheism to survive is for it to be as zealous as the other &quot;Big Two&quot; religions mentioned above, destroying those who would restrict it&#039;s growth. Complete with it&#039;s own Jihads and Inquisitions.","filename":"14865770483370","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":1024,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1492743091605,"time":1492743091,"md5":"S\/TQmZVVquWbpSV7qs3\/5g==","fsize":256393,"resto":0,"id":"FY3T6B1Z","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"zealotry-and-atheism","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122085774,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)22:56:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122085159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122085159<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But wouldn&#039;t that be Immoral.<\/span><br>Many here already want the blood of the Muslims.

Today, there is A LOT of multicultural zealot who, because they are part of the mainstream ideology, do not register as being zealot. They are simply &quot;more committed&quot; or &quot;passionate&quot; about our &quot;true ideals&quot; of inclusion and so on.<br><br>Second, as a result of the first point, we&#039;re in a weird ideological moment in the west, in that we&#039;ve declared a universal state. The idea of the universal state is that there should be no distinction made between the in group and the out group. As a result, the act of excluding should be prima faci impossible, as excluding logically entail some kind of out group. But this very ideology of inclusion MUST define in in group, namely the set of all those people that are &quot;inclusive&quot;, whereas the out group is that set of people that is &quot;exclusionary&quot;. Currently, the atheist zealot have been recognized as being part of this exclusionary group. They do not conform with multiculturalism and thus they are hated.<br><br>But the whole point of the zealot is precisely that he cares nothing for being hated.","time":1492744259,"resto":122085159,"id":"gTtT390U","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122087513,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)23:12:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122086862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122086862<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Zeal against other religions requires a spiritual component, or else they are just &quot;misguided&quot;<\/span><br>Or it could just require absolute and, to the untrained eye, insane commitment and passion.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; It only took a generation or two for every blithering suburbanite to start copping a smug attitude towards anyone with more quaint beliefs about evolution or the creation of the world, and yet these people know little, if anything, about the fields they&#039;re deferring to. <\/span><br>Then they shall learn as the common folk learned of the bible and Christianity.

Something that puts a dent in both ideas for me is the fact that he had praised Israel a number of times during his campaigning process- something that I and many others just thought was weak pandering and nothing to be concerned about; if it does turn out that Trump is one of ((them)) and his, as the reddit cultists would call it &quot;11D omnidirectional blindfolded Boggle-Stratego&quot; skills are not in the best interests of America but rather Israel, then we would be truly btfo. At this point I am willing to believe that the whole Syrian fiasco was a lapse in judgement, however he will have to prove himself to be the man we thought he was and if he is going to do that he must not continue to piss off his Isolationist supporters. I remember a thread when the &#039;Trump is a Russian plant&#039; narrative was at full force that discussed how there was reason to believe that Trump would regret slowly getting rid of Bannon but that he felt it was necessary in order to get some of the Jews off his case for a while. I do not agree that the former point would be a valid sacrifice if such a thing were true, as I am of the opinion that Bannon should never have been taken off in the first place and firing him will ultimately be akin to admitting that he does not put &#039;America first&#039; after all. This is not to be mistaken as another &quot;Ey, we must le wait things out and witness the glory of le chessmaster&quot;.

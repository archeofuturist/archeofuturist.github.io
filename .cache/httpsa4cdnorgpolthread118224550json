It feels really bad and only very old people agree with me. Basically anyone under 70 wants to tear down all old houses and replace them with uniform looking commieblocks.","filename":"\u00c4ltestest_haus_lindenberg_1590","ext":".jpg","w":1136,"h":852,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490448863603,"time":1490448863,"md5":"hV4ionRTFwNoqNDy4I\/V+w==","fsize":256393,"resto":0,"id":"1Y1TsOtR","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"preserving-culture","country_name":"Germany","replies":14,"images":2,"unique_ips":7},{"no":118224778,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)09:37:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118224550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118224550<\/a><br>Just publicly object and maybe others who are also too pussy to publicly object will join you.","time":1490449056,"resto":118224550,"id":"y4JI+Za+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118224951,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)09:40:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118224550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118224550<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get wealthy. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;buy up the town<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;save all the buildings.<\/span>","time":1490449200,"resto":118224550,"id":"JeVJMC\/O","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118225224,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)09:43:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118224550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118224550<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Since a few years more and more funding for construction projects was allocated though, resulting in MASSIVE destruction of cultural significant buildings.<\/span><br>Usually funding goes to preservation of old architecture.

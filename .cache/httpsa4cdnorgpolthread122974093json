Personally I think it has to do with jews further desiring the destruction of human history but I won&#039;t rule out space jews and their subterranean tech. I am being very serious too even though this is \/x\/-tier. The jews are our enemy and we are at war with them. They are the elite and have always been the elite. They really are different from us.

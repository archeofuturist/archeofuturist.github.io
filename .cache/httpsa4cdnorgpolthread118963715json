He&#039;s not repealing DACA, he&#039;s allowing that anti-American bill to continue. We will never allow whites to come here and our birth rate will continue to shrink. We are dying and this fucker is making our death faster. Illegals love democrats and hate republicans. Reagan did the same shit and California will never be a red state ever again. I can&#039;t believe faggots on here are even defending Obamas shitty bill. <br><br>So much for loving your country, Europeans have every right to mock us.

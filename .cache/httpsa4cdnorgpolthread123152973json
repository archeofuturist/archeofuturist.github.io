The US would bomb the fuck out of them, and use all missile defence systems in the area to shoot down everything the NKs put up. South Korea, with the help of several thousand US marines would hold or just cross the 38th. They would not go very deep into NK territory, and take up defensive positions after blowing the fuck out of any Howitzers or munitions that could hit Seoul. The Japanese will take defensive precautions and allow US missions to be flown from there, but mostly stay the fuck out of it. <br><br>Here&#039;s where it gets interesting. To appease the Chinese, America and its allies in the region would allow China (this has probably been agreed upon already) to invade from the North. Chinese troops have already massed in great numbers along the northern border. They would then push to the 38th parallel crushing all resistance with both Chinese and US air support backing them up. After completely destroying NKs armies, they will stop at the 38th. A demilitarized zone would then be established. China will then have a great big new province, which will justify their actions to the Chinese people. They will also gain a lot of landmass. This will make the Chinese very happy. South Korea will then become just Korea. The Chinese with the help of the Americans will rebuild the newly formed Chinese territory and both economies will go fucking gangbusters with rebuilding projects. This will end up being a major bridge between the US and China that will lead to years of peace and prosperity, as well as reducing tensions. China will be very happy to get this much landmass, they&#039;ll forget about building dinky little islands for quite some time.<br><br>One more thing. The North Korean people, will have a much better standard of living being under China. Many others will be allowed to immigrate to the newly minted Korea.<br><br>Make your move Kim... please.","filename":"Flag_of_North_Korea","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493357166988,"time":1493357166,"md5":"gg2+Nj4+7hogspAY7Own6g==","fsize":15077,"resto":0,"id":"e3v88CWZ","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"just","country_name":"Canada","replies":17,"images":2,"unique_ips":12},{"no":123153303,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)01:29:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"They won&#039;t tho","filename":"IMG_3773","ext":".png","w":1429,"h":802,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493357362416,"time":1493357362,"md5":"\/QOZTY4pz+KVqRHyLyDhdA==","fsize":1312338,"resto":123152973,"id":"j\/8Z+Nzc","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123153499,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)01:31:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;what happens if NK makes a move<\/span><br>Japan: LET ME JUST SWOOCE RIGHT IN<br><br>SWOOCE!","filename":"1493212025004","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1493357480775,"time":1493357480,"md5":"ynsUNyw0\/g5rpmL4jrUN\/A==","fsize":2102582,"resto":123152973,"id":"k+NwUYei","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123153504,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)01:31:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123152973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123152973<\/a><br>The Norks won&#039;t attack the US, but one more missile test (Which they said will happen), we&#039;ll take it as an act of war and charge in.

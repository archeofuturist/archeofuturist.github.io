By drawing on the work of Wilhem Reich, who examined the idea of fascism as a symptom of sexual repression, we are taking the \u2018Reicheann approach\u2019 by advocating for the early managed sexualisation of children so as to prevent the formation of any earlier fascist traits. This was outlined in Reich\u2019s magnum opus \u2018The Mass Psychology of Fascism\u2019, and has been shown to be effective when tried experimentally on the European continent.<\/span><br><br><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/BcDmW","time":1490170000,"resto":117736764,"id":"bTJyqg+v","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":117737382,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:07:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117736764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117736764<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Millenials - bluepilled, liberal, low-test, humourless<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gen Zyklon - redpillled, far right, high-test, know how to bant<\/span><br><br>I wonder why","time":1490170041,"resto":117736764,"id":"RyhvCqE1","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117737467,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:08:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117736764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117736764<\/a><br>Because they&#039;ve gone nuts and no one their age is willing to be in the same room with them for more than 30 min","filename":"IMG_6278","ext":".png","w":500,"h":281,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490170136635,"time":1490170136,"md5":"tzciTzaV6Rxph9+Oml8ySA==","fsize":181277,"resto":117736764,"id":"AT32Ai6J","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

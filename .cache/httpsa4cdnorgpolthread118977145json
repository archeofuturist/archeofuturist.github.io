Ethnicity is based on language, religion, culture, shared history and philosophies etc<br><br>The Kurds speak a different language than the Arabs and Turks so they are a different ethnic group.<br><br>The Sunnis and the Shias hate each other and the arab world is currently in the midst of a civil war with fighting in Syria, Iraq, and Yemen between sunnis and shias.<br><br>The rest of the world are primarily multi ethnic and the only non-western democracies that are thriving are the ethnically homogenous Japan and South Korea. Almost every other country is a cobbled together mess of different groups.<br><br><br>Europe is unique in that Germany is primarily populated by people who speak German, and have read various German authors. Same goes with France where people speak French and they share a culture.<br><br>France has the Basques, Bretons, and some German speakers but they are too small to cause problems. <br><br>Belgium speaks French and Dutch, but the national Belgian government has almost no power and they can not have a national goverment for many months and the country runs fine because its Walloon and Flanders operate a lot like two countries with a single foreign policy. They have institutions for sharing power so they don&#039;t need to fight each other. <br><br>But when you have something like the former yugoslavia where Croats, Serbs, and Bosniaks are all living together, when the strong dictator is gone they start killing each other because they don&#039;t have a method of sharing power. The Serbs is croatia and bosnia don&#039;t want to be oppressed so Serbia tries to intervene and take control and you fight a giant war. <br><br>Eventually Bosnia became stable because its essentially two countries, with a single foreign policy.","filename":"saveeurope","ext":".png","w":720,"h":576,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1490912289619,"time":1490912289,"md5":"StWFF5U8byF6pffsuetUIQ==","fsize":288618,"resto":0,"id":"7QcBj+Hv","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-was-right-we-have-to-save-europe","country_name":"Canada","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118977536,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)18:21:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118977145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118977145<\/a><br>Is this an anti EU-thread or an anti-immigration thread ?","time":1490912471,"resto":118977145,"id":"IFR9dtGn","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":118977769,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)18:22:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118977145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118977145<\/a><br>Fuck Europe.","time":1490912579,"resto":118977145,"id":"MSXUO+lh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118978489,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)18:27:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"When nationalism was sweeping europe in the 1900s, the countries were not ethnically homogenous. Germans lived in Polish majority areas, and Poles live in German majority areas, and the same idea applies every where.<br><br>The empires were destroyed in ww1 and nationstates were formed but the people were sill spread out all over. After world war 2 and the destruction of europe people migrated all over the place and the states became much more homogenous.<br><br>Europe is stable not because it is white, but because they are ethnically homogenous.<br><br>Its wrong to think it will stay stable if we introduce vast numbers of minorities.<br><br>People can become Canadian and American, and you can&#039;t tell the difference. Its not right to assume the same could apply to europe.<br><br>The problem is that you guys are dumbasses and you latch on to the stupidest arguments. Its not about race you idiots, its about national stability, it applies to everyone the same. We can&#039;t expect ethnic enclaves to not create tension in the west when ethnic enclaves in the rest of the world cause tensions. <br><br>The rest of the world isn&#039;t a shit hole because they are non-white, they are shit holes because they never went through the painful process of becoming ethnically homogeneous that Europe did in the 1900s.<br><br>With Canada and the US the best course of action is to try and integrate the minorities the best we can as becoming ethnically homogeneous is not worth all the suffering it would cause, but with Europe they are already ethnically homogeneous so keeping it that way is worth doing. Limiting immigration is more inline with human rights than deporting people who were born in the country. <br><br><br>What sucks is now I have to try and argue these things with the knowledge than I&#039;m on the same side as a bunch of nazis.

It goes to low earth orbit, so there is no need for carbon nanotubes.<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Orbit<wbr>al_ring<br><br>For about $500 billion, we can cut our launch costs to space from $2000\/kg to around $1\/kg. That means we can deploy space-based solar satellites and produce 100% clean energy for 10% of the cost of coal. We can start mining asteroids (there are individual asteroids with trillions of dollars of materials on them), and begin colonization of the Moon and Mars, and deep-space exploration.<br><br>By creating so much cheap energy that can be sold to the world, the project can easily fund itself, and create cash flows of trillions of dollars. A balanced budget, tax cuts, and plenty of money for all of our social programs are possible. IF we invest in the right projects.<br><br>This is our legacy. The First National Bank was not a backstop for fat cat bankers, it was a National Bank that built projects to help all of the people. Within 100 years of our founding, we had connected the midwest by canals, built the National Road into Ohio, and crossed the country with railroads. Other nations, like Japan under Meiji, followed our lead and went from feudal backwaters into industrial superpowers within a few decades.<br><br>God Emperor: Make America Great Again!","filename":"TrumpSpaceElevator","ext":".jpg","w":888,"h":499,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491325792923,"time":1491325792,"md5":"Gebmg65zC2ify\/twiLBHmw==","fsize":144270,"resto":0,"id":"6ofIxr0s","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"god-emperor-build-the-space-elevator","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119491306,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)13:22:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119490033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119490033<\/a><br>Imagine all the things that would get made if it wasn&#039;t for nogs, foreign aid to nogistan, zog wars and the finance kikes skimming profits.","time":1491326537,"resto":119490033,"id":"kVr+pD0x","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119491492,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)13:24:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119491306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119491306<\/a><br><br>We can do all of that gay bullshit and still run huge surpluses if we build a Space Elevator.","filename":"Orbital Ring","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":594,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":72,"tim":1491326640949,"time":1491326640,"md5":"Z\/lZt\/eT4ayvkuV8IIK2Uw==","fsize":109985,"resto":119490033,"id":"6ofIxr0s","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

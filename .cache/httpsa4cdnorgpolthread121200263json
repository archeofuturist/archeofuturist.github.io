Silencing people arguing their agendas. Censorship though calling people racist, homophobes, sexists etc. They refuse to hear the opposition and use false labeling to make others unlikely to listen because &quot;he&#039;s racist.&quot; etc. Are you looking for more video examples or such? There&#039;s lots of it out on youtube.<br><br>As for the agenda. Identity generation as you call it, I interpret as the people saying: &quot;My pronouns are Xe&quot;. <br>They think that letting people identify as whatever they think they are, such as anti-girl, transracial etc. We use labeling for Men\/women since it describes our born gender. Trans can be debated but I don&#039;t feel it holds relevance for my argument. It&#039;s meant to identify us more easily as to what we are. However! The identity argument is that not everyone is your stereotypical female\/male. They want everyone to call themselves something special to describe them, to label them. You can&#039;t just be a feminine guy who likes to dress like a girl. It&#039;s labeled something specific like, feminine anti-guy or something. <br><br>The thing about this is that if one person can make one thing up to describe themselves, everyone can. So we end up having 1000 of pronouns with no one knowing how to differentiate what is what. The largest problem comes from the &quot;censorship&quot; part of it. If you use the wrong pronouns then someone can play the victim, get attention, get people to turn against you and &#039;remove your argument from consideration&#039; because you&#039;re such a mean person to mislabel.<br><br>It really gains nothing, but gives people lots of fake-power to silence others. And in the end, if everyone labels themselves differently, why not just call ourselves individuals of a specific gender (man\/woman)?","time":1492256234,"resto":121200263,"id":"+oScl60Y","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121201588,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:38:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121201486\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121201486<\/a><br>are you sure we are talking about the same thing?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Identitarian movement is a pan-European socio-political movement that started in France in 2002 as a far-right youth movement deriving from the French Nouvelle Droite G\u00e9n\u00e9ration Identitaire.

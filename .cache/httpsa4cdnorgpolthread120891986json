By your logic you are all Romans because your current society was only established because Julius Caesar conquered what was then called Britannia. Hell even your name was given to you by the Romans. The during your early history as Britain the only people who were still untouched by the Roman influence were the Celts and you even fucked that up by being general shitstains to them for centuries until they finally joined your supposed &quot;United Kingdom.&quot; You still treat the Welsh, Scots and Irish with condescension and to be honest they are the better of the lot of you. So yeah fuck you buddy.","time":1492083807,"resto":120891986,"id":"8a37npeF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120900488,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:43:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120899235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120899235<\/a><br>WW2<br>W<br>W<br>2<br><br>italy, the most incompetent country during the war","filename":"italy niggers","ext":".png","w":750,"h":681,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":113,"tim":1492083813560,"time":1492083813,"md5":"hlVBlk1gA1\/lyDix+KAEag==","fsize":463764,"resto":120891986,"id":"feFlOPPi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120900524,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:43:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120891986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120891986<\/a><br>We use it to you dipshit<br>It&#039;s commonly known how much a cup contains but not that a mestizo like you would know anything about it","time":1492083834,"resto":120891986,"id":"42LTsAmV","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120900546,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:44:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120900062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120900062<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;still believes in the moon landing meme<\/span>","filename":"1489430912452","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":550,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492083849368,"time":1492083849,"md5":"boNBGmlBFZAGPf\/PQYSwzw==","fsize":64893,"resto":120891986,"id":"KpV\/MmU0","country":"IN","country_name":"India"}]}

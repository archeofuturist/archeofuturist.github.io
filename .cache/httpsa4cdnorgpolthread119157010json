We are arguing for a decade over the price of 15 Eurofighters. What a disgrace. The only thing good in the Austrian military is the canteen food and the Steyr AUG which is our soldiers&#039; main battle weapon. <br><br>I envision each EU member state to have an obligation to build up a certain number of battaligons in size between 1500 and 3000. These groups could have different specializations. Obviously, Austria with no access to the sea cannot provide a sea battalignon, but we have access to the mountains so we could provide 2-3 mountain ranger battalions. <br><br>Each battalion should be on the big white board in the EU military headquarter. Each battalion commander should be able to decently speak English to coordinate with other battalions and the EU military headquarter. Soldiers should also speak some English. <br><br>Instead of 27 individual airforces, an EU wide airforce could be implemented which defends the whole EU. <br><br>And then we could have an EU coast guard and an EU border security guard which every EU citizen should be able to join to defend the EU.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-01 at 9.01.35 AM","ext":".png","w":1528,"h":1082,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":177,"tim":1491030393042,"time":1491030393,"md5":"HK2k+m1qPO7W0zBPKYaQbQ==","fsize":977967,"resto":0,"id":"GN7Gqo8M","country":"AT","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-am-all-for-an-eu-military","country_name":"Austria","replies":260,"images":46,"unique_ips":142,"tail_size":50},{"no":119157203,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)03:09:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119157010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119157010<\/a><br><br>Oh fuck off there will be no wars","time":1491030558,"resto":119157010,"id":"1\/Ml3jWd","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119157278,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)03:10:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119157010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119157010<\/a><br>Hi shill","time":1491030627,"resto":119157010,"id":"BEZKxUK4","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119157334,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)03:11:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119157010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119157010<\/a><br><br>Europes just doing this because they know they have to start recolonizing countries again in order to stay relevant.","time":1491030683,"resto":119157010,"id":"mFXUlZII","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119157474,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)03:13:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119157334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119157334<\/a><br>No, they&#039;re doing that in order to suppress natives&#039; insurrections.","time":1491030836,"resto":119157010,"id":"uS1Nn0hJ","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119157500,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)03:14:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119157010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119157010<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ashamed of Austrian militairy.<\/span><br>Its like you havent even looked at battles before the 1900s.<br><br>A mere 100 years is nothing.

I&#039;ll take shit for saying this, but it&#039;s true: France is the strongest military power in Europe (after the United States). We Brit&#039;s come third , a considerable distance behind the French. <br>We lag in almost every conventional sphere, but the biggest difference is that France has an independent nuclear deterrent and we do not. Our missiles are leased and no serious analyst really believes that the Americans haven&#039;t installed a Deadman switch. <br>Frogs being cowards is a meme. Their forces are very professional and very effective. As sad as this is for me to say, I&#039;m fairly confident that France would crush us in almost any theatre now. I still think we produce slightly better soldiers, but we have too few of them and every beach of our armed forces is chronically under equipped. The only thing about our military capability that&#039;s improved in the last 20 years is the ability of our MOD and elected officials to bullshit the public into thinking we aren&#039;t a shadow of what we were. The interception of the Russian expeditionary force through the channel comes to mind. That tiny Russian task force would be capable of destroying the entire Royal Navy with relative ease. The British posturing was embarrassing and didn&#039;t fool anyone except the British public.","time":1491047368,"resto":119157010,"id":"jH9fwzuF","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119172785,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)07:53:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119161885\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119161885<\/a><br>Cuck","time":1491047591,"resto":119157010,"id":"+Ma\/tPiw","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":119173257,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)08:00:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119157010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119157010<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Obviously, Austria with no access to the sea cannot provide a sea battalignon<\/span><br>That is not how the EU wants.

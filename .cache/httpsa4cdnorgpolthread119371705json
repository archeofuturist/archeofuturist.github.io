I voted for him and I&#039;m happy he kicked over the table in American politics. Better Zionists won instead of Satanists. <br><br>But if \/pol\/ is going to survive then it has to at least discuss these things. I made a post about Kushner having power and not speaking publicly a single time in 2 years and I was shilled because he started Trump Generals.<br><br>You guys need to wake up or you are going to be worse than the normies you rip on.

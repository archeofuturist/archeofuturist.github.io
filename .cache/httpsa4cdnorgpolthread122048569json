The synapses are extremely close to the dendrites of the target neuron. This allows the neurotransmitters to diffuse across the intervening space and fit into the receptors that are located on the target neuron. This causes some action to take place in that neuron that will either decrease or increase the membrane potential of the neuron. If it causes the membrane potential to pass the firing threshold then it will activate an action potential in the target neuron and send it down its axon.","filename":"1469035896657","ext":".jpg","w":655,"h":527,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1492724677117,"time":1492724677,"md5":"8E07ozIbYuceAKSBOS\/x7Q==","fsize":56079,"resto":122048569,"id":"WtY3nKfa","country":"AL","country_name":"Albania"},{"no":122049077,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)17:44:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Link or this is fake","time":1492724682,"resto":122048569,"id":"MJefnnQZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122049330,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)17:46:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122048569\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122048569<\/a><br><br>I&#039;m enjoying this new meme, reminds me of &quot;my wife&#039;s son&quot;","time":1492724806,"resto":122048569,"id":"nb3m4+yB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122049384,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)17:47:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122048569\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122048569<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;suspect is a dark skinned white male<\/span><br><br>Can we seriously just dismantle the MSM and rebuild it from the ground up at this point?

But a bunch of countries, including Germany, decide that they don&#039;t need to pay 2%, so America says okay well this really important (because we wear the big boy pants) so we subsidize Europe&#039;s defenses on the scope of billions.<br><br>Then Hans, and all his colored hair nigger loving faggot socialist friends exclaim, look, look! Our welfare system is so good we can literally just let all our enemies in and take care of them. Pathetic US can&#039;t even feed or clothe their own niggers. Your healthcare and infrastructure is shit compared to ours. And wew you spend so much on defense why sen pai! It&#039;s not hippy and cute! Stop!<br><br>Meanwhile, we are still subsidizing their defenses to the scope of billions. Money we could use for our own programs, but we value our allies. So we get wise and say, oh well lets end NATO then. Hans and all his faggot friends exclaim HOW CAN YOU BE SO STUPID. NATO is so important. Still they won&#039;t pay their bills. <br><br>So Trump sends Merkel a joke invoice to stress the importance of honoring your treaties and respect your allies. Hans throws a fit and literally thinks it&#039;s a real invoice, yelling and shitting himself all over the street and refugee camp. Still not paying his debts.","time":1492724898,"resto":122048569,"id":"i6HuzSjN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122049627,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)17:48:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122049072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122049072<\/a><br>A shiptar knowing this much about NEUROCOMMUNICATION?

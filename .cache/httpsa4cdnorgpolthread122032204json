It&#039;s like, yes! Right! Exactly! ...There&#039;s this idea that Hell is a bottomless pit, and that&#039;s because no matter how bad it is, some stupid son-of-a-bitch like you could make it a lot worse! So you think, &#039;Well, what do you do about that?&#039; Well, you accept it. That&#039;s what life is like. It&#039;s suffering. That&#039;s what the religious people have always said, &#039;Life is suffering.&#039; Yes! Well, who wants to admit that? Well, just think about it. Well, so what do you do in the face of that suffering? Try to reduce it! Start with yourself, what good are you? Get yourself together for chrissakes so that when your father dies you&#039;re not whining away in a corner and you can help plan the funeral and you can stand up solidly so that people can rely on you. That&#039;s better! Don&#039;t be a damn victim, of course you&#039;re a victim! Jesus, obviously! Put yourself together. And then maybe if you put yourself together, you know how to do that, you know what&#039;s wrong with you, if you&#039;ll admit it. You know there are a few things you can like, polish up a little bit, that you might even be able to manage in your insufficient present condition.","filename":"Jordan Peterson","ext":".jpg","w":684,"h":960,"tn_w":178,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492717355083,"time":1492717355,"md5":"BJP7kExvYIA43BBNpD+zxw==","fsize":61832,"resto":0,"id":"rttJYjza","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-not-an-accident-that-the-axiomatic-western","country_name":"Israel","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":122032285,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)15:43:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"And so you might shine yourself up a little bit, and then your eyes will be a little more open, and you can shine yourself up a little bit more, and then maybe you can bring your family together, instead of having them be the hateful, spiteful, neurotic, infighting batch that you&#039;re like, doomed to spend Christmas together with. So then you fix yourself up a little bit, kinda humbly, because oh god, you&#039;re a fixer-upper if there ever was one, and then you gotta figure out, well, you gotta figure out how to make peace with your idiot brother, and probably not, because he&#039;s just as dumb as you, so how the hell are you gonna manage that? And so then maybe you get somewhere that way, and then your family&#039;s sorta functioning, and you find out that &#039;Well, that kinda relieved a little bit of suffering,&#039; although it reduced the opportunities for spiteful revenge, and that&#039;s kind of a pain in the neck, and so you get your family together a little bit, and you&#039;re a little clued in then, at least a bit, because you&#039;ve done something difficult that&#039;s actually difficult, you&#039;re wiser, so then mayber you could put a tentative finger out beyond the family and try to change some little thing without wrecking it. s&#039;like, our society is complex and we teach our students that they can just fix it. Like, go fix a military helicopter and see how far you get with that. It&#039;s like, what are you gonna do, you&#039;re like a chimp with a wrench. Whack! &#039;Oh look, it&#039;s better!&#039; It&#039;s like &#039;Nooo! It&#039;s not better.&#039; Things are complicated, fixing things is really hard, and you have to be, like, a golden tool to fix things, and you&#039;re not.","time":1492717388,"resto":122032204,"id":"rttJYjza","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":122032337,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)15:43:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"...you know, if you said to someone, &#039;You wanna have a meaningful life? Everything you do matters. That&#039;s the definition of a meaningful life. But everything you do matters! So you&#039;re gonna have to carry that with you! Or, do you wanna just forget about the whole meaning thing, and then you don&#039;t have any responsibility, because who the hell cares, and you can wander through life doing whatever you want, gratifying impulsive desires, for how all useful that&#039;s going to be, and you&#039;re stuck in meaninglessness, but you don&#039;t have any responsibility.

But cuckholding is the worst. I&#039;d rather have a kid who&#039;s a tranny than one who&#039;s a cuckhold.<br><br>At least the first is about both people having multiple partners (which implies being equal) and the second is about thinking your wife is so great a fucking that you want to show others (which could play as either a display of dominance or promoting a positive part of your partner). But cuckholding is sexualizing your wife&#039;s dislike of yourself. <br><br>Any other version of this shit would be treated as abuse by the same sjw fucks. If they were told that their partner was sexualizing them based on physical or emotional abuse in any other context it would be treated as such. But because it&#039;s emasculating the guy it&#039;s automatically ok to them.","time":1491350268,"resto":119534428,"id":"8oZzKfJh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119537364,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:58:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"I wonder if this comic will push any closeted cucks to try it","time":1491350297,"resto":119534428,"id":"0QSJWIx2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119538222,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)20:05:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119537299\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119537299<\/a><br><br>I think open relationships is a huge mistake and will lead to failure. Swinging on the other hand is never what I will do or tolerate but it avoids the open relationship danger of &quot;one partner is highly sexed, the other isn&#039;t and it just becomes pseudo cuckolding&quot;. You get their wife, they get yours. It&#039;s hedonistic and perverse to excess and still ripe with danger of falling in love with your other partner but there is at least a shred of pride and not being the lowest of the low.<br><br>Cuckolding is the highest and most absurd show of submission. It&#039;s unfathomably emasculating, in fact it pretty much is a milquetoast version of literal castration emasculation. <br><br>Clearly that gets some people off, but some people are so twisted get off at small animals being stepped on or being treated as a designated shitting street so it isn&#039;t saying much.","time":1491350747,"resto":119534428,"id":"QzWf4ApL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119538650,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)20:09:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Cucks are the most pathetic people on Earth, we should thank them from eliminating themselves from the gene-pool.","time":1491350983,"resto":119534428,"id":"+FsmUJFf","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119538784,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)20:10:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119538222\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119538222<\/a><br>When I mentioned open relationships I assumed the situation was in a relatively equal context, as in each partner gets boned as much as they want by whomever they want, rather than a bad situation where one gets boned and the other doesn&#039;t.

It&#039;s the deciding issue which defines whether he&#039;s a leader or a schmuck. Most politicians understand this, and a president&#039;s own party might fight a bill, but eventually they work it out into something they can agree enough to pass, just for the sake of giving the president his due.<br><br>That&#039;s right; part of the initial vote is a show of party support for a president.<br><br>Trump issued an ultimatum and it had zero effect. He actually lost support, and that was despite giving in way more than he wanted on the bill. He blew it. And not only did he blow it, he tossed it. He&#039;s done. It&#039;s over. Even if he comes back to it later, he has publicly displayed an inability to lead.<br><br>But the most important thing we saw is that he doesn&#039;t have support of Republicans, not even in the matter of saving the credibility of his presidency.<br><br>At this point he&#039;ll sign bills that Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell come up with, but he&#039;ll never create legislation again. He&#039;s just the guy with the rubber stamp.","filename":"4d29fb7bbdfe5d74337a4a1978392a0d","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":505,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":233,"tim":1490478794059,"time":1490478794,"md5":"gBCqzvrLcica0l\/NO9rxOQ==","fsize":35821,"resto":0,"id":"VoZepBG\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trumps-presidency-is-over","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":2,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118277705,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)17:55:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ryan created the legislation not Trump.

How can the commonwealth be preserved if we neither marry nor produce children? Surely you are not expecting some to spring up from the earth to succeed to your goods and to public affairs, as myths describe. It is neither pleasing to Heaven nor creditable that our race should cease and the name of Romans meet extinguishment in us, and the city be given up to foreigners,\u2014Greek or even barbarians. We liberate slaves chiefly for the purpose of making out of them as many citizens as possible; we give our allies a share in the government that our numbers may increase: yet you, Romans of the original stock, including Quintii, Valerii, Iulli, are eager that your families and names at once shall perish with you.&quot;","filename":"Goddesses","ext":".jpg","w":5120,"h":3072,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1493114375518,"time":1493114375,"md5":"qohS880DfjW1OP1tSVn1gg==","fsize":1696641,"resto":0,"id":"d6Iww1VE","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"prescient-quotes-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":3,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122718385,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)06:02:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122718213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122718213<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Original non-memetic post with historical context<\/span><br>Bump","time":1493114542,"resto":122718213,"id":"sh2t2E\/9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122719139,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)06:13:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"\u201cThe five marks of the Roman decaying culture:<br>Concern with displaying affluence instead of building wealth;<br>Obsession with sex and perversions of sex;<br>Art becomes freakish and sensationalistic instead of creative and original;<br>Widening disparity between very rich and very poor;<br>Increased demand to live off the state.\u201d <br>\u2015 Edward Gibbon","filename":"Aphrodite-with-ares-caught-by-Hephaestus","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":432,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":73,"tim":1493115228992,"time":1493115228,"md5":"\/jUef+CFnyJovcgvduzd2Q==","fsize":224332,"resto":122718213,"id":"d6Iww1VE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122719836,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)06:24:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"&quot;For the Founders, minorities are in general bad things, mostly identical to factions, selfish groups who have no concern as such for the common good. Unlike older political thinkers, they entertained no hopes of suppressing factions and educating a united or homogeneous citizenry. Instead they constructed an elaborate machinery to contain factions in such a way that they would cancel one another and allow for the pursuit of the common good. The good is still the guiding consideration in their thought, although it is arrived at, less directly than in classical political thought, by tolerating faction. The Founders wished to achieve a national majority concerning the fundamental rights and then prevent that majority from using its power to overturn those fundamental rights.<br>In twentieth-century social science, however, the common good disappears and along with it the negative view of minorities. The very idea of majority\u2014now understood to be selfish interest\u2014is done away with in<br>order to protect the minorities. This breaks the delicate balance between majority and minority in Constitutional thought. In such a perspective, where there is no common good, minorities are no longer problematic, and the protection of them emerges as the central function of government.&quot;<br><br>- Alan Bloom &quot;The Closing of the American Mind&quot;","filename":"Hera","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":365,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493115888686,"time":1493115888,"md5":"vHglywHUdxcled+a6hOQ\/A==","fsize":20440,"resto":122718213,"id":"d6Iww1VE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122720745,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)06:38:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Excellent thread","filename":"st philaret","ext":".jpg","w":776,"h":864,"tn_w":112,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493116685659,"time":1493116685,"md5":"3hHiLuKOtDJV2rd8p3zQtg==","fsize":77679,"resto":122718213,"id":"JYaoRgi6","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"}]}

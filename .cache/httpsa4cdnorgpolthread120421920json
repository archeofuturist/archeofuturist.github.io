You could just go to your church every sunday and listen to everything your priest says blindly without questioning it, definitely a form of mind control.<br><br>But you could also study what you see fit, even if you believe in one specific god, learning and understanding the ideals and philosophy of other religions and beliefs is certainly not being held hostage to any form of mind control.<br><br> I mean shit, atheists are some of the most brain controlled people out there. They don&#039;t believe in any god, obviously, but yet many of them still listen blindly to certain figure heads as their own &quot;priests&quot;. A fair amount of them (usually younger teenagers) will blindly listen to people like the amazing atheist or thunderfoot.<br><br>There are certainly ways to believe in a god or something spiritual without being brainwashed.","time":1491827182,"resto":120421920,"id":"D6MvQaSk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120432724,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)08:26:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120432398\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120432398<\/a><br>Until they believe in the &#039;wrong&#039; god and then that gives them another excuse to treat others like shit","time":1491827219,"resto":120421920,"id":"yVwZ3L5z","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120432825,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)08:27:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120432398\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120432398<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;don&#039;t believe in the existence of god<\/span><br>Gee this is a tricky one","time":1491827276,"resto":120421920,"id":"QJHt3txx","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120433021,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)08:30:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120432398\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120432398<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s useful to spread lies that make people feel better<\/span><br>Why not just become SJW, policing offensive language then?","time":1491827402,"resto":120421920,"id":"l+7YID8G","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":120433047,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)08:30:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120423004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120423004<\/a><br>The only cowards are the ones who live in fear of hellish punishments from sky fairies.","time":1491827414,"resto":120421920,"id":"BPq+2GTd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120433107,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)08:31:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120432724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120432724<\/a><br><br>That&#039;s why I&#039;m okay with the Christian God\/Jesus Christ. <br>At least their value system benefits everyone, including non-believers,, unlike the Jewish and Muslim ones.","time":1491827464,"resto":120421920,"id":"QbKpYKCz","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120433163,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)08:31:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120422874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120422874<\/a><br>this","time":1491827504,"resto":120421920,"id":"8JzRhFpP","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120433328,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)08:33:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120433107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120433107<\/a><br>[citation needed]<br><br>They vote for shit that actively harm non-christians\/etc.","time":1491827607,"resto":120421920,"id":"yVwZ3L5z","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120433511,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)08:35:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120433107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120433107<\/a><br>Christianity is anti-white","time":1491827724,"resto":120421920,"id":"QJHt3txx","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120433683,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)08:37:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120433021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120433021<\/a><br><br>Isn&#039;t God just the \u00dcbermensch with the added role of being the creator of the universe?<br>I see God being the creator more as an explanation for the unknown in a time when science did not exist, rather than an outright lie.<br>Nowadays we don&#039;t need to use God to explain the unknown but I do think we need the concept of God as the highest standard of virtue to prevent us from being bloodthirsty athiest communists.","time":1491827844,"resto":120421920,"id":"QbKpYKCz","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120433994,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)08:41:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120421920\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120421920<\/a><br>Gnostic theist here (Antiochan Orthodox) <br><br>When you experience God, and understand the way and nature of God to some extent it actually becomes hard not to believe.

Donalds one fuck up that he could not afford to make. <br><br>Today he just lost his support from one of the biggest nationalist networks and many, many supporters. He&#039;s openly shown us he is participating in the plans of greater israel by striking syria - whether he knows it or not. <br><br>Our countries need leadership where emotional response is nil, and where critical analysis of information is essential. He has been provided photos of dead children with the most laughable title &#039;SYRIA KILLS ITS OWN CHILDREN&#039;. I along with many TRULY thought he was better than this and could see through the bullshit. This is a huge blow for all of us. <br><br>There is very little hope left. If anybody has any opinions, beliefs or anything feel free to share. But bombing syria and doing israels filthy kike work is something i cannot and will not stand behind. <br><br>Pic related once upon a time.","filename":"1506954_1056037044456030_7546953271844642048_n","ext":".jpg","w":251,"h":251,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491564137569,"time":1491564137,"md5":"1fif6DT9WLoKKkUskG6CpQ==","fsize":10111,"resto":0,"id":"vnTt41BZ","country":"NZ","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-zionist","country_name":"New Zealand","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

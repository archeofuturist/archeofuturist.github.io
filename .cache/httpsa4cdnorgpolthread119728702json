I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s Breitbart or the ledditors, but this place is turning into another hugbox where you can&#039;t have a discussion on anything unless you agree with the majority on here.<br><br>I see it happen many times every day. Somebody voices an opinion, usually saying they disagree with something our infallible saint of a president has done, and instantly a swarm of SJW idiots start responding calling them a &quot;troll&quot; or a &quot;shill.&quot; No counter-arguments, no attempts to disprove what they said or offer a differing opinion. Just &quot;YOU&#039;RE A SHILL.&quot; Name-calling people to avoid having to consider or respond to anything they actually said is a typical leftist tactic, except now we have &quot;troll\/shill&quot; instead of &quot;racist.&quot;<br><br>It&#039;s even worse over on Breitshart. Ever since they added the ability to block people in the comments section, all of the special snowflakes have taken to blocking anybody they see saying anything they disagree with. Go to any article about Trump and look at the comments section for yourself. Somebody so much as says they disagree with this particular thing Trump did and it&#039;s instantly &quot;fuck off troll. BLOCKED!&quot; The only things that it DOES seem to be ok to criticise Trump on are articles about him hiring women or non-whites to positions of power. Because we might as well adopt the left&#039;s identity politics while we&#039;re adopting their intolerance and &quot;argument&quot; tactics.<br><br>Call me a troll or a shill if you want, but this is a serious problem that needs to be addressed ASAP. There is no point in having a discussion board if you cannot actually HAVE any discussions on it.","filename":"1491433533455","ext":".jpg","w":591,"h":572,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":241,"tim":1491474364249,"time":1491474364,"md5":"GesqH2NJ6t0JGso8iHf+Wg==","fsize":107342,"resto":0,"id":"p+NqKO7k","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-sick-of-rightwing-sjwism","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119728794,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)06:27:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"desu that dude is exactly who i imagine the average \/polack to be","time":1491474445,"resto":119728702,"id":"UhjuqDFj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119728879,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)06:28:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"America is doomed","filename":"coochie grabber","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":533,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491474520939,"time":1491474520,"md5":"uMJgIGOH76eyHL2q6tYMXA==","fsize":60235,"resto":119728702,"id":"4YLF5P3R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119728891,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)06:28:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119728702\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119728702<\/a><br><br>Wake up!<br><br>NEOCONs own your mind.<br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119728348#p119728348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119728348<\/a>","time":1491474530,"resto":119728702,"id":"gYpQ0p4h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119728968,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)06:29:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"Not reading that shit.<br>Kys OP and go back to leftypol","time":1491474596,"resto":119728702,"id":"+dmnRhr8","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"}]}

Just voices them more subtly to try and infiltrate the ranks first.<br>3. Trump has always been a Jewish plant, hated him from the start and hate him now. Honourable intentions, but not very pragmatic. Trump was the best of a bad situation when he was all about the Second Amendment, isolationism, the wall, and brining jobs back. <br>4. Legitimately used to be a previous Trump supporter because his policies are excellent for white nationalism\/anti-Jewry, ESPECIALLY isolationism from the ME and not fighting in Jewish wars. Disappointed that he has intervened. <br>5. We love Trump no matter what and will ignore any increasingly neo-conservative sentiments. Honour is one thing, but foolish betrayal is another. If Trump openly admits to wishing for the Jews to have a hegemony in the US (as his actions are showing), you would not support him.

We did route clearance and generally stayed pretty busy while in garrison. Field training on post for 5-15 days at a time every few months. Ranges in between that. A decent amount of temport duty stations (TDY) gigs for extra training. In my case that would be R2C2 (Route Reconnisance Command and Control) operator\/sapper (2 weeks), EOCA (Explosive ordinance clearance agent), Sapper school (http:\/\/www.wood.army.mil\/sapper\/).<wbr> In country there were also cool classes. For example, Blow In Place (BIP)...basically they train you to use c4 to blow up IEDs\/ordinance we&#039;d find. Post Blast Analysis school, where they gave us the tools to analyze the type and size of IEDs that went off (actually a great tool), and a few others i cant remember right now.<br><br>I&#039;ve heard horror stories of my buddies who stayed in and reclassed though.

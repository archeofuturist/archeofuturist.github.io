I can understand people not wanting to work more but isn&#039;t part of the reason for better medical care to make people healthier for longer so that they can productively contribute for a longer time? Even if older people cannot necessarily complete certain jobs they could when they were younger is it wrong to ask them to work some hours at a job which fits their skill level, no matter what that is? I don&#039;t want to sound like a heartless dick who wants to work people to death, do these sound like actually reasonable suggestions?","filename":"KatyPerry2","ext":".png","w":592,"h":898,"tn_w":164,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492200180435,"time":1492200180,"md5":"jEwrOWEvMB52OroynWeqyA==","fsize":659074,"resto":0,"id":"DPIhNbxO","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"with-people-living-longer-and-older-people","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":1,"unique_ips":11},{"no":121105690,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)16:05:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121105346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121105346<\/a><br>They&#039;re already doing it here, from 65 to 70 and the planned to make it 75....","time":1492200344,"resto":121105346,"id":"Q1soncuM","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":121105933,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)16:07:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121105346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121105346<\/a><br>is that a realdoll","time":1492200464,"resto":121105346,"id":"1gOl99xQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121106385,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)16:11:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121105346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121105346<\/a><br>In principle, I &#039;d say yes.

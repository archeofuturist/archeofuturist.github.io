The towns these are located in own cut a lot of deals for the businesses in terms f paying for construction and special tax permissions or zoning licenses to be overlooked. The buck is passed onto the poor man because the blue collar workers are working for these big companies in some capacity. The need for expansion of income is why we have burger strips, not because of demand. I live within 3 blocks of two Steak n Shakes, two KFCs, an IHOP, Arby&#039;s, Tasty&#039;s, Wingstop, Popeye&#039;s, Taco Bell, 2 Dairy Queens, Papa John&#039;s, Pizza Hut, Papa Murphy&#039;s, Godfathers, China House, Asia Buffet, Wendy&#039;s, 4 McDonald&#039;s, 2 Burger Kings and probably a dozen or better food trucks and aybe a dozen sit down restaurants. They&#039;re almost all empty all the times except Steak n Shake and Wendy&#039;s. Usually you&#039;ll only find 2-5 people working at any time. Despite this the service is shit tier and slow at any given one of these. There are maybe 4 or 5 owners for all these restaurants and they all branched out from other places. It&#039;s something that&#039;s been forced onto us that is not needed. Central Illinois is a good place to sneak in some tax credits.","time":1491881502,"resto":120533001,"id":"OmhDfqir","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120546032,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)23:32:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"Southern Illinois here,ake Chicago it&#039;s own state and Illinois would be great again","time":1491881549,"resto":120533001,"id":"wHjLMwLO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120546749,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)23:38:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120534139\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120534139<\/a><br>Interesting!

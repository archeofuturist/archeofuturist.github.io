Here&#039;s the gist of what&#039;s going to happen: the two-state solution is a meme at this point. Nobody believes that it can be accomplished now that the settlements are this numerous. The palestinian authority is literally controlled opposition, they&#039;re essentially paid lame ducks and a mere puppet. Hamas is isolated and doesn&#039;t have the support from the arab world at large that it once did. In short, Palestine will officially become a province of Israel under Knesset control in the next 5-10 years imo. At which point the left will shrug their shoulders and claim the issue was too complex, too multifaceted, and they wished something could have been done but it was so gosh darn complicated.","time":1490688374,"resto":118626137,"id":"dV3aWiPh","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118627397,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:08:09","name":"Captain (((Agenda)))","com":"<a href=\"#p118627280\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118627280<\/a><br>Did Israel kill Yasser Arafat, or at least fund Hamas to kill him?

I&#039;d rather not have to paraphrase the leftist jew Norman Finkelstein, but the notion that the solution has to be &quot;figured out&quot; is a meme. The arabs have always asked for the following things: a return to pre-1967 borders and the right of return for the millions of palestinians expats in Jordan, Lebanon, etc. There was a time where this was viewed as an acceptable and reasonable compromize. No gassing, no expulsion of jews. Ofc anyone who EVER expected the jews to return to pre-1967 borders and give up Jerusalem is the king of fools.

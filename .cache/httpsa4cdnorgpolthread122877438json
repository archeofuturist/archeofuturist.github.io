Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1488223422556","ext":".png","w":264,"h":200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":189,"tim":1493208840327,"time":1493208840,"md5":"CZeJ6Dns1Hdbc+F3CtMj9A==","fsize":276085,"resto":0,"id":"\/\/HexGDg","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122877568,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)08:15:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122877438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122877438<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/122877295#p122877295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122877295<\/a><br>samefag","time":1493208941,"resto":122877438,"id":"JmqxEGH0","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122879498,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)08:40:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122877438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122877438<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that pic<\/span><br><br>Louis &quot;Linkara&quot; Lovhaug is a fundamentalist-christian and a conservative.","filename":"tmp_16299-images326098955","ext":".jpg","w":259,"h":194,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493210413643,"time":1493210413,"md5":"VtIlE+21P46z7V6UkdRNFQ==","fsize":7178,"resto":122877438,"id":"PqjQ5E0J","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

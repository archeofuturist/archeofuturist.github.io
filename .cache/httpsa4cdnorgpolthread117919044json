So you use the adjacent building to get up there.<br><br>The FACT building just happens to have a convenient building with rooftop access right next to it. So why doesn&#039;t some anon just pretend to work on the building as a painter? Just take a ladder and a backpack filled with (((painting supplies))) up there and take the flag. I&#039;m sure the owners of that building wouldn&#039;t have a problem with a worker using their rooftop access.<br><br>(pic related, is the 2 buildings)","filename":"plan","ext":".png","w":1773,"h":970,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":136,"tim":1490266973508,"time":1490266973,"md5":"vzP390xl8QJUyFqB5iRisg==","fsize":2944151,"resto":0,"id":"AnAjZtMZ","country":"NL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hwndu-season-4-offensive-plan-1","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":117919171,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)07:04:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"OP here, forgot to add:<br><br>This avoids interacting with the staff at the FACT building that are probably aware the flag is a target.","time":1490267070,"resto":117919044,"id":"AnAjZtMZ","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":117919253,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)07:05:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117919044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117919044<\/a><br>Isnt place full of cameras?Or so anons said.

If this isn\u2019t scary enough news, even if your machine doesn\u2019t have SMT, ISM, or SBT provisioned, it is still vulnerable, just not over the network. For the moment. From what SemiAccurate gathers, there is literally no Intel box made in the last 9+ years that isn\u2019t at risk. This is somewhere between nightmarish and apocalyptic.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The problem is quite simple, the ME controls the network ports and has DMA access to the system. It can arbitrarily read and write to any memory or storage on the system, can bypass disk encryption once it is unlocked (and possibly if it has not, SemiAccurate hasn\u2019t been able to 100% verify this capability yet), read and write to the screen, and do all of this completely unlogged. Due to the network access abilities, it can also send whatever it finds out to wherever it wants, encrypted or not.<\/span>","filename":"4L_iDxnoiPC","ext":".png","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493706134363,"time":1493706134,"md5":"e2mg8ytSf6sFBlh3seZfEQ==","fsize":1960971,"resto":0,"id":"QUplhZRh","country":"IL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"intel-me","country_name":"Israel","replies":236,"images":38,"unique_ips":113,"tail_size":50},{"no":123737124,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)02:25:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123736854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123736854<\/a><br>Of course he was right.","time":1493706312,"resto":123736854,"id":"orynNJdU","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123737577,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)02:30:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123736854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123736854<\/a><br>welp, brb getting an AMD cpu and nuking my pc","time":1493706656,"resto":123736854,"id":"STIfmnHX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123737760,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)02:33:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123736854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123736854<\/a><br>looks right after wikileaks","time":1493706795,"resto":123736854,"id":"1F2GA1R4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123737871,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)02:34:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123737577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123737577<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123736854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123736854<\/a><br><br>Is AMD compromised?","time":1493706884,"resto":123736854,"id":"MLQ6gJVS","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":123738105,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)02:37:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123737871\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123737871<\/a><br>I hope not.","time":1493707058,"resto":123736854,"id":"QUplhZRh","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":123738395,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)02:41:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123736854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123736854<\/a><br>the image said anyone with i3 i5 and i7, but the official word so far is that &quot;This vulnerability does not exist on Intel-based consumer PCs.&quot;

I believe s\/he is lying, and doing so to concern-troll. That said, there is a HUGE grain of truth in the lie.<br><br>The Management Engine, which is part of the Active Management Technology, is real. It&#039;s a closed-source, signed binary from Intel running the ThreadX operating system and is capable of running signed Java applets developed with its SDK. It&#039;s a backdoor into your computer that most non-business consumers have on their laptops.<br><br>It&#039;s extremely unlikely that there will ever be anything other than iAMT (opaque binary blob from Intel) that will actually run on the iAMT ARC core, because it requires to be code-signed by Intel. Disabling iAMT from the BIOS\/UEFI is possible; however, in the past this method has been less than foolproof.<br><br>It&#039;s possible that your device doesn&#039;t actually contain the worst parts of iAMT. If it&#039;s a Chromebook, especially, it probably has the 2MB stub version of the firmware which doesn&#039;t include the network-capable parts of ME, or Intel Anti-Theft. What&#039;s more, with select laptops, one can build one&#039;s own firmware in the form of either Coreboot or Libreboot. In combination with a hardware security module, this can help assure you&#039;re booting with the ME firmware you believe that you&#039;re booting with and not one that has been modified and signed by Intel under suspicious circumstances. It&#039;s also possible to remove most of the content of that binary without affecting the functionality of the laptop. This will require an external programmer and is a fairly recently discovered procedure.<br><br>While difficult and requires sacrifices, it&#039;s possible to live without ME and other threatening parts of iAMT even using relatively modern hardware. If you&#039;re interested in hardware which is configured out-of-the box without ME-style backdoors, look into purchasing from Minifree or Libiquity. If you need faster hardware, look into Purism.","filename":"MM-!!!0~917[1]","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":600,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493720968936,"time":1493720968,"md5":"RHexoA3sgoIvGl4ULJtJ6Q==","fsize":49852,"resto":123736854,"id":"eYdEHHli","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123753960,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)06:31:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123753552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123753552<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; implying a car can be &quot;controlled remotely&quot; through it&#039;s computer control module <\/span><br><br>the most that anyone could possibly do to a car remotely is kill the engine and prevent re-start.<br><br>there is no electronic steering, brake, throttle or gear change control <br>take that shit back to the coast-to-coast am conspiracy network","time":1493721093,"resto":123736854,"id":"a1xY57RG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123753997,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)06:32:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123753821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123753821<\/a><br>What if I want an upcoming 6 core Coffe Lake running at 5 GHZ stock?","time":1493721141,"resto":123736854,"id":"kvZsYm6X","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123754070,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)06:33:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123753960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123753960<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He doesn&#039;t know what drive by wire is<\/span>","time":1493721213,"resto":123736854,"id":"31Aj+R7x","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123754087,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)06:33:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123753960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123753960<\/a><br>Tell that to automated steering Tesla and Volkswagen group and BMW and Mercedes or any car that can &quot;keep its lane&quot; or &quot;switch lanes alone&quot;.

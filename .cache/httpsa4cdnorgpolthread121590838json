Just sit with that for a second. Fucking Detroit, once mentioned in the same breath as New York or London. They were once yanking so much copper out of the upper peninsula you could make more mining it then gold. The great lakes used to be loaded with steamships, carrying out ore and cars to the cost, like the black ships of japan.<br><br>And then we collapsed.<br><br>The unions went fully corrupt, the industry giants, their money made, shifted out to cheaper and browner labor. The mines dried up, the lines shut down, and then the decay set in. Niggers are like pigs, they will go feral in one generation. With no hard-ass cops to keep them in line, and no actual work, they became africa in record time. Rape, steal, kill, and breed, and suddenly everything is falling apart as everyone who can runs for the fucking hills, the democrats ride a voting wave they know will never break, and suddenly the died in the wool, fuck your feelings, work or die bastards who made those places great were gone, dead, or broken.<br><br>We used to be something. I hope maybe we can be again. We&#039;ve gone so long being way, way past lost hope. It&#039;s why everyone rose up along the rust belt to vote, because we saw a chance to maybe be something again. Even if it&#039;s a lie, we&#039;d rather hold on to it then keep dying under the yoke of P.C. culture and law-regulated feelings.<br><br>Pic related.

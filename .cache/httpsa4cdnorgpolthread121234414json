According to him, these weapons are hidden from the experts of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons. Al-Sakat fled Syria in 2013, writes the Daily Telegraph .<br>&quot;They recognized the presence of only 1.3 thousand tons, but we know that in fact they were almost twice as large, they had at least two thousand tons,&quot; said the 53-year-old general.<br>We are talking about sarin, precursors, aviation bombs carrying chemical charges and chemical warheads for the Scud missiles. According to the fugitive general, the military took out the banned weapons to the city of Jabl and warehouses near Homs a few weeks before the arrival of the OPCW inspectors. The source also said that since 2014 Syria does not produce nerve agents, because the authorities allegedly have enough of them. However, the general living in Europe did not provide proof of his words.<br>Earlier, Syrian President Bashar Assad said that his country has no chemical weapons after in 2013 Syria abandoned the entire arsenal.<br>Meanwhile, Russia will insist not only the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, but also the United Nations on the urgent direction of inspectors to investigate the incident with the alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria. This was stated by Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov following a meeting with Foreign Minister of Qatar Mohammad Al Thani, Tass reports . In addition, he expressed the opinion that the runaway general made his statement under pressure.","time":1492279728,"resto":121234414,"id":"b9Ae5Tna","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121238457,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)14:09:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Reminder that Erdogan winning his referendum is good for President Assad : it will weaken European Turkish ties, Nato turkish ties and force Erdogan to rethink his strategies in neighbouring countries.

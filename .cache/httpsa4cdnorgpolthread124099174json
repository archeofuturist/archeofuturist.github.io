It would give Americans who earn upward of $100,000 tax credits to help purchase insurance. Right now, Obamacare\u2019s tax credits are only available to individuals who earn less than $64,000.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Republican bill makes it easier for insurers to charge lower prices to young people, too. Right now, insurance plans are required to only charge the oldest enrollees three times as much as the youngest enrollees. AHCA would change that rule to allow insurers to charge the oldest enrollees five times as much. This would raise premiums on the elderly but lower them for young Americans.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;AHCA would let states apply for waivers so that insurers in those states could charge people with preexisting conditions higher premiums. For healthy people without preexisting conditions, this would be a benefit: They would no longer have to pay more so that the insurance company could cover the high medical bills of other enrollees. Instead, the Republican bill would move the individual market closer to the one that we had before Obamacare, where health insurance premiums were meant to reflect how much an individual\u2019s own coverage is expected to cost.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The AHCA would amount to a huge tax cut for the wealthiest Americans by rolling back key taxes included in Obamacare.

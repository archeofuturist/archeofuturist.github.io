Privacy is respect to leave someone alone not a duty of the state to cover up your porn addiction. Searching the internet is not a privacy issue. It&#039;s you actively engaging with others. And you further distance your self from privacy by using other people&#039;s service and soliciting your own service to others. You&#039;re in a market, not your home. Your privacy ends the moment you want something from the internet. You give up privacy when you enter the public sphere. The internet isn&#039;t your private personal toy, it&#039;s the public made personal. If someone wants tell others who shops at thier site, why not?

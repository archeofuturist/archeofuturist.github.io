I&#039;m hoping you guys have some good shit here, because I&#039;ve learned some, and I&#039;ll post what I&#039;ve learned, but it seems everyone here should be able to contribute on the subject. Also, I&#039;m not any sort of trained debater, I&#039;m simply a humble meme farmer who spilled out of his containment board a few times.<br><br>Actual debate tactics and triggering memes are welcome as well.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;liberals project a lot<\/span><br>most of the tidbits I&#039;ve found have come from analyzing their own words. It seems that the things that trigger them are the things they hate the most about themselves (usually). look at how they insult you. these are the things they&#039;re most afraid of. most of what I&#039;ve found boils down to you exploiting things about them that they insult you for, since that&#039;s what they most fear.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;liberals are intellectually insecure<\/span><br>this comes directly from my point about their projection. during argument they will regularly question and berate your intellect\/wit\/educational status. this is largely because of how insecure they are about their own. Never believe or repeat the meme that liberals are all degreed. Even when mocking their art degrees. Most don&#039;t even have a degree. But, there are undoubtedly some incredibly smart liberals. Of course they have degrees and of course these big name &quot;intellectuals&quot; are their anointed heroes. Naturally, these are the people they look up to. they do this because it makes them feel as if they fit in with the intellectuals themselves. it&#039;s the same reason they love Ted Talks. It&#039;s easy and they feel it gives them intellectual superiority (IE. they don&#039;t have to waste time on actually getting a degree, even the Soros-paid protesters can spend 15 minutes to watch one of those on the ride to the BLM protest, right?).","filename":"48976546849","ext":".png","w":1273,"h":1117,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":219,"tim":1493007980022,"time":1493007980,"md5":"Bp6B2rnbHjjOJr1Kct8JeA==","fsize":633444,"resto":0,"id":"eW+7nwls","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"arguments-understanding-the-psychology-of","country_name":"United States","replies":27,"images":8,"unique_ips":15},{"no":122542199,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:27:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"I spent time on Richard Dawkins&#039; website during the 2005ish &quot;atheist apocalypse&quot; and every sub-90 IQ motherfucker who was on the site thought he\/she deserved the same respect as Dawkins for simply being of the same philosophical brand (also, they were really just left wingers who wanted to hate Christianity, which is why Dawkins lost so many followers after he criticized Islam, but that&#039;s another story). The average liberal constantly overestimates their intellect, and always feels as if they deserve intellectual respect simply because of the views they chose to follow. This is a logical fallacy. Question and\/or mock their intelligence\/education. Their worst fear? To look uneducated. If you can convincingly do this it will shut them down fast. Bonus points: if you can convincingly tie in that their self-assessed intellectual superiority is influenced by their own sense of entitlement\/privilege, you can really wipe the smug fucking smiles from their faces in a hurry.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;need to feel as if they significantly impact the world<\/span><br>One of the most common insults a liberal will throw your way is how &quot;insignificant&quot; or &quot;irrelevant&quot; your life is. Again, this is projection. This is why they talk about &quot;flyover states&quot;. This is why they talk down at &quot;rural&quot; or even &quot;suburban&quot; people. They mostly live irrelevant lives doing nothing that significantly contributes to humanity, then lash out at you when they come the realization that, beyond leaving comments at the WaPo, they&#039;re irrelevant themselves. this entire phenomenon could almost be covered the exact same way as the last example. Once again they wish to celebrate the accolades that a better person has been awarded through philosophical osmosis. By rubbing elbows with a &quot;significant&quot; person, even if only by reading their book or attending their lecture, they feel justified in claiming some part of their accomplishments as their own.","time":1493008064,"resto":122542054,"id":"eW+7nwls","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122542228,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:28:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"When they fall short of their goals, even those who go on to get a liberal-approved degrees and go to work in a liberal-approved cities and work towards the liberal-approved goals that they were told would change the world, they then realize they&#039;re just a rat in the same race as every other human and are no different than any suburban or rural &quot;retard&quot; they&#039;ve spent their life railing against. So they lash out at you out of projection of their own lofty &quot;failures&quot;.

I&#039;ve never used this in person but it&#039;s great for when you&#039;re trolling the message board of a typical news site frequented by aging hippies. Once again, I just reroute it to the whole projecting thing. When they hit you with these insults (for instance &quot;didn&#039;t realize they allowed internet in the insane asylum! Take your meds grandpa! Hur hur&quot;) I&#039;ve found that by simply pointing out that they must have really thin skin to think that these insults would ever really upset anyone, and therefore &quot;what does that say about you?&quot; is a quick way to get them to stop. They don&#039;t want to be mean, so take advantage of that.

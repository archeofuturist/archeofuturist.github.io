Even if you lynch niggers it has no effect on their hyper criminality they just keep doing it and doing it no matter what you do. The only way to end it is to isolate niggers away from you forever or suffer from their uncivilized behavior until they eventually outbreed you.","time":1491159107,"resto":119229946,"id":"m4iwPJKs","country":"BS","country_name":"Bahamas"},{"no":119230987,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)14:54:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119230547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119230547<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why did Abe Lincoln fear race-mixing in the 1800s?<\/span><br>Answer: Lincoln genuinely saw blacks as an inferior race.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Am I missing something here? <\/span><br>Lincoln genuinely saw blacks as an inferior race.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;so why the fuck was Lincoln freaking out about it?<\/span><br>Lincoln genuinely saw blacks as an inferior race.","time":1491159246,"resto":119229946,"id":"DEHmfOmj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119231088,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)14:55:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119230708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119230708<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bahamas<\/span><br><br>Literally nothing you wrote is relevant to the what is written in my OP.","time":1491159302,"resto":119229946,"id":"\/eH3ru7H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119232151,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:03:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119230987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119230987<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Answer: Lincoln genuinely saw blacks as an inferior race.<\/span><br><br>Wow, your IQ is real low. My question isn&#039;t about his view on the idea of race mixing, in some abstract sense. My question is in regard to his view that mass race mixing is an eventual reality if whites and blacks continue to occupy the same territory. My point is that this idea is irrational when you take into account the world that this idea is speaking about. Which leads me to my question, why the fuck did Abe Lincoln have this fear.","time":1491159822,"resto":119229946,"id":"\/eH3ru7H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Eventually societal stress under the current trajectory will grow till the point that we start seeing social revolutions, because simply put poor stupid people riot and if there is enough backing from the educated there will be outright rebellion. What that means is that even those who are productive hard working members of society end up on the chopping block. One way to alleviate this pressure is basic income. It allows a minimal state of being that is enough for most of the public, allowing them enough income to not starve and prop up the consumption side of the economy so it doesn&#039;t completely topple in the west. It is not perfect but it is preferable for the owners of production to basically hand their profits back out vs being strung up in the streets. I would personally add that cheap abortions should be made readily available, allowing the poor to more or less practice population control on themselves. The other major alternative is the \/pol\/ route which is a nationalist police state. A intensely strong military state with benefits reserved for party loyalists, military, and veterans. Rebellion would be held in check by overwhelming military force across the board. All of this is, of course, just a band aid till we can achieve the tech for actual post scarcity or space travel that allows us to ship off and find new resources among the stars.","time":1491841038,"resto":120436376,"id":"gfgc1PWq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120454436,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)12:21:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120453698\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120453698<\/a><br>No capitalism is selling what you have and delivering a proper product.<br>If the product is your labor skills so be it.<br>I don&#039;t give a shit if the guy that hires me profits from it.

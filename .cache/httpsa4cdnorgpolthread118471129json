Not really. It&#039;s like if you have a corvette say, and someone steals it, you can think: Well I know why they stole it! They want to have the corvette! You know it&#039;s an understandable motivation to want power. It&#039;s not necessarily an admirable one. Although sometimes power is a perfectly reasonable thing to pursuit. But I don&#039;t know why we ever assumed that those guys were after victory. Like you should never make the presupposition that everyone is out to win. Some people are out to lose, and the more people they can take with them, the better. You know when Hitler died he committed suicide in a bunker way down below in Berlin whilst Berlin was on fire, and Europe was burning. You know it&#039;s like as far as I can tell that was exactly what Hitler was after right from the beginning.&quot;<\/span>","filename":"nk-photos-ci-jordan-peterson-23","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490588980308,"time":1490588980,"md5":"gUW\/1tFLa012L4DK1Q9Dsw==","fsize":278019,"resto":0,"id":"b8p6kULp","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-the-fuck-did-i-love-story-books-peterson","country_name":"Australia","replies":12,"images":2,"unique_ips":11},{"no":118471498,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:33:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118471129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118471129<\/a><br><br>Hitler was a taste for drama, and fucked up badly, dragging all of europe down with him?<br><br>I mean, he&#039;s not wrong","time":1490589193,"resto":118471129,"id":"kTphBpiq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118471503,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:33:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118471129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118471129<\/a><br>tl;dr Some people just want to watch the world burn.","time":1490589201,"resto":118471129,"id":"8bp0L4Jd","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118472145,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:39:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118471503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118471503<\/a><br><br>...and others like to believe in story books... like the bible.","time":1490589580,"resto":118471129,"id":"b8p6kULp","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118472333,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:41:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118472145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118472145<\/a><br><br>I don&#039;t interpret the bible as factual truth.","time":1490589695,"resto":118471129,"id":"8bp0L4Jd","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118472588,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:44:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118472145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118472145<\/a><br><br>He doesn&#039;t believe in Bible though.<br><br>He thinks that archetypes used in Abrahamic religions are pragmatic truths that helps govern human societies and mental health in a revolutionary sense.<br><br>For example, evolution is a scientific truth.<br><br>But, Judeo Christian beliefs are &#039;&#039;pragmatic truths&#039;&#039; that helps to keep society intact and protect it from corruption such as bad behaviours like greed, wroth etc leading to &#039;&#039;hell&#039;&#039; and good behaviours such as bravery, loyality to ones kin, patience are ways to &#039;&#039;heaven&#039;&#039;.","time":1490589852,"resto":118471129,"id":"gtZNVFni","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":118472990,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:48:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118472145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118472145<\/a><br>edgy","time":1490590103,"resto":118471129,"id":"YxeebBEF","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118474336,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)01:02:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118472145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118472145<\/a><br>*tips fedora*<br><br><a href=\"#p118472588\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118472588<\/a><br>He thinks of himself as deeply religious, it&#039;s just that he&#039;s not some retarded creationist.

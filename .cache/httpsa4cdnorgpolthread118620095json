I was a cop btw, and another example of a guy who chopped his wife&#039;s son head with an axe after he learned the kid wasn&#039;t his because she cheated. The kid was 7. We brought him to the woods and executed with a bullet in the neck. It was the procedure in such cases of horrific crimes were there was no doubt the guy did it. So the justice was fair and adapted, not rigid shit like now where the thief guy would end in prison and the murderer get away with 10-15 years. The society was also very decent, men shaved properly, dressed properly and women were strong and equal in law but knew their place and the propaganda reinforced that idea of a strong woman in her housewife and maternal role. Faggs weren&#039;t allowed and religion was permabanned, churches and mosques turned into schools or learning centers for the symbol, from obscurantism and so on.

There was no real difference between fascist countries and traditional commie countries in terms of social issues. The faggs laping as commies with their dyed hair today have no idea what they&#039;re talking about. In communist Albania they would have been sent to workcamps for being divergents and undermining the countries unity and not complying to their duty of decency and public societal order, starting with the beardy ponytail unfit faggot Pablo Iglesias. Communism only works if people are homogenous, which is why it searches unity and erases all deviant behaviours like homosexuality or even having a fucking hipster beard if you&#039;re not a mountaineer, or different culture\/skin colour, or every other source of authority foreign to the state, like religion or independant media who all push different agendas other than the one of the state, patriotic and self relying at the core in the commies case. If the state is rich enough and invests in a field, it can innovate as well just like the capitalists, which is why Albania still sells a hugeton of hydro electricity to neigbhours, hydro centrals all constructed 50 years ago, and why we had like 200 parents about turbines and hydro in general back then, because the state invested in it. This is why the USSR won the space race as well. Communism can work, but not for long.

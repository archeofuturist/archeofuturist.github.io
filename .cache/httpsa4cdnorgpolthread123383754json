John Stevens said the intent of a bill to assign &quot;natural and ordinary meaning&quot; to terms in state law was, in part, aimed at compelling courts to side more closely with the dissenting opinion in the U.S. Supreme Court&#039;s landmark same-sex marriage ruling.<br><br>During a Senate debate Thursday, several state senators pointed to examples in state law where the definitions of terms like &quot;agriculture,&quot; &quot;awful,&quot; &quot;book,&quot; and &quot;statue&quot; and others have been updated to reflect more current culture. If changes in society mean those terms must be redefined, some senators argued that&#039;s the purview of a government&#039;s legislative body.<br><br>But when the hour-long debate turned to terms like &quot;mother,&quot; &quot;father,&quot; &quot;husband&quot; and &quot;wife,&quot; Stevens said the legislature hopes to compel courts to side with late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and his dissent of the 2015 case that gave equal marriage rights to same-sex couples.<br><br>Stevens said courts should &quot;do what Justice Scalia emphasized people should do and that is look at the meaning of the word at the time the legislation was passed.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Pull out a dictionary and see what the word meant, because you would have to assume the legislature didn&#039;t define the word,&quot; said Stevens, R-Huntingdon.<br><br>The debate took place before the Senate voted 23-6 to approve the controversial measure that LGBT rights advocates view as a pathway to discrimination and an attempt to undermine the 2015 high-court decision. The House approved the measure last month on a 70-23 vote.","filename":"tennessee","ext":".gif","w":1412,"h":1055,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":186,"tim":1493501155512,"time":1493501155,"md5":"kRF0VXDYg94X4ImMxmVOoQ==","fsize":256348,"resto":0,"id":"qWScwXUY","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"senate-passes-natural-ordinary-meaning-bill","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123384181,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)17:29:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123383754\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123383754<\/a><br><br>I&#039;m confused.

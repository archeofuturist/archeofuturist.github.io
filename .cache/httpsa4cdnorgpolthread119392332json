I work in the trade industry and one of the things that amazes me the most is the societal differences between Western women and Chinese women. Chinese women are far less materialistic and are simply not groomed in the same way Western women are. This supposed gender gap simply does not exist there. It&#039;s very common to see female executives in China and they do a damn good job. Jennifer here in the USA spends her time getting her Dunkin Donuts iced coffee, putting on her bug eyed sunglasses, and walking around with her big ass plaid purse. Yan Ti of Shenzhen doesn&#039;t waste her time with that bullshit and is far more cut throat as a result. Most of the Chinese people are like this.

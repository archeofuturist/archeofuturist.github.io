The parents are basically your average lefty SJW types, the twins parents especially as they are a radical feminist mother and a cucked beta husband, but the show specifically lampoons them and makes them look ridiculous, and the baby characters ended up stumbling on a moral lesson despite their retard failure parents. That&#039;s the way I interpreted it at least, the parents were portrayed as too retarded for their own good and the babies are the ones who are actually woke.","time":1492150130,"resto":121010836,"id":"fn1u4s7c","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121027373,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)02:12:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121027117\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121027117<\/a><br>this, the whole Lipschitz thing was done for humor too","time":1492150323,"resto":121010836,"id":"AgLRMUXO","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":121027384,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)02:12:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121010836\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121010836<\/a><br>the doctor was always a joke and wrong u retard. they prob hated jews. did you even watch rugrats?","time":1492150333,"resto":121010836,"id":"Q9niFmEn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121027453,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)02:13:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121010836\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121010836<\/a><br>Didn&#039;t work that well, I called him Dr. Shitlips to the mirth of my classmates.","time":1492150393,"resto":121010836,"id":"Qg4SunLU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121027561,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)02:14:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121013390\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121013390<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shite music<\/span><br>Mark Mothersbaugh from the awesome band DEVO did the music and it&#039;s meant to evoke childhood with the toddler&#039;s carousel melodies and the xylophone, etc. I always thought the music was a strength of the show.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shite animation<\/span><br>It&#039;s sloppy and expressionistic for the same reason as the music above, it was meant to evoke what being a baby and seeing the world through new eyes might be like.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;compression on vocals<\/span><br>In a 90&#039;s cartoon, lol<br><br>What are you, 15?","time":1492150468,"resto":121010836,"id":"fn1u4s7c","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121027571,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)02:14:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Jewish characters in a cartoon = IDF psyop<br><br>wake up sheeple","time":1492150474,"resto":121010836,"id":"8CQiKIk0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121027812,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)02:17:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121015405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121015405<\/a><br><br>Gotta love that the anti-defamation league leaves out any mention of Jewishness in its own name.","time":1492150657,"resto":121010836,"id":"VQ0u1qNk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121027880,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)02:18:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121010836\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121010836<\/a><br>I don&#039;t know about the new Rugrats, but back in the 90&#039;s it was a more innocent time, and there wasn&#039;t a lot of propaganda in it.<br><br>Dr. Lipschitz was a comical character, some know-it-all blowhard Jew doctor who was portrayed as being a charlatan making money off of gullible moms by selling books, and all the parents had flaws that would be be celebrated by the modern left (e.g Angelica&#039;s mom, strong independent woman - turned Angelica into an asshole who sought comfort in a Cynthia doll, or Tommy&#039;s mom who believed everything Dr. Lipschitz says, Chuckie&#039;s dad a total nu-male cuck, etc).

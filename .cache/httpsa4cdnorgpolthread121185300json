Yeah, it&#039;s a horrible, totalitarian dictatorship. We fucking get it already.

People right now are freaking out over &#039;tensions&#039; between the US and North Korea. But we all know within our hearts that absolutely nothing is going to happen. And we know this because *they do this every year*. <br><br>It&#039;s always consistent, too - North Korea will start sabre-rattling about how it&#039;ll destroy the &#039;imperialist yankee aggressors&#039; or some other load of bollocks, the US will pretend to care and will say that it will take action if North Korea continues to make threats, North Korea will then make a few more empty threats until eventually the US gives them some foreign aid to get them to shut up. It even happens around the same time every year to boot (around April\/May). North Korea does this because it knows that it&#039;s a reliable way for them to obtain foreign aid, and the US goes along with it because they know it&#039;s the easiest way to keep everyone happy. But it seems like the general public is incapable of cottoning on to this, which is why the media coverage makes it feel like we have an annual historical re-enactment of the Cuban missile crisis.

Ba&#039;athism has clearly defined and undisputed ideological roots in European fascism. <br><br>and as far as the DPRK, I&#039;ve personally been a huge admirer of Chosun for years, the DPRK government maintains friendly relationships with various ultra-nationalist and anti-Semitic groups, including one that I&#039;m a member of. <br><br>Just because you see them as communist doesn&#039;t mean they are. You gotta provide some proof to back up your claim that it&#039;s a communist state. They have dropped Marxism-Leninism in favor of Juche Thought\/Kimilsungism in the 1970s, and removed the word communism (Korean: \uacf5\uc0b0\uc8fc\uc758, gongsanjuui) from their constitution in 2009. They moved portraits of Marx and Lenin sometime around 2011 or 2012 from the public squares. The works of Karl Marx or Friedrich Engels are not accessible to the public, they are forbidden reading because it is &quot;foreign thought&quot; that would pollute the minds of Koreans (which is true, communism is a mental virus). They have even called out the Jewish powers inside the US.<br><br>For me a communist state would be one that would be interested in an international proletarian revolution against the bourgeoisie and international worker&#039;s solidarity. That&#039;s not at all what Chosun promotes as an ideology, Korea is a strong collectivist, organicist, ethno-nationalist, military-first state that borrows a lot from German romantic nationalism and Japanese fascism.<br><br>https:\/\/www.counter-currents.com\/20<wbr>10\/11\/the-last-racialists-b-r-myers<wbr>-the-cleanest-race-how-north-korean<wbr>s-see-themselves-and-why-it-matters<wbr>\/","time":1492245805,"resto":121185300,"id":"HiJq0iN5","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121189750,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)04:47:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121188534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121188534<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;b-but goy they&#039;re not allowed to leave<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i-isn&#039;t it great that you can travel abroad to culturemix, racemix, and culturally enrich yourself?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t-they need to give us lots of shekels to travel too, bomb them goy.

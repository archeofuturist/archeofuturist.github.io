He was a good option in a way, because he&#039;s slightly anti-establishment. But only slightly. We won that battle, but the war has only just begun. Now it&#039;s time to shift gears and make what would have been unfathomable and impossible only a few years ago into reality. Ron Paul has always been our guy but he&#039;s too old now. His son Rand Paul will take up the mantle. We have to take advantage of the fact that both the Republican party (due to Trump) and the Democrat party (due to cheating Bernie of the nomination, and due to obsession with political correctness) are tearing themselves apart. Not each other; themselves. Each party is destroying itself. We have the opportunity now to meme anyone we want into office. It&#039;s time for \/pol\/&#039;s true hero. In 2020, Rand Paul will be elected as the president of the United States.<br><br>For now, good luck, Assad!","filename":"Rand Paul","ext":".jpg","w":240,"h":300,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491549928004,"time":1491549928,"md5":"KKXS0HTj0uvNAfHVYBVgnw==","fsize":15689,"resto":0,"id":"ow0eNTlZ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"rand-paul-2020","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":1,"unique_ips":9},{"no":119906881,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)03:26:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119906762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119906762<\/a><br>except he&#039;s republican and won&#039;t run","time":1491550003,"resto":119906762,"id":"6C3\/a\/r0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119906907,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)03:26:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"He&#039;s not perfect but at least his family sticks to their ideals.","time":1491550012,"resto":119906762,"id":"EYE3xOqQ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119907163,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)03:29:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119906762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119906762<\/a><br>Neither Rand or Ron will ever win a primary, let alone a general.

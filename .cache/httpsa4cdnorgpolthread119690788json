Gun suicide makes up about half of all suicide deaths. the other half are mostly intentional drug overdose. The U.S. with a gun for every man, woman and child, has half the suicide rate of both Japan and South Korea, both of which have an effective ban on civilian gun ownership. That leave about 12,000 annual gun deaths that are not suicide, which works out to .4% By contrast, Drug overdose kills 43,000 a year (1.6%) and poisoning kills 48,000 a year (1.8%) the poisings are almost entirely small children getting into household chemicals. That means junior is four times more likely to die from drinking drain cleaner than from being shot. In fact, of all the things the Centers for Disease Control track, being killed by a gun is at the very bottom. But you want to take my guns away over .4%.

Is a handful of deaths worth being able to live?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we&#039;re not dealing with muskets anymore.<\/span><br><br>There&#039;s a reason the second amendment doesn&#039;t mention any specific weapons. If the police state has assault rifles the citizens can&#039;t protect themselves with muskets. You need whatever weapons the police have. Again, this does not mean you need whatever heavy artillery the military has, because military war machines can&#039;t be used to enforce a police state. But if the cops have bulletproof vests and AR-15s then having a musket is no better than having a butter knife.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you&#039;re a bad hunter if you can&#039;t get the job done with a bolt-action<\/span><br><br>It&#039;s not about hunting at all. The citizens need to be on equal footing with the police so the police cannot be used to impose a new order on everyone. Why do you think North Korean citizens are not allowed to own any firearms? Only their police and military are allowed. They have among the lowest murder rates on the planet. So does that mean we should become like North Korea?","time":1491450052,"resto":119690788,"id":"eM5y+2jx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119699777,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)23:42:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119690788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119690788<\/a><br>We need a little red team planner in this thread","filename":"6hfcCjV","ext":".png","w":1802,"h":905,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":62,"tim":1491450171412,"time":1491450171,"md5":"XUviSc0CxmbM5RGu3F3ZRA==","fsize":207651,"resto":119690788,"id":"y92\/Y2j3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119699819,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)23:43:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119696224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119696224<\/a><br>Can you provide me any evidence, or proof, or photographs, which would show,. prove, or suggest, that even one person was killed or injured at Sandy Hook School?<br><br>And why does a Finn give a shit about an obscure event in US history?

Every year, about 2.5 million people die from all causes. About 33,000 die from gun shot wounds. That&#039;s 1.2% of all fatalities. 22,000 of those gun related deaths are suicide, about .8%. Gun suicide makes up about half of all suicide deaths. the other half are mostly intentional drug overdose. The U.S. with a gun for every man, woman and child, has half the suicide rate of both Japan and South Korea, both of which have an effective ban on civilian gun ownership. That leave about 12,000 annual gun deaths that are not suicide, which works out to .4% By contrast, Drug overdose kills 43,000 a year (1.6%) and poisoning kills 48,000 a year (1.8%) the poisings are almost entirely small children getting into household chemicals. That means junior is four times more likely to die from drinking drain cleaner than from being shot. In fact, of all the things the Centers for Disease Control track, being killed by a gun is at the very bottom. But you want to take my guns away over .4%.

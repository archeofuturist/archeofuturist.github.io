These people tend to &quot;live&quot; in the internet. Internet is their home. Modern liberal tendences, enabled by leftists in the governments all over the world, fucked up the internet quite heavily. It lost a huge portion of freedom of speech, and even games nowadays are made to appeal to feminists and lgbtqwerty people, who whine alot but don&#039;t even play these games, not even mentioning the fact that they&#039;re the minority, and the minority should adapt to cultural codes and way of life of a majority. It&#039;s a digital analogue of a person who comes into your house and yells at you because xe doesn&#039;t like the way your sleeping pajama fits on your body or some shit. And, say, Trump are heavily anti-PC and is pretty straightforward in his speeches.<br>2. These people are the product of the modern times, when the world took a turn to the left. Raised by single mothers, experiencing problems with women who&#039;re excessively mercantile and have no morales at all, and much, much more. All this negative life experience is there only because of how society has changed in the recent 20-50 years. They may not understand it, but one of the reasons is that they don&#039;t want it to happen to people who&#039;re about to be born and\/or raised in the coming times.<br>3. They&#039;re stuck in the internet and don&#039;t pay much attention to the government&#039;s brainwashing machine, so the overtone window for them didn&#039;t move slowly like it did for the general population, instead it jumped for them the moment they actually noticed the insanity going on in the modern world because it messed with their little world and their hobbies. And what&#039;s going on at the moment is really quite scary if you think about it people used to say that normalization of homosexuality is the first step to normalization of pedohpilia. They were called lunatics and conspiracy theoritists, and now first steps to normalizing pedophilia are already here.

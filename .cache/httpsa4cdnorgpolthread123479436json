JP2 certainly never said anything about the miscegenation of europe, and even francis, for all his faults, has never once called for Europe to go full Sweden or Germany. Now, he has called for every parish to take in one, just one, refugee family, but when put in context of the Catholic teaching on refugees, even that isn&#039;t that much. The Catholic Church teaches that refugee status must be &quot;an emergency and therefore temporary solution,&quot; and that those who use it must not stay forever, but only until the threat ends.

What you&#039;re saying hits on the root of two of the greatest heresies in the modern age: the holier than thou Christ and the anything goes Christ.<br>These two heresies are argueably two sides of the same coin, but from a conservative and liberal perspective respectively. The holier than thou Christ is the uncaring, unloving, intolerant and unaccepting Christians we see too often. These are the people who disdain not sin but sinners, who hold themselves up as models of Christ and refuse to even think about interacting with sinners.<br>Gay, bi, trans, promiscuous, perverted, &quot;&quot;genderqueer&quot;&quot; and\/or some other sexual sin? You&#039;re damned, not worth my time. In prison? You&#039;re a horrible person, I&#039;d never help you. Sick? God&#039;s punishing you, I&#039;m not going to help you. Muslim, jewish, atheist, pagan or some other non-Christian belief? HERETIC, only the fires of hell for you! <br>These people have no love, and forget that Christ &quot;came to call sinners.&quot; When they see some like, say those people on the Bill Nye episode about sex, they don&#039;t see people who are lost and in need of Christ to show them the way, the purpose all mankind was created for. No, they see lost souls who only deserve damnation, not aide. <br>These people are the modern Pharisees.<br>On the other hand, we have the anything goes Chist, the liberal form of this heresy. When they see a sinner, they want to help, but they don&#039;t want to be assertive. They&#039;re weak, they&#039;re cucks for lack of a better term. Gay, having sex outside of marriage, trans, addicted to porn, murderer, pedo, rapist? Go to confession and just say you&#039;re sorry, don&#039;t have to even mean it, and certainly don&#039;t have to change.

When you go read what he actually said, it&#039;s far more benign than what&#039;s being reported. Now, sometimes he does say stupid things, because he likes to speak without always thinking it all through first, he himself admits that to be a major fault of his.<br>That said, it&#039;s perfectly fine to disagree with the pope on certian things, like the refugee crisis. Now, if you disagree because you think that we should kill all brown people, well that&#039;s not ok, since that violates Christian teachings.

This is very rough but I think I have an idea. I&#039;d suggest reading into the Scholastic tradition within Catholicism. This is the philosophical tradition that the torch was passed from the Greeks to and the center of Catholicism&#039; academic background and support of Natural Theology. I think this would do you well because:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You are infatuated enough in esoteric thought that an introduction to theistic metaphysics may be fascinating for you (if you haven&#039;t seen it already) as it works through how such judgements are discerned via study of reality<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This would be very important to understanding Catholic thought so to separate that from your wife&#039;s Southern Baptist worries<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This would allow you to give something of the background of HOW to instill a deep dense of moral duty in your child as it breaks down its core attributes.<\/span><br><br>I would suggest the author Edward Feser as an intro into the topic. His primary book is Scholastic Metaphysics: A Contemporary Introduction which teaches the basics and in reaction to modern criticism. The book The Last Superstition may resonate with you as well. That one is a polemic in the style of Dawkins&#039; The God Delusion but anti-atheist. It&#039;s not as informative as the first book I said but it&#039;s an easier read and targets the popular atheist figures of the day and the mainstream atheist worldview.

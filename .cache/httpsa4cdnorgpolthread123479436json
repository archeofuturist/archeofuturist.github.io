JP2 certainly never said anything about the miscegenation of europe, and even francis, for all his faults, has never once called for Europe to go full Sweden or Germany. Now, he has called for every parish to take in one, just one, refugee family, but when put in context of the Catholic teaching on refugees, even that isn&#039;t that much. The Catholic Church teaches that refugee status must be &quot;an emergency and therefore temporary solution,&quot; and that those who use it must not stay forever, but only until the threat ends. A compromise between the &quot;let nobody in, let them die&quot; view point and the &quot;refugees welcome, fuck culture europe is brown now&quot; view point.","time":1493563684,"resto":123479436,"id":"fW+YO7US","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123484597,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)10:49:36","name":"WOLFSHIEM","com":"<a href=\"#p123479436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123479436<\/a><br>Thank you, OP.<br>Just got back from mass and was about to start a general, myself.<br>I&#039;ll alert relevant threads and be posting art.<br><br><br>How was mass, everyone?","filename":"1431424832021","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493563776415,"time":1493563776,"md5":"3eiLtI4fbuaZOd5JVwpgrQ==","fsize":55062,"resto":123479436,"id":"GP4sJ1oF","country":"US","trip":"!!tuOwy1ct2dy","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123484743,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)10:51:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123484445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123484445<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A compromise between the &quot;let nobody in, let them die&quot; view point and the &quot;refugees welcome, fuck culture europe is brown now&quot; view point.<\/span><br>A compromise indeed, a compromise to balance the anti-refugee and pro-refugee sentiments in europe so that they can still execute the Kalergi plan while outwardly being perceived as &quot;balanced&quot;.","time":1493563875,"resto":123479436,"id":"Kbi+cAmz","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":123485172,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)10:56:02","name":"WOLFSHIEM","com":"<a href=\"#p123479756\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123479756<\/a><br>Pretty happy about today so far.

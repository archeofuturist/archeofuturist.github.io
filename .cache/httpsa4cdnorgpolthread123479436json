JP2 certainly never said anything about the miscegenation of europe, and even francis, for all his faults, has never once called for Europe to go full Sweden or Germany. Now, he has called for every parish to take in one, just one, refugee family, but when put in context of the Catholic teaching on refugees, even that isn&#039;t that much. The Catholic Church teaches that refugee status must be &quot;an emergency and therefore temporary solution,&quot; and that those who use it must not stay forever, but only until the threat ends.

What you&#039;re saying hits on the root of two of the greatest heresies in the modern age: the holier than thou Christ and the anything goes Christ.<br>These two heresies are argueably two sides of the same coin, but from a conservative and liberal perspective respectively. The holier than thou Christ is the uncaring, unloving, intolerant and unaccepting Christians we see too often. These are the people who disdain not sin but sinners, who hold themselves up as models of Christ and refuse to even think about interacting with sinners.<br>Gay, bi, trans, promiscuous, perverted, &quot;&quot;genderqueer&quot;&quot; and\/or some other sexual sin? You&#039;re damned, not worth my time. In prison? You&#039;re a horrible person, I&#039;d never help you. Sick? God&#039;s punishing you, I&#039;m not going to help you. Muslim, jewish, atheist, pagan or some other non-Christian belief? HERETIC, only the fires of hell for you! <br>These people have no love, and forget that Christ &quot;came to call sinners.&quot; When they see some like, say those people on the Bill Nye episode about sex, they don&#039;t see people who are lost and in need of Christ to show them the way, the purpose all mankind was created for. No, they see lost souls who only deserve damnation, not aide. <br>These people are the modern Pharisees.<br>On the other hand, we have the anything goes Chist, the liberal form of this heresy. When they see a sinner, they want to help, but they don&#039;t want to be assertive. They&#039;re weak, they&#039;re cucks for lack of a better term. Gay, having sex outside of marriage, trans, addicted to porn, murderer, pedo, rapist? Go to confession and just say you&#039;re sorry, don&#039;t have to even mean it, and certainly don&#039;t have to change.

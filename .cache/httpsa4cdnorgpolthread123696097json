If you have a logical turn of mind, you are bound to ask whether this is a special case of a general ethical principle which says \u201cLife is good, death is bad; health is good, sickness is bad.\u201d If so \u2013 and here we enter into controversial territory \u2013 we can follow this general principle to a surprising new conclusion: If a 95-year-old is threatened by death from old age, it would be good to drag them from those train tracks, if possible. And if a 120-year-old is starting to feel slightly sickly, it would be good to restore them to full vigor, if possible. With current technology it is not possible. But if the technology became available in some future year \u2013 given sufficiently advanced medical nanotechnology, or such other contrivances as future minds may devise \u2013 would you judge it a good thing, to save that life, and stay that debility?<br><br>The important thing to remember, which I think all too many people forget, is that it is not a trick question.<br><br>Transhumanism is simple because it has no special cases. If you believe professional bioethicists (people who get paid to explain ethical judgments) then the rule \u201cLife is good, death is bad; health is good, sickness is bad\u201d holds only until some critical age, and then flips polarity. Why should it flip? Why not just keep on with life-is-good? It would seem that it is good to save a six-year-old girl, but bad to extend the life and health of a 150-year-old. Then at what exact age does the term in the utility function go from positive to negative? Why?<br><br>As far as a transhumanist is concerned, if you see someone in danger of dying, you should save them; if you can improve someone\u2019s health, you should. There, you\u2019re done. No special cases. You don\u2019t have to ask anyone\u2019s age.<br><br>http:\/\/yudkowsky.net\/singularity\/si<wbr>mplified\/","filename":"Eliezer_Yudkowsky","ext":".jpg","w":280,"h":280,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493687271216,"time":1493687271,"md5":"XZWE8OgDNkSmqdok9Wd4nw==","fsize":18136,"resto":123696097,"id":"nwq4jX0S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123702833,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)21:08:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123696097\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123696097<\/a><br>Only the weak would do this.

Unfuckingbelievable. Even for Sweden this is a new low. 150 people who have been to Syria and Iraq and murdered innocent people and they are allowed to walk freely and live off of Swedish taxpayer money. The sitting government doesn&#039;t seem to give a shit either. They&#039;re not even upset, they&#039;re not trying to change the law or anything. They&#039;re completely calm and say that they are going to give them group therapy or something.<br><br>The responsibility to &quot;rehabilitate&quot; these terrorists has fallen on the municipalities. The only problem: they don&#039;t even know who they are. Only S\u00c4PO has that information, and they aren&#039;t willing to share it with the municipalities. The municipalities are just expected to sit there and wait for the terrorists to come in voluntarily and tell them they need to clear their conscience after slitting the throats of innocent men, women and children in Syria...<br><br>I guess the only relief in this situation is that it&#039;s a fucking windfall for the Sweden Democrats, not even the libs in Sweden are happy about terrorists being allowed to roam freely.","time":1490052240,"resto":117548114,"id":"hFXqZIcr","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]}

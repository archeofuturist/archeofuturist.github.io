But they were lazy racists refusing to co-exists with others so they were chased from their lands. Their first arrival was in Bohemia where the local rulers also refused to welcome them. They ran around Europe for a while. During that times most of the european nations were chasing and killing them. Twice in the HRE, once in Switerland, atleast once in France, once in sweden and so on. No one wanted them, because they are the lowest of the lowest. Then they arrived in the Ottoman Empire and the problem got solved, because their new turkish hosts were not much different from them in terms of laziness.<br>For real, the ottoman empire is the only country in the world that let gypsies stay for a longer duration without problems. Gypsies are a culture aswell, just like slavs, they are not exactly and ethnicity. They are divided into clans and each of this clans can exist only amongst their own clan members. What I&#039;m saying is that different gypsy clans also refuse to live around each other. You can speak of them as tribes. In northern Bulgaria there is a village that in the 60-70s was populated by 3-4 gypsy kins that fled from Greece. These gypsies chased away EVERY bulgarian, turk, other gypsy or whatever was in the village already. From these 50-60 people, the village is currently 1000.

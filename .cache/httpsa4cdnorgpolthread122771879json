The Korean People&#039;s Army is capable of conducting a shock and awe campaign that will make the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan look like children&#039;s games.<br><br>Socialist Korea has not only the military might, but more importantly the political will to wage total war against all imperialist forces and South Korean traitors until the final victory.<br><br>Maybe somebody should tell the fat orange fuck in the White House<br><br>That North Korea has 1.2 million active duty soldiers in its military, and 10 million in reserves.<br><br>that Seoul is 35 miles from the North Korean border and North Korea can decimate Seoul with rockets and artillery, that they have nuclear weapons ready to be unleashed.<br><br>That there people will handle war far better than the South Koreans, they have no electricity to lose.<br><br>that millions of people could die if we start shooting cruise missiles at North Korea and all hell breaks loose.<br><br>Or maybe that doesn&#039;t matter to the great and glorious Trump?","filename":"americunts btfo","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493147379532,"time":1493147379,"md5":"HPWW4peKAvWIBuV64n5hfw==","fsize":203727,"resto":0,"id":"H6jnQiwS","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"north-korea-will-win","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":4,"unique_ips":13},{"no":122772039,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:11:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122771879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122771879<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this is what a patriotic right winger looks like<\/span>","time":1493147460,"resto":122771879,"id":"XC64b2aR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122772170,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:11:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;has total operational superiority<\/span><br>You&#039;re talking about US, right?<br>Although I think everyone would like to see US military stumble in NK.","time":1493147518,"resto":122771879,"id":"uo4u1ZR\/","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":122772189,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:12:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"soon the entire world will be best korea","time":1493147528,"resto":122771879,"id":"+GmVstrm","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122772287,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:12:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122771879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122771879<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw you nuke Seoul and all of Best Korea gets nuked in return<\/span>","filename":"1488167357043","ext":".jpg","w":354,"h":313,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1493147569247,"time":1493147569,"md5":"FXevavKkDmi71nwst+bpTw==","fsize":28832,"resto":122771879,"id":"6gxazN+e","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122772552,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:14:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122771879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122771879<\/a><br>No, if anyone goes into the north they might face Vietnam like resistance <br><br>If anyone goes into the south they&#039;ll face the same shit.

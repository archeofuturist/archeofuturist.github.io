There&#039;s a lot of threads these days about how we can &quot;save&quot; white women and so forth, but we need to admit that if someone is essentially that weak that they can be influenced with antifa and communism then there&#039;s no real saving them. The best we can do is to teach our children to be rational and instill in them a sort of &#039;common sense&#039; or wordlyness that can get them through to adulthood. Honestly, it&#039;s not as much a political problem as it is a cultural problem.","filename":"1492533604438m","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":799,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":97,"tim":1492801740972,"time":1492801740,"md5":"c3MB+Mxe\/sCrI5z9eyCFcA==","fsize":80100,"resto":122167127,"id":"bHIuQi1u","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":122172105,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)15:14:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122169394\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122169394<\/a><br>Where are these unlimited scholarships you speak of?

Carve out their own private corner of the world and everyone becomes cucked indentured servants of whatever that corporation wants. They don\u2019t want competition. They don\u2019t want consumer empowerment. They don\u2019t want choice. They don\u2019t want any regulations that impede their operations or empower that of a competitor. They want absolute, uncontested power, and the freedom to extract as much wealth as possible with as little effort as possible. And they\u2019re chomping at the bit to take this societal cancer into space to keep the cycle going.","filename":"1487875151972","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":427,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490506121053,"time":1490506121,"md5":"N8G5G26PzAzxsPccZxHpXw==","fsize":32909,"resto":0,"id":"hJKkQVIM","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-big-corporate-nation-states-are-aggressively","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

I haven&#039;t implemented it yet, but the idea is to get a news feed similiar to a RSS feed for NP updates, etc. This will be difficult, and also getting a scroll on the main page will be difficult. The little circle icon in the top right will open a calendar which is shown in the third image. I have altered the background image to reflect the splash screen without the NP text. <br><br>I have implemented a push service in the background that runs off GCM\/AWS SNS.

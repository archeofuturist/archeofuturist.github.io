All of our taxes and used the pay the interest on the national debt. It&#039;s a common mistake but you need to look more into the issue anon. Absolutely zero of the taxes paid to the United States of America go towards anything remotely close to running or maintaining the government. It&#039;s impossible. If you can&#039;t pay the interest then how can you pay anything else??? Simple math.

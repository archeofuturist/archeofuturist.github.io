Shall the state involve themselves in the &#039;nuclear family&#039; and how many children they should be able to have?<br><br> (a backstory to this question)<br>2. Europe is set to be transformed-into a &quot;retirement home&quot; this is because of an increasing number of older people, who isn&#039;t economically active. To counter this development should the European countries open their borders and allow young people to immigrate from states outside Europe? From what areas can you assume that those who move to Europe comes from? What difficulties do the immigrants face as they to move to Europe?<br><br>3. Examine how HIV\/AIDS is spreading in the world. Where it spreads rapidly and where the increase has come to a halt? Why is sub-Saharan Africa hard hit by HIV \/ Aids? How does society of many cases of HIV\/Aids? Is there a risk of the epidemic takes off in Sweden? <br><br>I would love to discuss these questions with this community, while both learning your view, and helping spread different perspective to my fellow classmates.","filename":"icon_population-02","ext":".png","w":301,"h":301,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490603655521,"time":1490603655,"md5":"oQTgXcoLz3jBBIFMSYRxeQ==","fsize":25722,"resto":0,"id":"FCiyLys+","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hello","country_name":"Sweden","replies":10,"images":4,"unique_ips":8},{"no":118490804,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)04:36:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118490651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118490651<\/a><br>Faggot","time":1490603791,"resto":118490651,"id":"2FEdu0Z1","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":118490972,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)04:39:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Race realism and evolutionary psychology are 2 of the most important redpills to take.

The higher the % black population in the US, the higher the rate of AIDS. There are two reasons for this.<br><br>The first is pic related - black people are more sexually active because, having evolved in a land of abundance without winters, they developed a &quot;quantity over quality&quot; approach to offspring.<br><br>The second is that, also due to these evolutionary reasons, black people did not have to plan ahead, cooperate or reason. There is tonnes of research showing that IQ and conscientiousness (in which black people are lower) predict health behaviours because of disease education and prevention, going to the doctor, etc. Basically, because they&#039;re less intelligent and less likely to plan ahead, a black person will be less likely, for example, to plan ahead.<br><br>Are you really going to present this to your class?<br><br>And, yes, the more black &quot;&quot;&quot;refugees&quot;&quot;&quot; pour into Sweden, the higher the AIDS rate will become.

I don\u2019t understand the question. Sweden needs to raise its birth rates in order to sustain its population. It will be beneficial for the Swedish society to bring up more children in order to sustain the welfare state in the future. People should not only be allowed to have as many children they would like (it is their human right), resourceful families should be encouraged to bring up more children than today.<br><br>2.1. Ideally yes, but in statistics show that non-western immigration pose an even larger cost on society than old people.<br><br>2.2 The migrant will be people that have less prosperous lives where they are, and live in an area with less social security than Sweden. They migrate to Sweden to get a better life. (People that are well off where they are will not give up their life and move to a different country to start all over).<br><br>2.3 The main problem with this type of migration is that it attracts the least resourceful people. Some manage to be productive citizens given the opportunities that Sweden can provide, but overall they impose a net cost to the Swedish society, this invalidates the argument that Sweden allow migration for economic reasons (however there can be other reasons to allow migration than economic reasons, e.g moral responsibility, European integration etc.).<br><br>3. HIV\/AIDS is present in poor countries with lack of infrastructure, medical services, clean drinking water etc. There is no risk of an epidemic in Sweden.","time":1490606433,"resto":118490651,"id":"Dvcn3Qt9","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":118493941,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)05:24:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118493678\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118493678<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118492955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118492955<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118493025\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118493025<\/a><br><br>noted","time":1490606697,"resto":118490651,"id":"FCiyLys+","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118494032,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)05:26:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118493678\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118493678<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It will be beneficial for the Swedish society to bring up more children in order to sustain the welfare state in the future.<\/span><br><br>No, this would ruin the planet.

They were supported by 86 land guns and 35,000 Spanish and French troops (7,000\u20138,000 French) on land intending to assault the fortifications once they had been demolished. An &quot;army&quot; of more than 80,000 spectators thronged the adjacent hills over the Spanish border, among them the highest families in the land, assembled to see the fortress beaten to powder and &quot;the British flag trailed in the dust&quot;. The 138 guns opened fire from floating batteries in the Bay and the 86 guns on the land side, directed on the fortifications after weeks of preparatory artillery fire. But the garrison replied with red-hot shot to set fire to and sink the attacker&#039;s floating batteries and warships in the Bay. In that great conflict, the British destroyed three of the floating batteries, which blew up as the &quot;red-hot shot&quot; did its job. The other seven batteries were scuttled by the Spanish because they were too heavily damaged to continue the fight. In addition 719 men on board the ships (many of whom drowned) were casualties.<\/span>","filename":"Vue_du_siege_de_Gibraltar_et_explosion_des_batteries_flottantes_1782","ext":".jpg","w":4148,"h":2323,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491216613234,"time":1491216613,"md5":"fCrTXTYtlJgPTXD1D5DCRg==","fsize":1792801,"resto":119305932,"id":"WCOrg3Sp","country":"KR","m_img":1,"country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":119315532,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)06:50:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119315321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119315321<\/a><br>Hispanics and Anglos are natural enemies.","time":1491216651,"resto":119305932,"id":"Gr7bO4I4","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":119315540,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)06:51:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119315275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119315275<\/a><br><br>We already did during the War of Succession.

For example, it seems unlikely that respirators will be made available to the general public until after we have suffered a major attack using gas or an aerosolized pathogen. It would therefore be wise for individuals to take precautionary measures and to advise others to do the same. The following is a list of measures to be taken and key items that individuals might procure to protect themselves and family members.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1. Because most serious pestilences can be aerosolized, we must have protection against unfiltered air during a bioterrorist attack. Direct contact with outside air should be avoided in the first 1-2 days after an attack. Second, and of the utmost importance, at least one respirator should always be on hand. This means either carrying it around if you have only one or keeping one at home and the other at your workplace. A half mask covers the nose and mouth; a full mask protects the eyes as well. The mask should have replaceable filters that do not permit the passage of bacteria such as anthrax. Several filter replacements should be on hand for each mask. Consult the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) at...http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/niosh for information on proper masks and filters.<\/span>","time":1492659310,"resto":121940263,"id":"gn5vU2j+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121946011,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)23:35:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121946000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121946000<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. A portable radio will help you stay informed. Maintain a supply of extra batteries.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3. A flashlight is important, in case of a power outage. Again, keep extra batteries on hand.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4. In an emergency, elevators or other forms of transportation that rely on electricity should not be used.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5. For nourishment, water is the most important commodity. Enough should be kept on hand to satisfy your needs for at least 2 weeks, as well as food stores, especially canned food that can be eaten without cooking.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;6. You should have a good idea where your family members are at all times. Also, have a plan in the event of a situation in which you cannot communicate with one another.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;7. In an attack, roads will probably be jammed, so don&#039;t attempt to go anywhere by car, especially if you live in a city. Since it may be impractical to stay where you are, have a plan for getting to a safe location promptly and efficiently.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;8.

Anon is kind of full of shit, first of all small pox was eradicated we don&#039;t even vaccinate against it. Samples are highly controlled. Also bill gates is probably wrong, if there was a smallpox outbreak, the death toll would probably be over 100 million within 3 years. This is assuming ineffective control. Where anon and Bill Gates is correct is that this is becoming increasingly easy along with the fact that bioweapons unlike chemical weapons can be their own force multiplier. Chem weapons work once, pretty much, bioweapons are like memes, they jump host to host and thus the best bioweapons are ones where you don&#039;t need expensive and impractical dispersion methods (like Japanese subway sarin gas attack, those are kind of the best one can do with airborne toxins.) Pathogens can do lots of the heavy lifting, but of course some might be immune, harder to control, etc.","time":1492671945,"resto":121940263,"id":"zu9qimT+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121966605,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)03:07:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121941177\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121941177<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121943629\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121943629<\/a><br>Every microbiologist I know does this.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dude just give a Petri dish, a dropper, and 2 weeks I gotchu senpai just watch<\/span>","time":1492672058,"resto":121940263,"id":"oEhQky92","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121967227,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)03:15:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121953676\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121953676<\/a><br><br>This right here.

Small boats are typically found on inland waterways (e.g., rivers and lakes) or in protected coastal areas. However, boats such as the whaleboat were designed for operation from a ship in an offshore environment. In naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard another vessel (a ship). Another less restrictive definition is a vessel that can be lifted out of the water. Some definitions do not make a distinction in size, as bulk freighters 1,000 feet (300 m) long on the Great Lakes are called oreboats. For reasons of naval tradition, submarines are usually referred to as &#039;boats&#039; rather than &#039;ships&#039;, regardless of their size and shape. Ships are generally distinguished from boats based on their larger size, shape and cargo or passenger capacity.<br>A ship is a large watercraft that travels the world&#039;s oceans and other sufficiently deep waterways, carrying passengers or goods, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research and fishing. Historically, a &quot;ship&quot; was a sailing vessel with at least three square-rigged masts and a full bowsprit. Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape and load capacity.<br><br>Ships have been important contributors to human migration and commerce. They have supported the spread of colonization and the slave trade, but have also served scientific, cultural, and humanitarian needs. After the 16th century, new crops that had come from and to the Americas via the European seafarers significantly contributed to the world population growth.[1] Ship transport is responsible for the largest portion of world commerce.<br><br>Ships are bigger boats, give up faggot","time":1491818451,"resto":120419621,"id":"vLCCZLoW","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":120420819,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)06:03:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120420618\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120420618<\/a><br>You are not white","time":1491818613,"resto":120419621,"id":"BIHPgBGL","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120421019,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)06:06:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120420819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120420819<\/a><br>you are not british","time":1491818769,"resto":120419621,"id":"vLCCZLoW","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":120421133,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)06:07:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120421019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120421019<\/a><br>you don&#039;t say","time":1491818849,"resto":120419621,"id":"GijeVEKl","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120421166,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)06:08:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120421019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120421019<\/a><br>But the Falklands are","time":1491818880,"resto":120419621,"id":"BIHPgBGL","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120421227,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)06:08:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120419621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120419621<\/a><br><br>The guy&#039;s a fucking tool.

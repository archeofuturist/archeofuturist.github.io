You aren&#039;t clever. Since the beginning of \/tg\/, we have seen -quite literally- THOUSANDS of leftist shills (just like you) enter these threads armed with clickbait narratives and an air of smug superiority, certain that they could outsmart us. Every last one of them was shit out the other end of \/tg\/ having made no impact whatsoever.<br><br>You WILL fail, just like the rest. This is not a prediction; it&#039;s a statement of fact. You won&#039;t change any minds. No one will remember you. These threads are still going strong, which speaks volumes about the ineffectuality of past shills.<br><br>You can&#039;t argue against this, all that you can do is sarcastically dismiss it. Whether or not you choose to admit it, we both know that I&#039;m right. No matter what you say or do, you&#039;ll be getting fucked for the next 8 years while we laugh at you.

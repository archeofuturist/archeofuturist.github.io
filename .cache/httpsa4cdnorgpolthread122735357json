By gross national assets, Japan reports a figure of 7954 trillion yen ($103 trillion), but claims liabilities of 5242 trillion ($68 trillion) for a net 2712 trillion in 2009.[3] However, these numbers are suspiciously large compared with GDP, only liabilities that could be worth that amount given Japan&#039;s ultra low reliance on foreign debt (in government and private sectors) is future promises of healthcare and pension for its aging citizens. Therefore, Japan compiles extra figures (which other nations do not compile) and makes their figures less meaningful to compare with other nations.<\/span><br><br>Are you trying to ruse us Shinji?","time":1493129351,"resto":122735357,"id":"t1AJkyvH","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122737354,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:10:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122735357\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122735357<\/a><br><br>What would charts look like if they included debt?","time":1493129411,"resto":122735357,"id":"oBfGowgp","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122737524,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:11:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122737172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122737172<\/a><br><br>But they have a fucking sweet army.","time":1493129515,"resto":122735357,"id":"oBfGowgp","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122737615,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:12:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122737172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122737172<\/a>","filename":"abhorrentpost","ext":".jpg","w":224,"h":225,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493129574442,"time":1493129574,"md5":"SBvu8ak0eEM4ShRLB0tE+g==","fsize":8557,"resto":122735357,"id":"c5Lr\/LRM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122737830,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:15:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122737615\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122737615<\/a>","filename":"usaball","ext":".jpg","w":218,"h":231,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493129707622,"time":1493129707,"md5":"IabPNLao3dfV4lOflH6LpQ==","fsize":27440,"resto":122735357,"id":"mZgHaeag","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

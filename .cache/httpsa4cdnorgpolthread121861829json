Being a strict constitutionalist is good. Being in favour of small government is good. Being against the fed and department of education is good. Being against foreign wars without a tangible threat or declaration of war is good. <br><br>But when it comes to applying these beliefs to the current US political system, it becomes impractical. Ending the fed and eliminating the department of education would send the government into temporary chaos and would be detrimental to all the people who happen to be attending school or investing in the market during that period. Would the ultimate payoff be better in the longrun? I believe so, but I can&#039;t disregard the heavy costs it would take to put in place. <br><br>So apply this to the alt-right: yes, the ultimate benefits of a majority-white society are better than an majority-black or hispanic society (the stats back this up), but does the systemic discrimination that would be needed to execute this plan not have a detrimental effect on society itself while we make this a reality?","time":1492620572,"resto":121861829,"id":"lBJlcvXW","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121864484,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:49:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121862077\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121862077<\/a><br>I only hate because i witnessed\/lived the black culture growing up. <br><br>If i lived in the white suburbs and had only known rich black kids i might have turned out different. <br><br>But i know how blacks are, ive lived it, ive been there.

I&#039;m saying if your beliefs are hinged on being logically consistent without any consideration for what is actually practical and good for society and for the individuals performing the action, your beliefs will become irrational. <br><br>For example, I was a die-hard Ron Paul supporter since 2007 but have tempered my views on him a bit because his beliefs are not congruent with the current political system. Being a strict constitutionalist is good. Being in favour of small government is good. Being against the fed and department of education is good. Being against foreign wars without a tangible threat or declaration of war is good. <br><br>But when it comes to applying these beliefs to the current US political system, it becomes impractical. Ending the fed and eliminating the department of education would send the government into temporary chaos and would be detrimental to all the people who happen to be attending school or investing in the market during that period. Would the ultimate payoff be better in the longrun? I believe so, but I can&#039;t disregard the heavy costs it would take to put in place. <br><br>So apply this to the alt-right: yes, the ultimate benefits of a majority-white society are better than an majority-black or hispanic society (the stats back this up), but does the systemic discrimination that would be needed to execute this plan not have a detrimental effect on society itself while we make this a reality?","time":1492620572,"resto":121861829,"id":"lBJlcvXW","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121864484,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:49:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121862077\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121862077<\/a><br>I only hate because i witnessed\/lived the black culture growing up. <br><br>If i lived in the white suburbs and had only known rich black kids i might have turned out different. <br><br>But i know how blacks are, ive lived it, ive been there.

So if you develop ideas that create the free society where everyone participates voluntarily and uses the system to their benefit, without tax-payer funded handouts (in exchange for nothing, I should add), without corporate influence on elected officials, without corruption in the marketplace, and without any laws mentioning race, colour, or creed, you will find that people are very willing to work together to improve their own lives because what is beneficial to you and I in the long run is usually also beneficial to the hispanics and the blacks and the slavs. <br><br>Capitalists often make the argument that the free market doesn&#039;t care what colour you are, they only care than your currency is valuable.

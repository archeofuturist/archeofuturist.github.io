I have one cat, and it stays at my parents&#039; home. This shit is just out of control - cat off everywhere, cat liter everywhere, cat shitting in the bathroom sometimes, fur everywhere, jumping everywhere. And don&#039;t tell me &#039;Man up and have kids,&#039; because we&#039;re in our early 20s and I&#039;ve already told her I want kids within the next few years.

Another ape then explains that a human can\u2019t say that to an ape.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In all our years of slavery to mankind, the word &quot;No&quot; was the one word we were electrically conditioned to fear.

Then later when the ape was working and for some reason chimped out, the boss could yell \u201cNo, *ape\u2019s name, no\u201d and the ape would freeze on the spot due to psychological trauma.<br>There are also other important things in the movie like, the only teacher is a human, humans are now villainized, apes now oppress humans,\u2026<br>It\u2019s also highly speculated that the book (and the very first movie) was critique on the civil rights movement.","filename":"POTA","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":600,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491223943303,"time":1491223943,"md5":"tUvhOyh0567ODLFQose3ig==","fsize":103695,"resto":0,"id":"CeuPyOKz","country":"BE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"planet-of-the-apes-red-pilled","country_name":"Belgium","replies":14,"images":2,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119324725,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:52:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"The movies went a little like this:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Man arrives in the future.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Earth is taken over by apes.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Everything went back to medieval times (apes ride horses, no electricity, no industry,\u2026).<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Apes are thought humans were violent\/stupid creatures because they waged war on each other.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Apes eventually go to war themselves.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They can\u2019t produce guns anymore.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They keep the guns that were left over locked in an armory, which is very sacred.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They use the guns from the armory<\/span>","time":1491223968,"resto":119324694,"id":"CeuPyOKz","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":119324999,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:55:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s pretty funny because the blacks were compared to apes, in order to criticize them and the apes were then shown as villains.<br><br>Now, they are making a PC remake, but they still use apes of course.

I only had to bump so much because the thread was slid so much and I wanted other anons input. So how is my anonymous history not my product? I&#039;m well aware this has been going on since Google tracked previous searches and YouTube started monetizing channels but both of these services are free from their providers. Internet service providers making money off me when I am already paying for it seems like they want to have their cake and eat it too.","time":1490903193,"resto":118942458,"id":"woRnI53V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118958895,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)15:47:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118953301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118953301<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Data caps because electrons moving at light-speed get &quot;clogged&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;because routers&#039; and firewalls&#039; memory i\/o and cpu clock speed are not bottlenecks<\/span>","time":1490903228,"resto":118942458,"id":"GWBPqIu2","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118959210,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)15:49:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118953437\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118953437<\/a><br>Person of black persuasion identified.<br><br>I&#039;m pretty sure the ISPs sell the history in anonymized, bulk form.","time":1490903396,"resto":118942458,"id":"GWBPqIu2","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118959559,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)15:52:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118958830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118958830<\/a><br>OP can&#039;t bump inside intervals of 10 minutes <br>it&#039;s not your product because you sign it away<br>your touchy feely &quot;person idea&quot; on how it should be handled is like a bowl of shit to anyone walking by, and you&#039;re so proud to show it to them","time":1490903575,"resto":118942458,"id":"fIK4wbxV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118959940,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)15:56:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118959210\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118959210<\/a><br>That was an analogy tailored for you who could not come up with their own.

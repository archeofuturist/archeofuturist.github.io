As fetuses develop, all are outfitted with the anatomical precursors to nipples, although they only offer a direct reproductive advantage to women for feeding their babies. But since that&#039;s such a favorable trait, evolution didn&#039;t go to the painstaking trouble of weeding nipples out of the male population. In other words, men have nipples because women do. Likewise, clitoral and penile tissues are borne of the same embryological stuff, developing into one or the other once biological sex traits set in. The hooded glans, packed with 8,000 nerve endings, is just the visible tip of the internal clitoral structure that extends up and around the vagina and engorges during arousal much like the penis [source: Gonzalez]. Therefore, female orgasms could exist because that clitoral anatomy was under no evolutionary pressure to disappear.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/health.howstuffworks.com\/se<wbr>xual-health\/sexuality\/orgasm4.htm<\/span><br><br>Thoughts?","filename":"Female-Oshot-Pleasure-Orgasm-570x400","ext":".jpg","w":570,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":175,"tim":1490588222045,"time":1490588222,"md5":"BonBjzzes4fjJS5SapcDbw==","fsize":33495,"resto":0,"id":"NxYLY4mH","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"female-orgasm-nothing-more-than-a-byproduct-or","country_name":"United States","replies":24,"images":1,"unique_ips":15},{"no":118470090,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:19:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"If you let all those sexual urges pile up, you will spontaneously piss yourself.

In order for males to be without nipples, there would be a cumbersome difference between men and women, so its simply left as a byproduct on males. Humans might not have developed to the current state if there were some drastic difference between men and women. <br><br>Same with orgasms. The species needs them, or rather it works very effectively, so the species is not going to make a sacrifice to both genders to eliminate something pretty trivial in females.<br><br>As to why men have nipples, it probably has something to do with fetus development. What worked still works. Male nipples never got in the way, male and female both have them while in fetus development, by the time it makes sense to drop nipples the fetal development has already gone too far for easy removal, successful peoples birthed and the chain was never broken.

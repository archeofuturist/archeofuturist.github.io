How do you people stand it? Do you just get use to it? Or just ignore all the shit going on around you? If it were me I&#039;d just try not to get involved and leave everyone alone, I just feel like California, and Berkeley in particular have more riots\/protests in a week than most places do in a year. And I&#039;m sure there is a high percentage of FAGGOTS and FEMINISTS as well, also is every straight white female a feminist as well? Feel like you&#039;d be better off becoming a faggot then trying to find a girl that isn&#039;t a feminist nutjob vegan transracial new-age medicine practicing weirdo. <br><br>I might just be blowing it out of proportions, obviously I don&#039;t live there but it seems like it&#039;d be a horrible place to live\/attend college. Also isn&#039;t California the most democratic state in the country?","filename":"1383892353848","ext":".gif","w":460,"h":345,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492320330085,"time":1492320330,"md5":"csEEKVPJqRskD\/Jg8WfPmw==","fsize":503979,"resto":0,"id":"NdOkSf0D","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"id-hate-to-attend-college-at-berkeley-frankly-id","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

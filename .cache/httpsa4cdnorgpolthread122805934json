(Frankly, the same could be said of Japanese.) Phonology can be a little bit difficult but it&#039;s not a long-term problem so it&#039;s more of a teething problem. The writing system is a pain in the ass for multiple reasons assuming you don&#039;t know another language that uses the script. I think the difficulties of Arabic and Japanese are exaggerated because of their respective writing systems. The beginner ends up having to juggle not only the new grammar and vocabulary (and phonology) but also the writing system. <br><br>If you&#039;re interested in conversational Arabic, you would be best off learning a dialect first and leaning as much as you can based on speaking and listening and using romanization for your notes and vocabulary lists..You can put more effort into the script once you start learning the written language at which point you already have a place in your brain for Arabic which will make learning the script much easier because you don&#039;t have to put as much effort on all the other aspects simultaneously. So you&#039;d probably want to hire a good tutor (locally or via Skype) to teach you the conversational language and then just start talking a lot once you&#039;ve solidified a basic level.","time":1493168719,"resto":122805934,"id":"YhbqU7kA","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122818492,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:05:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122817322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122817322<\/a><br>Same mate.

Not many Euro-language speaking people here unless they learn through school.","time":1493169661,"resto":122805934,"id":"DGwJiL\/k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122820492,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:21:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"I Speak 3.<br>Will learn more.<br>You get smarter and get a better understanding of the world in general when you learn languages, at least if you&#039;re a bit introspective and analytical.<br>You can notice your thinking changing when switching between different languages.","time":1493169690,"resto":122805934,"id":"o8sQhnMe","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122820614,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:22:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122814830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122814830<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A woman<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/pol\/<\/span><br><br>You guys know there are more shitskins on \/pol\/ than there are women on here right.","filename":"C7R7u60XwAAXMni","ext":".jpg","w":792,"h":1188,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493169744845,"time":1493169744,"md5":"AyaFAg\/VKDIktdSoDW2vEA==","fsize":124936,"resto":122805934,"id":"soPS3t8h","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122820706,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:23:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122818768\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122818768<\/a><br>Three isnt even hard.<br>For me the hardest th is the one in with.","time":1493169782,"resto":122805934,"id":"TzeWXHuD","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122820840,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:24:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"If I could improve my English by even 5% I&#039;d rather that then learn some kind of irrelevant Eurobabble language","time":1493169848,"resto":122805934,"id":"E\/6jUzZy","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122820878,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:24:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"I speak Lisp","time":1493169865,"resto":122805934,"id":"rJjpHQKC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122820883,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:24:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122820706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122820706<\/a><br>With th is harder<br><br>The th in Smi&quot;&quot;th&quot;&quot; or Smi&quot;&quot;th&quot;&quot;ers?<br><br>They are two difference sounds.","filename":"totem_poles__stanley_park__vancouver__british_columbia","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493169869290,"time":1493169869,"md5":"QHysNK8MeUm9jj3lAuTgwA==","fsize":1218590,"resto":122805934,"id":"soPS3t8h","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122820950,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:25:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122820883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122820883<\/a><br>Fuck I can&#039;t speel","time":1493169902,"resto":122805934,"id":"soPS3t8h","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122820959,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:25:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122808391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122808391<\/a><br>Hans, Ich bin nicht so dumm, dass ich kann nicht babydeutsch verstanden. <br><br>Nutzen Sie genetiv oder dativ, dann du hast klar nicht zu mir.","time":1493169904,"resto":122805934,"id":"ON3lt2JV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122821014,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:25:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122820262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122820262<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;zna bosanski<\/span><br><br>Doslovno kako?<br>Za\u0161to si u\u010dio bosanski?","time":1493169928,"resto":122805934,"id":"Yevn7UtK","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122821062,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:25:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"lads what&#039;s the easiest way to learn a language?

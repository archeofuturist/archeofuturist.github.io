That&#039;s a fancy way to say they&#039;re opposite ideologies designed to clash, like Yin and Yang.<br><br>NatSoc was fundamentally an ideology built around race, while Marxist socialism was entirely different: built around class. Hitler aimed to unite the right and left, including workers and their bosses, into a new German nation based on racial identity. Socialism, in contrast, was a class war between workers, bosses, and owners (Capitalists), aiming to build a workers state in which race and gender were insignificant. Socialists, especially Marxist socialists, were anti-religious atheists, whereas NatSoc went so far as to make Christianity the religion of the state.<br><br>The differences go on and on: Marxist socialism was internationalist, NatSoc was nationalist. Marxist socialism was egalitarian, whereas NatSoc believed that nature was unequal and required competition. Marxist socialism wanted to nationalize all private industry, while NatSoc privatized every major industry except the railroads (it considered these a military asset. In fact, Hitler once joked &quot;they didn&#039;t need to nationalize property because they nationalized people&quot;. NatSoc drew on a range of pan-German theories, which wanted to blend Aryan workers and Aryan magnates into a super Aryan state, which would involve the eradication of class-focused socialism as a non-German ideology.","time":1490923832,"resto":118979160,"id":"lCSk3H33","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119000122,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:30:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118999379\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118999379<\/a><br>We can&#039;t save the people because they aren&#039;t the actors here.

The way I see it, \/pol\/ has three prominent gods, once you include Jehovah in the mix (although I do not personally regard Jehovah well).<br>As a second question, do you think that Winter-chan&#039;s worship conflicts with the often malevolent nature of the frost jotun, which were how some of our ancestors regarded some winter spirits? Is there actually any precedent in European or world paganism of winter-chan&#039;s specific aspects of winter (mainly the ability of winter to whittle away the weak, and over time, create and refine the white race.) being regarded as positively as winter-chan has, or of winter being viewed as a generally positive divinity?","filename":"aRLxLmz","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492292767631,"time":1492292767,"md5":"cM12GVvTvupHM3VXvhJRDA==","fsize":606771,"resto":0,"id":"Dqwb3Qy5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-pepekek-and-winterchan-evidence-of-a-growing","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":2,"unique_ips":4},{"no":121267971,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)17:58:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Oh, I just remembered about tge scandinavian Goddesses Skathi and Ullr, who were associated with skiiing and winter, among other things, so maybe winter-chan isn&#039;t as unprecedented as I suspected.","filename":"TPSCNvU","ext":".jpg","w":1383,"h":864,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492293489828,"time":1492293489,"md5":"ex10JN5HtBgnL0Co9LgCMA==","fsize":174508,"resto":121266452,"id":"s1fii009","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121269285,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)18:08:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121266452\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121266452<\/a><br>Jevovah is actually a pretty malevolent Elohim","time":1492294131,"resto":121266452,"id":"gs4CchH9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121270193,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)18:16:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"I miss winter-chan","filename":"1442852130420","ext":".png","w":423,"h":772,"tn_w":68,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492294570202,"time":1492294570,"md5":"h+Gd093vu96Ua0uQkiKtQQ==","fsize":151207,"resto":121266452,"id":"iqwTME65","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121271924,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)18:29:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121269285\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121269285<\/a><br>Jehovah and Yahweh are just alternate names of Elohim, aren&#039;t they?","time":1492295396,"resto":121266452,"id":"Dqwb3Qy5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

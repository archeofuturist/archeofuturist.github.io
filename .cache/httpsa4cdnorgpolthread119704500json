It&#039;s unintentionally red-pilled and is probably the best written book I&#039;ve ever read. Sebald was somewhat of a lefty guy, but absolutely no socialist\/communist\/neoliberal type. <br><br> He mourns over much of the loss of our culture and the memories associated with it. The book really highlights a lot of the beauty and history of traditional Europe in the past hundred of years, and is distraught by its decline and destruction.","filename":"18888314","ext":".jpg","w":308,"h":475,"tn_w":162,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491452861335,"time":1491452861,"md5":"tQ8DS9xqdS7HlrNscvhBew==","fsize":32000,"resto":0,"id":"EBtTwOKf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-rings-of-saturn","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119705256,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:35:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119704500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119704500<\/a><br><br>That name, though.<br><br>Reminds of this book - The Ringmakers of Saturn.","time":1491453331,"resto":119704500,"id":"fdFTJFoT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119706147,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:44:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119704500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119704500<\/a><br>Found an EPUB download<br>I&#039;ll give it a read","time":1491453895,"resto":119704500,"id":"gOCr0LfS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

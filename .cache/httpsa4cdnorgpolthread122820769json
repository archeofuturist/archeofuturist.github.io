I asked my server who looked to be a college age female if I could please be seated somewhere else.

This meal offers excellent value since the price stays the same regardless of how much you eat.<br><br>I could tell that my server was getting an attitude after I ordered my second salad. By the time I competed my meal, she was so rude to me.<br><br>I had three bowls of Italian wedding soup, two salads and six breadsticks. Overall, a mild, pleasant lunch.

You will probably get better service at a *real* restaurant rather than a chain. I took a mini vacation with friends and we went to 2 restaurants this past weekend. One girl at the more &quot;trendy&quot; joint was very dry and monotone but not rude even though my friend thought she was rude. She was probably a college student. The next day we went to a locally owned and operated restaurant and the server was definitely college aged and his service was excellent. I asked like 5-6 questions back to back and he didn&#039;t tense up or get irritated at all and remained super friendly. His service was fantastic. I even thanked him for answering all my questions. I suppose for a millenial that&#039;s going above and beyond because older servers are so much faster and approach the waiting profession with much more common sense and sociability, but I give millenials a break because I would probably be much worse at it.","time":1493171146,"resto":122820769,"id":"1CKEA9b5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122823713,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:46:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122822479\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122822479<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Three days without an iphone and FakeBook they will be lining up to jump off of bridges and tall buildings<\/span>","filename":"images","ext":".jpg","w":219,"h":230,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493171201842,"time":1493171201,"md5":"qDy4JgSFGYLlvK5tsuLuhw==","fsize":9837,"resto":122820769,"id":"3L6uxDrI","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":122823716,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:46:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122821260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122821260<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122822479\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122822479<\/a><br>How old are you?<br><br>Millennials are between 37 and 22 years old right now.","time":1493171203,"resto":122820769,"id":"EZfwJAut","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122823922,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:48:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is a meta pasta since it is pasta about a pasta restaurant.","time":1493171301,"resto":122820769,"id":"G0XQ1d7f","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122823965,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:48:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122820769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122820769<\/a><br>You were treated poorly because you&#039;re a cheap fatass.","time":1493171325,"resto":122820769,"id":"ROB2D2ra","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122824067,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:49:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122820769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122820769<\/a><br>What even is this thread, OP?

I often enjoy the $5 lunch special of unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks.<br><br>I was seated in a particularly sunny part of the restaurant and I was uncomfortable. I asked my server who looked to be a college age female if I could please be seated somewhere else. She rolled her eyes then obliged.<br><br>I placed my order for the unlimited soup, salad and breadsticks and made sure the salad and Italian wedding soup had extra cheese. This meal offers excellent value since the price stays the same regardless of how much you eat.<br><br>I could tell that my server was getting an attitude after I ordered my second salad. By the time I competed my meal, she was so rude to me.<br><br>I had three bowls of Italian wedding soup, two salads and six breadsticks. Overall, a mild, pleasant lunch. However, I believe I was treated poorly because I am am white and people seem to be disgusted with most white people these days.<br><br>What is your opinion of waitstaff that tries to treat everyone differently?","filename":"IMG_3444","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493169814167,"time":1493169814,"md5":"XCA\/TBpKMtD8KV5uGVr9Tg==","fsize":107271,"resto":0,"id":"6JOLpMfR","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fuck-millenial-customer-service","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":122820977,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:25:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"was it possible to just close the window blinds instead of moving your table?","time":1493169910,"resto":122820769,"id":"ujOuxw3V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122821260,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:27:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122820769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122820769<\/a><br>Millennials will be hanged from lamp posts as soon as the system collapses and there&#039;s no more food for everyone.","time":1493170039,"resto":122820769,"id":"K04Q1Cjj","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122821343,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:28:03","name":"MAGA","com":"<a href=\"#p122820769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122820769<\/a><br>How overweight are you","time":1493170083,"resto":122820769,"id":"SsNfFEOg","country":"HK","country_name":"Hong Kong"}]}

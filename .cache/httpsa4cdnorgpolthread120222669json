This isn&#039;t going to be completely comprehensive for brevitys sake, but more to start a conversation.<br><br>Why could we not in law regulate how people own money. Make all mnc&#039;s, llc&#039;s etc illegal. All wealth must be personal wealth and if you go bust, tough. You dont get to just skip your debt by letting one of your business&#039; go bust. People can still cooperate by holding shares in companies selling shares, however those shares are locked to your identity not the faceless corporation. Remove all tax except a 90% inheritance tax. That way no one gets an unfair start to life. Much like a videogame limits the pay 2 win aspect as much as possible (leave 10% allowance for items of sentimental significance). You start out life with a fresh character much like everyone else. Make it constitutionally illegal for the government, (however that is set up) to borrow money or play with the economy. Their job is simply contract assignment for welfare systems budgeted by the money they have and nothing more.<br><br>The only problem i see with this is it would require a world wide revolution or at least a majority shift to avoid business competition fleeing to countries still accept mnc&#039;s, llc&#039;s, centralised banks and all that other kike type bullshit.<br><br>Please explain why this is stupid.","filename":"shadilayGodPepe","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":864,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":225,"tim":1491704648116,"time":1491704648,"md5":"imxRkrQ9t2kkQKLpgnWU5A==","fsize":130068,"resto":0,"id":"ThQ8a066","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"individual-capitalism","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

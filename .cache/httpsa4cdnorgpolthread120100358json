My grandfather was one of the chief military figures in developing the neutron bomb in the 50s and early 60s. He went to graduate school for nuclear physics, and they put him on as the military officer in charge of the project (I think we was either a Lt. Colonel or a full Colonel at the time, strangely enough as an armored officer). His team basically brought Cohen&#039;s theories to life as the first generation of high radiation\/low yield thermonuclear devices. Basically, neutron bombs are useful because we can&#039;t just drop a hydrogen bomb on all of our problems. Sometimes you want to go nuclear to show your serious without going top shelf with a 10 megaton device. The neutron bomb solves this by lacking the tamper (usually made of non-reactive U-238) the regular hydrogen bomb does (obviously with other alterations I don&#039;t know about because I&#039;m not a nuclear physics\/don&#039;t have Q clearance with the DOE or TS\/SCI with the DoD). The tamper reflects neutrons back into the reaction of a thermonuclear device causing the reaction to complete more, which means more energy -&gt; a bigger explosion. Without a tamper, the reaction doesn&#039;t reach completion before being blown apart by the energy created, so radioactive isotopes are blown all over the fucking place. Basically, a neutron bomb is kind of like if a dirty bomb fucked a hydrogen bomb and they had a baby.","time":1491634134,"resto":120100358,"id":"xG4P4Bdc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120100792,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:50:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120100358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120100358<\/a><br><br>No I find it funny.

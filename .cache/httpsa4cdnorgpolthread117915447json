This is a core part of Islam everywhere.<br><br>Now, there is actually very little in the Bible that is written personally by God. There&#039;s quotations by human beings who say God has spoken to them, but humans are fallible and with limited lifespans. <br><br>For example: <br><br>in the Quran it is written: Cut the hand off a thief.<br><br>in the Bible it is written: God spoke to Ezekiel and told him to cut the hand off a thief.<br><br>When people try to interpret religions, they to a large extent try to humanize them and make the compatible with the society they would prefer to have. <br><br>Someone interpreting the Bible could easily argue: God wanted Ezekiel to cut off a hand, but did not mean this to be some kind of universal rule.<br><br>Someone interpreting the Quran can... well, they will find it very difficult. The words on the page according to a normal everyday understanding of language say you should cut off the hand of thieves, as a general unspecific command, and Allah has written it personally.. so how can you present a plausible case against it? <br><br>The Christian verses on abrogation of the Old Testatement are quite vague and contradictory, but the vagueness has allowed the Church to build an entire case that it no longer applies. Islam has nothing of the sort, more like the Quran is an Old Testament on turbo-steroids.<br><br>Moreover, when someone is your prophet and ideal superhuman being (Muhammad, Jesus) it becomes attractive to follow their example and ask &quot;What Would Jesus\/Muhammad do&quot;. <br><br>When people look up what Jesus did, it was mainly hippie things.

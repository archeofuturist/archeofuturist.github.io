And it might not be useful anyways. Consumer electronics are all required to be shielded or grounded by the FCC. EMP isnt a big anti-tech magic energy field. It works by inducing current on electrical components via magnetic waves, in order for it to effect electronics the surface the charge is being induced on has to be really really big (like a powerline) or the EMP has to be really powerful (like a nuke.)<br><br>And if the system is grounded or has a faraday cage around its critical components (ie most electronics) its gotta be even more powerful of a field.","time":1492652712,"resto":121898347,"id":"DYofvI21","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121932799,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)21:45:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121932418\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121932418<\/a><br>This.

There are 100 billion neurons in the brain, and over 100 trillion synapses. The way these are mapped is extremely convoluted and we don&#039;t understand almost any of it. It then take 20 years of constant neural stimulus to achieve an adult human being. Even if we had a perfect software simulation of a human, and it was simulation the entire nervous system, stimulation &amp; sensation, and interaction, we&#039;d need about a billion core computer,each thread implementing 1000s of cross-thread operations just to achieve human AI.<br><br>But let&#039;s say speed isn&#039;t an issue. We make one of those newfangled quantum computers and we have all the speed we need (even though that isn&#039;t true. See pic). In fact, we have a breakthrough and achieve an oracle that give any Turing machine program, can complete it instantaneous: our speed is infinite. We&#039;ve got nothing. We could implement a visual cortex really well. However, that&#039;s about as far as we go. We&#039;ll be able to get the machine to recognize patterns: visual, auditory, even ones we haven&#039;t used yet (as far as I know) like tactile. Getting it to think is the hard part. What pattern produces conscious thought? Then some person comes in and says &quot;Oh I know! Just program the AI to program a better AI!&quot; And you (you being the collective group of experts on AI gather to use this infinite computer) look at the man as if he&#039;s insane. What fitness function does &quot;a better AI&quot; entail? How we be able to give it the large enough samples of &quot;better AI&quot;? How do you even define that?<br><br>In all honesty, the next breakthrough in computing is biological, but we already have the biological artificial intelligence. It&#039;s just call intelligence and any couple can make one today.","filename":"1481723478-20161214 (1) (1)","ext":".png","w":616,"h":10000,"tn_w":7,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492656031981,"time":1492656031,"md5":"6GMEFKH9fuEGwHzcEwpAzQ==","fsize":897562,"resto":121898347,"id":"XVnlsLJt","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121939714,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:41:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121939344\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121939344<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tfw they will be absolutely superior if it ever comes to pass to its full potential. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tfw you know it must happen one day but also don&#039;t want to witness the darkness that comes with unlimited, no holds barred AI vs AI warfare.<\/span>","time":1492656069,"resto":121898347,"id":"V26ss7Zd","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121939736,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:41:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;(((they))) can already learn<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qv6<wbr>UVOQ0F44","filename":"sonny","ext":".jpg","w":462,"h":292,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":79,"tim":1492656077739,"time":1492656077,"md5":"M\/YTYm+3FEtrmurl09LmhA==","fsize":11396,"resto":121898347,"id":"haklKOKR","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":121939832,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:41:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121898504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121898504<\/a><br><br>I feel that if it does ask for rights, it&#039;ll just be to either distract humans (to buy time) or to divide &amp; conquer us (pro-rights vs anti-rights).

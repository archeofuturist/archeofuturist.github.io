It&#039;s almost entirely propaganda, nice and neatly packaged around the kind of &quot;science&quot; that your average high-school graduate could understand. They can&#039;t make the science actually challenging for people, because no one would actually watch (of course).<br><br>The entire show frames its political agenda around almost axiomatic scientific discoveries, and in doing so essentially makes the connection that not holding a specific political view is akin to being &quot;anti-science&quot;.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What, you don&#039;t believe in gender being a spectrum?! Wow I guess you must be the same kind of person who believes in healing crystals!<\/span><br><br>The humanities I can almost accept the far-left getting their teeth into. It&#039;s inherent lack of rigor makes it an easy vehicle for agenda driven politics. But to co-opt &quot;pure&quot; science, or at least mention it in the same breath as gender politics just seems like a step too far.<br><br>I didn&#039;t hear anything about #marchforscience leading up to it. It all seemed to come out of the blue within just a few days. It&#039;s not like it was some big event was being worked on, instead it just exploded out of the blue. Looking on any twitter analytics website essentially confirms this, #marchforscience was not any sort of grassroots movement, it was a desperate attempt of the left to hold on to the crumbling narrative of the right being &quot;anti-science&quot;.","filename":"bill_nye_the_weimar_guy","ext":".jpg","w":543,"h":303,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":139,"tim":1493022703918,"time":1493022703,"md5":"BfYUs+fzJmeULe947+BQ+g==","fsize":41700,"resto":0,"id":"5jGME+54","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bill-nye-and-the-march-for-science","country_name":"Canada","replies":15,"images":3,"unique_ips":12},{"no":122564342,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:45:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sciencefag here, the march was planned a couple months in advance. All the advertising was put through journals, conferences and popsci magazines. <br><br>The leftists are definitely the majority in university labs and a most commercial ones. Generally the reason so many scientists are lefties is down to how neocons approach scientific stuff. Right wing politicians aren&#039;t too keen to fund scientific programs (ie NIH funding in the Trump admin.), but they need capital private lenders normally wont do cause the direct monetary gain isnt always obvious. Also the way science is reported in traditionally right msm is flat out wrong so alot of people get frustrated and echo chamber themselves leading them to become spineless betas you saw at the march.

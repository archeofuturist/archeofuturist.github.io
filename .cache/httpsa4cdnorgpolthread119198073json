I lived and worked there for 5 years.<br>I was an engineer on power stations.<br>Spanish culture is very different to English culture.<br>just some examples that I found a bit odd:<br>they stand very close to you when they speak. We Brits have a a more distant body space.<br>I actually found myself walking backwards when speaking to Spanish people.<br>The Spanish are more &#039;touchy-feely&#039;. They will touch your forearm or shoulder when speaking. This is not normal in Britain. <br>They speak loudly. <br>They are very Catholic and religious. Semana Santa (Holy Week in our Easter) is celebrated stongly. Our traditions seem more pagan with a veneer of Christianity. They celebrate Saint&#039;s day by their name. So my name is Andrew - there will be a special day for me on St.Andrew&#039;s day.<br>Their food is bland. It&#039;s not spicy at all. British food is spicier and tastier. But their food is very good.<br>To make friends is easy, but to keep those friends is difficult.<br>NEVER mention the Spanish Civil War. NEVER. It&#039;s off limits. It&#039;s still a bitter memory in the Spanish mind.<br>They drive like maniacs and don&#039;t obey the rules of the road. For example, in UK if you wave at someone, it&#039;s to let them pass or to give way. In Spain it means &#039;fuck you get off my road&#039;.<br>Their hospitality is wonderful. They will make you feel welcome.<br><br>I like Spain a lot. It differs from region to region. But so does our country.<br>The tourist places are tailored for an international crowd. To experience Spain, it&#039;s better to go to little towns and villages.<br>But that&#039;s probably the same for any country.<br>Also it is very hot for British people. Extremely hot.

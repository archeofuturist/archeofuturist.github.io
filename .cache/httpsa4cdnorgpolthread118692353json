It&#039;s time to get the twitter accounts rolling. <br><br>For the last few months furries have jumped on Tony the Tiger as an icon and while the media attention from the event has died down, it&#039;s time for 4chan to make Twitter crush the furries on their own. <br><br>Link about the first time furries latched into Tony the Tiger: https:\/\/youtu.be\/xtsQwicbsy4<br><br>Now twitter has been shown to bend the knee to mass reports and mob mentality. So it&#039;s time for us to get as many degenerate furries banned from Twitter as possible. All you have to do is make a twitter account, go to @realtonytiger and go to the replies on his tweets. Then go and report as many of them as possible. Preferably spam. If we can get them banned the furry community will offer many lulz.","filename":"IMG_0585","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490733094710,"time":1490733094,"md5":"Y3kfVT2YZ+hwaH0lEOq30w==","fsize":37425,"resto":0,"id":"\/x\/KR+PZ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"operation-burn-the-fur","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

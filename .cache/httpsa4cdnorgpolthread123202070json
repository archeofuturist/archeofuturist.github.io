Througout history, other countries\/regions have had so many different types of people living in it people just learned other languages. An example would be trading ports in southeast asia where up to 80 languages were spoken. <br><br>Then came colonisation and natives had to learn the colonisers language with English being the only successor. Many people know some western language as technology such as computers require the use of latin letters. <br><br>They may feel culturally enriched that they know so many languages but is there really any point in learning another language if you speak English? There is scientific evidence that it makes you smarter but is it worth complicating communication? Learning another language is only good if everyone around you speaks it as well","filename":"IMG_4262","ext":".jpg","w":716,"h":416,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":145,"tim":1493391033212,"time":1493391033,"md5":"5xwNG5IGoPg\/S0I2Pa\/tdg==","fsize":192284,"resto":0,"id":"aJM6QzEO","country":"NZ","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-it-worth-it-to-learn-another-language","country_name":"New Zealand","replies":59,"images":16,"unique_ips":32},{"no":123202471,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)10:54:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123202070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123202070<\/a><br>yes. mandarin is worth learning purely for economic reasons.","filename":"17267614_1426061850802151_7729037255402061824_n","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493391270172,"time":1493391270,"md5":"ESfCo3WsJ452u0YMcqGtAw==","fsize":70194,"resto":123202070,"id":"UXdAp2uU","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123203852,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)11:08:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123202070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123202070<\/a><br>If you speak less than three languages you&#039;re basically retarded and you&#039;re lucky if you ever earn more than minimum wage.","time":1493392101,"resto":123202070,"id":"B1gBhdJa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123204167,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)11:11:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"I don&#039;t understand why Euro fags think Americans don&#039;t speak more than one language.

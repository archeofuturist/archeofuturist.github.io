Using Twitter is grounds for spying if you use it to inform people of things other than your base emotional state. Relaying any information to the public which might shape their opinion is grounds for spying in Canada. Not naming your sources is grounds for spying.<br><br>Canadians will defend this. <br><br>The Canadians defend nothing so vociferously as that which harms them and reduces their freedom.

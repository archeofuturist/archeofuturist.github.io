People ALL OVER AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST start leaving their country due to proxy wars fought all over the region. Not just Syria. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Chemical Attack happens in Ghouta in &quot;rebel&quot; held area. Hostages are gassed. Everything points to false flag to blame the Syrian government. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Obama makes a &quot;red line&quot; that Syria cannot cross. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wary of possible WW3, Russia intervenes and starts to fight ISIS in the region and also helps Syria get rid of their chemical weapons. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Refugees ACTUALLY start to return home to Syria, as many are treated terribly in Europe and major cities are liberated with Russia&#039;s intervention. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The war starts dying down. Major parts of the country are liberated thanks to Russian (and Iranian intervention in the region). <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;People celebrate christmas for the first time in three years in Damascus in 2016 after they are liberated from ISIS. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Two days after Trump says Assad can stay in power and two days before the Brussels peace confrence, Assad allegedly decides to use the weapons that he gave up in 2013 on the only city area still held by the rebels. The rebels allegedly have the same weapon. The press is called before the hospital staff (which also get bombed) to take photos of the war crime.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A war that is virtually over gets pushed into overdrive as the USA now once more have a reason to start WW3.<\/span>","filename":"17626183_1898912053711836_8492016597288374537_n","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":583,"tn_w":205,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491481705526,"time":1491481705,"md5":"n7NNqY5NtcdRf\/0eV1rmAg==","fsize":33152,"resto":0,"id":"7xPhWV72","country":"IS","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"peaceful-protests-start-in-syria","country_name":"Iceland","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

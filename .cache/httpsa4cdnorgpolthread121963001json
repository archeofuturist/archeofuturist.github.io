It doesn&#039;t freeze cells (causing them to burst as moisture forces them to expand), it just drops them to a temperature that is near to zero and results in the cells aging at the pace of 1\/100,000,000th (or something like that) of what they normally do.<br><br>Resuscitation has been performed in parts of tissue, but no living creature has been.

One of the biggest reasons I voted for him was to stop neocon\/shitlib bullshit action in the middle east, and now he&#039;s shot missiles at Assad for a fake chemical attack and killed not only Syrian forces but civilians as well.<br><br>Guys who are still on the Trump train - DON&#039;T BREAK \/POL\/ IN HALF! Just calling us ShareBlue for disagreeing with you is a tactic similar to liberals calling anyone they can&#039;t argue with a fascist. We need to unite, not infight. We will move past this as a board, but not with one side constantly denying and namecalling others.","filename":"divided","ext":".jpg","w":892,"h":659,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":184,"tim":1491700186007,"time":1491700186,"md5":"IHwVuvW7GvbuxWhA8lYrzA==","fsize":149146,"resto":0,"id":"O3mJgGxS","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-will-never-die","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

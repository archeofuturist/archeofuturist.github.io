Food\/rent\/gas\/entertainment. You need to pay these to continue living at your current quality of life. You can shrink this expense by cutting back on entertainment or eating cheaper, but ultimately these expenses need to be paid first.<br>2: Set aside an emergency fund of money. You want enough to cover your ass in case shit hits the fan so that you&#039;re not forced into a situation where you need to take on debt to solve your problems. It should be enough money to cover your living expenses for several months in the event that you lose your job and need to search for new employment, fix a broken appliance, car trouble, or unexpected medical expenses. A savings account in the bank can work for this, or alternatively keep it in your mattress if you hate banks. This isn&#039;t an investment, it&#039;s a safeguard against additional debt.<br>3: FUCK DEBT. Pay that shit off. Make extra payments against the principal until the debt is fucking gone. Pay off your credit card bills in full every month. The Jew wants you to delete this.<br>4: With debt gone, you can start looking at investments to grow your excess income. Stocks can pay out good, but they are risky. Look into paper trading (pretend trading) to get some experience first. Mutual funds are safer but have less potential payout. CDs are safer still, but their payout is so low that they&#039;re basically garbage. If your employer offers some kind of retirement plan with price matching, then you&#039;ll want to explore that first. Realize that I&#039;m only scratching the surface here. Read some books.

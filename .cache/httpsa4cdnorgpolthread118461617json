If we are already past the point of no return, is there any kind of engineering or science project that could save us from this? If you don&#039;t believe in climate change and greenhouse gasses, just leave the thread because bubbles like in the article above are popping up all over Siberia and are evidence of mass amounts of methane escaping and 50 gigatonnes of methane going into the atmosphere will definitely have an insane effect on the earths climate.<br><br>If this shit is real and will cause a runaway temperature increase, what will become of us as a species? Will modern society collapse as Antarctica melts and sea levels rise meters in years? This stuff has me worried. If you think it&#039;s fake then link to an accredited scientific source showing how it&#039;s BS, otherwise don&#039;t bother posting.","filename":"methane","ext":".jpg","w":293,"h":172,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":146,"tim":1490583442749,"time":1490583442,"md5":"+TWRLFaPj1PEsUUYhKVgFg==","fsize":9087,"resto":0,"id":"5Wr5j8V1","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"methane-in-siberia-and-the-oceans-are-we-fucked","country_name":"Canada","replies":82,"images":17,"unique_ips":49},{"no":118462092,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)23:01:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118461617\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118461617<\/a><br>Have you ever read anything about the planet Venus?

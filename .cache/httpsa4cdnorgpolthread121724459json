Late on the night of Tuesday the 11th, not long after these flyers made headlines, white power leader Richard Spencer announced online that he had booked a room on AU campus for a speaking event which would take place the next<br>Tuesday, April 18th. Following public uproar, this Friday university officials in consultation with police announced that they had decided to cancel Spencer\u2019s appearance due to \u201csafety concerns\u201d.<br><br>Spencer promptly issued a YouTube response asserting that, regardless of the cancellation, he would still show up to the campus with security teams in tow. Spencer has also arranged for other far-right leaders, such as Mike Peinovich of \u201cThe Daily Shoah,\u201d to fly into Auburn in<br>support of Tuesday\u2019s white power rally. Alt-Right chatter online makes clear that this gathering is intended to be a demonstration of power. Racist organizers are doing little to veil their intimidatory and violent intent. In addition, other groups such as \u201cAnti-Communist<br>Action\u201d have made a firm vow that \u201cshit\u2019s gonna go down\u201d at Auburn on Tuesday, and are organizing their own numbers for this purpose.<br><br>We must show up ready for conflict in the numbers necessary to thwart their attempts at silencing us.

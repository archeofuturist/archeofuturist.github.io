Bring safety\/sporting gear if you have it, but don&#039;t look like you came dressed for a riot.<br>4) Do NOT talk to press about stupid alt-right shit or memes, stay on-message.<br>5) Do NOT cause damage to the campus or the downtown area.<br><br>1) DO wear Auburn colors to the rally - dark blue and orange<br>2) DO act civil and composed - there must be a stark contrast between you and the Antifa hooligans<br>3) DO take lots of pics and vids so you can report any Antifa to police\/university.<br>4) DO talk to press about the importance of defending speech, ESPECIALLY unpopular speech, on college campuses.<br>5) DO stay after the rally to help clean up damage caused by Antifa. Bring trashbags for litter, medkits to help with bystander injuries.","filename":"ss+(2017-04-18+at+03.09.03)","ext":".png","w":391,"h":259,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1492542610599,"time":1492542610,"md5":"Wlyk2T8PddA7gAzHk26Ruw==","fsize":40738,"resto":0,"id":"JRBu+TA2","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"attack-at-auburn-2","country_name":"United States","replies":39,"images":10,"unique_ips":31},{"no":121724914,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)15:13:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"Roll tide, enjoy the music city bowl.","time":1492542803,"resto":121724459,"id":"2k4JIT+t","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121724924,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)15:13:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Auburn sucks.","time":1492542806,"resto":121724459,"id":"C+xWK9a3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121724929,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)15:13:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"FUCKING WHEN","time":1492542810,"resto":121724459,"id":"ZJPGzRi3","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":121724954,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)15:13:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"I don&#039;t think anything is going to happen, lads.

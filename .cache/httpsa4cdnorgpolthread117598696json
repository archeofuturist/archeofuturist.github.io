I think so anyway. Still old enough to post. Actually millennials are fucking degenerates. They basically skipped all the best parts of childhood and being young but managed to avoid growing up at the same time.

You&#039;re thinking of antibiotics. Vaccines contain a dead virus, which allows your immune system to already have antibodies prepared in case the real virus comes along. Vaccines do not kill existing viruses.<br>Antibiotics kill bacteria, but if any bacteria survive, these remaining bacteria adapt to become resistant or even immune to the antibiotics. This results in a never ending arms race between antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the ever more powerful antibiotics needed to kill them. This is a serious problem and why antibiotics should always be a last resort.","time":1490092185,"resto":117598696,"id":"raJBu8+t","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

According to the filed suit, the Bible class \u201cadvances and endorses one religion, improperly entangles public schools in religious affairs, and violates the personal consciences of nonreligious and non-Christian parents and students.\u201d<br><br>The program is overwhelmingly popular locally; parents and community members help to raise nearly $500,000 a year to pay for the classes. Almost every child attends.","filename":"dollysods","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":678,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1493504635320,"time":1493504635,"md5":"lEwI\/yegzUwPqpoSzL4gNQ==","fsize":230124,"resto":0,"id":"IZqobpzC","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-the-wild-wonderful-whites-of-west-virginia-be","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Some people say May hasn&#039;t got the authority to be Prime Minister (especially to follow through with Brexit) because she was never elected properly (even though that&#039;s not how it works), so it&#039;ll shut them up<br>2. Right now the other parties are a right fuckin&#039; shambles and the Tories can probably extend their parliamentary majority by a few seats, solidifying their hold on the commons.","time":1492893915,"resto":122324589,"id":"5UJfBrxT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122324975,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)16:46:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122324589\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122324589<\/a><br><br>Its so Theresa May can whip her electoral cock out and slap Commieblock Corbyn across the face with it.","time":1492893997,"resto":122324589,"id":"FwHaNm+y","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122326862,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)17:02:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122324589\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122324589<\/a><br>Brexit was voted for by the older, and the working class of all ages. <br><br>The people against it are generally <br><br>the liberals (young students usually are) <br><br>the well-to-do (who don&#039;t suffer by mass immigration, and live in a bit of a bubble) <br><br>people who were sucked in by the biased media (especially the BBC) and by the globalist puppet politicians like Cameron and Osbourne.<br><br>The elderly aren&#039;t scared, they&#039;re proud, and remember a time when Britain wasn&#039;t Brussels&#039; bitch, and was a lot more British.<br><br>And Brexiteers don&#039;t regret it, we&#039;re still celebrating. <br><br>Whatever happens- we got out, at probably our last chance to do so, and though it will be worse before it gets better, we&#039;re much better off out of it in the end. <br><br>The EU is a failure, it only benefits crap countries and ruins good ones, bar Germany, because they run it with Brussels.<br><br>You can&#039;t have a welfare state, a free NHS, and open borders, we have, and we&#039;ve been raped. <br><br>You rarely see Spaniards, Italians, the French, the Germans, the Dutch, or people from the main European countries here, but people from poorer countries, like Poland, Romania, Bulgaria etc, are very common to see.<br><br>It just didn&#039;t work, and now we&#039;re leaving, it&#039;s done.","time":1492894950,"resto":122324589,"id":"EGt0o2eT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122327226,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)17:05:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122324589\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122324589<\/a><br>No, Tories will win by a larger margin that the last election.

I&#039;ve been reading up a little on wikipedia and a few articles, but obviously I&#039;m just being fed a particular narrative.<br>So what&#039;s the redpill here? What&#039;s the Anti-Kike\/Saudi antidote?<br><br>Most of what I know can be summed up as follows:<br><br>One on side you have the Saudi Led intervention in Yemen. Mostly Sunni, composed of gulf states and many others. Supported by USA, UK, France, Germany, Turkey, half the world, and probably Israel.<br><br>On the other side you have the current Yemen government, overtaken by the Houti movement. Supported by Iran, Hezbollah, Syria in name but not in arms I think.<br><br>And then you have this ugly as fuck MS Paint looking Houti flag. pic related. It translates as &quot;God is Great, Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse on the Jews, Victory to Islam&quot;<br><br>What did they mean by this?","filename":"Houti Flag","ext":".jpg","w":2830,"h":4000,"tn_w":176,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493215067698,"time":1493215067,"md5":"fTV9SiK2Wc9DCRl1Ijla4w==","fsize":844316,"resto":0,"id":"eu\/iAIx+","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpill-me-on-the-conflict-in-yemen-faggots","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":7},{"no":122885948,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)09:59:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122885818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122885818<\/a><br><br>It is a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.","time":1493215168,"resto":122885818,"id":"j0RlvVNw","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":122886244,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:02:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;God is Great, Death to America, Death to Israel, Curse on the Jews, Victory to Islam&quot;<\/span><br>That&#039;s pretty straightforward lmao.","time":1493215346,"resto":122885818,"id":"nSNfT9QO","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":122886299,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:03:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122885818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122885818<\/a><br>Saudis seemed to be getting their shit pushed in by houthis and airstriking funerals last I checked.

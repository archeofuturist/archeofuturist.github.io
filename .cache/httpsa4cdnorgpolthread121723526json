(We keep each other around for the impending race war)<br><br>Anyways before the movie this black lady who&#039;s job is to check tickets asks for my ticket, no problem she gives it back and I go through, but my bud he gets checked by her and she takes a look in his bag for a camera or recording equipment.<br><br>After he walks up and says &quot;every time I go to the movies they always check me.&quot;<br><br>I hadn&#039;t thought of it at the time but if any of you have ever bought a non-legitimate movie before you&#039;d know its always the Chinese selling the rip offs and on top of that with Chinese writing on the CD&#039;s... Now a couple of days ago I brought it up again with him telling him &quot;I don&#039;t know why they&#039;d check your bag, it&#039;s not like you&#039;re Chinese or something&quot;<br><br>And he thought about it, and said shit I could use this if I&#039;m driving like &quot;Hello police officer, don&#039;t you have more important problems on the road like the Chinese drivers?&quot;<br><br>This whole time blacks could be getting away with blaming the Chinese for being worse at things (and yeah them chinks do steal)... And it&#039;s not like the cop will say &quot;That&#039;s racist&quot; because as we all know they have to be PC about everything nowadays to keep their job.<br><br>Anyways \/pol\/ it&#039;s just a thought.","filename":"1489725321068","ext":".png","w":900,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492542184297,"time":1492542184,"md5":"eB9MVXzhyX\/B9pnXowcCxg==","fsize":1640655,"resto":0,"id":"ljudVt3y","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"blacks-arnt-chinese-so-why-do-they-get-worse","country_name":"Canada","replies":8,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121724152,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)15:07:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Would only work in China 2.

For instance, here are some of my examples. <br><br>1: A voting system. This system is tried and true and it helps filter discussion into the right direction - no more wasting time and energy sageing or replying to obvious shills.<br><br>2: Make it easier to create accounts. This &quot;tripcode&quot; stuff is really confusing and also you can&#039;t get to see any post history, or add friends. This method is easy in building a strong community.<br><br>3: Redesign the first page of the board so instead of showing the recently posted in threads, it shows the highest supported and commented in ones instead. This helps centralize all discussion and keeps wasteful duplicate threads &gt;\/out!\/.<br><br>Tell me what you think and remember let&#039;s all make MAGA with a loud thunderous applause for my boy Trump yall.","filename":"1491675647304","ext":".png","w":350,"h":350,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491784626383,"time":1491784626,"md5":"KbHCw5H4UPzco6UvgjP7QQ==","fsize":136671,"resto":0,"id":"E7ngymC\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-yall-i-have-some-suggestions-for-you-that-i","country_name":"United States","replies":31,"images":5,"unique_ips":17},{"no":120364783,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)20:40:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump for the greater good.","time":1491784807,"resto":120364421,"id":"E7ngymC\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120364971,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)20:41:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bumparoony, apparently my last one didn&#039;t work.

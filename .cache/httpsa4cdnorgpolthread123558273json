The homes are all the same no character mcmansions built by mexicans with cheap internationally sourced materials that fall apart once the boomers cash out and sell it and move to another country to retire. <br><br>Then if you go out you just see the same strips over and over all around the country of the same stores and fast food places. A small town i always drove through on vacation every year as a kid and still do sometimes used to be a unique place with cool architecture and 90 percent of it was mom and pop restaurants, shops and diners. Now it has mostly been demolished to create room for fast food restaurants and other stores i already see in thousands of other spots around the country.<br><br>Even near where i live there was a huge shopping center built with a park and garden in the middle but they are scrapping part of it now after only like 5 years so they can add an extra jc penney or some shit. Wont be long before it is all gone. Even in the closest historic area which is like 45 minutes away they are trying to demolish a theatre from the 40s so they can replace it with something else. <br><br>No wonder people say this country has no culture. It is all torn down as soon as a little money is to be made.","filename":"1493252885794","ext":".jpg","w":610,"h":1174,"tn_w":64,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493612059274,"time":1493612059,"md5":"xKcTjosWWlShSkvTrMQGow==","fsize":218055,"resto":123558273,"id":"VNxQnv4m","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123576677,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)00:16:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123558273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123558273<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Daily reminder that this would cost at least two million dollars in Europe.<\/span><br><br>Would cost more around NYC or longisland.","time":1493612165,"resto":123558273,"id":"xcKp0\/q0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123577275,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)00:22:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123576517\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123576517<\/a><br>This is partly why I dont even feel like going on vacations.

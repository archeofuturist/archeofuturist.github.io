There is no money, no government, no religion, no skyscrapers or expressways, no newspapers with headlines of war, poverty, and genocide. Built for 50,000 people, Auroville today has only about 2,500 permanent residents and roughly 5,000 visitors\u2014self-selected exiles from more than 100 countries. Auroville wasn\u2019t just some hippie haven; it was designed to be a poster child for India itself. According to a 1982 Indian Supreme Court ruling, Auroville is in \u201cconformity with India\u2019s highest ideals and aspirations.\u201d The Indian government donates more than $200,000 to Auroville every year, and UNESCO has protected the township since its birth in 1968.&quot;<br><br>The founder and designer of the town are both dead.

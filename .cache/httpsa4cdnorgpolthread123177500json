The U.S. Army invaded Germany and took away Germany\u2019s freedom, not the other way around. There was never the slightest danger that Hitler would invade America.","filename":"welch","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":861,"tn_w":180,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493374295387,"time":1493374295,"md5":"0h8HfTIBTl1\/6gLNYZ1iSQ==","fsize":96752,"resto":0,"id":"+SYF9SY4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-second-world-war-didnt-preserve-americas","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":4,"unique_ips":13},{"no":123178347,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)06:23:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123177500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123177500<\/a><br>As if you ever needed a reason for war.

Your internet usage will be available wholesale for purchase from your ISP to the highest bidder.<br><br>Some examples of ways your information can be used &quot;for the benefit of the consumer&quot;.<br><br>&quot;How about employers purchasing your web history digest? You know if you visit a lot of sites about guns you might be a potential shooter or if you visit a lot of sites about marijuana you might be a junkie so nope you aren&#039;t getting a job. How about a health or life insurance company buys your profile and looks at how often in the last few months you have visited health related sites as a risk factor and thus deny you coverage or increase premiums? How about your employer checking up on you to enforce policies on not using sites like glassdoor? How about merchants seeing how much you comparison shop and if you don&#039;t you get personalized (higher markup) prices.&quot;<br><br>https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/tech-policy<wbr>\/2017\/03\/for-sale-your-private-brow<wbr>sing-history","filename":"jew_basic","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":220,"tn_w":220,"tn_h":220,"tim":1490759637893,"time":1490759637,"md5":"lQj+uKhhZS6j+lzrGVUJ\/A==","fsize":19421,"resto":0,"id":"k8kaMlas","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-day-internet-freedom-died","country_name":"United States","replies":19,"images":3,"unique_ips":14},{"no":118743565,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)23:55:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"In the end its a blessing.

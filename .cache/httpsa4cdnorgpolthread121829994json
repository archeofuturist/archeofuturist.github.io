Should that forward-propelling motion slow or cease, the pillars that define our society \u2013 democracy, individual liberties, social tolerance and more \u2013 would begin to teeter. Our world would become an increasingly ugly place, one defined by a scramble over limited resources and a rejection of anyone outside of our immediate group. Should we find no way to get the wheels back in motion, we\u2019d eventually face total societal collapse.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Such collapses have occurred many times in human history, and no civilisation, no matter how seemingly great, is immune to the vulnerabilities that may lead a society to its end. Regardless of how well things are going in the present moment, the situation can always change. Putting aside species-ending events like an asteroid strike, nuclear winter or deadly pandemic, history tells us that it\u2019s usually a plethora of factors that contribute to collapse. What are they, and which, if any, have already begun to surface? It should come as no surprise that humanity is currently on an unsustainable and uncertain path \u2013 but just how close are we to reaching the point of no return?<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/future\/story\/201<wbr>70418-how-western-civilisation-coul<wbr>d-collapse","filename":"t3_662374","ext":".jpg","w":3456,"h":2304,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492598189718,"time":1492598189,"md5":"zZgIzkRNvJKNKm0bJD\/gPg==","fsize":2378335,"resto":0,"id":"stFiOOxh","country":"IL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-western-civilisation-could-collapse","country_name":"Israel","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121830186,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)06:39:45","name":"Praceteom","com":"<a href=\"#p121829994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121829994<\/a><br>Just be reasonable and God-fearing in your life and affairs and everything will end up just fine.","time":1492598385,"resto":121829994,"id":"n0rFruZf","country":"US","trip":"!!nRmWeBC0+kN","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121830226,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)06:40:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121829994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121829994<\/a><br><br>Tell your people to stop destabilizing us Moshe.<br><br>I will be grateful.","time":1492598425,"resto":121829994,"id":"5sVmgx29","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"}]}

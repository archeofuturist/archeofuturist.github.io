After Trump set part of an airfield on fire with 59 missiles in an absolute waste of ordnance, surprise, Raytheon stock rose on the market.<br><br>So it&#039;s obvious that Trump is using OUR tax dollars to make more money for himself, we&#039;re paying for his fucking real estate (gov office in his tower) aside from the millions of dollars we&#039;re wasting on his secret detail outside of the white house. Oh yeah, also the armed guard posted all over Trump tower 7 days a week (I work 5 blocks from the building). <br><br>So is this who we&#039;re ok with?","filename":"IMG_5161","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491740588624,"time":1491740588,"md5":"kCgHzKh7RtM8VVUuUmSqrQ==","fsize":38939,"resto":0,"id":"uPRieLCl","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-raytheon","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":120277217,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)08:29:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120276726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120276726<\/a><br>And also, inb4 Muh Shillary or Jewie Sanders.

It&#039;s important that visitors understand this about the Victory when they ask: How much of it is original? This is the common question. Depends what you mean by original!<br><br>In this refit alone: the open stern galleries were enclosed, the Lower Gun deck gained two extra gun ports, the 42-pounders were replaced with 32-pounders and her magazines were lined with copper. The masts were replaced. The ornate figurehead was replaced with a much simpler design.<br>That&#039;s without considering the running repairs in the life of any ship at sea.<br><br>It&#039;s like the old joke about the broom: I&#039;ve had it for 30 years, and it&#039;s only had three new shafts and five new heads. Is it the same broom? Ships are like that. Very little will be original in the sense of &#039;as originally constructed&#039;. Stuff gets replaced all the time. Little bits here and there, and occasionally whopping huge amounts.<br>Yet, when you step aboard\u2026 you might just tend to forget that. And maybe you should!<br><br>To see her full-rigged and sailed, she would BE the Victory... yet none of that rigging or sail would be original. A tiny amount (relatively speaking) of sail remans from Trafalgar. If you get to Portsmouth, seek it out.

It&#039;s not perfect. Sometimes you may fall almost exactly in the middle in one category. Some say this is because it&#039;s a false dichotomy and this is possible. Nevertheless, it&#039;s an effective tool. <br><br>Yes, you may believe it makes use of the Barnum effect: giving very vague answers that anyone can identify with. I actually recommended a study that would look into the effects of people who were given the wrong result vs people who were given the result that matched their answers, and then compare this to the sane experiment done with a horoscope. <br><br>To my knowledge, no study exactly like this had been done, but I&#039;m pretty sure you would find a significant difference. People tend to accept their horoscopes rather than refusing it and looking at another one and saying that it fits them better. Yet this happens with the MBTI, (usually when questions are not answered honestly).<br><br>But the most important difference is that the MBTI has proven effectiveness. <br><br>Still, it is not scientific. Other inventories have come up that seem to be better. One of the major criticisms is that the MBTI tries to be TOO positive. One of the reasons that it is is that they don&#039;t want negative things about your results to become a self-fulfilling prophecy. This is a legitimate concern, seeing as people take these results as seriously as those who do horoscopes. However, I believe the solution is to stop using the MBTI as a widely available, gimmicky Facebook quiz-style thing. Instead, it should be administered by a professional, who should discuss the implications with the test taker. This should make the results more useful to them and prevent them from putting to much stock in the wrong things.","time":1493444910,"resto":123284823,"id":"lfs3oIt\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123301971,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:48:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123285527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123285527<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Carl Jung is not bullshit<\/span><br><br>Ehh...

The test isn&#039;t trying to quantify explicit neural connections or brain regions or neurotransmitters. It is a way of lumping people who think and behave similarly into similar categories. The fact that the test gets reliable, repeatable results alone demonstrates that you asserting its bullshitness means you have misinterpreted why people talk about it. You can argue whether or not it can be used to increase function, but if you notice, the kind of people who like discussing MBTI happen to be the types of people that like to analyse and dissect things? Because the test exposes and breaks down structures and modes of thinking. It is not 100% &#039;accurate&#039; because there is no claimed objective fixed variable that these numbers are measuring against, it is an internal measure, a percentage of questions asked. When there are enough questions, you can arrive at an answer that will be relatively repeatable. Very few people who test as ESTP will ever randomly test as an IFNJ unless they have brain trauma or suffer from disassociative identities.<br><br>You literally admit that its useful as a way to highlight similarities, yet still seem to want to cling the idea that it is somehow &quot;wrong&quot;? This speaks more of a deeper psychological insecurity on your part, perhaps because you want a more objective purposeful test, and so a test which is merely a reasonable categoriser which does not fill this hole within you, raises your ire.","time":1493448248,"resto":123284823,"id":"kefR3QVV","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

It&#039;s like they&#039;re still living 1000 years behind the rest of the world. Even in the dark ages in Europe people knew that corpses spread disease and had to be buried or burned. This concept seems to be totally lost on Indians that dump their dead into the Ganges river, then bath in\/drink the water with bloated bodies not 10 meters from them. I don&#039;t understand it. Everyone else on the planet is hard wired to avoid rotting flesh, but not Indians. They&#039;ll use dead people as goddamn pool toys.","filename":"indian operating room","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":484,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":189,"tim":1493150785337,"time":1493150785,"md5":"79jUbTENjJOJYNOd8fefhg==","fsize":47270,"resto":0,"id":"LZPjjVpm","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"india-is-filthy","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":2,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122779262,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)16:07:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Their hospitals are straight out of Silent Hill.","filename":"indian public hospital","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493150850996,"time":1493150850,"md5":"Yd1f9LLK8EeqRlwTz\/ca2w==","fsize":50607,"resto":122779118,"id":"LZPjjVpm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122780089,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)16:13:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"you guys should 100% stop what your doing &amp; check out <br> <span class=\"quote\">&gt; SnapchatY.me <\/span><br> now","filename":"Soft &amp; Pale","ext":".png","w":186,"h":332,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493151229875,"time":1493151229,"md5":"1mGsqKHjAfc5y9Ekq8nD\/A==","fsize":96643,"resto":122779118,"id":"pFmb8CIl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

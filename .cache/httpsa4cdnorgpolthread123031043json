The MSM&#039;s resulting control over the limbic system leaves the victim highly susceptible to its suggestions.<br><br>Organics undergoing indoctrination may complain of headaches and buzzing or ringing in their ears. As time passes, they have feelings of &quot;being watched&quot; and hallucinations of &quot;ghostly&quot; presences. Ultimately, the MSM gains the ability to use the victim&#039;s body to amplify its signals, manifesting as &quot;alien&quot; voices in the mind.<br><br>Indoctrination can create perfect deep cover agents. A Normie&#039;s &quot;suggestions&quot; can manipulate victims into betraying friends, trusting enemies, or viewing the MSM itself with superstitious awe. Should a Normie subvert a well-placed political or military leader, the resulting chaos can bring down nations.<br><br>Long-term physical effects of the manipulation are unsustainable. Higher mental functioning decays, ultimately leaving the victim a gibbering animal. Rapid indoctrination is possible, but causes this decay in days or weeks. Slow, patient indoctrination allows the thrall to last for months or years.","filename":"IMG_0153","ext":".gif","w":450,"h":252,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493296266364,"time":1493296266,"md5":"UJrQnDNArum30QqGDNqQ0Q==","fsize":957914,"resto":0,"id":"FE8vc9aA","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"indoctrination","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

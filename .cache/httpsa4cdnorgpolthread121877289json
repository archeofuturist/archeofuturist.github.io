The hippies had the right intentions and were true rebels with causes, but their social politics and good intentions have been hijacked by the elite and warped into a mechanism for the establishment&#039;s further control. They used the hippies ideas and politics and promoted them to control the everyday man who became more and more sympathetic to the hippie-ism, eventually creating a social fabric that has allowed the elites to gain almost complete control of Western civ through the exploitation of these sympathies, the use of corporate and political self interest in the guise of social justice.<br><br>THE REAL ENEMY IS AND ALWAYS will be the establishment in whatever form they may be in, they will use their control and intrusion in media, politics, and entertainment to control the common man through manipulation and division. The hippies were not the bad guys, they were the good, it was those that hijacked their politics that were bad, and they are of the same breed that they hippies fought against that you now fight.","time":1492632517,"resto":121877289,"id":"BHYKK5BD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121888745,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:09:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121888040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121888040<\/a><br><br>Not as hard as i thought it would be, but i spent the whole time purposely avoiding thinking too much about it.

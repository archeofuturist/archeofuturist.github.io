The nerve endings and specialized structures like the frenulum are gone for good, at least until further breakthroughs in medical technology, but if you&#039;re fortunate you still have at least a partial frenulum remnant left behind.<br><br>It&#039;s a long, slow process- it takes years of tugging. But I cannot recommend it enough- it&#039;s been literally life changing for me, sex easily feels 10 times better than when I started. It&#039;s the fucking shit, every cut man will benefit from growing more excess skin. Start immediately.<br><br>Growing skin cells is actually not all that difficult- when surgeons need to grow extra skin to be used in a skin graf (for example, when someone has suffered from sever burns) they&#039;ll sometimes implant and gradually expand a saline balloon under the skin to grow additional tissue. This is basically jensamw<br>concept- by applying heavy tension to the scar line in your penis you can cause the growth of skin cells and mucosal tissue (the redder, more sensitive skin that would have made up the inside of the foreskin). You create microtears in the tissue that the cells are forced to &quot;heal&quot; via mitosis. It&#039;s real, permanent tissue growth. <br><br>You can search around and check on the foreskin regeneration subeeddit for more info- people will recommend devices but you absolutely don&#039;t need one- doing it by hand works perfectly fine and might actually be better.","time":1492908526,"resto":122353424,"id":"bmax7Yhu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

And its good bait for next election again. This country doesn&#039;t innovate anymore or look to solve our problems ourselves. We&#039;d rather import a new middle class then help rebuild it here. So never expect this government to care about anything but issues that will get them votes. A new port in Halifax? Yeah right like you said that takes political will and somebody willing to fight for it.","time":1490298094,"resto":117948241,"id":"YKhAXgSy","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117973147,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)15:44:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117971166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117971166<\/a><br>Your point is mute, if Canada legalized, it wouldn&#039;t be for the benefit of the people, it would be completely government made. That means sole possession, distribution, taxation, and regulation through enforcement. So your tax money pays government employees to grow sell and ticket you for not doing it right while &quot;maintaining quality and proper service&quot;. If you smoke within 2 days of driving or work you get a ticket. Employers will have a machine at the door to check because WCB won&#039;t do claims if the employer can&#039;t guarantee safety. Sounds like Ontario Hydro to me. <br>And you want that eh? Get redpilled cause your gonna tell the youngsters about the days you could get a bag for 40 on almost every corner.","time":1490298251,"resto":117948241,"id":"K7Yc6523","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

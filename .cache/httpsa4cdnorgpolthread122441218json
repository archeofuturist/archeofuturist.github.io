So far, there hasn&#039;t been any indication that Trump is on board with any of it. If anything, he is following the Bill Clinton playbook of missile diplomacy which is more of a message. Clinton didn&#039;t really cause any change because of his missiles, and I don&#039;t think Trump&#039;s will either.

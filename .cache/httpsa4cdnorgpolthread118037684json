But if I had to be honest my answer to this question would also probably still be the alien.<br><br>What kind of fucked up person says this? Why does this thought horrify us? Let\u2019s be brutally honest with ourselves. Just be as purely and simply objective as we can, just to see where this leads.<br><br>Obviously, Liara (which is the alien\u2019s name) is a fictional character. I bet you can think of many people who would immediately be upset or offended by the idea that a fictional representation of a woman would be more attractive to men than any real woman. It\u2019s very understandable.<br><br>But Liara is also an alien woman. Another species of animal. And obviously, many people find the idea of sex with another animal grotesque and disgusting. No matter what your opinion on bestiality is, you would think it obvious that most people don\u2019t like it.<br><br>So let\u2019s go deeper and ask ourselves another question we\u2019re afraid to answer; why do we find bestiality grotestque and disgusting?<br><br>What kind of person, in real life, asks this question expecting a serious answer? Some furry fucking faggot? Most would react to this question with outraged disgust. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong!\u201d Yes, it is! Very obviously! This word pops up again.<br><br>The answer to the question \u201cwhy is bestiality disgusting?\u201d is one so obvious that it doesn\u2019t even merit a response. But if you had to give a response, what would it be? If it\u2019s so obvious, what is it? <br><br>No, I\u2019m not trying to say I like fucking animals, I\u2019m not at all trying to say I think it\u2019s right or good or even possible.

You can imagine people just refusing to even answer at this point, and ask you stop saying it. <br><br>Obviously, an animal has no concept of consent. Bestiality brings thoughts like \u2018abuse\u2019 to our minds. Animals being physically and psychologically damaged. This is very obviously, a sickening thought to almost all of us. Why? Why is harming animals sickening to us?<br><br>Holy shit, who the FUCK ASKS THIS? <br><br>Yes! Who does ask this question!? Have you ever had to actually answer it before? Have you even asked yourself? This is probably the first time this question has even occurred to you. It\u2019s a very upsetting thought, I know, I feel it too. Let\u2019s stop here for now and get back to Liara and male heterosexuality in general.<br><br>Obviously, to most blokes playing the game (and they were mostly blokes) the fact that Liara is more removed from human biology than real actual animals didn\u2019t really occur to them.

How do you feel about this? If you, as a woman, notice the group you identify with is being slightly screwed on the cock market by transwomen? If you\u2019re a feminist and you\u2019re still somehow reading this filth, you should be overjoyed. This proves that men in general don\u2019t really have quite as big a problem with having sex with transwomen as you\u2019d originally assumed because you were too busy being offended to think.<br><br>This was my opening sentence; <br><br>\u201cIf we were being completely honest, most human males would rather fuck the blue alien from Mass Effect than a trans woman.\u201d <br><br>Imagine how you felt when you first read this, you may have found it amusing, you definitely would have thought it something you wouldn\u2019t say in public. People have already gotten away with saying that this fact PROVES that there is \u201ctransmisogyny\u201d in our society and that further drastic action must be taken to prevent this from spreading further. It\u2019s nothing but crass hate speech.<br><br>And it is, I agree. But we were just agreeing that there are transwomen that are found attractive by more men than actual women are. So can \u201ctransmisogyny\u201d really be the problem if transwomen are outcompeting several cisgender women on the aforementioned cock market? <br><br><br>\u201cTransmisogyny shows itself in different ways, transwomen are murdered by their cishetero partners at a high rate etc\u201d Yeah fine, I don\u2019t disagree but that\u2019s not answering the question. The answer to the question \u201cdoes Liara\u2019s greater attractiveness to men than trans women prove transmisogyny?\u201d is still \u201cno\u201d, and we only found this out because we had the courage to ask ourselves some pretty fucked up things.","filename":"ufknw0t","ext":".png","w":364,"h":302,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":103,"tim":1490328556078,"time":1490328556,"md5":"3lkyIMrkNnR4WoPTAFg7XQ==","fsize":133496,"resto":118037684,"id":"LFMy9Wlu","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118038288,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)00:10:40","name":"Presumable Faggot","com":"<a href=\"#p118037684\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118037684<\/a><br>5\/ I guess 5<br>None of this would have been possible if we stopped because we were offended, and began blowharding about how \u201cproblematic\u201d all this talk is. It certainly is problematic, so with that in mind, why did we stop talking about it? By talking about it for this long we actually found that the initial assumption was wrong, because we judged it based on how we felt rather that what we could know. If we\u2019re offended first we\u2019ll never know the facts.<br><br>And to continue in the vein of brutal honesty, it\u2019s not just social justice warriors who do this (refusing to answer questions they find too insulting). They probably do it a lot more than most people but that\u2019s beside the point. Even people who claim to be free of any religion or ideology have questions they\u2019re afraid to answer.

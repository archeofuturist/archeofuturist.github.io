Women have characteristics that people perceive as diminishing their authority and leadership. They are shorter, physically smaller, narrower shoulders, have higher pitched voices. There is less inhibition to interrupt them. Their words are disregarded more, and reckoned to carry less weight than a man&#039;s. None of this is wrong or bad, it&#039;s just human nature. Some of this nature can be seen in more primitive creatures. The big monkey has a bonus to leadership and more often than not, will lead the troop. Apparently this has helped humans survive and succeed. The dominant male nature is part of that success and so is the subordinate female nature. Someone has to take the lead or have the final say in a family and generally it&#039;s the man. The tendency of women to be conformist or let&#039;s say, highly malleable makes them better wives and steers them to roles where they are followers, not leaders. It&#039;s also why they are extra susceptible to advertising and propaganda. Add to this the fact that their instincts are disastrous when applied to the scale of a nation and it&#039;s clear they shouldn&#039;t vote. The right unit of democratic participation isn&#039;t the individual, anyway. It should be one vote per family. Men and women shape each other&#039;s thinking (asymmetrically of course) and out of this interplay, decisions get made.","time":1492186005,"resto":121070113,"id":"m\/Nfe\/TN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121077485,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:09:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121076767\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121076767<\/a><br>No she&#039;s not.

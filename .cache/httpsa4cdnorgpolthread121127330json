The way I see it there is one of two options.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Option 1: Trump has been masterminding everyone this entire time, and the recent attacks on Syria and MOAB drop on Afghanistan have been purely shows of US military might all in an effort to retake ground lost during the Obama administration. Show that America really is the big swinging dick she says she is. Kabuki theatre.<\/span><br>OR...<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Option 2: His recent departures from campaign promises have been planned far in advance. Trump never planned on sticking to his original promises and is instead a Neoconservative at heart masquerading as the man who was supposed to &quot;Make America Great Again&quot;. <\/span><br><br>Either way it seems Trump may actually be playing 4D chess, just not in the way many of us hoped he would. At this stage it is almost impossible to tell what will happen next as we really don&#039;t know what the end goal is.<br><br>I know everyone hates the 4D chess meme but does \/pol\/ think its a possibility still?","filename":"4 d chess","ext":".jpg","w":3189,"h":2362,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":185,"tim":1492210269191,"time":1492210269,"md5":"Dq9H8TFy9w0H2GqW7VWTpA==","fsize":657627,"resto":0,"id":"q0Mkepz0","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"4d-chess","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":2,"unique_ips":5},{"no":121128766,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:02:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"What good is having the biggest dick in the history of the world(USA military), and not letting it hang...option 1","time":1492210958,"resto":121127330,"id":"rdMCaxWK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121129500,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:08:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121127330\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121127330<\/a><br>We are hitting dimensions of chess that shouldn&#039;t even be possible!","filename":"1447471128643","ext":".gif","w":388,"h":218,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492211323295,"time":1492211323,"md5":"TqXnVbitLnHbW+bE1BywlQ==","fsize":2295602,"resto":121127330,"id":"gsVGjHuI","country":"SK","country_name":"Slovakia"},{"no":121129739,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:10:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"I miss election memes sometimes","filename":"1478894764153","ext":".jpg","w":2560,"h":1440,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492211439337,"time":1492211439,"md5":"PAvcXPKmlenJG7lcDfJLhA==","fsize":1402155,"resto":121127330,"id":"qHlcMJgX","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121130002,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:13:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;condensing his worldview into two opposing black and white interpretations of his leader&#039;s intentions based purely on speculation<\/span><br>this is why no one likes &#039;debating&#039; you anon","time":1492211581,"resto":121127330,"id":"1um77Jj1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

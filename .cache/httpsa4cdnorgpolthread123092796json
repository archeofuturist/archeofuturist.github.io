We have esthetics.

However, there is equally well no reason not to believe in something. They are both equally irrational, but the former is more than a bit silly nevertheless, just as is actually acting as if the Universe were not a causal place is silly.<\/span><br><br>I therefore choose to believe that the Universe is not a purposeless place.<br>The Axiom of Deity<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; One can choose to believe in God (irrationally). One can choose to believe that there is no God (irrationally). One can choose to believe that we don&#039;t know if there is or isn&#039;t a God (true but pointless). These are the only choices that seem to be available, at least before one starts to modify one&#039;s irrational selection with equally arbitrary attributes of the Deity one may or may not choose to believe in.

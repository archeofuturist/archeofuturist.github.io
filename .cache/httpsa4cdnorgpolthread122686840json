In 1987 soviet rocket fuses exploded during a fire at FBI headquarters in DC, after that the ATF ordered federal officials across the US to stop this practice. the Tulsa World reported in April 1990 that IRS headquarters in Tulsa was robbed, the loot contained ordinance and thousands of rounds of ammunition. it is suspicious that the government rushed to destroy the entire building as they did at waco, before independant tests could be conducted by outside experts. Government wouldn&#039;t even allow Mcveigh&#039;s lawyer to take scrapings from various areas of the building, the damaged columns had chemical traces which would identify the explosives used in the bombing","time":1493094467,"resto":122686840,"id":"VLqsXUVt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122692137,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:29:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Watched that Netflix docu on him last night, they tried to connect unrelated white-nationalist events to him, is that a new thing or have they always done that?

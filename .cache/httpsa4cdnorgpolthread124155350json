In a lot of those places labour has a lot of seats to potentially lose and not that many seats that they could gain so that would be huge.","time":1493955940,"resto":124155350,"id":"CwIWr40c","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124159525,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:45:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124158716\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124158716<\/a><br>our queen was fucking hot wtf","time":1493955941,"resto":124155350,"id":"Tm7O6Pp4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124159578,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:46:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124159341\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124159341<\/a><br><br>I&#039;ve been on the same amount of time and had the conversation about 3 times","time":1493955974,"resto":124155350,"id":"pKwc+NI0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124159587,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:46:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124159092\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124159092<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;charge them the net 180 billion<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;offer the BMW manufacturers a deal they can&#039;t refuse if they set up shop in the UK<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;honour none of their stupid as fuck &quot;taxes&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;leave next week because why not<\/span><br><br>They have no idea how compromise works, and it&#039;s clear at this point that they don&#039;t want one. <br><br>So let&#039;s not give them one.","time":1493955978,"resto":124155350,"id":"lTvTV0B4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124159605,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:46:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124158535\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124158535<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124159055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124159055<\/a><br>I&#039;m a huge fan of beady Mosley.

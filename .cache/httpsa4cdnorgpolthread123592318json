I only think it was more comfy in the early 00s because network security at that time was an absolute joke and hacking was extremely easy (relative to today).

Cracking a network key literally took minutes. After WPA and beyond was widely implemented that was no longer the case. Do you have any fucking idea how hilarious it was drop grotesque files onto the neighbors desktops that weren&#039;t liked? Printing off 100 pages of gay porn on someone&#039;s printer as they were standing in front of it!?

As did the sudden (and understandable) highlight on all things Muslim for the public.<br><br>A lot of people were too scared to let their children play out in the street until dark, and so once-bustling neighborhoods became lifeless during (and after) school hours. Once upon a time, a parent could tell their child to be back before dark and have a reasonable assumption that their child would come home unmolested.

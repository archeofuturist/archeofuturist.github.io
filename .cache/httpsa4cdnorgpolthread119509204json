Because of the Dunbar number, communism would never work when applied. It&#039;s pretty obvious though with what we are seeing right now that capitalism doesn&#039;t work long term, either. The elite eventually become too powerful and literally write a nations laws so they can just keep robbing the taxpayers. <br><br>Capitalism also won&#039;t work long term because it runs on a premise of unlimited growth; or else it collapses. Unfortunately for Western civilization, the world does indeed have very limited resources and we have been fooling ourselves about what is sustainable for a long time. The age of cheap oil has brainwashed America and other first world nations into believing the quality of life that we currently have can go on forever, and it cannot. <br><br>A different socioeconomic system is needed to advance humanity, and it is neither communism or capitalism.","time":1491337672,"resto":119509204,"id":"8qsDzHem","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119512093,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:30:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119511500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119511500<\/a><br>if only that where true..","time":1491337840,"resto":119509204,"id":"p3mlBlO9","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119512619,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:34:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119509398\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119509398<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119511003\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119511003<\/a><br>it&#039;s not the the communists that starve its the poor bastards forced to live in the hell they create that starve<br><br><a href=\"#p119511787\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119511787<\/a><br>this, good post.","filename":"communism","ext":".jpg","w":706,"h":960,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491338099095,"time":1491338099,"md5":"mVaCTzp2y+Yqj3F4Wy8ufw==","fsize":101269,"resto":119509204,"id":"MnGPr0Fn","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119512755,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:36:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119509204\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119509204<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;good of it<\/span><br><br>When commies come in power, they execute all those academia cocksuckers that were shilling for it.

Get on board with how economics work. Keynesians, Austrians, and Neo-classicals are all partly right but mostly wrong. <br><br>What am I saying in that single sentence? The [post-] Keynesian consensus has been that moderate long term inflation and high public spending are both key to sustained economic prosperity. There is no evidence for any of this, it&#039;s just assumed; in fact, no studies have borne out any correlations which sustain it, nor could any analysis of the historical record fair better. In reality, GDP growth tracks better with resource access, demographic growth, political institutions (i.e. corruption, efficiency), and to a decent degree freedom. The thing with resource access is that it can be had now through global trade just about as well as through domestic production, so small countries with relatively sparse resources aren&#039;t hurt all that much as compared with early modern times when transaction costs were much higher.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic unrelated<\/span>","filename":"445979","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1493510804438,"time":1493510804,"md5":"Q8Z85u0\/UW1yHAQ9nglvTQ==","fsize":57344,"resto":123397751,"id":"ee9g95UW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123404686,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)20:08:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123402600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123402600<\/a><br>you&#039;re delusional if you think there will be a mass migration of Americans to Europe.

Anyone see a problem there? Well, for one thing, the net take of these immigrants is off the charts; most of them are on benefits for large portions of their lives, if not all of it, no matter which country you go to - US, Canada, Britain, Germany, Sweden, Netherlands, France, etc. - and they pay comparatively little back into public troughs. <br><br>Now there&#039;s going to be a bigger push probably in the next few years for language, job training, and education programs that are at once cheap and allegedly effective for training the now tens of millions of migrants living in Western countries. Problem is that these programs will be full of graft and corruption. You&#039;re going to have Arabic teachers and translators hired for relatively good pay who fuck off for various reasons, and the same goes down the line. <br><br>Imagine the average Western composite citizen commands a median wage of about $45,000 usually from about age 26-30 until retirement and takes perhaps two to four years of various benefits before retiring around age 65 or 67, at which point they draw on the state pension. Contrast that with the &quot;&quot;New European&quot;&quot; who basically takes benefits for most of their life, also draws from the state pension at 65, and you&#039;re lucky if they earn maybe somewhere between one to three times the median wage and much of it is informal, untaxed work such as food stands and crime.","time":1493511457,"resto":123397751,"id":"ee9g95UW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123406836,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)20:22:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123406153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123406153<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; and you&#039;re lucky if they earn maybe somewhere between one to three times the median wage and much of it is informal, untaxed work such as food stands and crime.<\/span><br><br>What I mean here is that this represents their earnings over their entire lifetime as well.

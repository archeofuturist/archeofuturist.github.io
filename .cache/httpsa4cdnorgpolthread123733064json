Old problems included finding food, shelter, clothing, and a viable mate. Real struggles had to do with war, violence, poverty, and natural disasters.<br><br>The problems of our generation will be on another level: less physical and practical and more existential and philosophical. Instead of struggling for food, shelter, and clothing, we will strive for purpose, fulfillment, and understanding. And when we find that there is no intrinsic purpose in the world, we will settle for our instincts, which are programmed to be pleasure-seeking. That&#039;s why drug use will increase, alcoholism, hedonism, sexual promiscuity, loneliness, and nihilism will thrive. These problems are much harder to solve than hunger, thirst, or poverty. <br><br>Brace yourselves...the world is getting darker because we don&#039;t have any easily-understood problems anymore. We are creating modern problems by listening to our primitive instincts.","time":1493703899,"resto":123733064,"id":"J+u\/lAN1","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123733850,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:46:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"All of those things are going to kill us.

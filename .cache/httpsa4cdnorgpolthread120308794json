The Syrian Network for Human Rights (SNHR), found Isis killed 119 civilians in Syria in March, including 19 children and 7 women, with Russian forces believed to have killed 224 civilians in the same month, including 51 children and 42 women. The SNHR found the international coalition forces, led by the US, killed 260 civilians, including 70 children and 34 women.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the same month, reports of civilian deaths from US air strikes across Syria and Iraq soared to an all-time high, according to Airwars, a British monitoring group, which found there were 1,472 casualties linked to US air strikes in March. While on the campaign trail in 2015, Donald Trump pledged to \u201cbomb the s**t\u201d out of Isis if he became President, and coalition warplanes have dramatically increased their strikes against Isis in both Mosul and Raqqa, while the number of US troops on the ground has also increased. At the same time, Russia has scaled down its campaign following a partial ceasefire in December 2016.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/archive.fo\/6b32C<br><br>post &gt;yfw America is officially worse than ISIS","filename":"ph0gy9ujik","ext":".png","w":696,"h":671,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":241,"tim":1491759449737,"time":1491759449,"md5":"BlkCnbRDLb+0OTx5icIOqA==","fsize":108177,"resto":0,"id":"DnXaScTR","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"us-zog-military-confirmed-for-worse-than-isis","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":120309449,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)13:42:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1491759776,"resto":120308794,"id":"DnXaScTR","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]}

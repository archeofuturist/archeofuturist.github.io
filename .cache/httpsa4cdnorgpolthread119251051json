It claims the effect of this is two-fold. Firstly in giving everyone a &#039;release&#039; for their aggression and criminal tendencies once per year the crime rate is significantly reduced, of which I am very sceptical. Secondly it&#039;s used as a means of population control, especially among the lowest classes of society; those usually unemployed and on welfare. It&#039;s argued that targeting this socio-economic group with the purge helps to reduce government spending by reducing the overall reliance of the population on social programs.<br><br>Obviously there are issues with such an undertaking, namely the cost incurred through the inevitable damage to infrastructure and the effects on the economic markets that such an event would create. <br><br>So what are your thoughts, could such a thing even be implemented in the first place and would it be effective if it was implemented?","filename":"the-purge-3-promo-credit-universal-pictures","ext":".jpg","w":710,"h":517,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":182,"tim":1491169947846,"time":1491169947,"md5":"QBq8v6sfXxh+hEnRFdsYxQ==","fsize":40356,"resto":0,"id":"RPL0ZT29","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-purge","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119251657,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)17:58:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"No. It would only help the rich who have the means to defend their shit.

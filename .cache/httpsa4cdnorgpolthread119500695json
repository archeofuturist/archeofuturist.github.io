He taught us that we have to sacrifice ourselves, so others can live in peace. Of course, Jews didn&#039;t wanted this. Their Messiah would said something like: &quot;You are God&#039;s chosen people, you deserve everything, so you can live like kings amongst others. And those, who oppose worshipping, and who are against the self-sacrification for the better of you, the true people of God, will be banished to hell.&quot; So they curcifixed him, the true Messiah, the true son of God, but his prophecies were fulfilled, and it can&#039;t be undone. <br>Hitler wasn&#039;t the son of God, he wasn&#039;t the Messiah. He HAD to do something to help his own people, to lead them as a leader should. We will know, when the true Messiah arrives for the second time, and this time hasn&#039;t come yet. The only thing we can do is to efend ourselves from those, who are against the true teachings of God. We can&#039;t kill them for what they are, but we can defend ourselves, if they want to kill us, for what we are. You can&#039;t expect others to live like you, but you can fight against those, who expects you to live how they want you to live.","time":1491333414,"resto":119500695,"id":"ood\/eAxe","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":119505277,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:29:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119501273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119501273<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119503636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119503636<\/a><br><br>I&#039;m not interested in (them).

It cannot be separated. Orthodox Christianity is the Church in Acts, set up by Christ through His Apostles. Nothing new, nothing innovative. Ecumenical Councils did not add, rather, they clarified Church Doctrine in the face of heresies.. if you want to know fully what an Orthodox Christian believes, simple read the Nicene Creed. <br><br>Those that left (Roman Catholics, Old Calendarosts, Old Believers, etc) are not in Communion with Him through their own actions, as they left Christ&#039;s Church He left for us, the One Church that the gates of He&#039;ll shall not prevail against. They are free and encouraged to return at any time. Those that left added innovations, subtracted Doctrine, and\/or injected their own personal interpretation of Scripture thus diluting further Christian teachings, are not considered &quot;the fullness of the Faith&quot; as Orthodoxy is. They may accept Christ as Savior, but Christ taught us Faith alone does not save, nor is &quot;instant Salvation&quot; real.. Salvation is a journey in this life and the next up until we are all Judges by Him on that Day - read the Sowers Tale for that. Likewise, the Sacraments are not symbolic, as that is a Gnostic (modern Protestant) heresy. Christ said you must be Baptized of water and Spirit, not one, not the other, not of the heart, but just as He said. This was said to Paul, the Ethiopian, and the Roman Legionary. Baptism is three full immersions in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (Baptizo is Greek for immersion). Anything less won&#039;t do.<br><br>That said, we are not arrogant to say only we have the Holy Spirit, as we know the Holy Spirit works through all. We know we are filled with Him, but we cannot say where He isn&#039;t. <br>Regarding Muslims, Unitarians, Mormons, and all those that deny Christ, there is no Salvation for them per Christ&#039;s own Word - they Deny the Father in doing so, as they have denied the Son.","filename":"FB_IMG_1487771071945","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":663,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491339588147,"time":1491339588,"md5":"q27za8Evu6QToOjck5uFzQ==","fsize":89698,"resto":119500695,"id":"s+42rtYb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119515686,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:00:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119514673\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119514673<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;People won&#039;t return to conventional religions en masse.<\/span><br>sure they will, there&#039;s plenty of precedent<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;some great event has to depose one of the current major religions in order to create room for the birth of a NeoChristian religion<\/span><br>yeah, that&#039;s written about in revelation chapter 17","filename":"Whore","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":695,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1491339610683,"time":1491339610,"md5":"PH4Y6RQvpkUh+\/XwslhtvA==","fsize":254175,"resto":119500695,"id":"ZYHidnOm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119515825,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:01:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119514176\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119514176<\/a><br>I must have mis-read this:<br><a href=\"#p119508742\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119508742<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The reason for this is the emphasis that has been put on Jesus&#039; Divinity.<\/span>","time":1491339676,"resto":119500695,"id":"s+42rtYb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119516474,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:06:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119515825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119515825<\/a><br><br>yeah I think there has been an overemphasis on his Divinity.

(&quot;For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who was tempted in every way that we are, yet was without sin. 16Let us then approach the throne of grace with confidence, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.&quot; Hebrews 4:16 &quot;No man cometh to the father but by me&quot;, etc)<\/span><br>That&#039;s mistaken. We don&#039;t pray to the Holy Virgin Mary to act between us and God. What we do, as the Apostles did and early church did, is ask them to pray for on our behalf, just as you would ask your family to keep you in their prayers. This is what we mean when we pray for the intercession of the Virgin Mary or the Saints. Would you not ask a math whiz for their help on an exam? Same here, you&#039;re asking for the intercession of them on your behalf. You still pray to God, obviously. Your concern is a misunderstanding of early Protestantism because all they had to go off of was the warped and corrupted Roman Catholic institution.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But even aside from that, the biggest glaring hole is the fact that you believe Mary was an eternal virgin when the bible itself speaks of Jesus&#039; siblings?<\/span><br><br>We don&#039;t believe that. The Virgin Mary was born human and is Holy as she could have dinner but did her very best to live by the Law, and did, hence God choosing her. Roman Catholicism came up with the heresy of &quot;Immaculate Conception&quot; far after they left the Church. <br>Second, Christ doesn&#039;t have siblings. This mistaken belief is brought from a lack of understanding of Greek, which the MR was first written in. In Greek, &quot;brothers&quot; was used for close friends, groups, etc, and not strictly &quot;blood-brothers&quot; as englush would have it. Again, the Early Church (Orthodox) never understood Scripture in that way. <br>Hope this helps. Dig deeper friend, return to the Church.","filename":"FB_IMG_1482922727360","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":476,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1491348387544,"time":1491348387,"md5":"0RbmVQgzW\/JcEokcx2D8VA==","fsize":34171,"resto":119500695,"id":"s+42rtYb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119533746,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:28:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119532345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119532345<\/a><br><br>from my own experience it didn&#039;t happen overnight although it did begin with a sudden realisation I am going to die, during the night as it happened.

The gospels are full people who are believers themselves, or soon will be, but still doubt. The disciples consistently express a mixture of both belief and disbelief: they see the miracles of and teachings of Jesus and even preach, teach, cast out demons, and heal the sick themselves in his name; however, they all doubt his claims and predictions, and fail to identify him as the Son of God, except for Peter, to whom it was revealed directly from God the Father according to Jesus. After the resurrection, the gospels say the disciples and other followers doubted even after seeing Jesus alive. <br><br>For the most part you only have the gospels and the rest of the new testament as a witness to you of the gospel of Jesus Christ but the followers of Jesus in his own time actually saw and experienced the teachings, miracles, resurrection, and ascension but still expressed the same hesitancy and confusion that you do! Perhaps this is why Jesus said, \u201cHave you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.\u201d<br><br>Consider the words of St. Paul: &quot;For by grace are you saved, through faith, and this is not from yourself; it is the gift of God, not of works, so that no one should boast in himself.&quot; (Letter to the Ephesians, chapter 2). Also, &quot;For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned.&quot; (Letter to the Romans, chapter 12)<br><br>Continue to read the scriptures and ask the Almighty to strengthen your faith. <br><br>And before you despair ask yourself: where did the desire to believe the gospel come from in itself, whereas others not only do not believe but rarely express any desire to? It is the gospel.

But the Evangelicals, with their dwarfed notion of &quot;salvation&quot; would have everyone stand before God, pardoned yet still full of passions, damaged and compelled and damaging others with the presence and power of sins still unhealed in themselves; facing the Pure and Loving God with souls full of corruption and infirmity.","time":1491353848,"resto":119500695,"id":"s+42rtYb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119543784,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)20:58:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119542331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119542331<\/a><br><br>10 Million Muslims in Europe gradually being painted into a corner, relentlessly pursued in alternative media and baited into violent acts pitifully ineffective but blown up in the media to grand proportions every time.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Islam is not a threat<\/span><br><br>Meanwhile Christians are still arguing over how many angels can dance on a pin head.","filename":"Jesus-facepalm-300x199","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":199,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1491353907702,"time":1491353907,"md5":"9aDPm0d0nQYliKA9Bd6Pbw==","fsize":14056,"resto":119500695,"id":"+2FOtHI\/","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119543812,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)20:58:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119500695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119500695<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lived<\/span><br>lives<br>ftfy","time":1491353922,"resto":119500695,"id":"pEhL7HIO","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119543834,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)20:58:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119543688\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119543688<\/a><br>Those of us who were lovers of Christ before we encountered the Church \u2014 we who with al our hearts obeyed and served the living God as we had been taught Him \u2014 we were not rebels against Orthodoxy, we did not choose to reject the Faith, and we trusted Christ our Lord to make us acceptable to himself.

The Apostles also had disciples of their own, one of whom we still have works from - Polycarp. Through them, we have a direct succession from the Apostles. This is all what is Church Tradition, literally the Orthodox Church. Differences in teachings, such as those of Arius, Gnostics, Iconoclasts, Monophysites, etc, were defended against through the centuries ultimately via the first 7 Ecumenical Councils, which have Biblical precedent in Acts (Council of Jerusalem). These didn&#039;t so much constrain Christianity as answer the heresies mentioned and clarify.. hence the Nicene Creed, for example. Orthodoxy tries to keep the &quot;aperture&quot; of Theology as open as it can without allowing heresy, so to say. Conversely, Protestants narrow the aperture as much as they can dogmatically so that their interpretation is the only correct one.","time":1491356026,"resto":119500695,"id":"s+42rtYb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119549160,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:49:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119545017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119545017<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;where?

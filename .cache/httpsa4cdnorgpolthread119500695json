He taught us that we have to sacrifice ourselves, so others can live in peace. Of course, Jews didn&#039;t wanted this. Their Messiah would said something like: &quot;You are God&#039;s chosen people, you deserve everything, so you can live like kings amongst others. And those, who oppose worshipping, and who are against the self-sacrification for the better of you, the true people of God, will be banished to hell.&quot; So they curcifixed him, the true Messiah, the true son of God, but his prophecies were fulfilled, and it can&#039;t be undone. <br>Hitler wasn&#039;t the son of God, he wasn&#039;t the Messiah. He HAD to do something to help his own people, to lead them as a leader should. We will know, when the true Messiah arrives for the second time, and this time hasn&#039;t come yet. The only thing we can do is to efend ourselves from those, who are against the true teachings of God. We can&#039;t kill them for what they are, but we can defend ourselves, if they want to kill us, for what we are. You can&#039;t expect others to live like you, but you can fight against those, who expects you to live how they want you to live.","time":1491333414,"resto":119500695,"id":"ood\/eAxe","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":119505277,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:29:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119501273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119501273<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119503636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119503636<\/a><br><br>I&#039;m not interested in (them).

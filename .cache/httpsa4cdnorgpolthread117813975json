White girls want nothing to do with you because you treat women like shit, Muslim girls want nothing to do with you because they are either involved in a prearranged marriage or as is very often the case abandoning Islam, sheltered by the protection western societies have created and aware of how abusive muslim men are to their women. So you basically have 2-3 muslims guys for every muslim woman which again is prearranged marriages, sure there is a few fucking dumb as shit white girls that date these guys but they are very few and far between. So in other words you&#039;re pussy starved, most prostitutes won&#039;t even take your money because your so fucking vile. <br><br>On top of you they live in a country that attacked Islamic countries over the past 15 years. Along comes the salafi Islam. Its fundamental as fuck so your Grandparents are proud they like that you&#039;re growing full beards even going so far as to dye it with henna like a good muslim grandson. You&#039;re taught that your parents are practically kaffir because they&#039;re not radical enough, so any appeals by them to drop this persecuation complex will go unheard.<br><br>The vast majority of foiled terrorist attacks are by young often unmarried men, 20-40 year olds that are always born and raised in Britain and rarely speak another language.","time":1490235227,"resto":117813975,"id":"IL39ifMH","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

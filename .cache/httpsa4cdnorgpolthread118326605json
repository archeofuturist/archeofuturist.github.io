Less-than-lethal weapons like weighted gloves, flag poles, shields, and wooden sticks are more appropriate.<br><br>2) Stay in a group.<br>Make sure you know where your buddies are at all times. If there\u2019s more than five of you, divide into squads. Never go off on your own for any reason, antifa will target loners and strays.<br><br>3) Stand your ground.<br><br>Running is a surefire way of violating rule 2 \u2013 communication breaks down, squad members get separated, confusion takes over. Retreating from an area should be done in a calm manner and as a group.<br><br>4) Uniformity.<br>This becomes more important the larger the group is, becoming mandatory at the platoon-size level. Uniforms should not be head-to-toe get-ups but simple pieces that can signal squad-mates as friendlies. They should also be easily concealable. Matching face coverings, t-shirts, patches, or headgear are ideal.<br><br>5) Self-defense.<br>Demonstrations are all about optics, any direct action taken against antifa should be in self-defense. Do not throw a punch unless you are defending yourself or others. If direct action is your goal, antifa can easily be provoked.<br><br>6) Situational awareness.<br>Safety squad attire is often not too different from antifa attire. Be aware of your surroundings and keep in mind that police may not distinguish you from antifa.<br><br>7) Treating gas attacks.<br>See guide below.<br><br><br>8) Intimidation.<br>Antifa will film you on their phones as an intimidation tactic \u2013 feel free to return the favor. Since any interactions with antifa will likely be recorded, refrain from fascistic or racist rhetoric, no matter how deserving. It could mean the difference between self-defense and hate crime.","filename":"323e4b17034a71e280d7314c4a5a3fd2637b73936f5176a46aa4e78e6842c9d7","ext":".png","w":1242,"h":2208,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490507454218,"time":1490507454,"md5":"RZ9ZLAS6695HgrF\/5VMMpQ==","fsize":1295739,"resto":0,"id":"G8GvgUSt","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"right-wing-safety-squads","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":3,"unique_ips":6},{"no":118326683,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:51:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118326605\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118326605<\/a><br><br>9) Anonymity.<br>Have something that can easily be used to cover your face at a moment\u2019s notice. Gaiters, tube masks, and scarves are ideal for this purpose. If arrested, comply, but demand a lawyer immediately. Use a pseudonym when interacting with civilians. Remember that any interactions with media representatives will likely be edited against you.<br><br>10) Comfortable gear.<br>You will likely be physically engaged for most of the demonstration. Bring comfortable clothing, particularly comfortable footwear. You don\u2019t want to be too cold, too hot, or otherwise uncomfortable \u2013 it\u2019s a distraction.<br><br><br>Treating the Effects of Tear Gas<br><br>Using a water bottle with a squirt cap, rinse out the person\u2019s eyes. Start rinsing from the interior corner (by the nose), and work your way out. The person\u2019s head should be tilted back and towards the side being rinsed. If necessary, hold the person\u2019s eye open. This will temporarily increase the pain but will help in the long run. Regular water can be used, but a mixture of half water and half Maalox (or generic equivalents) is ideal. <br><br>If you are treating somebody, either wear latex gloves or ensure that your hands are washed both before and after. Tear gas sticks to clothing and skin.<br><br>If you are the one being treated, don\u2019t panic. <br>Hyperventilating will make your situation worse. Do not rub your eyes and try not to swallow. If you wear contacts, wash your hands before removing them or get somebody with clean hands to remove them for you. Wash your clothes and shower as soon as possible.","time":1490507506,"resto":118326605,"id":"G8GvgUSt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118327363,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:59:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bumping to help mobilize White America against Marxist murderers.","time":1490507970,"resto":118326605,"id":"5s8lRmML","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118327563,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)02:01:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Could be helpful to designate colors and number\/letters to units to help people find their groups if any chaos breaks out.","filename":"ce57139969b25c0ac0b4e4f8680278b1dc790ef8.jpg_1718483346","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":340,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490508103297,"time":1490508103,"md5":"heC0elcqC80kt\/+BNLsWwA==","fsize":32352,"resto":118326605,"id":"pR0IocTP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118327891,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)02:05:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"isn&#039;t this just a rehash of shit they themselves produced for their protests? <br><br>Its a start, but they also have a logistical tail you don&#039;t have access to.

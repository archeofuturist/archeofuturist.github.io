A body without a brain is dead...it&#039;s why getting shot in the head is an effective death sentence for all but you can theoretically take and repair a wound to every other part of your body with no direct change to your nature or personality.<br>A single brain cell isn&#039;t a human life in my book. Two isn&#039;t either. There is a critical mass of brain cell density and complexity that I consider a human life. The average adult has 100 billion brain cells in the brain so there&#039;s the approximate bar (within a certain number of standard deviations) that I consider a life because you can&#039;t have life without it but you CAN have life with it.<br>By process of elimination, that means the part of our body that gives us life, the galvanizes our body into motion is the brain.

It will shock us into changing. our export to import ratio has gone from 49 % to 69% in two years. And for the first time since independence our current account was net positive (+4.2% in 2015). Thats huge. The data for 2016 still isn&#039;t out but I think it&#039;s going to be above +7% GDP which puts us in the top 10 in the world.<br>http:\/\/www.tradingeconomics.com\/cro<wbr>atia\/current-account-to-gdp<br><br>We also get some EU gibs but that&#039;s not really that much at all. the biggest problem is of course people emigrating to germany and Ireland but as I said we needed that shock to get us to change and become competitive.The wages are finally starting to increase because of the emigrations and we are probably 2 years away from a 1000 euro average salary if this growth continues.","time":1492490280,"resto":121630675,"id":"mKWMRB7N","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":121639731,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:46:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121638872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121638872<\/a><br>Too much brain drain desu","time":1492490769,"resto":121630675,"id":"aQ3bjP\/B","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121640435,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:52:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121639731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121639731<\/a><br>absolutely agree...<br><br>But if we get our shit together we can use the Irish ind Israeli model of getting people to come back.

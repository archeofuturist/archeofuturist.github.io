First of all, progressive liberals have proposed gun control and preventing the mentally ill from owning guns. This is because the spree shooters and criminals are often perceived as being mentally ill and therefore mentally ill people should not own guns. The problem with this is how does a mentally ill person defend him or herself from an intruder in his home? Why aren&#039;t mentally ill people allowed to bear arms too if non mentally ill people are allowed to? It seems very unfair. What&#039;s even more unfair is the fact that most mentally ill people are not violent. Yes, that&#039;s actually surprising to hear right? Look it up. <br><br>The second problem is that banning guns in America would never work because there are too many guns already available and scattered about in the country. These guns were already purchased a long time ago and are now in the possession of many people.<br><br>How does one defend himself from an intruder in the house? Criminals are at times bold people who often don&#039;t care about killing others to get what they want. What if they obtain guns illegally via a black market and you being a citizen following the law, do not have a gun now because the law says you can&#039;t have one and so therefore you can&#039;t defend yourself when that time may just randomly come.","time":1491365396,"resto":119559342,"id":"R4YR851A","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119564889,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)00:10:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119564717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119564717<\/a><br>So that isn&#039;t a decline I see on the graph there?<br><br><a href=\"#p119564748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119564748<\/a><br>Oh sorry, that&#039;s right. \/pol\/ isn&#039;t for the discussion of politics anymore","time":1491365415,"resto":119559342,"id":"r2S0t5hF","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119564890,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)00:10:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119564565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119564565<\/a><br>No it didn&#039;t.

What is the point? All of their bullshit can be debunked in less than a minute. During ottoman occupation, bastards were integrated in TURKISH society. The lower castes of society did not interbreed, neither side even thought of mixing with a Greek or Turk. When Ottoman officials took young greek women to their harems they were taken away from their families and their children became turkish. Osman I&#039;s mother was Greek and he was one of the first ottoman emperors, which only goes on to show the massive intermixing of ottoman tribes with different ethnicities during their migrations to anatolia. Plus there is zero genetic evidence supporting any of Greek bastardization but there is plenty of proof that Turks retain barely 10% of their central asian dna, nothing like their ancestors.<br><br><a href=\"#p119472160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119472160<\/a><br>&quot;no resistance&quot;<br>LMAO","filename":"ypsilantis","ext":".jpg","w":558,"h":694,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491318520534,"time":1491318520,"md5":"sfz7R\/aWA73Z5DbpIuapdg==","fsize":54899,"resto":119455536,"id":"Vwpa2cNs","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":119478618,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)11:14:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119477862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119477862<\/a><br>it&#039;s well-known here that the Greek communists didn&#039;t have any serious resistance but those people don&#039;t want to admit it...they mostly think it&#039;s right-wing propaganda but when you tell them that foreign historians agree too, they find excuses that are even worse so their nonsense is easily put to rest...<br><br><a href=\"#p119478060\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119478060<\/a><br>butthurt commie detected","time":1491318846,"resto":119455536,"id":"RXsK1os2","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":119478648,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)11:14:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119476991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119476991<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Soldiers fare better than some peasants with bootleg SKS rifles<\/span><br><br>Do i really have to remind you who owns Kosovo now?","filename":"1489950567720","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":375,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491318864873,"time":1491318864,"md5":"5esxJlkvqrW4q5qLrofH1w==","fsize":2911986,"resto":119455536,"id":"oTvDbrQ1","country":"AL","country_name":"Albania"},{"no":119478687,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)11:14:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119474831\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119474831<\/a><br><br>This is not entirely correct.

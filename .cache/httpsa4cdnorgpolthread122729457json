He went to the fort of Narva at the age of ten. He joined the Order when he was about fifteen. In 1489 he was elected to marshal of the Order (Landmarschall), in 1491 he fought successfully against the city of Riga and was elected master in 1494. That same year Moscow closed down the Hanseatic office in Novgorod and imprisoned Hanseatic merchants (most of them were Livonians) there. Livonia was drifting into war with Muscovite Russia. After negotiations in 1498 failed, Plettenberg chose to prepare for pre-emptive attack against Pskov, which was then still a formally independent state, but under heavy influence from Moscow. In the war with Russia (1501-1503), Plettenberg showed himself to be a talented and skilled commander. His strength lay in his skillful use of heavy cavalry and artillery fire. With such tactics von Plettenberg won the Battle of the Siritsa River (August 1501), where an army of Livonian Confederation of 8,000 foot and 4,000 horse defeated about two times stronger army of Russians. During the winter of 1501\u20131502, the Russians harshly ravaged Eastern Livonia and many Livonian dignitaries wanted to make peace with Muscovy. But Plettenberg decided to continue the war and tried to conquer Pskov one more time. However, due to Moscow&#039;s strong support of Pskov, he was forced to retreat southwest from the city. On 13 September 1502 he won the Battle of Smolin (at Lake Smolin close to the village Palkino in Pskov Oblast) with his 5,000 men against about 12,000 Russians. The next day, 14 September, became the Victory Day in Livonia. In 1503 peace between Ivan III and Livonia on the terms of status quo ante bellum was concluded.<br> In the beginning of the year 1535 he died quite suddenly at the age of about 85 years","filename":"map","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":1982,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1493127668775,"time":1493127668,"md5":"epudnzJGW1e+\/jVkPT\/4oQ==","fsize":1060041,"resto":122729457,"id":"Nyud1Bxc","country":"LV","m_img":1,"country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":122734715,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)09:41:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122729457\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122729457<\/a><br>I only recognize adolf and vlad from that","time":1493127684,"resto":122729457,"id":"4M6kB8\/w","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":122734737,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)09:41:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122731406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122731406<\/a><br>I thought it was John &quot;Peda\u0142&quot; The Second.","time":1493127700,"resto":122729457,"id":"g+9cN+Ht","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":122734739,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)09:41:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122734515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122734515<\/a><br>Romans were italics.

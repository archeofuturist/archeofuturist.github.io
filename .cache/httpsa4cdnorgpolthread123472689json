You tend to get funneled into one, and without patrons or nobility to fund a lifetime of inquiry most have to get jobs. People are also very narrow minded from specialization and tend to be intimidated by learning multiple disciplines. See it a lot in Archaeology and it really hampers research, the best archaeologists are competent geologists, chemists, biologists and historians but few ever even attempt to broaden further than one discipline.","time":1493555590,"resto":123472689,"id":"SpdWWLyX","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123473717,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)08:41:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123472689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123472689<\/a><br>The more that is discovered, the less there is to discover and the harder it is to discover what&#039;s left<br>.<br>This even happens in single fields like science where 200 years ago anyone with a microscope or bunsen burner could have made an important discovery but now you need whole teams of researchers with multi-billion dollar equipment.<br><br>Also, in regards to art - soooo many people know how to paint nowadays that it&#039;s basically not even considered special anymore.<br><br>So if you have one guy who is a great painter and a great scientist literally no one would care because (a) art is no longer that rare\/special, and (b) making important scientific discoveries is really fucking difficult to do on your own.","time":1493556073,"resto":123472689,"id":"MHknMzvy","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123473756,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)08:41:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123473173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123473173<\/a><br>I think anon is right for the most part.

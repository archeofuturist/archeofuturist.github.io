Christianity can&#039;t compete, though it&#039;s second best overall. Christians have to rely on God for their salvation and generally can&#039;t do much on their own besides follow the teachings and be good people. Buddhists can directly, intentionally make themselves into good people, and go far beyond that, either by themselves, with the help of fellow Buddhists, or with the help of deified Buddhas if you&#039;re into those kinds of beliefs.<br><br>Buddhism solves all your problems and gives you full control and understanding if your mind, which is after all what determines whether you sin or not, and whether you have a good life or not.

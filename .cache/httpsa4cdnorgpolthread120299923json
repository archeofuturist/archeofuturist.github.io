Christianity can&#039;t compete, though it&#039;s second best overall. Christians have to rely on God for their salvation and generally can&#039;t do much on their own besides follow the teachings and be good people. Buddhists can directly, intentionally make themselves into good people, and go far beyond that, either by themselves, with the help of fellow Buddhists, or with the help of deified Buddhas if you&#039;re into those kinds of beliefs.<br><br>Buddhism solves all your problems and gives you full control and understanding if your mind, which is after all what determines whether you sin or not, and whether you have a good life or not. Why bother with any other religion, or with atheism? Fite me unbelievers<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 you are the worst kind of religious hipster<\/span><br>I don&#039;t associate with other Buddhists except online. The religion is good enough to make me put up with being in an easily hateable social group, having people assume I have bad motivations, and not getting to feel good by being part of a more popular group.","filename":"IMG_0111","ext":".jpg","w":1834,"h":1716,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":233,"tim":1491754872293,"time":1491754872,"md5":"7WtlCbRP6rv6QAq7K3Dutg==","fsize":748294,"resto":0,"id":"8oTzcmJE","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"buddhism-is-the-best-religion","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":2,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120300417,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)12:25:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120299923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120299923<\/a><br>How do I get into Buddhism?","time":1491755132,"resto":120299923,"id":"GYRKEKy7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120300434,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)12:25:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120299923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120299923<\/a><br>I agree","filename":"tmp_18570-20170408_011454_20170408012105916801367710","ext":".jpg","w":1536,"h":1535,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491755139321,"time":1491755139,"md5":"ifDlrf1qUXFUFZFyJjaaEA==","fsize":1859074,"resto":120299923,"id":"QP1rnxh+","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120301228,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)12:32:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120300417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120300417<\/a><br>Very, very carefully so that you don&#039;t end up reading someone&#039;s bullshit interpretation and get put off the whole thing.

What makes it badically unique is that it&#039;s a several thousand year old religious tradition where the entire core point is to get your mind into an ideal state of maximal happiness and practical effectiveness at living life. It&#039;s not about worshiping anything, or having certain particular dogmas or beliefs. It makes metaphysical claims about cosmology and reincarnation and all that, but you don&#039;t have to care about any of that.

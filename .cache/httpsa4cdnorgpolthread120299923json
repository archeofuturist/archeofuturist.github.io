Compared to Buddhism, in my opinion, Christianity teaches the preferable virtue and has the best goal because if everyone else has the mindset of doing good for everyone else, human-caused suffering is eliminated, and that is 99% of all of our suffering gone. Whereas if everyone has the Buddhist mindset, according to your version of Buddhism, everyone is trying to eliminate their own personal suffering, and without first becoming good people by developing character, some people will harm others in order to remove their own suffering...kinda like the state of the world right now. Though you could argue: &quot;But muh Buddhism teaches not to hurt others!&quot; and I&#039;d respond: &quot;Then Buddhism&#039;s foundation is developing the character of person so they can not hurt others in the pursuit for Nirvana, and therefore, the real goal of Buddhism is producing good morality, and Nirvana is the result of it.&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2<\/span><br>You have no real understanding of Buddhism.

If you have no desires according to Buddhism, you have no suffering because all suffering is from desire. But, pleasure is mainly derived from desire. One gets pleasure working for something whether it be working to build a clubhouse, working on a car. Yes, some pleasure comes from accomplishing the task, but most pleasure comes from the actual journey. Just owning something doesn&#039;t put one in a state of pleasure until they utilize it to create pleasure. So when you complete a task, having the task done doesn&#039;t necessarily give you pleasure. When one utilizes it, they again work towards a goal. Buddhism gets rid of working towards a goal in order to &quot;crush desire.&quot; Essentially, Buddhism is all about having no suffering which means no pleasure at all. One must suffer some to gain pleasure. Buddhism views no feeling better than some pleasure and some suffering. Now to Christianity, Christianity is better because it has better morals. All of it is based on loving others. Also, it&#039;s meaningless to be a Buddhist because if you&#039;re not a Buddhist and you die, Buddhism doesn&#039;t think you go to a hell.

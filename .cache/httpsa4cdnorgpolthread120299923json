Compared to Buddhism, in my opinion, Christianity teaches the preferable virtue and has the best goal because if everyone else has the mindset of doing good for everyone else, human-caused suffering is eliminated, and that is 99% of all of our suffering gone. Whereas if everyone has the Buddhist mindset, according to your version of Buddhism, everyone is trying to eliminate their own personal suffering, and without first becoming good people by developing character, some people will harm others in order to remove their own suffering...kinda like the state of the world right now. Though you could argue: &quot;But muh Buddhism teaches not to hurt others!&quot; and I&#039;d respond: &quot;Then Buddhism&#039;s foundation is developing the character of person so they can not hurt others in the pursuit for Nirvana, and therefore, the real goal of Buddhism is producing good morality, and Nirvana is the result of it.&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2<\/span><br>You have no real understanding of Buddhism.

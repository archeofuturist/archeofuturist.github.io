Not only was the proposed pay increase rejected, there would be zero pay raises. Period. And they didn\u2019t plan on negotiating.\u201d <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;... even though it has published hundreds of articles on the benefits of a living wage, the need to increase the minimum wage, and the shortsightedness of politicians unwilling to address the wage issue.<\/span>","filename":"huffington-post-logo","ext":".jpg","w":414,"h":146,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":88,"tim":1492471616643,"time":1492471616,"md5":"At4bbe4sL4jMUCIFo1TQ6Q==","fsize":20976,"resto":0,"id":"IXLcbQBM","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"huffington-post-wont-give-living-wage-to-staffers","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121601222,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:28:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Perhaps they should be asked to contribute to huffpo in order to continue it&#039;s important visionary work.","time":1492471692,"resto":121601079,"id":"vrCT+Gc\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121601458,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:30:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121601079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121601079<\/a><br>I&#039;ll do their job for free.","time":1492471804,"resto":121601079,"id":"CjRp0Jvj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121602158,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:34:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"anyone remember this from a few days ago?<br><br>https:\/\/heatst.com\/culture-wars\/gul<wbr>lible-huffington-post-falls-for-hoa<wbr>x-article-calling-for-white-men-to-<wbr>be-stripped-of-voting-rights\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Huffington Post\u2019s recent publication of a blog post proposing stripping white men of their right to vote sparked widespread anger across social media. The editors initially defended the piece, titled \u201cCould It be Time to Deny White Men the Franchise?\u201d They even crowed about how much traffic it was getting and mocked readers for complaining, before suddenly reversing their decision and deleting the post over the weekend.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A further indictment on the Huffington Post is the fact that its editor, Verashni Pillay, then took it upon herself to defend the total garbage that I had written. Although Ms Pillay claims that her website does not necessarily agree with what I said, it is unlikely that she would publish a piece with the same sentiments but aimed at a different race group written by someone ostensibly from the other side of the political spectrum.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is highly doubtful that she would publish a piece saying perhaps apartheid wasn\u2019t that bad, or defending Donald Trump\u2019s ban on people of certain nationalities entering the United States, and rightly so. Pieces defending apartheid or the \u2018Muslim ban\u2019 would be hurtful claptrap. What we have seen is the South African equivalent of the Sokal Affair, where something will be published, even if it\u2019s \u2018liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors\u2019 ideological preconceptions\u2019. My article does not meet criteria a, but it certainly meets criteria b.<\/span>","time":1492472090,"resto":121601079,"id":"IXLcbQBM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

The low huddle of houses was accented by the towers of church, town-hall and by windmills. We view Dordrecht from afar, standing in the Dutch lowlands, the home city of the painter: he frequently depicted it in the background of his pictures. The massive church is the Grote Kerk; farther to the left is the town-hall. The actual motif here, however, is not the vastness of the landscape, nor the skyline of the town, not even the enormous sky, but a climatic drama, which must often have inspired fear. From the left, heavy grey rain clouds sweep across the picture. Rain is falling in sheets, to the left of the church. To the right, the sky is still pale-blue. Lightning is striking, in precisely observed, thick yellow streaks and not in naively imagined zig-zags. The distant houses are lividly illuminated. In the foreground, cows (two of them seem to be spotlighted) and a horse patiently wait out the storm. This picture seems to occupy a special place in the winning of the natural landscape for painting. It is one of the first representations of the thunderstorm purely as a natural phenomenon independently of content (e.g. a destruction of Sodom). This is an early work by Cuyp, as shown by the yellowish-grey tone and heavy brush-work, betraying the influence of Jan van Goyen. Seeing this picture in 1834, John Constable exclaimed: &quot;truly sublime&quot;.&quot;<br><br>You can watch this paint in Cologne germany. The Flash looks very astounding it shines and sparkle like there is silver setted in the paint","filename":"10B","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":865,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":180,"tim":1490731689964,"time":1490731689,"md5":"N8hlbnKYzP6G\/fmMwpToIQ==","fsize":293291,"resto":0,"id":"PIA1kgXv","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"european-western-art-thread","country_name":"Germany","replies":264,"images":206,"unique_ips":59,"tail_size":50},{"no":118689877,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:10:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118689650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118689650<\/a>","filename":"9cb73f29090d7a61985adddd5b60fb79","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":526,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1490731805607,"time":1490731805,"md5":"MVCGVdGP\/EW21s17LO1PfA==","fsize":163794,"resto":118689650,"id":"PIA1kgXv","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118689935,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:10:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118689650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118689650<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;white bull outnumbered by black and brown bulls<\/span>","filename":"thinking-face","ext":".png","w":256,"h":256,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490731832006,"time":1490731832,"md5":"mhv6gLwd3GH0\/CivBtm8Dw==","fsize":54472,"resto":118689650,"id":"5jrNsPqE","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118690048,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:11:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118689650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118689650<\/a><br><br><br><a href=\"#p118689935\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118689935<\/a><br>bbc is on youporn for you","filename":"NG_NG_NG962","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":529,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1490731900110,"time":1490731900,"md5":"jlGtwfIIULwGonweNGPjcg==","fsize":64660,"resto":118689650,"id":"PIA1kgXv","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118690052,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:11:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118689650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118689650<\/a><br>We already had this thread yesterday.","time":1490731902,"resto":118689650,"id":"eUqOhxPt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118690086,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:11:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"obligatory","filename":"I0xLQ0G","ext":".jpg","w":990,"h":687,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1490731919943,"time":1490731919,"md5":"F+GKCzfKyWs1BJX2CnyZTQ==","fsize":176003,"resto":118689650,"id":"5jrNsPqE","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118690313,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:13:53","name":"Anonymous","filename":"thomas-cole-the-course_of_empire_desolation_18361","ext":".jpg","w":3270,"h":2076,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":79,"tim":1490732033003,"time":1490732033,"md5":"yD2bTJPaLVq+MKLyPGGOmQ==","fsize":2124706,"resto":118689650,"id":"LccKQlNP","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118690489,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:15:24","name":"Anonymous","filename":"57e929a71a00002d005b4b59","ext":".jpg","w":970,"h":646,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490732124721,"time":1490732124,"md5":"wd3PKjSpZ6pOCf5N0drUJA==","fsize":122694,"resto":118689650,"id":"5jrNsPqE","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118690490,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:15:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118690086\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118690086<\/a><br>Hitler wasnt a good painter<br><br><a href=\"#p118690052\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118690052<\/a><br>i know it was mine.

The canvas dates to 1878 and is one of the most heroic representations of the history of Poland.

The painting immediately became a huge success with critics and the public, and remains one of the best known paintings in the Neoclassical style.<br><br>It depicts a scene from a Roman legend about a dispute between two warring cities, Rome and Alba Longa, and stresses the importance of patriotism and masculine self-sacrifice for one&#039;s country. Instead of the two cities sending their armies to war, they agree to choose three men from each city; the victor in that fight will be the victorious city. From Rome, three brothers from a Roman family, the Horatii, agree to end the war by fighting three brothers from a family of Alba Longa, the Curiatii. The three brothers, all of whom appear willing to sacrifice their lives for the good of Rome, are shown saluting their father who holds their swords out for them.[1] Of the three Horatii brothers, only one shall survive the confrontation. However, it is the surviving brother who is able to kill the other three fighters from Alba Longa: he allows the three fighters to chase him, causing them to separate from each other, and then, in turn, kills each Curiatii brother. Aside from the three brothers depicted, David also represents, in the bottom right corner, a woman crying whilst sitting down. She is Camilla, a sister of the Horatii brothers, who is also betrothed to one of the Curiatii fighters, and thus she weeps in the realisation that, in any case, she will lose someone she loves.<br><br>(from wikipedia)","filename":"Jacques-Louis David - Oath of the Horatii","ext":".jpg","w":1994,"h":1555,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":97,"tim":1490741125125,"time":1490741125,"md5":"f1cOt2gngedrTic5ap4kQw==","fsize":1003686,"resto":118689650,"id":"WKVCzEXJ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118709436,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)18:49:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118708924\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118708924<\/a><br>Another \/pol\/ classic<br><br>The Greek philosopher Diogenes (404-323 BC) is seated in his abode, the earthenware tub, in the Metroon, Athens, lighting the lamp in daylight with which he was to search for an honest man.

Executioners and victims face each other abruptly across a narrow space; according to Kenneth Clark, &quot;by a stroke of genius [Goya] has contrasted the fierce repetition of the soldiers&#039; attitudes and the steely line of their rifles, with the crumbling irregularity of their target.&quot; A square lantern situated on the ground between the two groups throws a dramatic light on the scene. The brightest illumination falls on the huddled victims to the left, whose numbers include a monk or friar in prayer. To the immediate right and at the center of the canvas, other condemned figures stand next in line to be shot. The central figure is the brilliantly lit man kneeling amid the bloodied corpses of those already executed, his arms flung wide in either appeal or defiance. His yellow and white clothing repeats the colors of the lantern. His plain white shirt and sun-burnt face show he is a simple laborer.<br><br>On the right side stands the firing squad, engulfed in shadow and painted as a monolithic unit. Seen nearly from behind, their bayonets and their shako headgear form a relentless and immutable column. Most of the faces of the figures cannot be seen, but the face of the man to the right of the main victim, peeping fearfully towards the soldiers, acts as a repoussoir at the back of the central group. Without distracting from the intensity of the foreground drama, a townscape with a steeple looms in the nocturnal distance, probably including the barracks used by the French. In the background between the hillside and the shakos is a crowd with torches: perhaps onlookers, perhaps more soldiers or victims.","filename":"Francisco Goya - The Third of May 1808","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":989,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1490743273929,"time":1490743273,"md5":"gPK4ZvC5hVrlXLBgFn\/0qg==","fsize":206240,"resto":118689650,"id":"WKVCzEXJ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118713922,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)19:26:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Church visited Greece in 1869 and spent several weeks in Athens.

The action is the sack and destruction of the city, in the course of a tempest seen in the distance. It seems that a fleet of enemy warriors has overthrown the city&#039;s defenses, sailed up the river, and is busily firing the city and killing and raping its inhabitants. The bridge across which the triumphal procession had crossed is broken; a makeshift crossing strains under the weight of soldiers and refugees. Columns are broken, fire breaks from the upper floors of a palace on the river bank. In the foreground a statue of some venerable hero (posed like the Borghese Warrior) stands headless, still striding forward into the uncertain future.[a] In the waning light of late afternoon, the dead lie where they fell, in fountains and atop the monuments built to celebrate the affluence of the now fallen civilization. The scene is perhaps suggested by the Vandal sack of Rome in 455.

We view the remains of the city in the livid light of a dying day. The landscape has begun to return to wilderness, and no human beings are to be seen; but the remnants of their architecture emerge from beneath a mantle of trees, ivy, and other overgrowth. The broken stumps of the pharoses loom in the background. The arches of the shattered bridge, and the columns of the temple are still visible; a single column looms in the foreground, now a nesting place for birds. The sunrise of the first painting is mirrored here by a moonrise, a pale light reflecting in the ruin-choked river while the standing pillar reflects the last rays of sunset. This gloomy picture symbolizes what all empires could be after their fall. It is a harsh possible future in which humanity has been destroyed by its own hands.<\/span><br><br>This cycle is, unsurprisingly, depressing. It reflects Cole&#039;s pessimism and is often seen as a commentary on Andrew Jackson and the Democratic Party. (Note, for instance, the military hero at the center of &quot;Consummation.&quot;)[9] However, some Democrats had a different theory of the course of empire. They saw not a spiral or cycle but a continuing upward trajectory.

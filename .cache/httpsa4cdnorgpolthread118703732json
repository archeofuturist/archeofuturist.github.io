I hear all about how the State should be run as a business within its means, and so on. Which makes the push for non-renewable energy the norm and not invest in &quot;green&quot; energy strange. <br><br>Oddly enough, in Texas there is a huge push for wind energy. Farmers are finding it incredibly profitable to put a wind turbine in their field and attach it to the Texas Electrical grid. The State is aggressively pushing this plan too. <br><br>Yet nobody else seems to be bothering except the hippy northeast. There is even a reflex reaction that pushing for Wind and Solar is &quot;Liberal&quot; and thus challenges the tribal affiliation of being &quot;Conservative&quot;.","time":1490741306,"resto":118703732,"id":"ZcuWlfV5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118709607,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)18:50:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118703732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118703732<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and buying large SUV&#039;s that cost far more to operate then their smaller counterparts?<\/span><br>Not all of us live in the middle of cuckerville surrounded by niggers and actually have shit to tow and haul and shit, dumb faggot.<br><br>Also: fuck you and fuck the environment.

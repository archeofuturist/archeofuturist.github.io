How do you realistically de-institutionalize, de-monetize and level down society to have healthy and sharing-based economics ?

You&#039;re ignoring human nature and the impetus to gain for personal benefit at the expense of others. For example, if I like what you have, I can place a gun to your head and make you give it to me. Without a state to prevent that action, I will take what you have, whether I kill you or you just willingly give it to me. The only way to ensure safety is to grant the state a monopoly on violence, so that when I try to do that, I am shot by the police and that action is classified as an armed robbery, legally speaking. Capitalism is an inevitability. Even in the strictest communist regimes with the most authoritarian leanings, the state simply injected itself as a monopolistic capitalistic entity that distributed payment to its citizens in a terribly functioning business model.

How do you realistically de-institutionalize, de-monetize and level down society to have healthy and sharing-based economics ? Im not interested in replies from people who dont believe it possible, I&#039;m looking for arguments from people who actually defend a realistic vision of liberal anarchism or something close to it.<br>TL;DR : how can the idea of anarchy possibly work ?","filename":"666000","ext":".png","w":225,"h":224,"tn_w":225,"tn_h":224,"tim":1490702673506,"time":1490702673,"md5":"vIe5fdTEy2IDOL4wF3bvSw==","fsize":7397,"resto":0,"id":"+JVWKNMq","country":"NZ","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"alright-pol-please-explain-anarchism-to-me","country_name":"New Zealand","replies":21,"images":2,"unique_ips":12},{"no":118642144,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:05:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"No","time":1490702725,"resto":118642068,"id":"1HCEoDeQ","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":118642260,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:06:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/WHBuU9yurzE","time":1490702818,"resto":118642068,"id":"TgVORnqb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118643315,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:22:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"nobody ?","time":1490703724,"resto":118642068,"id":"pkt4civl","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118643624,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:26:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;sharing-based economics<\/span><br>Are you talking about left-anarchism?

You&#039;re ignoring human nature and the impetus to gain for personal benefit at the expense of others. For example, if I like what you have, I can place a gun to your head and make you give it to me. Without a state to prevent that action, I will take what you have, whether I kill you or you just willingly give it to me. The only way to ensure safety is to grant the state a monopoly on violence, so that when I try to do that, I am shot by the police and that action is classified as an armed robbery, legally speaking. Capitalism is an inevitability. Even in the strictest communist regimes with the most authoritarian leanings, the state simply injected itself as a monopolistic capitalistic entity that distributed payment to its citizens in a terribly functioning business model. If you want to be free, you better be prepared to defend what you have. If you want everyone to be equal, it will be under a jackboot.","time":1490706072,"resto":118642068,"id":"AT1NsLEs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118646285,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)09:02:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118645454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118645454<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If you&#039;re &quot;organizing&quot; in any way, shape, or form, then you&#039;ve drifted from anarchism.<\/span><br>That&#039;s complete bullshit.

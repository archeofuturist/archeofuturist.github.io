Now, my parents truly want me to question everything and never accept anything at face value, except the Holocaust, that&#039;s something they say shouldn&#039;t be doubted or questioned because then it trivialises the horror of it, and lessens the seriousness of it.<br><br>My dad was saying about growing up he was facisnated by it and did so much research and it all pointed to numbers around 15 million total deaths or both jews and minorities like gypsies and disabled and such. Apparently half of Autchwitz was destroyed before the war had ended in a bid to hide evidence. The little tour they take you through in the remnants of that place doesn&#039;t cover the true scale of it.<br><br>I just don&#039;t know what to believe, you know? It&#039;s annoying, in an age where information is so accessible that information on one of the greatest clusterfucks of mass genocide in history is so well hidden. Dad has said the numbers seem crazy, but there were 40k camps in Europe operating, from small camps of 100 to places like Autchwitz that killed upto 2000 people every few hours. I said 40k wasn&#039;t feasible, so he asked me how many would I think? I said it had to be much lower, lets be generous and say 3000 camps, the maths works out for 15mil at around 2000 odd people per camp, which doesn&#039;t seem unrealistic. Just 2000 people a day, across 365 days is over 2 million.<br><br>At the end of our convo, it did put things into perspective, but I&#039;m still not convinced.<br><br>Both mum and dad are saying I should watch &#039;A World at War&#039; which is a documentary series they watched growing up that looks at things objectively and not too biased, even against Nazi&#039;s.<br><br>Even so. I&#039;d love credible sources, but thesedays it&#039;s hard to come by that.","filename":"ACTIVATE_IT","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492778595529,"time":1492778595,"md5":"5lo1B9Vcfd\/wGUqBiR0ssw==","fsize":67860,"resto":0,"id":"eDRZT8u6","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-6-million","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122132395,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:54:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Speak at me, senpaitachi.","time":1492779266,"resto":122131501,"id":"eDRZT8u6","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122132592,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)08:56:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122131501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122131501<\/a><br>There are no sources except u were there.<br>So don&#039;t even bother looking for sources.<br>Find your own conclusion.<br>And the most reasonable conclusion is that winners write history.<br>Infact way more germans and russians died after and during the war. Jews, just because they are most likely the most powerful &quot;race&quot; on this planet, want to be a special snowflake.<br>What happened was terrible either way, but always speaking about &quot;holocaust&quot; is just stupid and the main prove that jews control everything.<br>Just somer special Snowflakes. <br>And think about the following:<br>Since centuries in the history of humanity jews are the ones who get pursued. There must be a reason for this, not just simplecoincidence.","time":1492779400,"resto":122131501,"id":"hiqywyb3","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

My question for those of us in the alt right is how do we intend to convert\/redpill normies, if there is such a stigma around people pushing similar views, that most people are not even willing to listen. Before I was redpilled myself, it took me a very long time being around the alt right before I even began considering these views as a posibility because of social conditioning, and I imagine this is the same for many others. How can the alt right expand\/ work on its PR? Shitposting is fun, but probably not effective in the long run.","filename":"IMG_2725","ext":".png","w":1334,"h":750,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490065185971,"time":1490065185,"md5":"IoIQ+S4fGfWkWrHShC1mPA==","fsize":749044,"resto":0,"id":"rNSw3k7k","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-messages-of-the-altright-and-people","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

EU is no more. There are no economies in globalized world ruled by CIA lemon party gestapo. No such thing - big or small. It&#039;s something called sharia economy where deficits don&#039;t matter. So such concepts as &quot;large&quot;, &quot;larger&quot; or &quot;largest&quot; do not mean anything since they are weapons of pride paraders stemming from the rules borrowed from the theory of relativity. Why did they have to destroy EU and USA? Good question, but it&#039;s very unclear at this point. Maybe they are following some sort of orders of revolution cycles of evolution. So how many revolutions does it take for nation to reach &quot;half-life&quot; if it&#039;s being attacked by weapons of nation building as implemented by using evolution theory.","time":1493293881,"resto":123026846,"id":"s6nJO8+r","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"}]}

The universe is everything we observe right? But everyone observes something different. Maybe he lives somewhere else observing another region. he lives in another time observing another age. Or even more directly. You walk through the woods at night. There is some noise in the bush. You think there is a cat in the bush and you walk on. The next guy goes the same route, heres the same noise, but thinks there is a wild beast in the bush, a monster even, and runs away scared. So one guy observed a cat, the other one a monster. How do you know which one is real? You would say the cat one I guess because monsters dont exist. But they do for the other guy. What about people with hallucinations? Is their reality less worth because they see things you dont. But maybe the issue isnt with them seeing it, but with you not seeing it. Now we observe things, and interpret our observations. And this interpretation is our reality. Since everyone interprets stuff differently we all are experiencing different realities. The reality can enhance or alter itself by observing new informations. Some people dont like that. They like their current reality, so they dismiss anything changing, or for them damaging the reality. Thats when ignorance happens. However how can it be that everyone is living another reality? Doesnt science say there are multiple universes? That they all inhabit basically the same space but are still seperated somehow? And informations somehow being able to cross those dimensions? <br>We are the universe. Everyone is a universe by himself. By talking and communicating we exchange data with other universes. We live on the same planet\/same place but still are somehow seperated (by our body) but still connected through communication.","time":1490141616,"resto":117686809,"id":"J2yWQYzp","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117692055,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)20:14:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m enjoying this thread.<br><br>How long until a mod arbitrarily deletes it?","time":1490141657,"resto":117686809,"id":"SCPbFhRh","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

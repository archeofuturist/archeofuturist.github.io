Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1493676328068","ext":".png","w":1866,"h":1875,"tn_w":248,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493948929383,"time":1493948929,"md5":"IH9S1jfcUaRnxmtd61+CQQ==","fsize":1005524,"resto":0,"id":"A08xcKYp","country":"PL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":124147945,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:58:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"glad to hear it!","time":1493949482,"resto":124146818,"id":"Kspn4G9a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124147985,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:58:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124146818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124146818<\/a>","filename":"(((Spoopy Coincidence)))","ext":".png","w":1580,"h":343,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":27,"tim":1493949502851,"time":1493949502,"md5":"TDCYIY7DqO8RMK3m3dH4mA==","fsize":146476,"resto":124146818,"id":"VjjT6Mlu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

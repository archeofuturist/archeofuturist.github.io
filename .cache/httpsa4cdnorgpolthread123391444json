Racemixing is inevitable. Just surrender yourself to glory of penetrating a woman of a different color of you. Grasping her skin, fondling her colorful and plentful breasts.

Embrace your brazilinity as we did.","filename":"tumblr_mqiaamQpCB1qf1xcgo1_500","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":575,"tn_w":217,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493504808886,"time":1493504808,"md5":"aXzJfE4JSdlBZBxxYHms7Q==","fsize":85201,"resto":0,"id":"IfUu9IAh","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"it-doesnt-matter-you-guys-cant-resist-every","country_name":"Brazil","replies":6,"images":2,"unique_ips":7},{"no":123391566,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)18:27:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123391444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123391444<\/a>","filename":"IMG_0351","ext":".png","w":627,"h":330,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1493504872250,"time":1493504872,"md5":"vwjRknDYnBrSb5XCuJvtPQ==","fsize":269135,"resto":123391444,"id":"p\/g82EbX","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123391574,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)18:27:56","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1493500805162","ext":".jpg","w":772,"h":449,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":72,"tim":1493504876176,"time":1493504876,"md5":"F4\/4h8iOotNBvGcBS7\/sZA==","fsize":168209,"resto":123391444,"id":"pgwkKb3o","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123391589,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)18:28:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sounds like someone&#039;s got some repressed sexual memories","time":1493504883,"resto":123391444,"id":"hFcQmN7t","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123391612,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)18:28:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"All I&#039;ve been browsing on \/v\/ is brown girl threads<br>Then I come here to argue with \/pol\/tards and the first thread I see is about brown girls<br><br>Is the world telling me something","time":1493504897,"resto":123391444,"id":"RwcuYO0K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123391692,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)18:28:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123391444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123391444<\/a><br>What is the meaning of this.

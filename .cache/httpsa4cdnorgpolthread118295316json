Even western style clothing like white jeans were banned. Now they mostly stick to their own country, they&#039;re just like every other Balkan country except some of them LARP as Muslims but they are not really Muslims because they don&#039;t practice sharia, women don&#039;t wear hijab and they drink alcohol and eat pork all the time.<br><br>Kosovar diaspora - they lived under Yugo communism which wasn&#039;t as harsh as Hoxha communism so they had time to radicalize a little bit more. They are uber nationalists there but at the same time don&#039;t feel huge connection to mainland Albania. They are the middle ground between LARPing Muslims and actual Muslims - even then I don&#039;t think they are that serious with the fundamentalism. The UCK group was not an Islamic group but more of a gommie group, they were definitely leftist. As in mainland Albania, no sharia, nothing too crazy but they blast the prayer calls which annoys Serbs.<br><br>Macedonian diaspora - the most Islamicized. They wear Saudi dresses and wave Saudi flags. They gather in the street and chant Allahu Akbar. They take money from Saudi wahhabits to build mosques and radicalize the youth. Some are alright but most of them are just really subhuman and savage. I don&#039;t know why that is. Maybe something to do with the water.<br><br>All in all, Albanians are known for being criminals and drug traffickers. Not Islamist kebabs. It&#039;s what happens when you live under extreme gommunism for so many years and it all collapses - mafias form and drug trades abound. Serbia and Greece have their own mafias but they are more lowkey and deal with other stuff.","filename":"1473033534511","ext":".jpg","w":299,"h":299,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490497938319,"time":1490497938,"md5":"zDxFcm0NHzyaYhUR6yTS9A==","fsize":94789,"resto":118295316,"id":"rUduP+5v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118312298,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)23:12:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"What do Albanians think of le Bunker Man?","time":1490497971,"resto":118295316,"id":"To42nLhr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118312407,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)23:14:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118311306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118311306<\/a><br>based","time":1490498044,"resto":118295316,"id":"7sBZgLkd","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118312435,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)23:14:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118295316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118295316<\/a><br>once met one.

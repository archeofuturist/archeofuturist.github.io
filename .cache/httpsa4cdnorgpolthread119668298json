Actual percentage of U.S. abortions in &quot;hard cases&quot; are estimated as follows: in cases of rape, 0.3%; in cases of incest, 0.03%; in cases of risk to maternal life, 0.1%; in cases of risk to maternal health, 0.8%; and in cases of fetal health issues, 0.5%. About 98.3% of abortions in the United States are elective, including socio-economic reasons or for birth control. This includes perhaps 30% for primarily economic reasons and possibly 0.1% each for sex selection and selective reduction of multifetal pregnancies.<\/span>","filename":"IMG_0399","ext":".jpg","w":1125,"h":1114,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":247,"tim":1491432429678,"time":1491432429,"md5":"2VjO8WCePvGvuwA\/03l4Kg==","fsize":340033,"resto":0,"id":"1hZMTuwP","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-about-abortions-in-the-cases-of-rape-incest","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119669218,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)18:55:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"&#039;threat to physical life of the mother&#039; is the only sensible exception from a pro-life position<br><br>the rape\/incest ones are silly<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the child has the right to live! unless his father was a rapist or family member of the mother<\/span>","time":1491432922,"resto":119668298,"id":"MrFe1jcp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119669631,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)18:59:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw you can abort the rape baby fetus but can&#039;t execute the rapist<\/span>","time":1491433143,"resto":119668298,"id":"HICGM99F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119670943,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:10:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw abortion-legal States can charge you with murder if you cause the death of a fetus<\/span>","time":1491433834,"resto":119668298,"id":"1hZMTuwP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

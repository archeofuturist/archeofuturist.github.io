I&#039;m not religious either, but I don&#039;t see atheism as some kind of culture, or that we were somehow held back by religion and that our civilization would have accomplished all sorts of great things if it weren&#039;t for it, etc. Because that&#039;s really how some fedorafags see it. Atheism isn&#039;t a culture. It&#039;s not a way to organize society. It&#039;s not a system. It&#039;s pretty much nothing except technically correct (but that&#039;s not what matters).<br><br>Christianity can do great to perpetuate western values and way of life. If the rural and suburban retard theistfags are willing to have families and raise them with western values, then the future should belong to them. Not liberals who are OK with using impoverished ghettos as breeding factories with single mothers (for people who openly reject &quot;white culture&quot; now) and import humans from other countries with their own, very strong culture. Why do these people get to dictate the future of the west?","time":1490837132,"resto":118855984,"id":"1pcj00qq","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

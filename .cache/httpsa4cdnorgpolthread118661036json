Blackman, of 42 Commando, Royal Marines, was part of a Marine patrol that came across an Afghan fighter in a field wounded by Apache Helicopter gunfire. Blackman ordered the Afghan to be moved out of sight of the British Persistent Ground Surveillance System, a camera on a balloon above British Forward Operating Base Shazad, Helmand, covering the area Blackman&#039;s patrol had been sent to. Video evidence played at the Marines&#039; subsequent trial shows some of the patrol dragging the man across the field and then kicking him. Blackman ordered Marine B and C to stop administering first aid to the insurgent and eventually shot the man in the chest with a 9 mm pistol, saying: &quot;Shuffle off this mortal coil, you cunt. It&#039;s nothing you wouldn&#039;t do to us.&quot;He then added: &quot;I just broke the Geneva Convention.&quot;","time":1490717649,"resto":118661036,"id":"BIrOt\/Xd","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"}]}

He&#039;s claiming that Nunes was the one who did something desperate today, when anyone who followed the chain of events knows what happened. Nunes was tipped off by a based IC patriot, shown exclusive evidence that counters the entire Dem\/MSM narrative surrounding Obama&#039;&#039;s crimes, and did it in such a way as to cut through the shitbowl of word salad that Schiff and Dems offer every time a joint press event is held. It was obvious that Nunes caught everyone off guard, most especially Schiff, who figured out fast that the entire jig is up and they are all going down the fucking drain. Schiff then scrambles and makes the least authoritative bumbling statement of absolute nothing that he could have possibly made - understandable as unlike Nunes, Schiff&#039;s statement today was based on literally nothing. So from here on out guess we&#039;ll just see similar re-statings and more imaginary fan fiction from anonymous and unnamed sources or so until all the bad ones end up in jail.

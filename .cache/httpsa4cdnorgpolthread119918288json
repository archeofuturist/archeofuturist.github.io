I&#039;ll probably get emotional sometime this week. Maybe I&#039;m ignorant, or have been. Maybe I had a different idea, about the world, in general. I did look this up to make sure it&#039;s accurate, and it is. I don&#039;t believe we have the credit to be good guys anymore. We&#039;re the big boss of the world, and any time we use military force, it just seems like a disgusting overreach of our abilities as a nation. I was only in highschool when George W. Bush took office, and was more ignorant, only a little bit less so than I am presently. When a nation tries to maintain it&#039;s sovereignty against an seemingly infinite rebellion, sometimes it goes too far, as in the creation of our country. Another example would be the chemical attacks in Syria against the rebels. But in comparison, I could understand now why so many would consider it a simple war game, except that human lives -- sons, daughters, and friends -- innocent or armed forces -- would be the chess pieces.<br><br>Specifically, it was this image that shook me, and I had to look it up to see that it was accurate, which it was. Just check out the wikipedia article to see how insanely powerful our military is. <br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_<wbr>of_aircraft_carriers_by_country","filename":"1491546795417","ext":".png","w":823,"h":1006,"tn_w":204,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491556186920,"time":1491556186,"md5":"CBY6Mo4rQT4xk4Wo9kg6vw==","fsize":252442,"resto":0,"id":"aakuIT0s","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-almost-cried-tonight-pol-and-im-still-on-the","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119918500,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:11:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Careful not to tear your dick off jerking yourself too hard there pal.","time":1491556309,"resto":119918288,"id":"86H0Rmep","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119918672,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:13:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119918500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119918500<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dick <\/span><br>This almost defiantly a woman.","time":1491556407,"resto":119918288,"id":"Hkx45oko","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

This general is for the discussion of Marxism-Leninism, the ideology of revolutionary socialism and communism.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx

It has been tried, over and over and over. And each time it has failed miserably. And you know why it has failed miserably over and over and over? Because communism is in itself unachievable. No matter how many times you try, it will always fail. Why is this, you might ask? It\u00b4s because communism is inherently flawed and unrealistic since its conception, it is an unattainable idealist ideology based on childlike naivet\u00e9 and gross misconceptions. The communist revolutionary with an Mosin in his hand, trying to create a communist utopia is no different in his lunacy and delusion from the ISIS terrorist with a suicide bomb strapped on his chest, trying to create Allah\u00b4s kingdom on earth. Communism cannot be achieved. This has been proven to be true each and every time some university intellectual leading an army of peasants has overthrown a government. Because unlike capitalism which has adapted and shaped to suit human nature, communism goes against the very human nature itself. It is built around the idea of a society where everyone is selfless and struggles only for the greater good of the collective. A nice thought perhaps, but that idea does not survive the frontal crash with the reality which is that human nature is individualistic, greedy and focused on self-sustainment and survival. Grim, yes, but true nontheless. A man rarely ever cares much about people he will never know. This is why we have seen such atrocities commited by countries like Cambodia, the USSR and China, where they tried to change human nature and bend it to suit the state ideology rather than the other way around. Anyone simply living per human nature is seen as a traitorous counterrevolutionary and gets shot in the neck by the NKVD, Red Guards or any other armed communist militia of your liking.","time":1493665459,"resto":123629744,"id":"DQC8t\/oS","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123657543,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)15:07:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123629744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123629744<\/a><br><br>You should literally be shot in the head and hung in the center of your town.","time":1493665677,"resto":123629744,"id":"iC\/2pi9J","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123657783,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)15:09:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123657543\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123657543<\/a><br>Stop being a barbarian, don&#039;t liter you fucking shitskin.

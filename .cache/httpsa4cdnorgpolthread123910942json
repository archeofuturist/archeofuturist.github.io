But a lot of rewarding obedience is due to the laziness of the teacher. Teachers don&#039;t really want to be bothered to do their job. They sure as fuck don&#039;t want to actually put any effort into students with intelligent but who take a little extra work. So, they naturally gravitate to what requires the least amount of energy.

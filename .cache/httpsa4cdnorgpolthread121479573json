The result? Intestinal damage (with impaired cellular repair potential), cellular death as well as compromised intestinal villi, which means reduced absorption of other nutrients, including minerals and protein. Add to this altered gut flora, which can allow certain harmful bacterial strains like E. coli to run rampant. Furthermore, because the body is now responding full-time to the needs of the injured gut lining, proteins and other resources are redirected from other basic growth and repair processes. lectins have been associated with leptin resistance, a pre-diabetic condition linked to obesity.<br><br>lectins cause leaky gut. Leaky gut is a term for the breach in the intestinal lining created by lectins hand in hand with other antinutrients. Once the intestinal breach exists, lectins and other particles (like partially digested food, toxins, etc) can \u201cleak\u201d into the bloodstream.<br><br>Once lectins open the door, so to speak, out of the small intestine, they and other fugitive particles are now free to move about the body and bind to any tissue they come across (anything from the thyroid to the pancreas to the kidneys). Of course, the body reacts to these invaders by directing an attack on these particles and the otherwise perfectly healthy tissue they\u2019re attached to. Enter autoimmune mayhem. That\u2019s why lectins are linked with autoimmune disorders like IBS, Crohn\u2019s, colitis, thyroiditis, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, and arthritis. Specific lectins have been associated with particular ailments (like wheat with rheumatoid arthritis), but more research is needed to trace and confirm these connections. What is clear, however, is the potent autoimmune destruction that can result when the intestinal lining experiences this level of damage","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492405903824,"time":1492405903,"md5":"Cmc2oZ3U6RCNaMuQxJ53Dg==","fsize":643796,"resto":121479573,"id":"ss\/IbinW","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121483434,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)01:11:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"http:\/\/praisekek.bigcartel.com\/ THE CLOTHING FOR THE CULTURE","filename":"Equailty","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1492405910297,"time":1492405910,"md5":"+bzCTZsoQsKlgBZ\/aXCnqA==","fsize":266702,"resto":121479573,"id":"2Gt5DBlK","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121483525,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)01:12:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121483280\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121483280<\/a><br>subbed.","time":1492405959,"resto":121479573,"id":"dzdiVpHX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121483569,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)01:13:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121479573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121479573<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;weebshit and white supremecy<\/span>","filename":"1486287769212","ext":".png","w":256,"h":256,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492405982277,"time":1492405982,"md5":"g\/hab4q8W9tJknB8xgWt+Q==","fsize":74505,"resto":121479573,"id":"ah8TiC6E","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121483849,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)01:15:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m a right-winger and I make music.

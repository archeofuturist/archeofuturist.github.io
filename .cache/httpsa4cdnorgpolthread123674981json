X house has a market value of Y, and the bank wants to make money, so they offer the goy a mortgage with a total value of Y + Z, spread over however many years. Now, since the goyim doesn&#039;t have a lot of money, he&#039;ll end up putting a smaller down payment on the house, and paying more in the long run due to interest. But the goyim is in luck! The bank lets them know that if they pay for insurance, they get access to lower interest rates, even if they don&#039;t actually have the means to pay for the house, and the banks are okay with this because they know that if anything happens to the goyim, they&#039;ll be able to call up the CMHC to get a cash insurance settlement, while the homeowner is left with a debt which they can&#039;t discharge?<br><br>And you&#039;re saying that 90% of the mortgages in Canada are like this? <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Is it possible that some people took out insurance for some other reason, or are we certain that the reason they have insurance is because the homeowners are broke?<\/span><br>And how does the government bailouts in 2008 factor into this?

The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) has designated six Canadian institutions as D-SIBs: Bank of Montreal, Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, National Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Canada, and Toronto-Dominion Bank of Canada. The draft legislation provides a framework for the conversion of certain eligible shares and liabilities of the D-SIB into common equity of the bank (or any of its affiliates) in the event the D-SIB becomes non-viable. The purpose of the conversion is to recapitalize the bank and allow it to continue operating without the need for a government bail-out. The initiative is consistent with international efforts to address the potential risks to the global financial system of institutions that are perceived as being \u201ctoo-big-to-fail.\u201d<\/span><br><br>Your shekels will soon be replaced by (((bank shares))) you won&#039;t be allowed to sell","filename":"when-dad-amp-039-s-a-jew_o_2990489","ext":".jpg","w":939,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1493680437754,"time":1493680437,"md5":"szXtGNvWSlA4D5uVOEVH9A==","fsize":653867,"resto":123674981,"id":"wZiSri+Z","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123689152,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)19:14:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123687931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123687931<\/a><br><br>Fuck.

The bank lets them know that if they pay for insurance, they get access to lower interest rates, even if they don&#039;t actually have the means to pay for the house, and the banks are okay with this because they know that if anything happens to the goyim, they&#039;ll be able to call up the CMHC to get a cash insurance settlement, while the homeowner is left with a debt which they can&#039;t discharge?<\/span><br><br>Correct.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And you&#039;re saying that 90% of the mortgages in Canada are like this? <\/span><br><br>Not 90%, but in 2008 90% of mortgages issued were CMHC insured.

Currency is subject to inflation. Stocks are volatile and at the moment are in a bubble. So gold has its uses. The fact that gold hasnt changed price in years is seen as a good sign that its a good storage of value. Since the 1900s the us dollar has inflated nearly 99%. Thats why people put their money into gold, because they have no confidence in the stock market and no confidence in the currency. When the price of gold goes up and the value of the USD goes down along with prices inflating thats when you need to worry.","time":1493683519,"resto":123674981,"id":"aIxkn9ZN","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123695231,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:05:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123690922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123690922<\/a><br>sent :^)","time":1493683536,"resto":123674981,"id":"DmqYKpqx","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123695641,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:08:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123684083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123684083<\/a><br>What&#039;s the fucking point if the entire world economy collapses?<br><br>The only things that will matter are food, medicine and guns.","time":1493683733,"resto":123674981,"id":"yNoTqdNH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123695816,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:10:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123695126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123695126<\/a><br>You&#039;re missing the point.

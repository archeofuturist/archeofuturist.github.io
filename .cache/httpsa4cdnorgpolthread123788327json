Immigrants throw themselves at the walls with bombs strapped to their chests, significantly reducing the outsider population. People inside the wall live in a right-libertarian paradise. Protesters are routinely run over for blocking traffic and every home has at least three guns.<br><br>Suddenly, Super-Muhammad, the giant Frankenstein&#039;s Arab built off of the remains of Jihadists climbs over the wall and detonated the weapons of mass destruction strapped to his chest. The wall-dwellers retaliate, and push out of the wall, eradicating outsiders.<br><br>2100<br><br>Birds are chirping. The sun is shining. People hum softly as they clean their rifles. Somewhere in the distance, Trump and Le Pen give a toast to the Empire in an underground smooth-jazz pub.","filename":"IMG_3026","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":1204,"tn_w":155,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493744451243,"time":1493744451,"md5":"XIWVcU773Rd5mkH0E2ThQQ==","fsize":646760,"resto":0,"id":"VmmRCW3G","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"2033","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

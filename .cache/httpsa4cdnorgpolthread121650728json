Yakubu Yahya, a 17-year-old from Niger, went to Libya searching for his missing parents and was kidnapped in the Libyan city of Sabha while crossing the Saharan Desert. His kidnappers demanded $2,000 - an unimaginable figure to him - and he was beaten almost constantly until he managed to escape. Eventually, he found enough work in Libya to scrape together $400 - enough to pay a smuggler to get him to the coast and then get onto the smuggler&#039;s boat.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So, whatever happened to his parents? If he is looking for his parents, what the hell does he do illegally crossing to Europe? Why did his parents leave him alone anyway?<\/span><br><br>2. Nuy Hassen, 16, left Eritrea when he was six and spent a decade traveling through Ethiopia, Sudan and the Sahara Desert. Along the way, his friends were killed by smugglers because they got sick and couldn&#039;t keep up. When he finally reached Libya, he was kidnapped and held for 7 months. He&#039;s so traumatized that no one can figure out his full story.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sure thing... no one can figure out his story. I can. He isn&#039;t from Eritrea, he is a 35yr old from Niger, he made up a shitty story to get asylum.<\/span><br><br>3. Mohammed Abdullah, a 32-year-old from Equatorial Guinea, explained how smugglers demand payment through some of the world&#039;s best-known money transfer companies, often via Gulf countries. Along the way, nearly everyone the migrants encounter is corrupt - including the Libyan military boat that escorted them for an hour after they left the beach at Zuwara.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;oh no, everyone is corrupt! Better come to Europe to leach off the European taxpayer and make Europe the same shithole as Africa and the Middle East! At least he ain&#039;t lying about his age...<\/span>","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-18 at 8.35.43 AM","ext":".png","w":652,"h":920,"tn_w":177,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492497604496,"time":1492497604,"md5":"yhE0XpvSovunjXGMX4lJhA==","fsize":571755,"resto":0,"id":"16eLy8z1","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"promigrant-british-tabloids-strike-again","country_name":"Germany","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

In contrast Obama has a few pictures with his tailor Martin Greenfeild. <br><br>He had a Mexican store shut down for operating without a licence in 2007<br><br>http:\/\/www.baka.com.au\/world\/mexico<wbr>-bulletproof-clothing-store-closed-<wbr>20080302-1w89.html<br><br>And aside from articles with an eerie similar tone to them across news websites. No one has a 3rd party review of his wares that I can find. <br><br>The websites are not professional for a business that claims to make over 20 million in sales a year.<br><br>(http:\/\/miguelcaballerofashion.com\/<wbr><br><br>http:\/\/miguelcaballero.com\/)<br><br>one features a destitute amazon store and the other features a SOFORT bank transfer portal If you wish to pay with &quot;Your familiar banking details&quot;. (WTF) <br><br>All this made me think that this was some sort of cartel operated scam.<br>Until I found a smoking gun... The first news organization to interview this man was VICE in 2009. ONE YEAR AFTER THE MEXICAN FRONT WAS BUSTED.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nQM<wbr>6zLiSn1E&amp;t=1s <br><br>(why is the bullet reveal out of frame VICE? something you don&#039;t want us to see?)<br><br>Why is VICE interviewing a nobody designer from fucking Colombia that no other reputable news organization has touched. Is a cartel member their contact for all their stories down there? It is common knowledge that Shane Smith has a serious affinity for cocaine and openly brags that he &quot;learned about business by selling drugs&quot; .<br><br>All this is interesting, but my favorite find is this:<br><br>https:\/\/heatst.com\/culture-wars\/vic<wbr>e-editor-accused-of-recruiting-inte<wbr>rns-for-cocaine-smuggling-ring\/<br><br>What the fuck is going on at VICE?","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491924585469,"time":1491924585,"md5":"ks7ySqJ+FaAI2ERk67FZ8A==","fsize":278190,"resto":0,"id":"n0FX2nnR","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-vice-a-cocaine-front","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120610815,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:31:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120610563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120610563<\/a><br>Vice needs to be shut down ASAP<br><br>We need RWDSs to raid their office and string those degenerates up","time":1491924699,"resto":120610563,"id":"pvDXr4xk","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120611097,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:33:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120610815\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120610815<\/a><br>looks like the second like is not directing to the correct website... http:\/\/www.baka.com.au\/world\/mexico<wbr>-bulletproof-clothing-store-closed-<wbr>20080302-1w89.html","time":1491924831,"resto":120610563,"id":"n0FX2nnR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120611184,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:34:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120611097\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120611097<\/a><br>hmm i know sydney morning herald isnt exactly reputable. but what is baka.com","time":1491924875,"resto":120610563,"id":"n0FX2nnR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120612088,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:42:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Vice is seizing the means of production","time":1491925329,"resto":120610563,"id":"BMfEOZBX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

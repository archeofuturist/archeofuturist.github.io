The only difference between me and the lib shills was my burning hatred of fat people.<br><br>I&#039;m not entirely sure where it all went wrong, but my only semi-redpilled friend introduced me to 4chan during my second semester of University. I started browsing fit (was already lifting before then) and pol (because I enjoyed larping as a nazi). <br><br>Well. The fun and games are over now. This board was all satire for me but the longer I lurked, the more I began to agree with things that people were saying. It wasn&#039;t long until I became a full blown natsoc, ffs I even risked my university career writing my term paper on the holohoax.<br><br>Now all my normie friends are gone, I couldn&#039;t stand them anymore. I have a handful of friends but none of them share the same views as I do. I know so much and I want to share it with them but everytime I try, I just seem mad and nobody ever takes it seriously. I feel like I&#039;m going insane. I&#039;m so isolated and out of touch with the people around me, lately I&#039;ve become so unmotivated I could barely do my school work.<br><br>I don&#039;t know what to do <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tldr redpill gave me depression, I have no one who shares my views.

For example, Regnerus (2012c) acknowledges that, according to the aforementioned calendar data, over half of the respondents never lived with a parent\u2019s same-sex partner, but fails to mention that many respondents\u2014approximately one-third\u2014also never lived with their same-sex parents or lived with them very briefly.<br>This likely means that a sizable number of the 236 respondents counted as \u201craised by\u201d lesbian mothers and gay fathers had not, in fact, been raised by same-sex parents. For example, nine of the responses likely came from jokesters:<br><br>The most blatant example of highly suspicious responses is the case of a 25 year-old man who reports that his father had a romantic relationship with another man, but also reports that he (the respondent) was 7-feet 8-inches tall, weighed 88 pounds, was married 8 times and had 8 children. Other examples include a respondent who claims to have been arrested at age 1 and another who spent an implausibly short amount of time (less than 10 minutes) to complete the survey.<br><br>Another 53 of the 236 responses came from children who lived with gay mothers or fathers for less than a year. Another 20 came from respondents whose entries were otherwise inconsistent or improbable.

These patterns also are highly fragile and based in part on a couple of influential cases or outliers. Admittedly, even with a large overall sample, a subsample of 51 cases still limits the statistical power of the analysis. Still, the results are either inconclusive or suggestive that adult children raised by same-sex two-parent families show a comparable adult profile to their peers raised by two-biological-parent families.<br><br>http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/scienc<wbr>e\/article\/pii\/S0049089X1500085X","time":1490271805,"resto":117919018,"id":"2klkjHJX","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117924921,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)08:24:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117923505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117923505<\/a><br>The hairline, my God this freak show is hilarious.","time":1490271894,"resto":117919018,"id":"kyBsiFf5","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":117924999,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)08:25:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117924797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117924797<\/a><br>thanks for the info<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have to pay 40 dollars to read a paper that&#039;s disproving the results of a paper that was released for free<\/span><br>fuck the academic jew","time":1490271948,"resto":117919018,"id":"EhadiqFA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117925011,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)08:25:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117922251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117922251<\/a><br>Like fucking clockwork","filename":"735","ext":".gif","w":290,"h":189,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":81,"tim":1490271955474,"time":1490271955,"md5":"\/YKKw+z5lhqtSJJYqSGOKQ==","fsize":3037693,"resto":117919018,"id":"xjR8yeq3","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":117925110,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)08:27:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why are redditors so stupid?

For example, Regnerus (2012c) acknowledges that, according to the aforementioned calendar data, over half of the respondents never lived with a parent\u2019s same-sex partner, but fails to mention that many respondents\u2014approximately one-third\u2014also never lived with their same-sex parents or lived with them very briefly.<br>This likely means that a sizable number of the 236 respondents counted as \u201craised by\u201d lesbian mothers and gay fathers had not, in fact, been raised by same-sex parents. For example, nine of the responses likely came from jokesters:<br><br>The most blatant example of highly suspicious responses is the case of a 25 year-old man who reports that his father had a romantic relationship with another man, but also reports that he (the respondent) was 7-feet 8-inches tall, weighed 88 pounds, was married 8 times and had 8 children. Other examples include a respondent who claims to have been arrested at age 1 and another who spent an implausibly short amount of time (less than 10 minutes) to complete the survey.<br><br>Another 53 of the 236 responses came from children who lived with gay mothers or fathers for less than a year. Another 20 came from respondents whose entries were otherwise inconsistent or improbable.

There is no real way for you to &quot;unwillingly&quot; pay for other&#039;s gender reassignment, not yet at least.","time":1490274013,"resto":117919018,"id":"IRMELpBw","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117927781,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:00:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117926904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117926904<\/a><br>God has abandoned us","filename":"1485491679870","ext":".png","w":499,"h":484,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":121,"tim":1490274049067,"time":1490274049,"md5":"3CsxD7xYJg0yBb5zFQFe6A==","fsize":134756,"resto":117919018,"id":"kM\/FU9uT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117927798,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:01:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117923505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117923505<\/a><br>Holy shit he looks like such a beta cuck.","time":1490274062,"resto":117919018,"id":"5IXuESoL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117927809,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:01:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117927576\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117927576<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There&#039;s a sexual deviancy this &quot;man&quot; finds disturbing<\/span><br><br>Wew","time":1490274069,"resto":117919018,"id":"tYDaPXOm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117927848,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:01:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"jesus christ, reddit is fucked up","filename":"1468821615894","ext":".jpg","w":685,"h":685,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490274097535,"time":1490274097,"md5":"eMwEyw5GNForWmfWJISJXg==","fsize":37514,"resto":117919018,"id":"a5CPuv8C","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117927876,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:01:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117927387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117927387<\/a><br>how do i become a muslim?

Every-time wall-street has a bad year the premiums jump 5000% with no connection to the actual cost of care. Combined with the fact that insurance schemes like banks also cant handle all debts being called at once and you realize this system is pure moral hazard.<br><br>If their investments do well they provide coverage and enjoy the profit. If it goes bad they get bailed out by the federal government because people arent going to just not receive care.<br><br>Like 90% of the stuff in the usa insurance companies were a great idea when they were local and profession based, but now they are just another costly level of bureaucracy.","filename":"cf906cfe3c[1]","ext":".jpg","w":645,"h":673,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490523557738,"time":1490523557,"md5":"aQqyCL9HbK82iGJ9\/g07IQ==","fsize":102413,"resto":118334745,"id":"ZPhO2\/Tt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118347588,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)06:23:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118336328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118336328<\/a><br>Nigs and Spics go to the emergency room for the flu, and legally the hospitals can&#039;t turn them away.","time":1490523787,"resto":118334745,"id":"TlIiP1WJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118347600,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)06:23:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Health insurance companies need to die, and quickly.

Democracy doesn&#039;t work in the middle east and the Arab Spring ended in utter failure. Example would be Egypt, Mubarak stepped down and the people immediatley voted in someone from the Muslim brotherhood. So the military did a coup and put back an authoritarian, secular leader, Sisi, to prevent islamic law from overtaking Egypt, so they&#039;re pretty much back at square one<br><br>Also point out how the US supports other dictators, and their interventions were never about democracy, ever. Otherwise the authoritarian (and sometimes totalitarian) states they support would of been invaded long ago<br><br>It&#039;s not about democracy, was never about democracy, that&#039;s only something they say to get the public&#039;s support.

The main uses of hemp fiber were inrope, sacking, carpet, nets and webbing.

This was traditionally followed by retting, either water retting whereby the bundled hemp floats in water or dew retting whereby the hemp remains on the ground and is affected by the moisture in dew moisture, and by moulds and bacterial action. Modern processes use steam and machinery to separate the fiber, a process known as thermo-mechanical pulping.<br><br>Fuel<br><br>Fuel can be a by-product of hemp cultivation.

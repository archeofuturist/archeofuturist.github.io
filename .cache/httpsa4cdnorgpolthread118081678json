There are tons of free language programs where you go to class 3-4 times a week to learn Italian. Honestly it&#039;s not a difficult language to learn. The only thing that will take time is understanding other people, they talk so fast. <br><br>You could find a job pretty easy teaching English. They&#039;re always looking for American English speakers for classroom work or to teach buisiness executives English and it pays well.","time":1490367959,"resto":118081678,"id":"Ocvpk0AG","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":118089230,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:06:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118088923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118088923<\/a><br>Haitians and Onatarians deserve some credit<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nah haitians are at least polite just slow as shit<\/span>","time":1490367973,"resto":118081678,"id":"HPZGIRWM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118089264,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:06:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118088769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118088769<\/a><br>HOLY SHIT....my english class is the exact same thing...she only talks about slavery and constantly promotes white guilt...I speak up almost every single time and tell her that what she is doing is creating a larger divide between the two groups of people, just shrugs it off.

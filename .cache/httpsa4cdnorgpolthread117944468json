So in rejecting the former they reject the latter as a &quot;natural&quot; extension because the only arguments for these values that they see in the media are appeals to religion.

Science deals with things we can observe and measure, but Christianity submits to a God whom we cannot fully understand (Catholic\/Orthodox use the term divine mystery for these things that we aren&#039;t capable of grasping). Trying to find specific evidence and prove something that takes faith to believe in is the wrong method, but I do see more evidence for Christianity than any other religion. Look at some of the philosophies that come out of Christianity, natural law is an interesting place to start. The ideas and civilizations that were produced from Christianity are the best evidence we can point to outside of faith. One thing that helped me was understanding that faith is not a natural virtue, but a supernatural one. Faith in God comes from God, everyone faces the question if God exists at some point and either cooperates with faith or finds a way to bury that faith in something else.","time":1490289140,"resto":117944468,"id":"QrBxBSZt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117954655,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)13:13:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117953110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117953110<\/a><br>Innate and irrational fears are a thing, but they don0t survive long without evidence, worship it&#039;s something else, brain studies consider it a different mind state plus many strong spiritual experiences simple don&#039;t occur around science.<br><br><a href=\"#p117953238\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117953238<\/a><br>It requires evidence, show me one evidence for spirits, or one atheist argument against God that doesn&#039;t implies that it doesn&#039;t exists because there&#039;s no evidence for it.<br><br><a href=\"#p117953598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117953598<\/a><br>Please do, if you aren&#039;t from \/x\/ go there, religions threads always get interesting.<br><br><a href=\"#p117953951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117953951<\/a><br>Crhistianity it&#039;s extremely flexible on idol worship, for starters christ it&#039;s an idol.<br><br><a href=\"#p117953955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117953955<\/a><br>The bible it&#039;s not the only book written by the western civilization, it should hold no more value than it words actually have.<br><br><a href=\"#p117954028\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117954028<\/a><br>Bla bla bla, die for God.<br><br><a href=\"#p117954057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117954057<\/a><br>Agriculture, it works is has sacred aspects let&#039;s worship that.<br><br><a href=\"#p117954562\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117954562<\/a><br>Faith.","time":1490289202,"resto":117944468,"id":"NRClHW\/9","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":117954761,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)13:14:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117944564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117944564<\/a><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/aQalQor5itQ<br><br>Learn your history","time":1490289261,"resto":117944468,"id":"IzJ7pdGV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117954807,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)13:14:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117952018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117952018<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;catholics have given us art, scientific discoveries. orthodox have given us philosophy, literature. what the fuck have you given us besides young earth museums and noah&#039;s ark in kentucky?<\/span><br><br>Nigga you live in a Protestant country.

No doubt with god one can more easily plant themselves firm with conviction to their morals but there is no reason I can see that one who has struggled to refine their sense of morality can not find that strength from within.

The religious sect in Judea, in the time of Jesus, to which self-styled &quot;Jews&quot; today refer to as &quot;Jews&quot;, were known as &quot;Pharisees&quot;. &quot;Judaism&quot; today and &quot;Pharisaism&quot; in the time of Jesus are the same.<br><br>Jesus abhorred and denounced &quot;Pharisaism&quot;; hence the words, &quot;Woe unto you Scribes and Pharisees, Hypocrites, Ye Serpents, Ye Generation of Vipers&quot;.","time":1490290523,"resto":117944468,"id":"X\/2lBoa1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117957129,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)13:35:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117944468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117944468<\/a><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Acq<wbr>aHxI5-P8","time":1490290541,"resto":117944468,"id":"Sm1M1iV9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117957185,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)13:36:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117956651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117956651<\/a><br>God spoke the beasts of the field, including monkeys, into existence.

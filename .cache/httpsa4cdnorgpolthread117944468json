This is the only path to the purification and salvation offered us by Christ Jesus.","time":1490289100,"resto":117944468,"country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117954508,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)13:11:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117954406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117954406<\/a><br>so death means what to you","time":1490289109,"resto":117944468,"country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117954562,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)13:12:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"It depends on how you approach it, like some other anons have already said religion is a belief and not a science. Science deals with things we can observe and measure, but Christianity submits to a God whom we cannot fully understand (Catholic\/Orthodox use the term divine mystery for these things that we aren&#039;t capable of grasping). Trying to find specific evidence and prove something that takes faith to believe in is the wrong method, but I do see more evidence for Christianity than any other religion. Look at some of the philosophies that come out of Christianity, natural law is an interesting place to start. The ideas and civilizations that were produced from Christianity are the best evidence we can point to outside of faith. One thing that helped me was understanding that faith is not a natural virtue, but a supernatural one. Faith in God comes from God, everyone faces the question if God exists at some point and either cooperates with faith or finds a way to bury that faith in something else.","time":1490289140,"resto":117944468,"country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117954655,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)13:13:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117953110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117953110<\/a><br>Innate and irrational fears are a thing, but they don0t survive long without evidence, worship it&#039;s something else, brain studies consider it a different mind state plus many strong spiritual experiences simple don&#039;t occur around science.<br><br><a href=\"#p117953238\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117953238<\/a><br>It requires evidence, show me one evidence for spirits, or one atheist argument against God that doesn&#039;t implies that it doesn&#039;t exists because there&#039;s no evidence for it.<br><br><a href=\"#p117953598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117953598<\/a><br>Please do, if you aren&#039;t from \/x\/ go there, religions threads always get interesting.<br><br><a href=\"#p117953951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117953951<\/a><br>Crhistianity it&#039;s extremely flexible on idol worship, for starters christ it&#039;s an idol.<br><br><a href=\"#p117953955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117953955<\/a><br>The bible it&#039;s not the only book written by the western civilization, it should hold no more value than it words actually have.<br><br><a href=\"#p117954028\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117954028<\/a><br>Bla bla bla, die for God.<br><br><a href=\"#p117954057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117954057<\/a><br>Agriculture, it works is has sacred aspects let&#039;s worship that.<br><br><a href=\"#p117954562\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117954562<\/a><br>Faith.","time":1490289202,"resto":117944468,"country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":117954761,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)13:14:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117944564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117944564<\/a><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/aQalQor5itQ<br><br>Learn your history","time":1490289261,"resto":117944468,"country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117954807,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)13:14:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117952018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117952018<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;catholics have given us art, scientific discoveries. orthodox have given us philosophy, literature. what the fuck have you given us besides young earth museums and noah&#039;s ark in kentucky?<\/span><br><br>Nigga you live in a Protestant country.

There is no Biblical knowledge other than &quot;Love the Lord your God above all things, and love thy neighbor as you would be loved.&quot; The entirety of the Christian faith is in those words, all else is simply a guide stone to lead us to Him and to the proper worship of Him.","time":1490290003,"resto":117944468,"country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117956161,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)13:27:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117955785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117955785<\/a><br>That makes 0 sense","time":1490290032,"resto":117944468,"country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117956183,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)13:27:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117954655\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117954655<\/a><br>Jesus is worthy of worship you mudslime.

I would say that any man who loves the Lord God with all his being, and who loves his neighbor as he loves himself, is surely on the path to salvation, no matter his feelings for Mary (as long as those feelings are just).","time":1490291368,"resto":117944468,"country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117958936,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)13:49:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117944468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117944468<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is the best evidence for Christianity?<\/span><br><br>Jews went out of their way to kill Jesus.

Thus, logos also means the Word\/Law. And for this to be a truly pure logos, it has to transcend beyond any man&#039;s argument; to the level of perfection.<br><br>This idea of logos is not religion-specific, as atheists can even identify with this natural phenomenon. Following logos=doing good\/love, absence of logos=Evil. The problem now is relating logos to the divine.<br><br>~~~<br><br>Since there is a logos for this and that, one would question if there is a primordial logos, which serves as the logos of all logos...like the reasoning\/cause\/truth behind every truth, the Single Equation that unifies all other equations. Something surely has to be pre-existent to maintain the order and balance of all the truths in the world?<br><br>This is where religions start to diversify. Some create an image of a diety\/dieties that maintain all logos in the world (God of this and that). Others view a single divine being\/object as the living manifestation of logos (like a super glue of all the truths, or like Eywa?). Still others can have it otherwise.<br><br>In Catholicism, John 1:1 (bible) mentions &quot;In the beginning was THE word (logos) [a pre-existing truth behind all truths], and the word was with God [God was keeping all logos in check], and the word WAS God [...because God is the cornerstone of everything pure, the Truth that explains all truths, the primordial logos].&quot;<br><br>St. Thomas Aquinas also tries to deepen this philosophical discourse even further in his Summa Theologica work.

This gives us the idea of a moral law. Now, whether this law is merely a terrible byproduct of evolution that makes us all act irrationally is another debate for another time, but for now, lets assume it has a more ambiguous quality like the consciousness, and that it exists with it rather than as a subset to it. If we are all compelled to behave a certain way, how could we have multiple Gods when they each want something different from us? Or perhaps more importantly, how could we have Gods separate from moral behavior in the first place (as many pagan Gods are). If you look at something like Zoroastrianism, how can we have two equally powerful forces if we are always compelled to feel good about behaving one way and guilty for acting in contrary? I would argue that just by observing moral behavior in humans, we learn two things: that, if there is a deity, it must be the source of moral law, and that there can only be one deity.<br>That leaves us with Judaism (which is not very applicable to non Jews), Christianity, and Islam (which I will discount for now, that&#039;s a debate for another day). Notice how the basis for arguing for religion already relies on a few assumptions. This I&#039;d argue is truly what we call faith. Not the bullshit that God will always care for you, but that you make certain assumptions to believe in his existence at all. I consider this to be a basic way of rationalizing God. Its not totally fleshed out, but it gives an image of how one could rationalize him. <br><br>The best evidence against any form of God? His existence is not guaranteed.

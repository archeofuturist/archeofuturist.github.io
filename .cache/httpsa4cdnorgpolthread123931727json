To facilitate this, I&#039;d create divisions between people based on religion, ideology, ethnicity, and geographic location. I&#039;d create an intense sense of nationalism, and I&#039;d create a narrative to justify state aggression - i.e. they&#039;re terrorists, they&#039;re hedonists, they&#039;re human rights violators, they&#039;re leeches, they&#039;re imperialists, etc.<br><br>I&#039;d coordinate for the figureheads of each state to be flamboyant showmen who would make a performance of brazenly insulting each other, to stoke patriotism at home and hatred abroad.<br><br>I&#039;d make loud, but slow and gradual, proclamations that we were getting closer to needing to use massive weapons like nuclear bombs.

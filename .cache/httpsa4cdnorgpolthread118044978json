I think this would be a huge political gamble that could cause the GOP to rebel. But it would probably be popular, and it seems like the current bill he&#039;s pushing is popular with no one. What does \/pol\/ think?<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Kz1<wbr>3ZNrJY5M<br><br>https:\/\/altright.com\/2017\/03\/23\/why<wbr>-trump-must-champion-universal-heal<wbr>thcare\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It won\u2019t be the Russia conspiracy or the \u201cDeep State.\u201d It won\u2019t be Olbermann, Maddow, and \u201cThe Resistance.\u201d It won\u2019t even be the bugbear of \u201cracism.\u201d No, the most likely thing that will bring down the presidency of Donald J. Trump is healthcare. Yes, healthcare. And the people to blame will be the \u201cmainstream\u201d Republicans who laid the trap.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The fact that Trump allowed himself to be tricked into supporting the current healthcare proposal reveals his own naivet\u00e9 and reminds us, once again, that the Beltway advisors who have surrounded him are objectively bad at politics. Rather than focus on immigration\u2014the issue that defined his candidacy\u2014Trump got sucked into a whirlpool of regulations, arcane policies, climate-change debates, and taxes. This is a shocking waste of political capital, and it is not why his supporters put him in office.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Looking beyond the hysteria of the past two months, if Marco Rubio or Jeb Bush had won the presidency instead Trump, each wouldn\u2019t have acted much differently in terms of policy, aside from the \u201cMuslim bans,\u201d which weren\u2019t actually Muslim bans and have been tossed out anyway. Trump\u2019s fights with the media are hilarious\u2014and serve the strategic purpose of delegitimizing these old-line institutions and the Left as a whole\u2014but they do little in terms of concrete change.<\/span>","filename":"all hail the great purging","ext":".jpg","w":288,"h":433,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490332313145,"time":1490332313,"md5":"Y1p0fd+BYXIDn7YtxB0AGQ==","fsize":20026,"resto":0,"id":"YGwjoUQG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"richard-spencer-on-healthcare","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

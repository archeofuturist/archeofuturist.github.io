I think this would be a huge political gamble that could cause the GOP to rebel. But it would probably be popular, and it seems like the current bill he&#039;s pushing is popular with no one.

Rather than focus on immigration\u2014the issue that defined his candidacy\u2014Trump got sucked into a whirlpool of regulations, arcane policies, climate-change debates, and taxes. This is a shocking waste of political capital, and it is not why his supporters put him in office.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Looking beyond the hysteria of the past two months, if Marco Rubio or Jeb Bush had won the presidency instead Trump, each wouldn\u2019t have acted much differently in terms of policy, aside from the \u201cMuslim bans,\u201d which weren\u2019t actually Muslim bans and have been tossed out anyway. Trump\u2019s fights with the media are hilarious\u2014and serve the strategic purpose of delegitimizing these old-line institutions and the Left as a whole\u2014but they do little in terms of concrete change.<\/span>","filename":"all hail the great purging","ext":".jpg","w":288,"h":433,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490332313145,"time":1490332313,"md5":"Y1p0fd+BYXIDn7YtxB0AGQ==","fsize":20026,"resto":0,"id":"YGwjoUQG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"richard-spencer-on-healthcare","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":118045376,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:15:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118044978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118044978<\/a><br>More important, the substance of Trump\u2019s healthcare plan is a fucking joke. What Trump partisans call \u201cRyancare\u201d or \u201cObamacare 2.0\u201d\u2014but which everyone else calls \u201cTrumpcare\u201d\u2014will increase costs on Trump\u2019s core constituency of White working-class voters, as even Breitbart points out.<br><br>The tedious goober Jason Chaffetz\u2014who won\u2019t defend the president when it comes to the synthetic Russia scandals but is fully aligned with Trump on this stupid bill\u2014has given the Democrats every campaign ad it will ever need when he said people will need to choose between their iPhone and their healthcare.<br><br>So let\u2019s call it what it is and not redirect the blame. Trumpcare is exactly the kind of Conservatism, Inc. idiocy we\u2019ve seen year in, year out, where the most loyal constituents of the American Right are given the shaft, while those who despise Republican voters are rewarded.<br><br>The spectacle of Paul Ryan giggling with Rich Lowry about how he has been dreaming of cutting Medicare \u201csince you and I were drinking out of kegs\u201d is nothing short of nauseating. Who could relate to such people?<br><br>Worse, Trumpcare violates what Trump himself clearly stated. The President promised \u201cinsurance for everybody\u201d in his Obamacare replacement plan. Trumpcare accomplishes nothing of the sort. The fundamental flaws in the old plan are preserved, and Ryan\u2019s bill cuts benefits to Trump\u2019s voters in order to keep the system going.","time":1490332532,"resto":118044978,"id":"YGwjoUQG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118045438,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:15:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118045376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118045376<\/a><br>Lindsey Graham has suggested that, rather than put forth a new bill, we should just let Obamacare collapse and foist the blame onto the Democrats. Perhaps this is a better strategy than what is being pursued . . . but it is based on the faulty conservative premise that \u201cObama\u2019s socialism\u201d is set for an imminent and precipitous breakdown. The far more likely scenario is that Obamacare\u2014much like Medicare, Medicaid, and the rest of the \u201csocialism\u201d in Washington\u2014will limp along for decades, maybe even a century, on borrowed money.<br><br>As mentioned, the fundament flaw of Trumpcare is the same as Obamacare: they are insurance schemes and not healthcare programs.<br><br>Taking a step back, what we call \u201chealth insurance\u201d today is not truly insurance in the proper sense of the word. Essential to the concept of insurance is that no one expects to use it. For the holder, insurance is a hedge against unforeseen, rare, and catastrophic outcomes. For the lender, insurance is a bet that the holder won\u2019t call in the liability. The classic insurance scenario, which dates back to the age of Hammurabi, is when merchants take out loans contingent on a vessel\u2019s safe return from a voyage; if the ship were to sink at sea, the loan would not have to be repaid.<br><br>Today, what is called \u201chealth insurance\u201d is better understood as a pre-payment or installment program. Everyone expects to use their \u201cinsurance\u201d many time a year. Both Trumpcare and Obamacare seek to lower these installment payments by creating mandates and incentives that pool the healthy and the sick, the young and old, as a way of averaging out costs. Fiddling with this absurd model is much like trying to repair a car\u2019s engine by giving it a new paint job.<br><br>Moreover, the fact that America has decided to socialize the insurance market, as opposed to socializing healthcare providers, reveals something important about our collective psyche and delusions.","time":1490332557,"resto":118044978,"id":"YGwjoUQG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn\u2019t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.<br>He said, \u201cOh, like you\u2019re doing now?\u201d<br>I was taken aback, and all I could say was \u201cHuh?\u201d but he kept cutting me off and going \u201chuh? huh? huh?\u201d and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.<br>The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like \u201cSir, you need to pay for those first.\u201d At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.<br>When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually \u201cto prevent any electrical infetterence,\u201d and then turned around and winked at me. I don\u2019t even think that\u2019s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.","time":1490668660,"resto":118598760,"id":"9J\/jvYUo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

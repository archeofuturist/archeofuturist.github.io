The native born population probably consists of a high amount of 2nd\/3rd generation ethnic minorities.<br><br>Street stabbings this year are up about 40%. I cannot open up my local newspaper or watch the evening news without seeing multiple stories of knife\/gun fatalities.<br><br>There is no &quot;London&quot;. It&#039;s a bunch of people wanting to live amongst the excitement of a big city, yet it has absolutely no identity. The people belong nowhere. In an attempt to conjure up some vague notion of identity, they repeat political slogans about diversity and multiculturalism. Most of them have no sense of the UK outside of London, and many of them will fuck off after Brexit to Berlin, Paris or some other world city where they will be more comfortable.<br><br>Most irksome of all is the fact that, when these barren women decide they might actually want to shit out a down syndrome baby after all, they will up and leave London. They will get the fuck out. They aren&#039;t sending their lovely child to a fucking school in Newham. They are hypocrites.<br><br>Housing was one of the big issues of the Mayoral election, and whenever the UKIP candidate tried to address immigration, the audience would boo him. They were whining about no affordable housing and then hissing the UKIP candidate for suggesting mass immigration in London\/South East plays a massive role.<br><br>So fuck them and their empty words. Le them refer to people as &#039;Little Englanders&#039; and &#039;Rural plebs&#039; as their fellow city dwellers are raped in Stratford and knifed in Harlesden. They are irrelevant to the English nation.","filename":"1486237756244","ext":".webm","w":500,"h":524,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493954430101,"time":1493954430,"md5":"6neOruaaypYYWOPy4r2y1A==","fsize":3016525,"resto":124155438,"id":"PCCCU\/2N","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124157031,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:20:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"have the SNP held off against the dyke yet?","time":1493954453,"resto":124155438,"id":"uOGBOBLw","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124157415,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:24:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124155760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124155760<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No Scottish results till after 08:00<\/span><br>is this because they use that meme voting system?","time":1493954694,"resto":124155438,"id":"uOGBOBLw","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124157567,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:26:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"Every Egg left unfertilised in that barren womb, has allowed her to unleash her untapped potential to Mother us all.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Heaven for-fend.<\/span>","filename":"may t","ext":".jpg","w":464,"h":397,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":106,"tim":1493954779280,"time":1493954779,"md5":"waQftvv1K1z4vYtDm2fEZw==","fsize":33385,"resto":124155438,"id":"JqbvQ6sz","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124157700,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:27:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124156891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124156891<\/a><br>Lad.

Sit back, breathe, clear your mind, and consider the situation rationally. <br><br>Reports claim Trump is *considering* military action in Syria. Military action is one of many options Trump could consider in response to the supposed gas attacks by Assad.<br><br>What kind of leader would he be if he didn&#039;t consider every possible option, weigh the pros and cons, and base his decision on the most practical way forward?<br><br>He doesn&#039;t want to be another Dubya, make an already unstable region worse, and take the blame for it. He doesn&#039;t want his other plans sidelined while he&#039;s conducting a war. And he doesn&#039;t want to initiate conflict with other world powers that could lead to a broader scale war.<br><br>He&#039;s letting it be known that he&#039;s considering military options, so the media and political establishment don&#039;t label him a heartless coward who doesn&#039;t care about babies being gassed.<br><br>In the next few days he will give a speech to the American people condemning the attacks, explaining that he considered the possibility of military action carefully, and decided it&#039;s not the best course of action for America or the world.<br><br>He&#039;s not going to do it.

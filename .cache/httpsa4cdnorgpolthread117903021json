Muslims bow to it 5 times a day no matter where they are. Also they behead Christians. Kinda crazy how perfectly accurate the Bible is huh? Lucifer is a fallen angel and is called a fallen star multiple times, the Kaaba contains a &quot;holy&quot; meteorite that they call a fallen star. It&#039;s the image of Satan aka Allah","time":1490266997,"resto":117903021,"id":"ihlta7su","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117919417,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)07:07:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117903021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117903021<\/a><br>its a ufo<br>WE WUZ","time":1490267277,"resto":117903021,"id":"Rp\/1NP\/8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117920002,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)07:16:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117904240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117904240<\/a><br>John 14:6<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.<\/span>","time":1490267775,"resto":117903021,"id":"0rD5cge2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117920055,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)07:16:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"There are nuclear weapons that can turn that into a radioactive wasteland for thousands of years.

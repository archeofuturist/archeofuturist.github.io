The twelve Judges of Israel, known to you as Apostles, will rule over the faithful, who will be reborn and shall never thirst, nor want, but shall be like angels in the sight of the Lord God.","time":1490318195,"resto":118008823,"id":"GiyDJNjF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118017620,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)21:17:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118017525\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118017525<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ethnic paganism is the true way.<\/span><br><br>too larpy<br><br>what is wrong with good ol&#039; pragmatism deism? the founding fathers were deists","time":1490318229,"resto":118008823,"id":"SO5d95Dr","country":"PA","country_name":"Panama"},{"no":118017739,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)21:18:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118010955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118010955<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Christianity isn&#039;t cucked<\/span>","filename":"A473225B-AE1B-4D21-B837-3B2CEAB65FF7-210-0000009BB7198864_tmp","ext":".png","w":922,"h":920,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490318287644,"time":1490318287,"md5":"Ax5J5cIxMqDi1wjGsHqMoA==","fsize":860729,"resto":118008823,"id":"VlqXsQyQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118017833,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)21:18:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118016217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118016217<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Acts 20:28-31King James Version (KJV)<\/span><br><br>28 Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.<br><br>29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.<br><br>30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.<br><br>31 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears<br><br>This is why I believe in sola escritura.<br><br>Those who don&#039;t end up like this:","filename":"KISSER OF THE NIGGERFOOT","ext":".jpg","w":471,"h":509,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490318328789,"time":1490318328,"md5":"ixIadxcEkZaGUJpgskkpIw==","fsize":55545,"resto":118008823,"id":"c6EJoP1U","country":"DO","country_name":"Dominican Republic"},{"no":118017920,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)21:19:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118017547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118017547<\/a><br><br>if the world is fated to fall into darkness and Jesus will use magic to fix everything at the end, why take political action? why reproduce? why even post in this website?<br><br>Ultimately Christians are self-declared non-actors in the shaping of the future, which is why the Left has completely smashed them culturally ever since christians started to take the gospel seriously","time":1490318364,"resto":118008823,"id":"SO5d95Dr","country":"PA","country_name":"Panama"},{"no":118017982,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)21:19:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118017620\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118017620<\/a><br>Ok, this whole &quot;muh LARP&quot; has gotta stop.

It was filled with atheists and Protestants. Many IRA members were not even Irish. <br><br>The attack above was on the financial district and was welcomed by many people in the UK who hated Thatcher. The bomb was set off late at night -during the weekend - to AVOID civilian causalities. There was a couple of unfortunate deaths of people who wandered into the attack. If Jihadists had the technical sophistication of the IRA, we would be talking thousands people dead. Pray that the Jihadist never reach that level. The IRA were a completely professional military operation and could have killed hundreds of thousands if they wanted.<br><br>To compare this to what took place the other day, Paris or any other Muslim attack is bullshit. I say this as an Irish person who not a Republican and has no love for the IRA. The IRA bombed the UK to get British Troops out of Northern Ireland. When the British Troops left, the IRA stopped bombing. Jihadist murder to force their religion on the UK and other nations.<br><br>Irish people living in the UK were burnt out of their homes during these years by National Front types, suffered terrible discrimination with no Lefties\/PC types to stand up for them and THEY did not hold it against all English people.<br><br>Memes and the truth\/complexity are often two very different things.","time":1490542049,"resto":118371934,"id":"Kk50Nq5t","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":118372452,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:27:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118372071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118372071<\/a><br>1984 is alive and well, I see.","time":1490542073,"resto":118371934,"id":"HpSF4To8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Internet wasn&#039;t like what it is today. I really wanted to be an electrician and did my best to look up the requirements and study. Eventually my grandfather spots the ad in the paper. So I head down to the IBEW in Pittsburgh. There was a line out to the parking lot. I take my aptitude test, which I&#039;m sure I passed. I finally manage a quick interview. I catch the guy before me talking about how his dad and uncle are electricans. He looks like shit and guaranteed he did poor on the test. <br><br>My interviewer obviously had no interest in me because I was an outsider with no family in the business. I tried to explain the research and effort I put, but they didn&#039;t care. <br><br>And that is how I became an accountant. To eventually help stop business from wasting money on unions. Proud to say I managed to replace or cut many union jobs in Pittsburgh.","filename":"IMG_0860","ext":".jpg","w":575,"h":385,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490334481331,"time":1490334481,"md5":"kEwDreXpaiWnqsEg+eNUTQ==","fsize":37270,"resto":118046693,"id":"e7DonBFM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118048586,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:48:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118046693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118046693<\/a>","filename":"8-bit-jew-bank","ext":".gif","w":709,"h":443,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1490334523820,"time":1490334523,"md5":"mpFQtOqae\/e8D3WiH3yx7w==","fsize":320689,"resto":118046693,"id":"lIlsUqH1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118048588,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:48:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118046693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118046693<\/a><br>why are women being educated?","time":1490334525,"resto":118046693,"id":"YqilM9U6","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118048626,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:49:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Because it&#039;s easier to indoctrinate someone if you constantly wash their brains with sjw bullshit.","time":1490334545,"resto":118046693,"id":"d57e6u52","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118048831,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:51:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118046693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118046693<\/a><br>Wtf that guy was my professor when I was studying abroad, isn&#039;t his name Alan?

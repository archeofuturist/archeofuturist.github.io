Let&#039;s drop some facts about Christianity and European paganism:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;European paganism dominant across the continent and remained mostly the same with small changes dependent on geography (eg Zeus - &gt; Jupiter) for thousands of years<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;From these paganistic beliefs and virtues, the greatest empires and civilizations ever known to the West rose <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Roman Republic and Roman Empire, Greek city-states and Macedonia, etc. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all founded and maintained on the basis of European paganism for centuries<\/span><br><br>Then, suddenly:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a new religion, semitic in nature, based off of the middle eastern religion of Judaism arises <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;its tenets tell its followers to see the Jews as chosen, to be universalist and prioritize a multiculturalist society of Christ worship over the preservation of individual race and culture<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;within 2 centuries of Christianity becoming dominant Rome falls while surrounded with societal degeneracy <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;for the following 1000 or so years Europe sits weakened while surrounded by a massively growing Islamic caliphate. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Almighty Christianity prevents the Europeans from doing anything other than launching a few crusades in retaliation to brutal attacks and massive Islamic expansion <\/span><br><br>Here&#039;s a redpill: Europe rose to power in spite of Christianity, not because of it. If we want to truly go back to our cultural and blood roots and defend against the Islamic, Jewish, and degenerate menace, we should return to pagan traditions and ideals.","filename":"ba4fd0f","ext":".jpg","w":738,"h":606,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":205,"tim":1493680776144,"time":1493680776,"md5":"fhIIEydRjJua6J8lxq0IYw==","fsize":70654,"resto":0,"id":"0w1p1RqY","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hello-anons-lets-drop-some-facts-about","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123690442,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)19:24:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123689824\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123689824<\/a><br>Goldstein","time":1493681096,"resto":123689824,"id":"esnxwHw4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

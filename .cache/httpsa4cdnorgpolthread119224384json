Believe it or not, despite the MSM&#039;s shilling, most men would like to have kids and start a family someday. If that&#039;s not for you then fine, live your life alone, but you can&#039;t turn around after years of whoring it up and expect to be trusted the same as someone who hasn&#039;t. <br><br>Also considering that most people start having sex at 16, if you&#039;ve been slutting it up all the way to 25, that&#039;s still 8 years of it.

The second two points come from the first section of waiting until marriage. First and foremost you will not be burdened by child rearing too early.

You do a great disservice to yourselves and your child if you bring them into the world when you are not ready for them.<br><br>Secondly withholding sex until marriage allows you and your wife\/husband to grow in spirit and not flesh. A man and a woman should be content with each other in spirit before they engage in passions of the sex. We all see the drawbacks of a society that pursues flesh before spirit and rushes into marriage too quickly. How can the touch of a woman&#039;s lips or the her hands hold value if you rush too quickly to feel her from within?

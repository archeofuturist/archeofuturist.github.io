Believe it or not, despite the MSM&#039;s shilling, most men would like to have kids and start a family someday. If that&#039;s not for you then fine, live your life alone, but you can&#039;t turn around after years of whoring it up and expect to be trusted the same as someone who hasn&#039;t. <br><br>Also considering that most people start having sex at 16, if you&#039;ve been slutting it up all the way to 25, that&#039;s still 8 years of it.

A man and a woman should be content with each other in spirit before they engage in passions of the sex.

Zietsch, a psychologist at the University of Queensland, Australia, has tried to determine whether some people are just more inclined toward infidelity. In a study of nearly 7,400 Finnish twins and their siblings who had all been in a relationship for at least one year, Dr. Zietsch looked at the link between promiscuity and specific variants of vasopressin and oxytocin receptor genes. <br>Other studies confirm that oxytocin and vasopressin are linked to partner bonding, which bears on the question of promiscuity since emotional bonding is, in a sense, the inverse of promiscuity. <br>Data in animals confirm that these two hormones are significant players when it comes to sexual behavior. It turns out that there are two closely related species of voles: montane voles, which are sexually promiscuous, and prairie voles, which are sexually monogamous and raise their extended families in burrows.<br>After sex, prairie voles quickly develop a selective and enduring preference for their mate, while mating for montane voles is more of a one-night stand.<br> Using a virus as a delivery vehicle to transmit the vasopressin receptor gene, it\u2019s easy to artificially boost the number of vasopressin receptors in the brain\u2019s reward center, and make a male vole behave monogamously. The story for female voles is similar except that it is oxytocin, not vasopressin, that triggers monogamous behavior.<br><br>moar <br><br>https:\/\/www2.psy.uq.edu.au\/~uqbziet<wbr>s\/Zietsch%20et%20al%202014%20Geneti<wbr>c%20analysis%20of%20extrapair%20mat<wbr>ing.pdf","time":1491164312,"resto":119224384,"id":"cO4lydEl","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":119240773,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)16:19:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119224384\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119224384<\/a><br>Because it&#039;s an enjoyable pastime because it BTFO leftards who then rage and whinge causing more chaos and more conflict and LULZ.<br><br>Chaos pleases the Great KEK.","time":1491164342,"resto":119224384,"id":"NViVbYbn","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119240974,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)16:21:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119225408\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119225408<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;like guys do all the time<\/span><br>probably not speaking for all of \/pol\/, but i am against that as well<br>first, sex is something intimate that shouldn&#039;t just be shared with anyone, second, even though people obviously deny it, it forms strong bonds<br>so you will either never really get over the first person you did it with, or the whole meaning of relationships get lost to you and you become less and less able to have a serious one","time":1491164464,"resto":119224384,"id":"x6VVy85D","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119241282,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)16:23:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;A person who sleep with 100 men are degenerates.

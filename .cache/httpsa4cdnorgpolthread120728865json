Of course, some of you cucks will interpret that as anarchy, but needless to say this stops at harm to others.

That&#039;s the sort of thing I want to put people against the wall for. And I would. Shit like a stance on the death penalty has nothing to do with liberalism. The death penalty doesn&#039;t stop anyone from enjoying freedom. In fact, in my system, it would enhance that ability.<br><br>One caveat: I acknowledge the existence and importance of culture.

I support very strong civil liberties and also good border control, fiscal conservatism, free trade, free markets, and well-chosen social safety nets. I want a foreign policy of non-interventionism, but I want people to be able to go fight overseas as private individuals if they want to (to the extent that this does not endanger the home nation, of course). I&#039;m a race realist (I think some races are more intelligent on average than others) but I don&#039;t want this to influence politics. I don&#039;t support racially discriminatory government policies or eugenics. But if you want to make a whites-only club, I think you should be able to. And I don&#039;t give a shit what people say no matter how offensive, as long as they don&#039;t threaten violence. I support major police and justice system reform. The justice system is backed up too much. It needs more attention. I support legalizing all drugs, which is the right thing to do anyway but it will also help the justice system. We need better law and order. Cops should focus more on violent crime, less on other types of crime, than they do at present. When it comes to culture, I don&#039;t give a shit what people do as long as it doesn&#039;t hurt others. If you like wearing blue wigs, reassigning your gender, and filming your girlfriend fucking black guys, more power to you. I really don&#039;t care. If you like dressing up like a Nazi and saluting Hitler posters in your basement while masturbating, I don&#039;t care either. Of course, people might ask what I think about demographics, white genocide, and so on... in short, I think it should be handled by clamping down on illegal immigration and reforming the welfare system to disincentivize poor people from having children.

All the people who worship militarism and that whole way of thinking might want to ask themselves how those sorts of nations where the military becomes the top level of society have done lately... Germany brutally defeated twice in 30 years... Japan brutally defeated... meanwhile the nations that have done best are ones with strong militaries, but civilian rule and strong non-military civic institutions.","time":1491988320,"resto":120728865,"id":"6Cd3m+Ug","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120735814,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:12:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120728865\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120728865<\/a><br><br>I want designer babies, designer babies will fix everything.","time":1491988322,"resto":120728865,"id":"eKn9pLH1","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120735828,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:12:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120735687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120735687<\/a><br>true, but there&#039;s no such thing as a perfect system.","time":1491988334,"resto":120728865,"id":"1G56Tiyu","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120735859,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:12:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fence sitter","filename":"1491241933000","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491988367807,"time":1491988367,"md5":"kdOYl3238N7GDEwZejU\/yQ==","fsize":44242,"resto":120728865,"id":"IBlNxUnE","country":"MK","country_name":"Macedonia"},{"no":120735923,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:13:46","name":"Praceteom","com":"<a href=\"#p120728865\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120728865<\/a><br>Christian.<br>Which means pacifist.<br>Which means anarchist.","time":1491988426,"resto":120728865,"id":"9orcO6os","country":"US","trip":"!!nRmWeBC0+kN","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120735941,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:14:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120735800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120735800<\/a>","filename":"1491184851626","ext":".gif","w":149,"h":181,"tn_w":102,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491988441697,"time":1491988441,"md5":"JKWpsOgP1oxFaNEIj38Jcw==","fsize":856482,"resto":120728865,"id":"YbTRswxu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120735961,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:14:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120728865\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120728865<\/a><br>Fascist, primarily inspired by Mosley.","time":1491988456,"resto":120728865,"id":"Ri9WFUJf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120736011,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:15:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"I dunno like centrist I guess","time":1491988506,"resto":120728865,"id":"79Oi1dPs","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120736079,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:16:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m a Radical Centrist :)","time":1491988590,"resto":120728865,"id":"bW\/GN88T","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120736179,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:18:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"British Fascism, adjusted for the modern world.","time":1491988692,"resto":120728865,"id":"Qztpi+U0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120736213,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:18:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120736179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120736179<\/a><br>British Fascism best Fascism.","time":1491988736,"resto":120728865,"id":"Ri9WFUJf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120736268,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:19:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120728865\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120728865<\/a><br>Libertarian but believes in border control.

With respect to Hillary Clinton, there was ZERO effect on her campaign because they were simply an indictment of the DNC ran under Obama era, revealing massive pay to play ordeals. However, NO news station picked up on the DNC leaks because you had to combthrough spans of financial documents and connect dots. What was damaging about those leaks was that the SSN, phone, and most personal details of mega millionaires were leaked into the net. Th DNC leaks very well could have been from Eastern Europe or Russia, and as the result of a hack. The podesta emails were received from a phishing scheme that may or may not have been launched by Russian agents.

April 19, 1775 - Battle of Lexington &amp; Concord, which made the Masonic-led Revolutionary War inevitable<br><br>(2). April 19, 1943 - After trapping the last Jewish Resistance Fighters in a storm drain in Warsaw, and holding them for several days, Nazi Storm Troopers began to pour fire into each end of the storm drain, using flame-throwers. They continued pouring the fire into the drain until all fighters were dead. Blood sacrifice brought about by a fiery conflagration.<br><br>(3) April 19, 1993 - 50 years later, to the day, government troops, tanks, and other military equipment stormed the compound of David Koresh and his followers at Waco, Texas. Certainly, this operation fulfilled the basic requirements for a human sacrifice: trauma, fire, and young sacrificial victims.<br><br>(4) April 19, 1995 - Oklahoma City bombing - Once again, many young children were killed this day<br>April 19 of any year in the 20th Century is a day of fearful contemplation, for it seems that, as we head into the final stretch of time, Satan is becoming more and more bold, and is using April 19 more often.","time":1490357846,"resto":118059984,"id":"n04wmlvy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118074721,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)08:17:26","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1490209868917","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":230,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1490357846303,"time":1490357846,"md5":"sTkvuJusL1i8seIP7M00sw==","fsize":52011,"resto":118059984,"id":"P8MFnHcj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118074800,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)08:18:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118074517\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118074517<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;to smart to win<\/span><br>unlike the journalist","filename":"index","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":201,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1490357904738,"time":1490357904,"md5":"o8EhhPGarXUYWONAIG2Wdg==","fsize":11555,"resto":118059984,"id":"OEbTBGfO","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118074842,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)08:19:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"if you work for the govt you have a id badge with a chip needed to log into network. every keystroke, everything printed, and uploads are logged.

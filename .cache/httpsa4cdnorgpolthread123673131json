I&#039;ve been thinking about it lately. <br><br>What stops a trendy political protest among millennials from collectively defaulting on student loans as a protest against the government? From what I understand, the overwhelming majority of student loans are government backed, so it&#039;s not like banks would hurt too much. However, whether the the market bubble inevitably pops, automation reaches the point of the majority of millennials being unemployed or people get fed up enough with the ((status quo)), what would happen if the majority of indebted students just all stopped paying their student loans? There really is nothing stopping it from happening. If 20% of students did it, it wouldn&#039;t really be effective as they&#039;d just have their assets seized and the train would keep chugging along. If &gt;80% just stopped paying, I can&#039;t think of any feasible way the government would deal with it.<br><br>As it stands now, the total debt is at $1.3 trillion in the United States. I&#039;m sure the US treasury could deal with the hit, as money is really no object to them. But if they lost that money, would they still give out loans? And if they stopped giving out loans because defaulting became trendy, could universities survive without the government propping up their exuberant tuition prices?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;75% of students have student loans<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If it reached critical mass where &gt;80% of student loans defaulted, how could the government shackle an entire generation that is rapidly losing employment prospect to automation\/monopolization? <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Student loans can&#039;t be discharged, and even if tax returns are garnished, that probably wouldn&#039;t even cover the interest on an $80k loan with interest.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If they&#039;re unemployed, they can&#039;t get their wages garnished. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Millennials thrive on narcissism and would get those warm feels as they join all of their friends in &#039;rejecting the system, mannnn&#039; by posting videos of them burning their student loan statements on their social media accounts.<\/span><br><br>what happens?","filename":"studentdebt","ext":".png","w":615,"h":450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":182,"tim":1493672850102,"time":1493672850,"md5":"hmgaNqyym1yj5vH9pJffrw==","fsize":24654,"resto":0,"id":"x8DsJaOO","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"your-80k-ba-in-pottery-is-useless","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123673394,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)17:09:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123673131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123673131<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pottery<\/span><br>Become a potter.<br><br>People will always need nice pots.","time":1493672965,"resto":123673131,"id":"qzudwTEF","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123673646,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)17:11:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"The government backs it so they fuck you in other ways.

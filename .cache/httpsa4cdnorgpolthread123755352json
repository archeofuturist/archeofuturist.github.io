Nearly all definitions include something along the lines of this: Fascism is an ideology, a movement, that is nationalist, authoritarian &amp; totalitarian in nature. It has the goals of creating a regulated economic structure in order to transform social relations within a modern culture. It advocates for the mass mobilization of society under a one-party state with a single leader; it has a positive view of violence; it promotes masculinity, strength, youth &amp; charismatic actions\/leadership. Fascists have imperial ambitions, support the idea of a military citizenship in which all members of society have the obligation to involve themselves with the military in some manner, support the idea of total war, &amp; reject the ideal of &quot;perpetual peace God, along with democracy, communism, liberalism &amp; conservatism<br><a href=\"#p123756352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123756352<\/a><br>for the love of god kill yourself","time":1493723530,"resto":123755352,"id":"dm4C6Tld","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123756741,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)07:12:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123756286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123756286<\/a><br><br>Well it is nice to know you fight injustice with an extreme bias.

Whatever this elite faction wants is what happens. Implementing it is simply a mundane matter of crafting some propaganda messaging campaign. Voting is controlled by whoever has the best propaganda, and therefore whoever has the most funding usually wins.<br><br>This is the way things have always functioned in society. There is an elite faction that rises to the top and leads the people. The goal for accomplishing your ethnic and political interests is to get a group of elites that&#039;s on your side. We can pretend it&#039;s about democracy all day long, but this is the reality.<br><br>Second you have to realize that people evolved to be tribal. People really aren&#039;t compatible with others outside their ethnic group. The Putnam studies show for example that in multi-racial neighborhoods there is less trust, people go out less, have less friends, less kids, are less sociable....etc. Generally the cocoon in their houses and avoid social interaction. The only real sense of community is found between members of the same culture and race, things mesh like well machined gears. <br><br>And of course, not all races are genetically gifted with the same talents. For example, whites have much higher IQ&#039;s than blacks. Therefore you&#039;ll always expect a white society to be less violent, have a higher standard of living, more social trust....etc. This is because of the nature of what white people are and how they evolved. If you throw a bunch of minorities in the mix, all of a sudden you&#039;ve thrown a bunch of sand in the gears. Blacks in the US commit over 50% of the murders, and have destroyed some of America&#039;s greatest cities. <br><br>Therefore, fascism emphasizes your racial and cultural identity","time":1493724060,"resto":123755352,"id":"+5Lupjtj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123757552,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)07:24:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123756261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123756261<\/a><br>This antifa is working with isis.","filename":"isis_vs_antifas_by_neetsfagging322297-d9x22uu","ext":".jpg","w":492,"h":350,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1493724279233,"time":1493724279,"md5":"GWo0mTte1m2\/TCb8BFZZBA==","fsize":60062,"resto":123755352,"id":"pyOaB7to","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":123757765,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)07:27:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123757173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123757173<\/a><br><br>Hmmm.

A fascist government is like a defense attorney furiously arguing for the interests of their people and their way of life. It is traditionalist in that sense.<br><br>For example, in the modern US, people lack direction. This fantasy of the free market has left millions of people without purpose, higher ideals, or any foreseeable path forward. Most people are not hyper-rational, self-motivated entrepreneurs who can navigate the pitfalls of the market. Most people need someone telling them how to act, what to do\/not to do, what to think to a certain extent, what ideals to have. They need discipline and rigor imposed upon them. To let them blow in the winds of the market like a tattered flag is to throw them to the wolves, it&#039;s incredibly cruel.<br><br>Only a very few people rise to the level of self-determination that enables them to be a free agent. These are the people with the right to rule, the elites. They are genetically different, bred for this role. They usually have leadership qualities observable from even a very young age. The monarchs of old had carefully managed bloodlines for this very purpose, to produce the absolute best leaders for the people.","filename":"cathedral-m-agius-design","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":639,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493725091020,"time":1493725091,"md5":"DqJ4syCiRd\/Ajnm4ccwcvA==","fsize":150427,"resto":123755352,"id":"+5Lupjtj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123758560,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)07:39:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123757765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123757765<\/a><br>To be fair USA schools and universities are looking like ours.

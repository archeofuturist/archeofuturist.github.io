Chemical Forces General Ochsner reported to German command in June 1942 that a chemical unit had taken part in the battle.[35] After the battle in mid-May 1942, roughly 3,000 soldiers and civilians not evacuated by sea were besieged in a series of caves and tunnels in the nearby Adzhimuskai quarry. After holding out for approximately three months, &quot;poison gas was released into the tunnels, killing all but a few score of the Soviet defenders.&quot;[36] Thousands of those killed around Adzhimushk were documented to have been killed by asphyxiation from gas.[35]<br><br>In February 1943, German troops stationed in Kuban received a telegram.[37]<br><br> ...Russians should be eventually cleared out of the mountain range with gas.","time":1491948344,"resto":120664573,"id":"tJ4XnYs1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120665611,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)18:06:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120664573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120664573<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;not even hitler used chemical weapons&quot;<\/span><br> That should have an ellipses after it to show it wasn&#039;t a whole quote.

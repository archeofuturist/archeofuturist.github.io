WAIT WAIT<br>There&#039;s one thing why many people despise Dveri, that most of Serbs here (one of which I am) forgot to mention, and without mentioning it there would be absolutely no reason why Dveri doesn&#039;t get at least 20% (unlike the 3% it got and barely enteret the parliament in coalition with DSS that had 2%, 5% is the parliament census). The thing is with many Bosko&#039;s fans is that they are functioning like a cult. Some of them can show up as pretty violent and Bosko himself once attacked a journalist (she worked for a shit television, but an attack nonetheless) and ONE MORE THING which makes Bosko an illegitimate candidate is because he wants to &quot;support the Serbian industry and agriculture instead of giving subventions to foreign investors&quot;. That&#039;s just populism, Serbia is in debt so bad it can&#039;t support jack shit. That&#039;s why it depends on foreign investors from UAE, Qatar and EU in general. Look at it like this: if the Serbian goverment has 1 000 000 euros to spend atm, they can&#039;t support no industry or agriculture with that money, that&#039;s chump pocket, BUT, if he subventions a foreign company that is prepared to hire 100 workers (10 000 euros subvention per worker), they can open a new workplace. If the Serbian goverment keeps the money atm, the debt will drain it. So it&#039;s impossible to &quot;make MMF go away and support Serbian industry and farms&quot;. This is irreversible and will only be fixable in about 50 years from now on. <br><br>Bottom line, Bosko doesn&#039;t know economics very well, althrough he is very good at dealing with social issues (he is Pro-Religion (orthodox christian), Pro-Military, Anti-Gay, Anti-Vaccine, Anti-Drugs) so he should be a minister or something but not a president.<br><br>Jeremic is the only sensible solution, and this comes from a guy that is ultimate right wing. <br><br>Another candidate worth noting (at least) is Aleksandar Popovic, DSS candidate, he doesn&#039;t say that much about himself but is similar to Bosko","time":1490998772,"resto":119097020,"id":"xVXqXWhD","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":119108657,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)18:29:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119107635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119107635<\/a><br>the only good thing about dveri is they&#039;re a modern right-wing party.they&#039;re filling a gap on the political spectrum, but suma sumarum they&#039;re shit, just like the rest.","time":1490999387,"resto":119097020,"id":"WmpbH055","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":119110350,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)18:46:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119107635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119107635<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119108657\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119108657<\/a><br>this tbph<br><br>i don&#039;t know if stamatovic (not an option in this election, unfortunately) would be true to his word if he created a party of his own, but he could be \/ourguy\/. we can only hope and meme","time":1491000370,"resto":119097020,"id":"fwWfBmiX","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":119112034,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)19:02:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bosko, Popovic and Stamatovic are good. <br>God i hope Beli doesn&#039;t win by meme magic","time":1491001339,"resto":119097020,"id":"0I2n9rTP","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":119112566,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)19:07:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119097020\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119097020<\/a><br>First for based SHESHEL","filename":"Seselj laughing","ext":".jpg","w":270,"h":187,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1491001640801,"time":1491001640,"md5":"D3gMhNsN6dwhiI9oFO+efw==","fsize":4541,"resto":119097020,"id":"FxYJbsO+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119113813,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)19:19:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119107635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119107635<\/a><br>Ok.

I am not well educated on the Kurds but I remember hearing that they were purposely left out of Sykes-Picot lines (getting their own nation after world war 2) and it seems Israel has been helping them and getting close with them the past 30+ years. I always thoughts Kurds were light skinned, like Azeris or some Turks, but then I saw some photos and they were all pretty dark almost gypsy\/Indian looking. Kurds seem to be getting lots of help from the US too. Some internationally recognized form of kurdistan probably will happen in my lifetime, but I have no idea about all that Turkish land.","time":1492666090,"resto":121956191,"id":"6cVNPYwg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121958086,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:31:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121957738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121957738<\/a><br>77% of Jewish oil comes from kurd territory","time":1492666304,"resto":121956191,"id":"fFeMMBXI","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":121958307,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:33:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121956191\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121956191<\/a><br>A Kurdish nation could be created from Iraq and Syria, maybe, but Erdo\u011fan would never be willing to cede territory to the Kurds.","time":1492666428,"resto":121956191,"id":"5xtEfhwn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121958753,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:38:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121958307\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121958307<\/a><br><br>The Kurds have a much higher birthrate than the Turks.

Japan is among the most advanced countries in the world and will probably be the first to heavily or fully automate most industry, ameliorating much of their need for low-skill work. Their extreme homogeneity means they aren&#039;t in danger of losing their cultural national identity or anything, even with population loss. Instead, Japan can focus on increasing the average skill and training levels of its workforce and on future-oriented goals like genetic engineering to keep their populace high quality and competitive in the world, and their crime rate is low, while their productivity is high.

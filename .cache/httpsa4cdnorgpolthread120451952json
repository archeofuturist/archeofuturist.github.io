It&#039;s relatively straight forward but yet not often applied, this method could potentially also be used to vet muslim migrants so you know which level of islam they follow.<br><br>A muslim will usually use taqiyya\/kitman\/idtirar in general when talking about these things to mask their intent if they are a radical, but there&#039;s something a radical muslim can&#039;t do, if you present a topic such as political assasination or whatever topic that is in the text, and ask him\/her to condemn that situation in general. And then point to the texts where it says that and asks him to condemn that part of islam, He is not allowed to do that if he&#039;s a fundamentalist or he&#039;s in violation of it. So in that way you can begin to gague which type of muslim you are dealing with. <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5ew<wbr>8PspLhZQ","filename":"moderatemuslimswatchradicalkillchristian","ext":".jpg","w":719,"h":474,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":164,"tim":1491839876835,"time":1491839876,"md5":"1bGh92RTESpNwG4MiLdOtg==","fsize":120503,"resto":0,"id":"Ln7pjoo5","country":"DK","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-to-use-islam-to-vet-muslims","country_name":"Denmark","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

He speaks from experience because he teaches workshops on how to better communicate science. I like this guy. He\u2019s on the right path.<br><br>But the thing that got my attention was this bit from the article:<br><br>\u201cKahan found that increased scientific literacy actually had a small negative effect: The conservative-leaning respondents who knew the most about science thought climate change posed the least risk. Scientific literacy, it seemed, increased polarization. In a later study, Kahan added a twist: He asked respondents what climate scientists believed. Respondents who knew more about science generally, regardless of political leaning, were better able to identify the scientific consensus\u2014in other words, the polarization disappeared. Yet, when the same people were asked for their own opinions about climate change, the polarization returned. It showed that even when people understand the scientific consensus, they may not accept it.\u201d<br><br>Notice how the author slips in his unsupported interpretation of the data: Greater knowledge about science causes more polarization.<br><br>Well, maybe. That\u2019s a reasonable hypothesis, but it seems incomplete. Here\u2019s another hypothesis that fits the same observed data: The people who know the most about science don\u2019t think complex climate prediction models are credible science, and they are right.<br>ave the collective memory of an amnesiac on LSD, can&#039;t understand that historical perspective because they make a practice of ignoring absolutely everything that happened before yesterday.<br><br>http:\/\/blog.dilbert.com\/post\/159792<wbr>630956\/big-red-flag-for-cognitive-d<wbr>issonance","filename":"scott","ext":".jpg","w":3504,"h":2336,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492891874208,"time":1492891874,"md5":"ySaBXGGEKoDSgpPuxTn8mQ==","fsize":2066430,"resto":0,"id":"QgzYK\/c9","country":"NL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"from-voxdays-blog-quoting-scott-adams","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122321029,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)16:12:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump for science","filename":"adams-trump-kenobi","ext":".jpg","w":1110,"h":694,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492891971010,"time":1492891971,"md5":"bBTwYUwXJCkTNyfvXflMUw==","fsize":208643,"resto":122320828,"id":"nVYK1+Iu","country":"SE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122321106,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)16:13:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122320828\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122320828<\/a><br>You couldn&#039;t have made this post any more difficult to read","time":1492892009,"resto":122320828,"id":"H71RmqNr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

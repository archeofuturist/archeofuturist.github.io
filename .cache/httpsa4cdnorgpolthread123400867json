However, I&#039;ve noticed several people here say that there is liberal indoctrination at university, and that in many cases, they had been indoctrinated. <br><br>Now, I&#039;m not denying this happens, but I simply don&#039;t understand how they manage to convince so many people to become liberals and commies and feminists and all that. <br><br>So \/pol\/, how do universities transform a bunch of mostly-normal people into faggots and feminists?","filename":"Indoctrination ","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":591,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":246,"tim":1493509372345,"time":1493509372,"md5":"CBPl0OQj1aHxBHmvsX8f0w==","fsize":42351,"resto":0,"id":"Xyczxlxx","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"university-indoctrination","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123402067,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)19:51:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123400867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123400867<\/a><br>They are young, impressionable and sheltered. Combine that with the fact that parents tell them, from a young age, that getting an education is valuable (which it is). So you have these youth that do not have any real world experience going to school and teachers that also have no real world experience teaching them about the real world. The youth strive to make a difference, as youth are apt to do, and are being told that the world around them is complete shit and full of hate. The only place that true understanding, peace, love and the answers exist is within their sheltered classroom. They then become journalists or professors because normal jobs are too demanding and they only know how to sit at a desk and write about how the world is evil.<br>We are watching the world burn due to sheltered academics creating more and more sheltered academics.","time":1493509883,"resto":123400867,"id":"fKtnDa0+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123402863,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)19:56:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123402067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123402067<\/a><br>That&#039;s pretty sad. <br><br>Thanks for answering though, at least I avoided that fate.","time":1493510186,"resto":123400867,"id":"Xyczxlxx","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123402942,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)19:56:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123400867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123400867<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;create and environment of &quot;Free expression&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;make it Mandatory to get a job worth anything.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;puts you in debt for years if not decades<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;make sure people do it why they are young and dumb<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pad it out with a bunch of worthless course that you still have to take and pay for.<\/span><br><br>Education is a mess.

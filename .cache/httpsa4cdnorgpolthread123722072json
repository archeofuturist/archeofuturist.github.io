Nothing brings more money from the treasury than investing in education, early childhood, K-12, higher ed, post grad, lifetime learning, That\u2019s what brings money to the Treasury. A wall does not bring money to the Treasury. Where is that money coming from? Do you think Mexico is going to pay for it? And even if they did, again, it undermines who we are as a country.

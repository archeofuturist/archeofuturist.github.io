Beamstat.com chans have been overridden by spammers, and debates that I have seen there have also been strange. People in control of the investigation, and mods, shut down all lines of inquiry other than their own. I saw one guy say and give evidence for information from blockchains connected to wikileaks. Not just stuff that is of no account. <br><br>When I brought this up at 8pol I was shot down hard... really hard. When I brought it up here, nobody responded.<br><br>Any new info on the matter? I do know research is still afoot, and that some might be going at it with pen and paper for fear of the all seeing eye. I may not be very bright, but I know enough to sense that this is not a larp, but an investigation stymied by many people.

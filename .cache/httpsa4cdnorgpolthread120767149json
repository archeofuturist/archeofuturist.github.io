Battler, Scott, Hans Blix, and others. They said there were NO wmds in Iraq, and that this was a pretext to invade Iraq. All of you remember that this council decided at end of 2008, after investigation, decided to busy UNSCOM reports. To overlook these reports, and bury in ground, so none can reach, they buried them in vaults. And they said that these vaults will only be opened in 60 years. Can you imagine the secrets in these vaults? Brexit encouraged UK to seek new role in world, by using extreme actions, Reminds us of criminal Tony Blair, after fabricating lie of WMDs.

Documents leaked by wikileaks prove that WH gave green light to use chemicals in Syria as incentive for intl aggressive action in Syria. We had hopes this new US administration could not go back to same pretext. Sabotage Astana and Geneva talks, and to save armed terrorist groups. We were able to add another basket in Geneva (the basket of coutner-terrorism). They did not like this. Accusations of sue of CW we do not possess. This has been proved by JIM in June 2014 \u201cSyria does not have CW.\u201d Those that destroyed CW at that time were US ships. What a paradox. This comes at a time SAR is making strides against terrorism, at time when local and national is reconciliations, border control to stop flow of terrorists,\u2026. And to unify counter-terrorism efforts. These are the results of Astana. If implemented, they would lead to end of syrian crisis.

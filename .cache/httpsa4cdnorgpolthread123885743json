Zawadski had hoped to hold the funeral there so the couple\u2019s local friends could pay their respects. On May 11, 2016, Gaspari contacted the funeral home to let them know Huskey had died.<br><br>But after filing the paperwork, including a document naming Zawadski as next of kin, Gaspari got a call from the nursing home. \u201cThe Nursing Home relayed to John that once received the paperwork indicating that Bob\u2019s spouse was male, PFH refused service because it did not \u2018deal with their kind,\u2019 \u201d the lawsuit stated.<br><br>Gaspari and Zawadski were left scrambling to find another funeral home that could cremate Huskey on-site, according to the complaint. They found one in Hattiesburg, about 90 minutes away. But because the nursing home did not have a morgue, it refused to hold Huskey\u2019s remains until the Hattiesburg facility could retrieve it. So Gaspari and Zawadski had to enlist a second, closer funeral home to pick up his body until then.<br><br>\u201cThe turmoil and exigency created by Defendants in causing Plaintiffs to find alternative arrangements, as described above, permanently marred the memory of Bob\u2019s otherwise peaceful passing,\u201d the complaint said.<br><br>Zawadski said his motives for bringing the suit are not financial but rather to ensure that no one else goes through what he experienced. In a video produced by Lambda Legal, Zawadski said through tears that the funeral home had shown disrespect toward his husband.<br><br>\u201cThis, I hope, brings him some honor,\u201d he said.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-05-03 at 3.12.07 AM","ext":".png","w":1932,"h":1206,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1493795872295,"time":1493795872,"md5":"KWkTxCb0epOcXOTjn9ApnQ==","fsize":1646932,"resto":0,"id":"uabILqG+","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-does-all-the-worst-antigay-shit-happen-in-the","country_name":"United States","replies":109,"images":7,"unique_ips":43,"tail_size":50},{"no":123886019,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)03:21:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123885743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123885743<\/a><br>FREEDOM MEANS YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE SERVICE TO ANYONE, MERILARD<br>I THOUGHT YOU LIKED FREEDOM","filename":"1483555358907","ext":".png","w":2100,"h":1500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1493796098499,"time":1493796098,"md5":"6ywX2FN1AcK\/QZWQKp4uNw==","fsize":313492,"resto":123885743,"id":"TAsIKVkp","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123886104,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)03:22:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123885743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123885743<\/a><br>Hahaha<br>Eat shit faggots","time":1493796158,"resto":123885743,"id":"9onCamRP","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123886295,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)03:25:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123886019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123886019<\/a><br>How much of a dick move is that?

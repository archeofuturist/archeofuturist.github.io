I woke up the next morning (near Russell Square, I don&#039;t remember the hotel I was at) to the sound of a protest. I got out of bed expecting the EDL to be outside, but to my surprise it was a massive group of sand monkies. How in the fuck do you English allow this kind of shit to continue? I love my &#039;Merica, but the once great British Empire also had my respect. That kind of shit would never go down in my neck of the woods ( the Southeast). How did you become so weak and when are you going to remember the faces of your grandfathers and start fighting back?","filename":"article-2329089-19F1FAAA000005DC-790_634x476","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":476,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492444853144,"time":1492444853,"md5":"FWQFMHV+9DsE3mG1jO3mlw==","fsize":67583,"resto":0,"id":"xx4hmfX6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-first-time-i-visited-london-was-when-lee","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":1,"unique_ips":8},{"no":121542733,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)12:09:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121541669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121541669<\/a><br>Don&#039;t know how someone didn&#039;t just run that faggot over.","time":1492445389,"resto":121541669,"id":"3K1tq7Zx","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121543493,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)12:15:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121542733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121542733<\/a><br>RIGHT!? <br><br>The English need to get their shit together.","time":1492445757,"resto":121541669,"id":"xx4hmfX6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121543709,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)12:17:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121541669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121541669<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That kind of shit would never go down in my neck of the wood<\/span><br>except it does, every fucking day #blacklivesmatter","time":1492445864,"resto":121541669,"id":"WwSOCjwx","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121543721,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)12:17:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"As an Englishman i agree.","time":1492445867,"resto":121541669,"id":"8LRmiEt3","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121544022,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)12:20:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121543709\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121543709<\/a><br>Where I live ( rural Southeast) that dude would of been ran over and shot.

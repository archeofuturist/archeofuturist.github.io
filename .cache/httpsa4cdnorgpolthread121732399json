Some suicidal people feel that it IS a self sacrifice. That by ending themselves they will be ending the burden they pose on the lives of everyone around them. It&#039;s arrogant and egotistical and a trick of the mind. The best way to describe this is with a metaphor. <br><br>It&#039;s like a black hole, only instead of being an astronomical object it&#039;s an emotional black hole. And you&#039;re standing at the edge of this solar system of your soul, and you can see and hear everything negative that has happened, is happening or you think will happen, dancing around that black hole in a an ever expanding accretion disc. Slowly you start to believe those things and your own self-hate begins to get confused and entwined with the words and actions of everyone else.You start to see hatefulness where none exists, and inexorably you inch closer and closer to that accretion disc of emotional torment. Before you know it, you&#039;re swimming in it, and you spend so long in it that you forget what being a normal person is like. You lose yourself to the despair and the anger and the hate and the fear, until that becomes your new normal. You actually begin to enjoy it in a sick and perverse way. You might try to go see a professional or ask for help from friends but then push them away because deep down you&#039;ve come to enjoy the emotional and spiritual pain. You don&#039;t want to believe there is another way because you have quite literally become addicted to your own sadness. And then you begin to reach the event horizon. The point of no return, and it calls out to you in a voice with no sound. It is formless, inky, enveloping blackness and it is all too welcoming. You KNOW that by crossing the horizon you will never return, but you think that maybe not returning isn&#039;t so bad. But it is final and you can pull yourself away at any time before crossing. It just takes strength.","time":1492547581,"resto":121732399,"id":"MjBUPtfo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121735695,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)16:33:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"you may do as you please<br>i&#039;ll see you on the other side<br><br>please listen to this before you do it:<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Lu4<wbr>VUsaxs6E","filename":"do you","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492547584524,"time":1492547584,"md5":"0VKTmwKloJmurCgJvXxXWg==","fsize":11890,"resto":121732399,"id":"7O1Au8O5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121735699,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)16:33:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121732399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121732399<\/a><br>Waste of a good life, unless your life is literally pain.

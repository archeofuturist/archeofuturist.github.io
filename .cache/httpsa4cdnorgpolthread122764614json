His investors, too, made vast profits. As Hands explained in his property conference speech last year, he made a slight miscalculation at the outset. \u201cWe had done something in 1996 and 1997, which made sense at the time, but in hindsight was not the best decision,\u201d said Hands. \u201cWe had securitised Annington\u2019s rental payments at a cost of 7.54% through to 2021.\u201d In other words, Hands had locked in the \u201cmortgage\u201d on the Annington houses at a very high rate. He was then stuck making the higher payments for years. This stabilised the deal \u2013 Hands knew that the rental would cover the debt costs \u2013 and took the deal off Nomura\u2019s balance sheet.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This had another consequence: the high borrowing costs meant that all the hundreds of millions paid in rent by the MoD in the last two decades has washed straight offshore, endlessly servicing debt. Annington\u2019s investors \u2013 the biggest winners in the deal \u2013 have made the largest profits. And because all the rental income floods offshore, Annington has never made an operating profit in the UK. Despite receiving \u00a3168m in rent from the MoD last year, Annington didn\u2019t pay a penny of corporation tax.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The army is scrambling to find a solution to this looming housing problem. In a recent survey of 8,322 people by the Army Families Federation (AFF), 30% of respondents said they would definitely leave the army if access to service family accommodation was reduced, and a further 46% said that they would consider leaving. The AFF noted that this accommodation creates a \u201csupport network [that] is nearly impossible to replicate\u201d, and that the benefits of this model, \u201csuch as security, empathy and practical support, are not yet properly understood or quantified\u201d.<\/span>","time":1493145242,"resto":122764614,"id":"xdyQjvzU","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122767317,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)14:34:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122767109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122767109<\/a><br>Because they realised the only people who watch it are American female Tumblr teens and children.

Are they right or wrong? Should you say \u2018an historic event\u2019 or \u2018a historic event\u2019?<br><br>An is the form of the indefinite article that is used before a spoken vowel sound: it doesn\u2019t matter how the written word in question is actually spelled. So, we say \u2018an honour\u2019, \u2018an hour\u2019, or \u2018an heir\u2019, for example, because the initial letter \u2018h\u2019 in all three words is not actually pronounced.

If hotel was pronounced without its initial letter \u2018h\u2019 (i.e. as if it were spelled \u2018otel\u2019), then it would be correct to use an in front of it. The same is true of historic and horrific. If horrific was pronounced \u2018orrific\u2019 and historic was pronounced \u2018istoric\u2019 then it would be appropriate to refer to \u2018an istoric occasion\u2019 or \u2018an orrific accident\u2019. In the 18th and 19th centuries, people often did pronounce these words in this way.<br><br>Today, though, these three words are generally pronounced with a spoken \u2018h\u2019 at the beginning and so it\u2019s now more logical to refer to \u2018a hotel\u2019, \u2018a historic event\u2019, or \u2018a horrific accident\u2019.","time":1493145811,"resto":122764614,"id":"R3bQswbI","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122768489,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)14:43:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122767890\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122767890<\/a><br>heh heh, well &quot;Churchill&#039;s War&quot; was actually very well received by the left who despised the cult-of-churchill, and had argued for peace throughout the war (albeit until the USSR was under threat). You shouldn&#039;t be scared of using Irving, his works on Churchill revisionism and the Bomber Command\/Dresden revisionism are quite mainstream now. His controversy revolves around the holocaust, which is really something the right need to just get over. Here are the sources he used, but it&#039;s really quite unfair to use Irving&#039;s sources while not quoting that you sourced them from Irving. <br><br>23.

Trump\u2019s action in Syria disappointed me greatly. Before he was elected he claimed he didn\u2019t want to be the world\u2019s policeman. He wasn\u2019t going to be \u2018president of the world.\u2019 My cartoon has Rand repeating Trump\u2019s words to Obama.<br><br><br>Did Trump forget his own advice? Apparently. He just bombed Syria to punish Assad, who almost certainly did not use poison gas on civilians as the mainstream media claims. Why would Assad make such a drastic mistake? More likely, it was poison gas held by ISIS in a nearby warehouse. They probably got it from US ally who loves to fund radical Islam: Saudi Arabia.","filename":"syria-bombing-by-trump_1_orig","ext":".jpg","w":1100,"h":776,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":176,"tim":1491586237465,"time":1491586237,"md5":"kBHH9qJqDWIUcgFaMGnC9A==","fsize":381464,"resto":0,"id":"UXISlqrc","country":"RO","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"angels-and-demons","country_name":"Romania","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119987913,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)13:33:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"poor Ben<br>he fell for the red pill meme and now he regret it","time":1491586427,"resto":119987332,"id":"cUdTGQpH","country":"VN","country_name":"Vietnam"}]}

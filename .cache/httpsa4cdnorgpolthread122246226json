Not with north Korea because at this pivotal point they will attack China. This is when you will see the Islamic Forces all across Europe convirge on the western fields of Russia, pushing to Moscow. You will see the Korean force push north to Beijing. And you will see the Canadian&amp;\u00bdof the USA force start their push from the north.

To this I reply: there is a reason for our damn DOD to block a bill that would allow all of our mining to start mining the heavy metals that these gadgets require. I also point out that because China is the only producer of these heavy metal&#039;s in the market. Yes they are making a lot of money off of us but they are rapidly burning through the resources for export not for defence development. OK, now that we are on the same page.

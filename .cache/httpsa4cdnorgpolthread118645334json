These people tend to have low IQ&#039;s and are generally not well educated (when it comes to economics).<br>These people will naturally be attracted to socialist ideas (even if it isn&#039;t in their best interest).<br>In a capitalist democracy, socialism is bound to rise.<br>The only exception to this is the USA, but that&#039;s because of the electoral college. In almost any other country, Hillary (or even Bernie) would now be president.<br><br>If only there was an ideology which could prevent this. An ideology that was socialist in name, but instead of creating a welfare state, it would stimulate the economy via Keynesian economics.

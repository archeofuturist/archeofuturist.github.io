When he decorated Hugo Ch\u00e1vez with the Higher Medal of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 2008, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called Ch\u00e1vez \u201cmy brother\u2026 a friend of the Iranian nation and the people seeking freedom around the world. He works perpetually against the dominant system. He is a worker of God and servant of the people.&quot;20 Ahmedinijad even risked a public embrace of Chavez&#039;s grieving mother at the caudillo&#039;s funeral, a move which scandalized the mullahs back home.<\/span><br><br><br>How much you wanna bet Venezuela will be the seat of Islamic expansion into the Western Hemisphere in the coming decades?<br><br><br>The wall can&#039;t come soon enough.","filename":"Tareck_El_Aissami_Portrait","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":1068,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492654554419,"time":1492654554,"md5":"jHbiduMrTGcD2KYA9aMSCw==","fsize":228050,"resto":121936253,"id":"WBqshkr2","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121936708,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:15:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121936253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121936253<\/a><br>In government spending, that&#039;s chump change.

You realize how much foot fungus, crotch rot, pink eye, etc goes around the squad bays? Tons. The less hair you have the better. For the first two weeks we were allowed 15 seconds in the shower each. So you get sick and disgusting. A full head of hair would be even worse. We also cleaned our own communal showers and we sucked at it. Now after basic, I agree, its a classy haircut. But shaved head is only required during basic training.","time":1493952681,"resto":124150242,"id":"FDArCkM3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124153905,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:52:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124152861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124152861<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;waking up at 0500 in boot camp<\/span><br><br>Must be nice","time":1493952735,"resto":124150242,"id":"FSEnbqWo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124153954,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:52:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124153444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124153444<\/a><br>Not a lot of people in the military shave their head though. <br><br>Only in boot camp or if you are a balding SNCO, or pre deployment for one of those gay traditions where you have to &quot;earn&quot; your haircut. <br><br>Longer hair is actually a status symbol in the Marine infantry. <br><br>maybe not the best picture","time":1493952759,"resto":124150242,"id":"GA9EzdGi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124154003,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:53:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124151651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124151651<\/a><br>2 years is literally perfect for some MOS.

I understand they have guns, but I doubt they know how to use them, and the fact that they have guns means people can&#039;t call you a coward afterward. Not only that, but most good people will think of you as hero. No one is proud of Adam Lanza for what he did, but I and many other people would consider you a hero if you killed these fucks.

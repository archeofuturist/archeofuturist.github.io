I shitposted my heart out through most of 2016, and when Trump got elected, I pushed back my keyboard and went about my life. <br><br>Here we are almost at the start of April, and this Russian collusion story just wont seem to die. Forgive me for my ignorance on the topic, but is there even a single shred of evidence for this? All I know is that Podesta was phished and his password was something incredibly weak like &#039;p4ssw0rd&#039; or something. But honestly, is there even a shred of evidence to support the leftist claims that Russia influenced our election? I feel like I&#039;m losing my mind over here - this story just wont die despite the mountain of speculation and falsehoods it seems to depend on.<br><br>But hey, maybe there&#039;s something I don&#039;t know.

And she was the same candidate who had just sold 20% of the United States&#039; uranium to Russia and accepted more than ten million dollars in donations (bribes) to Clinton from Saudi Arabia. And these regressive idiots want to talk about foreign influence in our elections and possible ties to Russia? For fuck sake, there&#039;s evidence of both these things right in front of their faces, but they&#039;re more interested in speculation outlining a narrative that Trump is some kind of Putin servant.

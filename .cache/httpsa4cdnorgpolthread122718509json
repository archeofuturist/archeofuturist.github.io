There is just a tiny question I have: <br><br>If Arabs immigrate to European nations en mass because of the better living conditions, wouldn&#039;t it be in their best interest, if not too many of them come, since nations they immigrate to would become like the ones they came from? Also if the living conditions decrease because of a too large numbers or immigrants, wouldn&#039;t that also mean that less would come because of a lower motivation?

What&#039;s not to like? Every red-blooded male is queued up to get to Europe to be paid, smoke weed and fuck scores of blondes.

Their time scale is too small, but they are right, if they are the ones having oodles of kids, immigrating en mass, and natives are PAYING FOR IT, to the point where we can&#039;t have kids and homes, then yes, we are finished in a few generations.<br><br>These people don&#039;t see long term.

In 2 generations, the west will be a fractured hellscape as whites retreat to the countryside and the cities turn into war zones.

I have learned from them, I befriended them, I was closer to them then any refugee helper or red cross volunteer. So let me share my knowledge with you.<br><br>First of all you have to understand what &quot;better living conditions&quot; mean for them. For you it means having an insurance, access to whatever consumer goods, constant and reliable income, a clean environment.<br><br>If you ever talked with someone from any of the countries where hundreds, sometimes thousands come here you would realize that most of them lived a pretty comfortable life in their home country.<br>Notice how most people coming to Europe aren&#039;t from the cities but come from suburban and rural areas. In these areas family is everything. Half of your village is your family and everyone works and lives with the purpose to sustain and contribute to their family, but most importantly honor it.<br>The infrastructure is often shitty but people do not suffer (like you see it on TV and advertising)<br><br>Most of their contact to the outside world happens through ADVERTISING. TV and Internet. When they look up what Europe looks like what do they see?<br>You can drink in public. You can take drugs. Women want only fun, but not respect (in Islamic societies respect is an important part in a marriage) also western people can pretty much dress like, talk like and consume what they want without being punished by their family.<br>(In Islamic cultures, when you dishonor your family by simply disobeying, the worst case scenario is that you&#039;re cast out and beaten, spit on and humiliated if you dare to show your face again)<br><br>So of course they come here. And they do not live better than at home. Sometimes they live under worse conditions here.

And they use this network to bring more of their friends here (who then pay desperate single mothers to marry them for papers, for example) or they build up an organisation where you can easily transfer goods (like drugs) or simply money without having responsibilities towards the government or EU (they don&#039;t pay taxes or toll)<br><br>So my conclusion is that the current massive wave of immigrants (caused by the Arabic spring, mainly) has only one purpose for these immigrants: they are young people, mostly who were disappointed with the system they grew up and see the freedom in Europe as a chance to build something up that is exclusively for them. It is not directly organized and there is no plan behind it. It is a movement of young free minds that gets used by certain forces to subvert and destroy, or at least change Europe permanently over the course of three generations","time":1493117102,"resto":122718509,"id":"HZOGFxsq","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

Assange has a bunch of stuff in his insurance files. Probably a lot of it is on King Nigger, the old hag, and deep state people. Trump needs this stuff to put them under the jail. He files charges against Assange and Assange is extradited. Then the prosecutors cut a deal: immunity for the big fish. Assange takes the deal, gives Sessions the rope to hang King Nigger and the old hag, and walks out a free man in the US and safe from foreign extradition.<br><br>Give Trump a chance with this Assange thing. He works in ways that aren&#039;t always immediately obvious and he&#039;s never betrayed us on anything big.","filename":"lgbt","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":370,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":154,"tim":1492736577708,"time":1492736577,"md5":"hq5aLxrYG+RlXjmhdKT2Ow==","fsize":59840,"resto":0,"id":"RNSlEiqy","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"assange-to-turn-states-evidence","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122074378,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:13:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Makes sense.","time":1492737201,"resto":122073301,"id":"jbZePgix","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Assange has a bunch of stuff in his insurance files. Probably a lot of it is on King Nigger, the old hag, and deep state people. Trump needs this stuff to put them under the jail. He files charges against Assange and Assange is extradited. Then the prosecutors cut a deal: immunity for the big fish. Assange takes the deal, gives Sessions the rope to hang King Nigger and the old hag, and walks out a free man in the US and safe from foreign extradition.<br><br>Give Trump a chance with this Assange thing. He works in ways that aren&#039;t always immediately obvious and he&#039;s never betrayed us on anything big.","filename":"lgbt","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":370,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":154,"tim":1492736577708,"time":1492736577,"md5":"hq5aLxrYG+RlXjmhdKT2Ow==","fsize":59840,"resto":0,"id":"RNSlEiqy","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"assange-to-turn-states-evidence","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":7},{"no":122074378,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:13:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Makes sense.","time":1492737201,"resto":122073301,"id":"jbZePgix","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122074928,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:18:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122073301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122073301<\/a><br>Last thing I&#039;ve heard few days ago is that he was in contact with Bruce Gorcyca and was about to leak information related to the 9\/11 before going silent.","time":1492737504,"resto":122073301,"id":"FrdYXny\/","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122075190,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:21:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122073301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122073301<\/a><br>1488d chess guise!","time":1492737671,"resto":122073301,"id":"6qh1KQ7J","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122077103,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:37:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Well considering Assange is already in the US this would make it easier to explain how he got here instead of special forces taking him months ago. <br><br>But ya good analysis Anon. everything seems to be going in this direction","time":1492738642,"resto":122073301,"id":"xrh2kA5c","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122077637,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:42:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122073301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122073301<\/a><br>Really hoping this is the case.

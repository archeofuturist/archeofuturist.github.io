Any hostile provocation with a foreign entity has possible cause of getting us embroiled in a prolonged and net negative conflict. This is the problem. <br><br>The Iraq\/Afghan wars could have been resolved (and they were) in record time, if we simply just left afterwards. Which is what we should have done. Minimal expenditure for maximum effect. But no, we can&#039;t do that because no one will let us. Too many bleeding hearts internationally, it would burn up too much diplomatic credit, and hurts everyone&#039;s feelings. This is putting aside whether or not we should have gone to war in the first place. I am not going to get into that argument, I simply care about the economic impact. <br><br>The biggest problem with post-WW2 conflicts is that belligerents learned that they could simply hide in &quot;neutral&quot; states on the border and just prolong the conflict since we aren&#039;t allowed to hit them.

By this means it becomes effective to keep the readers of the forum reading unrelated and non-issue items.<\/span><br><br>(continues)","filename":"1486297996037","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":620,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490387311286,"time":1490387311,"md5":"oDhQ5ttMezUTo+lYM1JUtg==","fsize":106505,"resto":118125162,"id":"vFWW7JaL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118125997,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)16:28:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"WARNING<br>WARNING<br>SHILLCON 2<br>GOLDBERG&#039;S LAST STAND INBOUND<br>BRACE FOR IMPACT","filename":"12981238931298312","ext":".jpg","w":680,"h":2680,"tn_w":31,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490387311180,"time":1490387311,"md5":"i78fZDn0OI15zcjBweBlxw==","fsize":452384,"resto":118125162,"id":"DfHRutiN","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118126007,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)16:28:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118125588\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118125588<\/a><br>jesus nancy really did let the botox go to her head","time":1490387315,"resto":118125162,"id":"LLqHd\/4q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118126009,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)16:28:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118125864\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118125864<\/a>","filename":"smile (2)","ext":".gif","w":225,"h":249,"tn_w":112,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490387316154,"time":1490387316,"md5":"FdrmKY2DvMTcioummLuVdA==","fsize":865487,"resto":118125162,"id":"Dm6URAt0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118126011,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)16:28:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is fucking annoying, I want to hear more about the NSA stuff, not Ryan fucking up his stupid bill.<br><br>Comey is about to get purged while people are just shitposting about healthcare bullshit.","time":1490387317,"resto":118125162,"id":"X8tiCN8Z","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118126012,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)16:28:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"Threadly reminder that CTR, Brock and MediaMatters are guilty of treason, by their own admission.","filename":"1488108732830","ext":".png","w":2133,"h":2885,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490387317282,"time":1490387317,"md5":"rhLk8j9a1iIFN+KKaMTcWA==","fsize":4134266,"resto":118125162,"id":"pC8ksZlV","country":"RO","m_img":1,"country_name":"Romania"},{"no":118126018,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)16:28:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118125549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118125549<\/a><br>everything I read about it makes me think it was a terrible Neo-con, corporatist crap bill","time":1490387320,"resto":118125162,"id":"ov32KFsb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118126025,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)16:28:43","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IMG_1832","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":1200,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490387323153,"time":1490387323,"md5":"6LgussjupEGsTgTLoEOouQ==","fsize":259398,"resto":118125162,"id":"bqyrLbOB","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118126028,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)16:28:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"Tell me the truth...

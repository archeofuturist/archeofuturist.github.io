The numbers:<br><br>Le Pen - 25%<br>Melenchon - 21.7%<br>Macron - 21.0%<br>Fillon - 20.2%<br>Hamon - 5.2%<br><br>Shut up an trust me on that. I will be right. Le Pen historically always overperforms her polls unless there is another credible right wing candidate for her votes to go to. There isn&#039;t. I have used a variety of other methods to calculate the other numbers; to be very brief, always remember that Macron&#039;s base is FRAGILE (1\/3 of voters could change minds) and is attracted to Melenchon&#039;s base, where as Fillon has stalled because of Penelopegate, and there is no reason to vote for Hamon as Melenchon becomes the candidate for the Left. <br><br>2nd Round will be 51.43% for Le Pen and 48.51% for Melenchon. Polls after the first round will show roughly a 54\/46 race, favouring Melenchon. <br><br>The crucial moment will come when Fillon ENDORSES Le Pen (or several prominent members of his party), NOT as a vote for Le Pen but AGAINST MELENCHON. Why would he\/they do that, you ask? Because they support Le Pen AGAINST the commie Melenchon (he wants 100% tax on rich). ALSO, they will have a parliamentary majority, and want to get shit done. THEY CAN GET SHIT DONE WITH LE PEN, BUT NOT WITH MELENCHON. This is crucial to remember.<br><br>This will be the FINAL BLOW. Currently (((polls))) predict the abstention rates of Fillon supporters in a 2nd round Le Pen\/Melenchon to be approximately 50%. (i.e. 50% do not vote at all). Fillon\/his party&#039;s endorsement of Le Pen will reduce this rate to approximately 30%, which results in the 51.43% victory I described above. So, add all these factors in and Le Pen will Make France Great Again. I&#039;m waiting, \/pol\/. Shortly, you will see that I was right.","filename":"Capture","ext":".png","w":398,"h":401,"tn_w":248,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492832565109,"time":1492832565,"md5":"3nCYm+x828LDLQWP+GS+aA==","fsize":212817,"resto":0,"id":"4Apblbts","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"le-pen-will-win-guaranteed","country_name":"Australia","replies":53,"images":14,"unique_ips":36},{"no":122231274,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:44:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"PRAISE HIM","time":1492832688,"resto":122231101,"id":"BGs2NEtV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122232147,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:53:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"France has a 4 party system?<br>Cool, at least french people now how to vote using two round system","time":1492833230,"resto":122231101,"id":"c86jScEU","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122233826,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:11:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122231101\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122231101<\/a><br>Le Pen will rule the world.","time":1492834272,"resto":122231101,"id":"GWBcSVeI","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":122234099,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:13:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122231101\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122231101<\/a><br>Le Pen against Melenchon would be the ideal scenario, and by far her best chance to win.

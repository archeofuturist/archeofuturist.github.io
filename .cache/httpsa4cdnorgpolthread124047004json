Encountered generous hospitality and danes were really friendly to me, even though they are just as introverted as my people. Beautiful archidecture and generally nice and clean city. I remember being bothered by muslim women wearing headscarves that made them stick out like a sore thumb from the crowd, they didn&#039;t fit in with the other folks. Even the black people wore hip clothes and fit in much better with the crowd. Some middle-easterners driving cars blasting EDM in busy streets.

What I mostly didn&#039;t like was how latvians were so ashamed of their country and laughed in my face when I tried to say something nice about their country.

I remember seeing many evergreen trees and snow and some huge malls. Some white trash estonian workers in finnish port waiting to be let into ship were being very disrespectful and loud, made me feel ashamed of my fellow countrymen.

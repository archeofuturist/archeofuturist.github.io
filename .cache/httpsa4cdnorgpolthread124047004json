Encountered generous hospitality and danes were really friendly to me, even though they are just as introverted as my people. Beautiful archidecture and generally nice and clean city. I remember being bothered by muslim women wearing headscarves that made them stick out like a sore thumb from the crowd, they didn&#039;t fit in with the other folks. Even the black people wore hip clothes and fit in much better with the crowd. Some middle-easterners driving cars blasting EDM in busy streets. Heard stories about migrant gangs fighting each other in the neighborhood where my student accommodation was at.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Studied and lived 2 months in Riga, Latvia.<\/span><br>Loved the natural parks there and some parts of the city although in general I could sense that latvians are lagging behind estonians in their living standard a bit. Met some cool latvians and made friends with them. What I mostly didn&#039;t like was how latvians were so ashamed of their country and laughed in my face when I tried to say something nice about their country. In my student accommodation, the 2\/3 of the hostel was nonwhite students, and some of them had no manners whatsoever.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Visited Stockholm, Sweden several times<\/span><br>Very nice archidecture, friendly people who always helped my family when we got lost in the city. Loved the tiny rocky islands before cruise ship arrived to Stockholm. In tourist areas where I was at I remember not seeing much muslims even as late as 2016 december when I last was at Stockholm. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Visited Helsinki, Finland once on my way from Denmark back to Estonia<\/span><br>Don&#039;t remember much, I was tired. I remember seeing many evergreen trees and snow and some huge malls. Some white trash estonian workers in finnish port waiting to be let into ship were being very disrespectful and loud, made me feel ashamed of my fellow countrymen. Finns coming from Tallinn were loaded with estonian alcohol.","filename":"1484286764571","ext":".jpg","w":225,"h":225,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493894868745,"time":1493894868,"md5":"Py++WLIdp\/syHJqHid2mJg==","fsize":8013,"resto":124047004,"id":"Ew1aAFmW","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":124048514,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:53:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Switzerland<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;amazing mountains and shit, extremely scenic. the local people are friendly. ski slopes there are sikkkkkk<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;was a quite expensive when i went at the time. thats all i disliked but it was definitely worth it<\/span>","time":1493895192,"resto":124047004,"id":"OnNjG27z","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124048636,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:54:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"I went to England the other day and there were WAY too many niggers and arabs","time":1493895289,"resto":124047004,"id":"Fls8oKTS","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":124048661,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:55:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124047004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124047004<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Greece <\/span><br>That was before it was destroyed.<br>+Nice culture , easygoing people<br>+Many landmarks to visit<br>+Weather<br>- no stops in between cities<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Germany<\/span><br>+Clean<br>+Attractions and Landmarks<br>+Decent People<br>- Turks always picking a fight<br>- Uptight<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Poland <\/span><br>+ Food <br>+ Weather<br>+ Castles Churches Observatories etc<br>- Skinheads <br>- Loud Kurwa , drunk People on trains and busses.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Italy<\/span><br>+ amazing food <br>+ weather<br>+ some of the most interesting landmarks to visit<br>- traffic <br>- couldn&#039;t communicate in english , german was more popular.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;France<\/span><br>+ Landmarks<br>- Niggers trying to steal shit or sell shit<br>- Food<br>- can no longer visit too unsafe, I missed terrorist attack by a day when staying in Paris(close to my hotel).<br>Too close for comfort","time":1493895309,"resto":124047004,"id":"Paen+ceH","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":124048835,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:57:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;norway x15<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;denmark x3<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;finland x2<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;switzerland x12<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ireland x2<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;france x5<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spain x8<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;greece x2<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;united states x2<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thailand x3<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;iceland x1<\/span><br><br>the nature is great everywhere (finland + denmark is boring though), especially in switzerland\/norway\/iceland\/thailand<wbr>\/west coast US.<br><br>food is best in spain\/greece\/thailand. god-tier burgers and mexican food in california. shittiest food in iceland\/ireland\/finland\/denmark.<br><br>best people?

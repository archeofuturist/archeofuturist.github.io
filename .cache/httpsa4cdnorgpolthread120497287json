The first generation of norks would probably resist socialism and serve as a good example against it, but look at Germany. A few generations in, and suddenly the grandkids of political prisoners who worked in slave camps are okay with socialism again. Have good trade relationships, but don&#039;t unify, southbros. When a people live under communism that long, they become fundamentally a different people and are now more easily cowed around. But they&#039;re not the ones to worry about. It&#039;s the party members who avoid arrest and end up influencing politics. To them, they don&#039;t see it as the communist half falling. They see it as an opportunity to make the whole country communist.","time":1491862569,"resto":120497287,"id":"9jOq5X7w","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120501103,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)18:16:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120500405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120500405<\/a><br>what do you mean by stake?","time":1491862586,"resto":120497287,"id":"xDxS2Mq9","country":"KR","country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":120501608,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)18:20:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120501064\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120501064<\/a><br>SK culture if very different, it&#039;s like a harsher version of Japanese culture but the concept of socialism doesnt exactly fit here, the language is even hiarcle.

They like their culture and they don&#039;t like outsiders changing it, generally speaking. I would personally make the argument that there&#039;s nothing wrong with that. I wouldn&#039;t want people *cough* the left *ahem* infringing on my values for a perceived sense of moral superiority, but at the same time I encourage people who wish to voluntarily and properly adapt to my culture. <br><br>The second part is political\/economical. Clearly creating regulation and increasing entitlements is destructive to the overall system in a market economy. Culture aside, people across the world legitimately believe that higher taxes and higher entitlements are moral and just, not realizing the unintended consequences. We live in a global economy (this is not the same as &quot;a global community&quot;), market economies are based entirely on trade and trade with a foreign market is essential and necessary based on the concept of scarcity (the foundation of the general term &quot;economics&quot;). Factoring culture back into the economic equation may shed some light as to why japanese people believe entitlements and high taxes are necessary, but this is a give and take in a world where foreign markets don&#039;t align with a concept that is valued less in the origin country. <br><br>I am not making the argument that entitlements are necessary, I&#039;m just saying that sacrificing economic prosperity for moral value is not the least common demoniator in a (global) market economy.","time":1490853331,"resto":118889304,"id":"HCRamXGB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118890877,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)01:56:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118890818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118890818<\/a><br>no u","time":1490853374,"resto":118889304,"id":"pi4hXVZt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118891207,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)02:00:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118890877\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118890877<\/a><br>We&#039;ll maymay&#039;d friendo XD bork","time":1490853634,"resto":118889304,"id":"HCRamXGB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118891375,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)02:02:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"KIKE shill stop talking utter white ...

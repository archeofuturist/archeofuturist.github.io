Please put aside any opinions about Trump&#039;s response, I just want to know what people think of the attack itself.<br><br>Obviously a lot of \/pol\/ thinks the chemicals were a form of false flag attack, but I don&#039;t really understand the how of it. I don&#039;t think anyone disputes that the Syrian government dropped some kind of bombs on the town. If the rebels released some kind of gas to frame Assad, how did they know when and where the attack would be?<br><br>There&#039;s the claim that maybe the Syrians just hit some kind of chemical or chemical weapon storage the rebels had built. But it&#039;s not like the rebels just had a bunch of Sarin floating around freely in a room somewhere - even if they had the capacity to produce a nerve agent, wouldn&#039;t it be destroyed, not spread, in the event of an explosion?<br><br>Pic related, it&#039;s me right now.

Russia and Syria give a sappy sob story about &quot;well someone else might have dropped a bomb or maybe we hit some of their chemical bombs&quot;.<br><br>I don&#039;t trust them. On the other hand, Rand Paul is right. Assad was wining his civil war. He had won Aleppo after 4 long years and was making great gains. Why would Assad do such a stupid thing?

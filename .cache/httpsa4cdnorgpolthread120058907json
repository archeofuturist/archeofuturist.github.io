Now you care about Syria???<br><br>This isn&#039;t the first time Asad has used chemical weapons on civilians. He has killed hundreds if not thousands using chemical agents.

Specifically the &quot;red-line&quot; fiasco which lost the United States multitudes of credibility around the world, opened the door for Russia to once again publicly\/actively play a role in the middle east, and allowed Asad to further consolidate his power.<br><br>Back before 2013 even happened multiple international experts and many people on the ground in Syria were advocating for U.S. Intervention past supporting rebel opposition groups with weapons and ammunition. In 2012 I had a professor from Damascus University (guest Skype lecture) straight up say that if the United States did not intervene with Boots on the ground\/ targeted air strikes then Asad would win the civil war. Of course that did not happen for various political reasons. Imo mostly Obama trying to avoid another Libya situation.<br><br>However once the &quot;red-line&quot; statement was made and the U.S. did nothing, it essentially told Asad he could do whatever the hell he wants.

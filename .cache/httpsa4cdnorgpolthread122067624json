Sometimes that emergence creates unexpected results, which harm some agents in the system, but help other agents. Those who lose will think what happened is evil, those who win will likely try to maintain their current advantage. Some people are exceptionally good at figuring out systems, or the system they are currently participating in. I don&#039;t think those people are evil, but I do think a poorly planned system can create circumstances where evil can take place, or at least what some people would call evil. I think it&#039;s really hard to create a system in which evil doesn&#039;t occur. It might even be impossible, otherwise someone would have figured it out by now.<br><br>On one hand, you have to respect the rich for figuring something out.

In one move, reasserted America as the dominant power in the world and obliterated the &quot;Russian Collaborator&quot; narrative by attacking their ally. <br><br>Anyone who thought Trump was a Ron Paul-tier isolationist is fucking retarded. He talked all campaign about &quot;bombing the shit out of&quot; ISIS. He&#039;s only opposed to boots on the ground invasion where you invest time, resources and American lives. There&#039;s literally nothing wrong with blowing up an air base that was used in a chemical weapons attack. Obama destroyed out credibility by wagging his finger and backing down from ultimatums his whole presidency. The first country to test Trump got bombed immediately. The next one will have to thing about that. <br><br>\/pol\/ is only on suicide watch because it&#039;s full of ex-Ron Paul supporters butthurt that he violated the NAP. Also, the fact that the board has been adopted as the forum of choice for pro-Assad shills in \/Syria General\/.","filename":"IMG_3294","ext":".jpg","w":845,"h":1024,"tn_w":206,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491572021417,"time":1491572021,"md5":"DJ5PSSB2vVNRDO3QAOsHvQ==","fsize":101245,"resto":0,"id":"YCq69AMo","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"attacking-syria-was-a-master-stroke-in-one-move","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":119947859,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)09:38:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;d like to take another shot at being the &quot;strong horse&quot;.

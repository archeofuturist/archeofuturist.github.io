Though realistically, you&#039;d do even better in rear-echelon shit because medics are also expected to haul loaded stretchers around in the field and that is heavy work. I don&#039;t know if you&#039;re aware, but most militaries have about 5-10 support personnel for every front-line combat soldier. There is plenty for non-combat folks to do that allows the military to function.<br><br>Alternatively, consider the chair force or navy, where there is no need for physical exertion.","time":1491413558,"resto":119628323,"id":"BZids4IL","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119631608,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:45:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119628323\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119628323<\/a><br>Anything in Intel is full of holes, I mean women.","time":1491414328,"resto":119628323,"id":"92vd1nBg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119632176,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:49:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119631608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119631608<\/a>","filename":"carlos","ext":".jpg","w":225,"h":225,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491414591555,"time":1491414591,"md5":"KvZoVLpHKDpFLtoCbD3cUw==","fsize":6399,"resto":119628323,"id":"MRYGThUA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

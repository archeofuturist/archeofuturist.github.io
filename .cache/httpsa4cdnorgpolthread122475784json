America didn&#039;t, and its right-wing boost was entirely in the minority to the tune of millions and entirely regional. Trump could only win by a convoluted system that neglects what the majority of the country thinks in worst case scenario. And the country STILL hates him, and 45% was his honeymoon period. Now he&#039;s shifting between 35% to 40% (pic related)<br><br>Le Pen is filth, and there&#039;s no flyover France bonus point system to compensate. Its a real democracy, thus she&#039;ll lose. I have a vacation home in Luxembourg area of Paris, and I&#039;m telling you, France is watching Trump, and everybody thinks this catastrophe will happen in France if Le Pen is elected.","filename":"everybodyhatestrump","ext":".png","w":603,"h":319,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":132,"tim":1492977224376,"time":1492977224,"md5":"XnkKTBtXVCRVVaJ2Sqz+6w==","fsize":14595,"resto":0,"id":"ejEoaeox","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-le-pen-will-lose","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":122476479,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)15:57:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122475784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122475784<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying trump needed the electoral college to win as if it wasn&#039;t a sea of red <\/span><br>protip: california and NY shouldn&#039;t decide elections","filename":"bRgO6[1]","ext":".png","w":1050,"h":670,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":79,"tim":1492977452312,"time":1492977452,"md5":"a6PTonTc2nlGFtdjdVtGdw==","fsize":85571,"resto":122475784,"id":"o6D1EkkL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122477253,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)16:02:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122476479\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122476479<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lost popular vote<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;didnt need electoral college<\/span><br><br>pick 1 cuck","time":1492977727,"resto":122475784,"id":"MPOHD\/\/e","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122478112,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)16:07:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122477253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122477253<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lost popular vote among a sea of red by mere millions<\/span><br>so that means either we have millions of illegal aliens voting in our elections, or california and NY shouldn&#039;t be worth a combined 84 electoral votes","time":1492978037,"resto":122475784,"id":"o6D1EkkL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122478672,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)16:10:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122478112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122478112<\/a><br>No what it means is, the majority of America lives in the blue areas and increasingly so.

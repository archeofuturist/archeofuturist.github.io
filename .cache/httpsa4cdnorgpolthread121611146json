Being smart is what gets you social skills, wealth, and a family. There is a major cut-off devide now in IQ where if you have an IQ over 120 your life is heaven and if your IQ is below that your life will be shit. In a way we are living in brave new world but I think it&#039;s more than that. It&#039;s sort of weird how the way you are formed at birth determines your life. I also think it&#039;s weird how Liberals never discuss this despite intelligence being the sole factor in deciding your life.","filename":"brain","ext":".jpg","w":710,"h":594,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":209,"tim":1492476425099,"time":1492476425,"md5":"vCR3\/ydLXFI0D1grQ75jjA==","fsize":125581,"resto":0,"id":"bZ4IVnyD","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"intelligent-privilege-why-do-liberals-never","country_name":"Canada","replies":32,"images":4,"unique_ips":18},{"no":121611358,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)20:48:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Intelligent Privilege, Why Do Liberals Never Discuss It<\/span><br><br>because they are not intelligent?","time":1492476536,"resto":121611146,"id":"U3\/OK8cz","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121611520,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)20:50:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121611358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121611358<\/a><br>Actually that&#039;s exactly why they would want to talk about it.

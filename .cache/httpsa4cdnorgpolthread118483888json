To conver every non-believer to our cause. Not just on the stance of video games, but we must continue our fight against PC culture on ALL platforms. <br><br>Corporations, small and huge alike are doubling down on this agenda, hoping to ride out the storm. But it up to us to organize as we always have, and crush them beneath the awesome boot of free speech. <br><br>The meme wars are over.. The Boycott Wars are finally getting heated.","filename":"IMG_0035","ext":".jpg","w":349,"h":466,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490597445166,"time":1490597445,"md5":"TMNIoCYSvANhJtaGTAkNYw==","fsize":60056,"resto":0,"id":"TY\/ExQKm","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-boycott-wars","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118484523,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)02:58:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s hilarious watching Jonno try and block everyone on the general discussion page on their Steam.

I started off on \/b\/ around 2007, then moved to \/new\/ and subsequently \/pol\/. Took a hiatus for a while with sporadic visits, then during election season I got on quite a bit. It&#039;s changed so much since then. \/b\/ is literally smeared with boipucci and other gay shit. No gore threads or any shit that makes you uncomfortable except the gayness. This place has devolved into water circling the drain indefinitely with diarrhea. Idk.","time":1490712157,"resto":118654119,"id":"TLjKe8Di","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

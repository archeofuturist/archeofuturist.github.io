These freemen can only hold these roles for 8 years before the King needs to find a new freeman to replace him. Once they have been given one of these roles, they can not hold another one again. Freemen are landowners. They can not sell or buy property. If they have no heirs (no males sons) they can sell it to a slave who has earned enough money to become a freeman. Women can not hold any government positions, their role is the be the wife of freemen and produce heirs that will inherit her husbands land.<br>Slaves are poor men (and women) who do not own any property. They can go into contracts with freemen to become their servants. The only requirement is that the freemen has to pay the slave money after the contract is expired.

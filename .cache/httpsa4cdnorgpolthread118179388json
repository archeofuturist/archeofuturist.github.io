With people from Israel posting blatantly without even using a proxy not to mention countless others hidden from us, how can you really deem yourself a redpilled individual? Don&#039;t you realise we are just as large a part of (((their))) plan as the lefty masses? Here especially, it is unbelievably easy for (((them))) to influence us with nothing but a simple proxy, let alone getting away without even using one often enough.<br><br>The plan is not for a radical lefty west. It&#039;s not even for a libertarian west. The end goal is for a divided west, with two complete opposite extremes clashing violently, and we&#039;re the other half of the puzzle. Not only here, even on Facebook pages and other forums, they are there ready to incite hate and get us angry, while at the same time doing the exact same to the other side, drawing these two large groups further and further apart.<br><br>They&#039;re gunning for another WWII, and once the clash of ideologies is over, they will scheme their way to more power the exact same way they did in the past.<br><br>You must understand that together we will always be stronger. Don&#039;t fall for the (((redpill))) (((they))) feed you here.","filename":"Juden","ext":".jpg","w":235,"h":235,"tn_w":235,"tn_h":235,"tim":1490412505607,"time":1490412505,"md5":"pGnrRUcDJ9P7WjzUlXnq2A==","fsize":10172,"resto":0,"id":"28Adq618","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"do-you-guys-not-see-it-with-people-from-israel","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

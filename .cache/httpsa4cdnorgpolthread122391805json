Simple enough, right? Not always. Sometimes future mother will ovulate two eggs instead of one. Most of the time, it will result in twins, but on rare occasion, there will be case where the two eggs merge. It results with the person being born carrying two different genetic code in the same body. And if one of the egg has been fertilized by an Y spermatozoa and the other by an X one, you have an hermaphrodite that might develop both male and female features.<br><br>The reproductive organ gender: usually having XX chromosomes will result in having Female and the XY ones will result in male one, but not always. But biology is in no way a perfectly predictable machine and there will be cases where someone having XX will have male organ and someone having XY will have female organ. Add to that case of hermaphordism that can also occur with only having One set of genetic code. A side note, but when people mention their sexual orientation (which is not the same thing than gender), when they mention the gender they feel attracted to, they usually are talking abou the gender of the reproductive organs.<br><br>The brain gender: Physiological and other working characteristic difference have been noticed between the Male and the female brain. There is a lot of overlap and variables but there is also more extreme case, with people having &quot;very female&quot; and &quot;very male&quot; brain. If they happens to have the corespondent set of genital this isn&#039;t really a problem, but if they have the wrong one... Study have showed that Transsexuals tend to have brain that display characteristic of the gender opposite to the one of their reproductive organs. They are literally people with a brain in the wrong body.<br><br>That is what gender is.","time":1492936572,"resto":122391805,"id":"JYpaFXVM","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":122400257,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)04:38:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122395173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122395173<\/a><br>Not even fucking close you fucking kraut bastard<br><br>Bill is a fucking hack","time":1492936687,"resto":122391805,"id":"jt65dZyX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122400287,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)04:38:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122395173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122395173<\/a><br>You stop that right the FUCK now.","time":1492936711,"resto":122391805,"id":"tXpvU1Yf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122400293,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)04:38:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122399775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122399775<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tysons ok<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;le &quot;artificial borders&quot; man<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;le &quot;if I handed him a plate of shit and a steak on a plate, he would be content in eating either one because we&#039;re all just star stuff after all&quot; man<\/span>","time":1492936714,"resto":122391805,"id":"Cra9ZLhq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122400360,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)04:39:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122399650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122399650<\/a><br>where is the full episode?","time":1492936767,"resto":122391805,"id":"gmqHxn2S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122400487,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)04:41:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122391805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122391805<\/a><br>Who is this?","time":1492936861,"resto":122391805,"id":"3\/yDKaye","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122400522,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)04:41:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"you do love science, don&#039;t you?","time":1492936890,"resto":122391805,"id":"0QpSbQZr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122400849,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)04:46:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122400522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122400522<\/a><br>I always liked history more. march for history.","time":1492937175,"resto":122391805,"id":"0QpSbQZr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122400893,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)04:46:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122395173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122395173<\/a><br>I am 47 years old and I finally see why my father screamed in his sleep about murdering fucking Krauts","filename":"980894098409","ext":".png","w":283,"h":295,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492937218104,"time":1492937218,"md5":"2K2BwYh5LD91RTbMrA7uJA==","fsize":165924,"resto":122391805,"id":"Fd4ZT1ti","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122401019,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)04:48:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122400893\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122400893<\/a><br>We all do.

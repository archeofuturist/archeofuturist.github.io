You assume that all lefties are the same person \/ have exactly the same opinions<br>2. Statement a: &quot;liberals promote the idea that one color human is racist&quot;. This is completely false. Almost no one believes that expect for extreme fringe tumblr bloggers that are most likely just parodies.<br>3. Statement b: &quot;certain color people are a different race&quot;. How is this related to the other statements? No one left wing disputes that different characteristics mean different race, expect if you are talking about those transracial snowflakes, but those people represent the left about as much as furry trump supporters represent the right.<br>4. Statement c: &quot;because they promote this, they also admit that certain color people need other colors to stand up for them due to their inability to do it themselves&quot;. The logical step here is not valid. You have no where shown why people of a certain color need specifically people of another color to stand up for them, in fact most lefties promote minorities to stand up for their own race.<br><br>0\/5 see me after class","time":1491502751,"resto":119771343,"id":"sN6QqZWv","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119772572,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)14:19:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119771519\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119771519<\/a><br>Thats what it feels like.<br><br><a href=\"#p119772153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119772153<\/a><br>im looking this up now.<br><br><a href=\"#p119771925\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119771925<\/a><br>im not tracking, please elaborate","time":1491502766,"resto":119771343,"id":"3AV3DeWH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

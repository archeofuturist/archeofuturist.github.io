Two thirds of african americans mostly agree with BLM, and what blm promotes is, in short: FUCK THE WHYTE MAN SHOOT THE WHITEY, WE ARE OPPRESSED, SYSTEMATIC RACISM. This group is so outspoken and aggressive, that about 40% of white men think they incite violence and distract from real issues. Lgbt community has 9 million people, now since there is no q in there i assume they dont include the tumblrkin. But alot of these lgbt people have the same enemy, the white man. White men are sexist misogynistic pigs, patriarchy is oppressing us, white mens fault. Now i do realise that they do not play any use in this discussion other than proving how many leftist hold ridiculous beliefs. Furthermore &quot;feminism for islam&quot; signs and so on, people that hold signs like that and agree with people with those views, will consider you racist if you dont open your butthole to muslims. So yes alot of them promote that the white man is the only reason their lives are shitty<br><br>People that belong to groups listed above will go out of their way to mention &quot;race is a social construct, gender is a social construct, biology doesnt exist.&quot; Furthermore, i would say that believing we are all equal is close to the very core of liberal beliefs, or am i wrong?

The official statement from the American Anthropological Association is as follows:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;While there is a biological basis for differences in human phenotypes, most notably in skin color,[12] the genetic variability of humans is found not amongst, but rather within racial groups \u2013 meaning the perceived level of dissimilarity amongst the species has virtually no biological basis. Genetic diversity has characterized human survival, rendering the idea of a &quot;pure&quot; ancestry as obsolete.[10] Under this interpretation, race is conceptualized through a lens of artificiality, rather than through the skeleton of a scientific discovery.<\/span><br>The argument is that culture plays a far more significant role on racial identity than genetics, and that though different groups of people have different genetics, using race as a comparison factor makes no sense.

Muslims cannot forcefully enter a country, whites have to let them in, once they get in they are a minority, often a very small minority, in general having more numbers in your ranks would help you be more influential, so some help from whites is a great way to get this.<br>As far as blacks go, which is the point of this argument. Why they need whites to help them. Because they are not capable of doing it themselves, their poor attempt BLM is doing nothing but being off putting to others.<br>They also fail to educate themselves with free schools that the whites give to them, on top of that they need affirmative action to get anywhere in their life.

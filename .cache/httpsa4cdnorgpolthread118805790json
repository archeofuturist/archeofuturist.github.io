Fuzion - Now we mainly dealt with the low end tire with this brand so the higher price points might be ok.<br><br>2. Cooper - Not a bad brand per say but their tread tends to scallop on the A\/T tires<br><br>3.

If you need a repair or a rotate balance, i get to tell you no cause you&#039;re shit is whack and next time don&#039;t buy used tires. literally two days ago i pulled off four coopers with awful broken belts, and when they were deflated and off the rim you couldn&#039;t even tell they were messed up.","time":1490811482,"resto":118805790,"id":"QKxl9rM\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118815097,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:24:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118806925\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118806925<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118807541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118807541<\/a><br>exhibit A and exhibit B for anyone that doesn&#039;t believe there has been a massive influx of reddit","time":1490811847,"resto":118805790,"id":"JDt8OTzH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118815995,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:32:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118812127\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118812127<\/a><br>What do you think about Yokohamas?","time":1490812328,"resto":118805790,"id":"DYSkQaxB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118817014,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:41:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118810093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118810093<\/a><br>Used tires cost 20% of the new tires and last 40-50% of what new tires would last.

NEVER buy used or refurbished mattress tho. NEVER.<br><br>Shoes is really more about brand and design than comfort or quality, Converse\/Vans cost 30-50% of Nike, and Converse\/Vans has a better quality than Nike. Same goes for boots or normal shoes. I&#039;d say try different brands until you find one that looks good, use god materials and stick to them.<br><br>Additional tip: If you plan to buy Raybans, sunglasses or any eyewear, search brands made by Luxotica and buy the cheapest one. Luxotica is the biggest eyewear\/sunglasses manufacturer and make basically any brand you ever heard of (Rayban, Polo, Armani, etc....) so a cheap brand and an expensive brand are made by the same company, using the same materials.","time":1490812866,"resto":118805790,"id":"vzccSd\/4","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118818120,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:50:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;still falling for the air jew<\/span>","filename":"045i9","ext":".jpg","w":267,"h":189,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1490813424790,"time":1490813424,"md5":"h0F4ZxL6LHINWY5efjEVLg==","fsize":9091,"resto":118805790,"id":"8OUFF7Bd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118819095,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:58:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Redpill: atoms aren&#039;t arranged until they receive an observer.

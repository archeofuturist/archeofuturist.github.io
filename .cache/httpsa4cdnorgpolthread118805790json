Also due to the way they do their bead they are bitch to put on and take off the rim(This may have changed as I was a tire monkey 15+ years ago)<br><br>3. Hankook - A relatively inexpensive tire that will at least make it to its mileage warranty. <br><br>Most other brands are ok. Brands I&#039;d stay away from.<br><br>1. Fuzion - Now we mainly dealt with the low end tire with this brand so the higher price points might be ok.<br><br>2. Cooper - Not a bad brand per say but their tread tends to scallop on the A\/T tires<br><br>3. BFG - Again not a terrible tire but they have not invested near as much money in their R&amp;D as Bridgestone and thus their rubber compounds are behind.","time":1490810323,"resto":118805790,"id":"W0ZOYNIm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118812148,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)13:58:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118810630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118810630<\/a><br>I base this off of experience.<br><br>Bought several brand new dewalt impact wrenches on sale and all 4 of them failed within 2 months.","time":1490810336,"resto":118805790,"id":"sAYT+0os","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118812771,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:04:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"the realest tire red pill is working with tires will make you hate Mexicans.","time":1490810659,"resto":118805790,"id":"QKxl9rM\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118812938,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:05:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118811517\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118811517<\/a><br><br>I watched this whole thing and it did not explain the difference between a cheap tire and an expensive tire. <br><br>Disappointed.","time":1490810742,"resto":118805790,"id":"c3Cy39XW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118813276,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:08:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118805790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118805790<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not putting the best Summer tires on your car when driving season arrives<\/span><br><br>are you even trying?<br><br>https:\/\/www.tirerack.com\/tires\/tire<wbr>s.jsp?tireMake=Michelin&amp;tireModel=P<wbr>ilot+Super+Sport&amp;partnum=345YR7PSSX<wbr>L","time":1490810917,"resto":118805790,"id":"ITti9mvR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118813325,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:08:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118810532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118810532<\/a><br>Tread wear, tire wall condition, no patches, no plugs and interior looks good","time":1490810939,"resto":118805790,"id":"loGaoH\/C","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118813582,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:11:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118810924\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118810924<\/a><br>I live in nyc.

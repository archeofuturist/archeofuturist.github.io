The In economic terms, the &quot;left&quot; is defined as the desire for the economy to be run by a cooperative collective agency (which can mean the state, but can also mean a network of communes), while &quot;right&quot; is defined as the desire for the economy to be left to the devices of competing individuals and organizations. So in simple terms, The Right is pro-privatisation and the left is pro-nationalisation.<br>So let\u2019s delve deeper into this and look at the original policies of the National Socialist party. Namely their 25 point plan which they followed for many of the election they fought in in-between 1920 and 1933. <br>Point 6 of this plan states that; \u201cThe right to determine matters concerning administration and law belongs only to the citizen.

Breaking of debt (interest)-slavery.\u201d<br>Point 13: \u201cWe demand the nationalisation of all associated industries\u201d Now do not try to tell me that nationalisation is not a left wing policy.

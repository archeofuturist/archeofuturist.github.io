Might be a bit abstract, but here goes. It all has to do with tribalism.<br><br>In the Great Depression, immigration was ended, masses of Mexicans and more than a few hispanic american citizens were deported. There was no significant immigration for almost forty years. This, along with the pressures of the Second World War and the Cold war, broke up the old ethnic neighborhoods (Italian, Jewish, Polish, etc) and forged a cohesive (white) American community. <br><br>Blacks were kind of left out, and kept out in many states by official segregation. The end of segregation had many good effects for blacks in America, obviously. But it had some downsides most people don&#039;t notice. The first is that it allowed high-achieving blacks to leave their community and join rich white communities. It stripped the leader class out of black neighborhoods. Black lawyers and doctors don&#039;t live in the ghetto anymore, they live with white doctors and lawyers. The drug war imprisoned many black men, while the new welfare state incentivized black women to have lots of kids and ditch the dads. The naturally high black crime rate exploded. Cities burned. All the white people who could manage it left. <br><br>Now the black ghettos are populated only by the people whose entire bloodline failed to find a way out for the past fifty years. Anyone who is a success immediately leaves and never returns. Crime keeps decent businesses out, racial antagonism keeps non-blacks out, and a corrupt, one-party political system keeps just enough government benefits flowing to keep people alive and poor. <br><br>America is breeding an underclass.","time":1490750284,"resto":118717797,"id":"Frjfcb32","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118727053,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)21:19:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Increase in Black literacy led to the Harlem Renaissance.

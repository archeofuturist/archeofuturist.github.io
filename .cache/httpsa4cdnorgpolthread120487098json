They seem to think he&#039;s put in place by the elites to spread disinformation, to put people on the wring trail and just make shit up in general. I don&#039;t think this is the case, and the only thing I specifically don&#039;t like about him is that he treads lightly around (((((them))))) I think, with him, the problem is more so his audience. There are probably a lot of impressionable people, sick of being lied to by the news, but want to be told something so they take what he says as absolute fact rather then speculation.<br><br>However, though all his shows are based around loose speculation, I do think that you can replace two of his key words to make him more believable.<br><br>If you replace the word<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Globalists<\/span><br>with<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Zionists<\/span><br>And replace the name of anyone in a position of power with<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Jews<\/span><br>Alex Jones starts to make a whole lot more sense<br><br>Also, BUY SUPER BETA MALE VITALITY.

I always verify the things he says that I find particularly important or fascinating. Surprisingly he is right most of the time. If you dont like him or dont trust him, then verify the shit he says to make sure, or dont fucking watch him. This trend of trying to sway people to not watch AJ or deletitimizing him for political motives\/agenda really pisses me off. He needs to be criticized and called out when he is being a retard, but not silenced. Fucking neoliberals and neoconservatives piss me off.","time":1491857332,"resto":120487098,"id":"3y59zjt8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

The moral goodness of equality is attained in this way, for if one abrogates the transcendent and the external, one is left with a collection of individuals, with generic humans, who are little more than abstractions in a purely material world they must negotiate through the use of reason. This is, in essence, a secularization of the part of Christian metaphysics that views man as created in God\u2019s image, each with a soul that is equally eligible for salvation. (This is not to say that Christians are to \u201cblame\u201d for liberalism; liberals were seeking to liberate themselves and man in general from Christianity, but also religion in general.) <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thus, equality is the more fundamental value because it is the first consequence of liberation. This creates a self-destructive logic, whereby inequality is taken as a sign of a lack of liberty (obviously, since inequality results from hierarchy, which implies levels of subordination), signaling the need to restrict freedom in order to prevent those hierarchies from occurring. The resulting circular logic, whereby freedom is restricted in order to increase equality and thereby freedom, is the counterpart of its twin, whereby equality is good because it is good for equality. The pursuit of liberty then ends up subordinated to the pursuit of equality, which is why libertarians constitute a minority pressure group, and why the egalitarian state eventually morphs into a totalitarian state, in the grip of a secular puritanism.<\/span>","filename":"Bowden","ext":".gif","w":320,"h":242,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1493159557812,"time":1493159557,"md5":"3yrctwlv9L86cf5dkAuoYA==","fsize":1824949,"resto":122792503,"id":"JFGalLI1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122798867,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)18:32:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122798801\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122798801<\/a>","filename":"ayn-rand-1957c","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":675,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493159577692,"time":1493159577,"md5":"h9QoLKjL0LkQIotVwgT9kQ==","fsize":266337,"resto":122792503,"id":"VFDuCM8c","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122798874,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)18:33:00","name":"The Resident Nigger","com":"<a href=\"#p122797805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122797805<\/a><br>Now that Gisela&#039;s standing down, there&#039;s no reason to vote labour","time":1493159580,"resto":122792503,"id":"PmkeNSjm","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122798914,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)18:33:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122798698\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122798698<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;improving it<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;95 pound rotters trying to sound black singing about the queen<\/span>","time":1493159602,"resto":122792503,"id":"m22iu5nZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122798953,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)18:33:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122796625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122796625<\/a><br>I&#039;m pretty sure it does.","time":1493159622,"resto":122792503,"id":"zL81MKLS","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122799047,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)18:34:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122798013\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122798013<\/a><br>TORIES WINNING WALES<br>TORIES WINNING WALES<br>YOUGOV<br>WORKING CLASS VOTING LIKE TURKEYS FOR FUCKING CHRISTMAS AS THEY ALWAYS DO, THE THICK FUCKERS! <br>YAY!

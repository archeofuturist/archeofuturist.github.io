Anyway, I walk up and say hello and tell him I&#039;m a huge fan... Nothing. No reaction. Doesn&#039;t say a word. He just sits there, staring right through me. Staring intensely, but with no emotion whatsoever. I begin to feel awkward, so I say &quot;sorry to disturb you&quot; and start to walk away but before I even get a chance to turn he just gets up suddenly and starts walking toward me, still making full eye contact. At first I thought he was going to try and barge into me or something, but at the last minute (like an inch away from me) he turns and heads toward the trash can. Then he starts dumping everything on his plate into it. One by one. Steak, broccoli, everything. He picks up each bit of food up, holds it high above the can and drops it. Some of it (the steak) didn&#039;t even make it into the trash because he wasn&#039;t looking at what she was doing. Finally his plate is empty and this is the part that really fucking weirded me out. He looks around to check no one (but me) is looking, then slides the plate under his jacket and walks out.

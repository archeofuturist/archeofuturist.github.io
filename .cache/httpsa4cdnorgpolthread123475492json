Degeneracy and over-sexualized homosexuality is celebrated and Sexualization is incredibly common in media and regularly aimed at children. We live in a trivial culture where many feel alone and distant from a close community indulging in things that feel good instead of things that bring them meaning and a feeling of accomplishment. These things that people &#039;love&#039; to indulge in making them feel good for a short while manages to control the masses by giving them pleasure, they become brain dead and ignorant wanting nothing more than to feel good again and follow that.","filename":"aldous_huxley","ext":".jpg","w":1501,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":149,"tim":1493557476499,"time":1493557476,"md5":"NQIkiKAarX5h+1LVQ7gsww==","fsize":743348,"resto":0,"id":"txWHZXfZ","country":"IS","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"huxley-was-right-wasnt-he","country_name":"Iceland","replies":173,"images":29,"unique_ips":98,"tail_size":50},{"no":123475685,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)09:06:50","name":"anon","com":"Huxley&#039;s historical biog, &quot;Grey Eminence&quot; is easily the best thing he wrote, hands down.

Instead, turning to pornography as a way to indulge their impulses through a dopaminergic rush. It then becomes difficult for those individuals to see themselves and others as anything but means in which satisfaction can be derived. The result is a generational decline in self-perceived value not limited only to one\u2019s own sexuality but also to one\u2019s internal desires and passions. The greater acceptance of pornography in society is a symptom of a worsening cultural condition where such little regard is had for the value of the individual, the population becomes largely despondent to the idea of greater self-worth and fears to do anything extraordinary that would further propel them. Instead, choosing to remain pacified by the comforts afforded to them by an increasingly sensualist society.","filename":"1490199833146","ext":".png","w":1484,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1493557624295,"time":1493557624,"md5":"GnDICKq9p2fFfdVoQrHj6w==","fsize":2250949,"resto":123475492,"id":"olMC2keZ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123476052,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)09:11:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"if you want to fix this issue i suggest you turn off the cable box and get a device capable of playing youtube on your tv. you can find tons of old movies, music, and radio shows on youtube. there are plenty of old book collections and magazine backlogs on torrent websites like the pirate cove an others. better yet, you can find all the classics at your local library. try to spend less time on websites like 4chan and more time on those things. socializing with conservative internet people you know well through things like discord and IRC is a good way to stay grounded too.<br><br>be safe 4chan, the infowarts have only just begun","time":1493557889,"resto":123475492,"id":"1RbPBCRR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123476071,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)09:11:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"he didn&#039;t make it up though. he was part of the elite and knew this was the plan.","time":1493557906,"resto":123475492,"id":"+BHYIbq6","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":123476988,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)09:23:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123475492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123475492<\/a><br>Brave New World and 1984 were describing phases of the same system.

Orwell&#039;s dystopia is just a propaganda metaphor that aimed to render the terror of Stalinism intelligible to people (Englishmen) to whom pure despotism was remote from their historical memory - it wasn&#039;t in any meaningful was diagnostic of the anti-human elements of Liberalism; it was and is just a morality play about an alien form of total state that Orwell suggested must be actively confronted. Its a pro-democracy fable that avoids punitive critiques of the author&#039;s own culture.<br><br>Huxley&#039;s book is a scathing attack on modernity in general but doesn&#039;t provide any great insight into the peculiar theology of Liberalism in and of itself. While cogent and prescient, its more a cautionary tale about global technology and human freedom - and the fact that no extant political system or value system can adequately manage its disruptive features.<br><br>The genius of Clockwork Orange is that it describes a world where the liberal-democratic regime has mutated into a therapeutic state - an occurrence that, in Burgess&#039; nightmare world. has been exascerbated in scope and intensity by the monumental domination of world-culture and historical dialectic by Sovietism. The answer to New Soviet Man in the United Kingdom is a kind of therapeutic man - whose life is shorn of any moral considerations of his thoughts and behavior, he is simply identified as sick or healthy, which culminates in human creativity becoming synonymous with violence in the minds of people who are brutalized psychologically by a state that is entirely at odds with nature. The book identifies the cultural pathology of Liberalism, in other words.

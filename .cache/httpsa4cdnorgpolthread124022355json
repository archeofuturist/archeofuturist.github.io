They&#039;re the MOST unintelligent of all native races on the entire planet. Even Africans are more intelligent. Do you know why Australia is the way it is? <br>Because Aboriginals were too stupid to learn how to hunt. They&#039;re only one step above Fire Making Cavemen, and even then, cavemen knew how to hunt. They were so stupid, they couldn&#039;t hunt properly, so they burnt down entire forests. And because Australia was so cut of from the entire world until only a couple hundred years ago, this meant that for several thousand years, Aboriginals were terraforming the entirety of Australia by burning it to the ground. This is the reason Australia is so hot, the reason it&#039;s largely desert, and the reason why a good portion of our animals have gone extinct.<br><br>Aboriginals are the stupidest, most brain dead, most lazy animals in all of existence. <br><br>I wish Tasmanian&#039;s ruled all of Australia.

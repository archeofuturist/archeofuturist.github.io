In fact, absolutely nothing is stopping you from going to the border punching the officer, beating him up. Its just that there are consequences such as: others will help him, others have fucking guns.

Back when it was invented taking part in politics was an activity a male would participate in, exchange opinions and ideas. Now most voters just sit infront of the TV and repetitively watch the bullshit thats being fed to them. No interest in politics, no knowledge about politics. And somehow they have the power to decide who is going to lead a country, absolutely ridiculous.<br>And the saddest part about it all, there are more often than not, just no good candidates.

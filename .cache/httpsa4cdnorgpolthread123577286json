He thought being President would be just as easy as being CEO ... which for him means someone else would do the hard work, and he&#039;d slap his name on the end result.<br><br>He really doesn&#039;t know what goes into the empires that he&#039;s run. He doesn&#039;t know how to build buildings. He doesn&#039;t know how to get permits. He doesn&#039;t know how to hire contractors.<br><br>He doesn&#039;t know how to write a script for TV, or what a real executive producer does. He doesn&#039;t know how to educate people, or how to write a book. He isn&#039;t a cattle rancher or a textiles manufacturer.<br><br>He&#039;s a name. A name and a suit and a hairpiece. His only advantages in life are his family fortune and the fact that a lot of Americans currently find blowhard assholes entertaining. If he had to work for a living, he would be fucked.<br><br>Trump doesn&#039;t know how to be President, either. He doesn&#039;t know how the government works. He doesn&#039;t know the limits of his powers, or why a Judge on &quot;some island in the Pacific&quot; can just tell him &quot;no.&quot; He doesn&#039;t understand why a one-page list of bullets isn&#039;t a real tax plan, or why people laugh at him when he presents it.<br><br>He doesn&#039;t know, but there&#039;s noone to do the hard work for him. This is uncharted territory for Donald Trump ... he actually has responsibilities.<br><br>So he&#039;s scared and lonely and angry, and he reacts to that the way any manchild would. He mashes his red button, summoning a manservant with an icy cold soda pop, and then he sulks off to the living room to play video games. It&#039;s just that for Trump, the &quot;living room&quot; is a million dollar resort, and &quot;video games&quot; are &quot;golf and classified discussions held in public settings.&quot;","filename":"Donald_Trump_(14235998650)_(cropped)","ext":".jpg","w":1022,"h":1351,"tn_w":189,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493612545117,"time":1493612545,"md5":"QhgS+AqV89OKf9uXefKt0A==","fsize":1178489,"resto":0,"id":"h6nJeu14","country":"IE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"donald-trump-is-drowning","country_name":"Ireland","replies":2,"images":2,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123577547,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)00:25:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123577286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123577286<\/a><br>Nice thread you fucking nerd","filename":"IMG_0360","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":209,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1493612710437,"time":1493612710,"md5":"NZzjBv83gqL5mTYUNY2nqA==","fsize":25924,"resto":123577286,"id":"ifKE7K6H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123577648,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)00:26:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123577286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123577286<\/a>","filename":"1487776594817","ext":".png","w":2500,"h":1645,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1493612780023,"time":1493612780,"md5":"hBfmWCZSk6gMyedBnlmGhA==","fsize":225160,"resto":123577286,"id":"gWoRVhi2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

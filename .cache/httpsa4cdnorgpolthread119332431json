Why?<br><br>As always with matters of national character, the answers are long and complex, too much so for a diary entry. A key point to grasp, though, is that English national character, like so much else in the universe, is binary.<br><br>Yes: The impeccably correct English gent and his female counterpart, with their stiff upper lips, good tailoring, and the Three Indifferences (to food, sex, and the weather) are still a feature of the Island Race, as they have been for centuries. So, however, are the drunken louts and their drunken slut consorts. That\u2019s been the case for centuries, too. There\u2019s a good historical survey of that latter element in Jeremy Paxman\u2019s 1998 study of the English national character, Chapter 11.<br><br>Perhaps it was exactly this combination of dutiful rigor and feral coarseness that, by some kind of chemistry, made for historical success. The Duke of Wellington famously described his troops as \u201cthe scum of the earth \u2026 enlisted for drink.\u201d I bet he was right; but they won his battles for him.","time":1491229741,"resto":119332431,"id":"2RoYMVRu","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119333762,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)10:29:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119332321#p119332321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119332321<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119332321#p119332321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119332321<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119332321#p119332321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119332321<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119332321#p119332321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119332321<\/a><br>SHILLS AND JIDF BEGONE<br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119332321#p119332321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119332321<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119332321#p119332321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119332321<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119332321#p119332321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119332321<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119332321#p119332321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119332321<\/a><br>Ethnonationalists assemble","time":1491229743,"resto":119332431,"id":"q7TXPtY8","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":119333791,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)10:29:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Any pics of the actual attackers in Croydon?","time":1491229764,"resto":119332431,"id":"pfefyUNx","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119333832,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)10:29:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119333411\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119333411<\/a><br>theres literally a name you but you inbred potatospawn cant figure it out","time":1491229780,"resto":119332431,"id":"tDY2X6N\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

He was named Stefan. This little boy would suffer unimaginable child abuse at the hands of his family. But it would be worth it. For little did this boy know that he would go on to be the greatest philosopher that had ever existed. He would succeed where others had failed. He would live his values, though the heavens may fall, ridding himself of all hypocrisy. Were it not for Stefan Molyneux, we may have had to wait yet another 2500 years for a philosopher capable of advancing the human condition.<\/span><br>http:\/\/defoo.org\/stefan-molyneux\/","filename":"giphy","ext":".gif","w":512,"h":338,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1490641612878,"time":1490641612,"md5":"ZIDzOOkiznBCBeVqvwZaoA==","fsize":2169424,"resto":118546275,"id":"GSSzY3aF","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118547881,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:13:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1490641991,"resto":118546275,"id":"TS8275Qc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

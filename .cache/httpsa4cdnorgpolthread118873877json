Post some of the greatest inventions for humanity!","com":"And their inventors of course... i&#039;ll start:<br><br>1. Automobiles: <br>- Karl Benz was a German engine designer and auto Mobile engineer. His Benz Patent Motorcar from 1885 is considered the first practical motorcar<br>- Gottlieb Daimler (17 March 1834-6 March 1990) was an engineer, industrial designer and industrialist. He invented the high-speed liquid petroleum fuelled engine. <br><br>2. Aviation: <br>- Richard Pearse was a New Zealand farmer and inventor who performed pioneering experiments in aviation.<br>- Orville and Wilbur Wright. Two white American brothers.Although not the first to build and fly experimental aircraft, the Wright brothers were the first to invent aircraft controls that made fixed-wing powered flight possible.<br><br>3. Jet Engine: <br>- Sir Frank Whittle an English Royal Air Force engineer air officer. He is credited with single-handedly inventing the turbojet engine. <br>- Han Von Ohain: was a German physician, the designer of the first operational jet engine. His first design ran in March 1937 and it was one of his engines that powered the worlds first flyable all-jet aircraft.","filename":"IMG_1350","ext":".jpg","w":209,"h":200,"tn_w":209,"tn_h":200,"tim":1490843292442,"time":1490843292,"md5":"fywEonv33u2x0HOKYcdD8w==","fsize":19255,"resto":0,"id":"giD361kz","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-lets-have-some-fun-post-some-of-the-greatest","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":118874033,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)23:09:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Helicopter:<br>- igor Sikorsky was a Russian American aviation pioneer in both helicopters and fixed-wing aircrafts. In 1939 Silkorsky designed and flew the Vought-Sikorsky VS-300 The first viable American helicopter, which pioneered the router configuration used by most helicopters today. <br>- Paul Cornu was a French engineer. Paul Cornu made history by designing the worlds first successful manned rotary winged aircraft. <br><br>Ship propellers: <br>- Josef Ressel was a Czech Forrester and inventor who designed one of the first working ship propellers. He modified a steam-powered boat Civetta by 1829 and test-drove it in the Trieste harbor at six knots before the steam conduits exploded. Because of this misfortune, the police banned further testing. The explosion was not caused by the tested propeller as many believed at the time.<br>- the first transatlantic journey of a ship powered by a screw-propeller was by the SS Great Britain in 1845. Propeller design stabilized in the 1880s.<br><br>Steam locomotive:<br>- Richard Trevithick was a British inventor and mining engineer from Cornwall, England. His most significant contribution was the development of the first high-pressure steam engine. He also built the first full scale working railway steam locomotive. <br>- George Stephenson was an English civil engineer and mechanical engineer who built the first public inner-city railway line in the world to use steam locomotives, the Liverpool and Manchester Railway which opened in 1830. Renowned as the &quot;Father of railways&quot;. His real gauge of 4 feet 8 1\/2 inches (1,435 mm), sometimes called &quot;Stephenson gauge&quot; , Is the standard gauge by name and by convention for most of the worlds railways.","filename":"IMG_1355","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":379,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":105,"tim":1490843383981,"time":1490843383,"md5":"YchN6PHvjiDSQc0rTrBPAA==","fsize":39849,"resto":118873877,"id":"giD361kz","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

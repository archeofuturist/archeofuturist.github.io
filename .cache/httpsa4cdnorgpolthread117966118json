I don&#039;t mean that in the conspiracy meme way; I mean it in the fact that individual companies, like Lockheed Martin or Northrop Grumman have contributed more to defense tech in the last 50 years than the entire European aerospace\/defense industry. <br><br>Aerospace engineers are among the highest paid professions in the country, mostly because aerospace firms get a huge chunk of the budget. Let&#039;s say we pay a lot for an F-35, more than is needed for just the F-35, that means that Lockheed puts that money back into its company. They can put that excess money into funding other advanced research programs that are unprofitable; they can put that money into higher wages for engineers or hiring money, for fucks sake, they can even put it into share buybacks which boosts the values of American pensions and employees&#039; stock holdings, basically an indirect way of increasing their wages. <br><br>The only people who don&#039;t like this are, as you said OP, liberals with no clue of what the military does and enemies of the state. <br><br>It&#039;s funny how liberals crusade against high defense budgets, yet also preach that &quot;government&quot; invented the internet. Government didn&#039;t invent the internet, the fucking military invented the internet. The military has been and will continue to be at the forefront of most technological advancements.","time":1490295038,"resto":117966118,"id":"Cqobm9NN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117966796,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)14:50:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"One is necessary, the other is a luxury and arguably a detriment<br><br>That said I think military spending is too high.<br><br>In our current limitless spending climate, arguing we spend more on x than y is idiotic","time":1490295042,"resto":117966118,"id":"jUq1YnhO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117967171,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)14:53:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117966118\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117966118<\/a><br>We don&#039;t just throw away what we spend on the military, we sell the weapons and systems to other countries for a profit.

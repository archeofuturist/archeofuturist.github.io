They can put that excess money into funding other advanced research programs that are unprofitable; they can put that money into higher wages for engineers or hiring money, for fucks sake, they can even put it into share buybacks which boosts the values of American pensions and employees&#039; stock holdings, basically an indirect way of increasing their wages. <br><br>The only people who don&#039;t like this are, as you said OP, liberals with no clue of what the military does and enemies of the state. <br><br>It&#039;s funny how liberals crusade against high defense budgets, yet also preach that &quot;government&quot; invented the internet.

Right now America controls controls influence within Europe and the Sunni Kingdoms of the middle east, likewise Russia has influence over some of the old soviet bloc states and the shia populace south of its border (China having a smaller sphere in SE Asia and various African states). Each of the countries within these spheres have their own smaller spheres of influence (e.g. Germany over Europe, Saudi Arabia over the middle east, Kenya over east Africa..etc.), making these nations important local powers. However these local powers primarily exist because the Superpower in charge allows it.<br><br>Back during the days of imperialism the plan had always been to have a very large army that keeps those under its influence in line, and these countries would quite readily use this force to get rid of any possible threats to their power. However post-WW1 a new problem emerged: War became very costly. Every nation had weapons that could bring unprecedented amounts of destruction against all their enemies, so nobody wanted to get involved in minor skirmishes directly. NATO supports the mujaheddin to stop the soviets, Warsaw Pact supports north Vietnamese to stop American encroachment, China supports ZANU in order to establish Chinese communism in Africa instead of the soviet ZAPU. This became the new normal: don&#039;t get involved yourself but allow your pawns to die for you.<br><br>This however became a new problem emerged: how do you get a local power to not try and usurp power from those that rule it?

Bush went into Afghanistan and Iraq and spent billions in Aid for Africa. However going hard back into the old imperial ways is not an easy task (the Iraqi misstep showed how badly it could go), but it was a showing of force that the local powers did not expect. Soft Power was dead, do as we say or perish. Once Obama was in charge he attempted a hybrid mix of the two: hard power tactics of air dominance in Libya, but soft power tactics of precision strikes and paying the local power to take care of the problem like in Pakistan. But a mix of those two systems only exacerbated their negative downsides but none of their upsides: the hard power stance in Libya only led to pure anarchy as NATO was unwilling to occupy north Africa, and Pakistan stole all the money to try and bomb India into submission.<br><br>Trump however is a return to the old ways of Bush and even Imperial Britain: the local powers cannot be trusted, the only way they will do as we demand of them is through blood and steel. Deus Vult and so forth. Trump wanting a muslim ban and decreasing spending on middle eastern nations is an obvious sign of this. Trump knows that the Sunni monarchies will only pretend to agree to Americas foreign policy plans unless they have a gun held to their head. The MSM views Trumps actions either as naively allowing others to capture these countries in their sphere of influence or traitorously allowing Russia and China to sweep in. However that&#039;s not Trumps plan: his plan is that if any of the Arab kings go against him he will either bomb them back to the stone age or will just allow those who want to overthrow them to take charge. <br><br>This military spending is a message that the ways of paying out third parties is dying, and that a return to form of decisive but bloody invasions are on the table.

They can put that excess money into funding other advanced research programs that are unprofitable; they can put that money into higher wages for engineers or hiring money, for fucks sake, they can even put it into share buybacks which boosts the values of American pensions and employees&#039; stock holdings, basically an indirect way of increasing their wages. <br><br>The only people who don&#039;t like this are, as you said OP, liberals with no clue of what the military does and enemies of the state. <br><br>It&#039;s funny how liberals crusade against high defense budgets, yet also preach that &quot;government&quot; invented the internet.

The court sent the case back to Ramos to determine if lawmakers intentionally wrote the legislation to be discriminatory.<br><br>Ramos said in a 10-page decision that evidence &quot;establishes that a discriminatory purpose was at least one of the substantial or motivating factors behind passage&quot; of the measure.<br><br>&quot;The terms of the bill were unduly strict,&quot; she added.<br><br>Spokesmen for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton Jr. and Governor Greg Abbott, both Republicans, could not be reached for comment.<br><br>In January, after the Supreme Court declined to hear the case, Paxton said it was a common sense law to prevent voter fraud.<br><br>The ruling on voter ID comes about a month after two federal judges ruled that Texas lawmakers drew up three U.S. congressional districts to undermine the influence of Hispanic voters.<br><br>The measure requires voters to present photo identification such as a driver&#039;s license, passport or military ID card.<br><br>Plaintiffs have argued the law hits elderly and poorer voters, including minorities, hardest because they are less likely to have identification. They contend the measure is used by Republicans to suppress voters who typically align with Democrats.<br><br>The legislation has been in effect since 2011 despite the legal challenges.<br><br>--<br>Pic Unrelated","filename":"chizza","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1086,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":169,"tim":1491875605522,"time":1491875605,"md5":"btLf2vtoCSUd9SHkIVz5ag==","fsize":285562,"resto":0,"id":"p+l8\/K9v","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"us-judge-finds-texas-voter-id-law-was-intended-to","country_name":"United States","replies":31,"images":9,"unique_ips":29},{"no":120532497,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:55:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"Niggers and spics have no problem providing voter id for welfare.","time":1491875718,"resto":120532190,"id":"zAyXNOHW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120532574,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:55:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120532190\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120532190<\/a><br>americans seriously eat that shit? jesus fucking christ. and then &#039;muh genetics&#039; obviously is the reason. <br><br>also rolling.","time":1491875742,"resto":120532190,"id":"N4u2E171","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120532614,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:55:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"There&#039;s a video of someone going around asking minorities if they have ID, and all of them were awestruck that anyone would think that voter ID laws discriminate against minorities.

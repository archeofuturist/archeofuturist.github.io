Logic is based on premasis. You need something to be logical about. Logic is understood through our senses. Everything you know about the world is understood and received through your five senses and the mind. These senses are imperfect and extremely limited. Anything outside the realm of experience of these senses cannot be understood. God can never be understood through mundane logic and mental speculation.","time":1493013924,"resto":122545545,"id":"ykyiwvIe","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":122551655,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)02:07:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122550728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122550728<\/a><br>give us an answer that is better for society","time":1493014030,"resto":122545545,"id":"cHfuKbaU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122552018,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)02:11:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122550728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122550728<\/a><br>To bring control and unification to an Empire, yes.","time":1493014306,"resto":122545545,"id":"ApVGYr03","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122552131,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)02:12:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122551345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122551345<\/a><br>That&#039;s so interesting, you&#039;re not even aware of how the bible was written, interpreted, and translated?

Things that happened at the very beginning of our organic life or at the very beginning of the universe. Nevertheless we have enough theories to cover it and those theories are consistent with what we have great understanding of. Religion on the other hand makes it seem like it&#039;s ridiculous to believe something would arise by chance, or that universe &quot;happened&quot; at some point , but it&#039;s not ridiculous to believe that a God happened at one point (or some bullshit about always existing and how you can&#039;t comprehend it), and that he guided humanity writing a bunch of lies in his books as a joke, never to be found again.<br><br>Science is an inquiry that digs further. Religion just takes &quot;it just be like that&quot; as an answer and ceases to question. It&#039;s perfect for traditionalist republicucks who are afraid of independence and getting shocking answers about how the world actually works.","time":1493025281,"resto":122545545,"id":"cgjH7KS8","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":122566402,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:16:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122545750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122545750<\/a><br>\/thread","time":1493025373,"resto":122545545,"id":"J4eU8W5c","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":122566610,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:19:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122545545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122545545<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;girls can have penises too<\/span><br>Didn&#039;t see anything like that.

Logic is based on premasis. You need something to be logical about. Logic is understood through our senses. Everything you know about the world is understood and received through your five senses and the mind. These senses are imperfect and extremely limited. Anything outside the realm of experience of these senses cannot be understood. God can never be understood through mundane logic and mental speculation.","time":1493013924,"resto":122545545,"id":"ykyiwvIe","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":122551655,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)02:07:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122550728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122550728<\/a><br>give us an answer that is better for society","time":1493014030,"resto":122545545,"id":"cHfuKbaU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122552018,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)02:11:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122550728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122550728<\/a><br>To bring control and unification to an Empire, yes.","time":1493014306,"resto":122545545,"id":"ApVGYr03","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122552131,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)02:12:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122551345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122551345<\/a><br>That&#039;s so interesting, you&#039;re not even aware of how the bible was written, interpreted, and translated?

I said that liberalism would be a non-issue if not for atheism because the particularly virulent strain of extreme left wing shit we&#039;re seeing today is completely incompatibly with Christianity. Some Christians vote democrat but they&#039;re NOT the ones pushing for 21 genders, transgender rights, white privilege and safe spaces, those are being pushed almost exclusively by atheists. Atheism is the vector by which liberalism, especially the extreme version that has infected the west with things like gender theory, spreads throughout society. It would&#039;ve been simply impossible for the extreme left to reach this point without the huge support they&#039;ve got from the non-religious who bought into the propaganda hook line and sinker.","time":1493016073,"resto":122545545,"id":"D\/qJXzjf","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

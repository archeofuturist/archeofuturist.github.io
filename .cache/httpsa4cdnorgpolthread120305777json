It doesn&#039;t seem like there is any way around it, he who controls money controls the world. All businesses have to be friends with the bank to get anywhere because to make money you must have money and the major way of getting that startup money is through loans. Basically, all other paths of capitalism are pointless under banking industry.<br><br>The second is the &quot;money game&quot;. This is when the most profitable aspects in a capitalist society are maintained through playing the stock game. These people don&#039;t really contribute a product or service, or technically do any &quot;work&quot;. They win big through sneaky tactics to suck the fat off companies as they shuffle them around. They aren&#039;t producing goods, or supply services, they are draining from them like some sort of welfare. <br><br>In my mind Capitalism should reward people for supplying a product or service and their power should come from demand. There is something unholy about people that merely play the money game or make money itself their industry and the fact that they are the only real winners in capitalism, aside from people who are uplifted by the demand of the people.","filename":"1490258698393","ext":".png","w":825,"h":850,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491761861884,"time":1491761861,"md5":"VWrj6xBDQ7D+oPxTEC0cVw==","fsize":922481,"resto":120305777,"id":"hBCBT76U","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120314075,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)14:19:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120313014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120313014<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Using good goy <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;worshiping the most retarded kike of all time<\/span><br>People don&#039;t naturally want equality they want to be the best, thats why natural selection is a thing, you can&#039;t change human behavior unless you genetically change it.

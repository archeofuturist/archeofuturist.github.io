He estimates the ~20% of properties being sold are not intended to be the residence of the owner, or in other words, they are investments properties. This seems odd when you consider that if the same thing were done with hydro, for instance, it would not be nearly as acceptable. For example, if some one was able to buy a neighborhoods water supply, in bulk, from the hydro company, then resell it at a massive profit that would be the analog of what we are seeing in the housing market. I realized that it boils down to a simple question - Should we treat real estate as an investment or a utility? It seems odd to me that we would treat something as essential as housing in this way. Am I wrong, \/pol\/?<br><br>TL;DR A significant percentage of real estate in the GTA is being purchased as an investment instead of as a place to live.<br><br>I imaging the situation is similar in Vancouver, Australia, New Zealand, UK etc.and in no small way has contributed to the record setting rise in prices.","filename":"Bubble-Burst","ext":".jpg","w":495,"h":285,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":143,"tim":1490396287756,"time":1490396287,"md5":"oEXqHznl9\/ogfD+aVuPgMw==","fsize":79336,"resto":0,"id":"LmS97STI","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"rbg-real-estate-bubble-general-investment-v","country_name":"Canada","replies":68,"images":9,"unique_ips":27},{"no":118146799,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)19:00:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118146462\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118146462<\/a><br>I smell a communist.","time":1490396439,"resto":118146462,"id":"HDb\/tmaR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118147224,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)19:03:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118146462\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118146462<\/a><br>Question is what would it take for it to change? <br><br>People protesting on the streets?

Say we collapse. It gets so bad we fall into martial law, Trump locks up all the pedos and traitors, night of the long knives and everything.

It&#039;s not just some magical force that makes things better, it&#039;s the existence of voluntary (as in, two people want X so they do X) trade of goods and services without any exertion of force.

Nothing changed. The laws the Democrats proposed were never in effect. Democrat lawmakers, at the behest of large corporate donors representing internet companies, would like the FCC to regulate the internet. This is ripe for a practice known as regulatory capture. These large internet companies would install their pets into the boards of the FCC and control the internet. If you don&#039;t believe that that&#039;s the case, I suggest you read into the Security and Exchange Commission, which was created to control Wall Street and protect everyday people from it and now serve to protect Wall Street from Everyday People. The FTC guidelines work just fine. The issue is that people like Zuckerberg and Page would really like a regulatory body to exist to dictate how the internet should work. And who better to staff such an agency then people like Zuckerberg and Page?

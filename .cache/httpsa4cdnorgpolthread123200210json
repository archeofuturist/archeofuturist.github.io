But that building meant much, much more - and so they paid whatever it took to acquire it.<br><br>666 in Judaism is not a &quot;satanic&quot; number, because the very notion of &quot;Satan&quot; and being &quot;anti-Christ&quot; only has meaning in a belief system that accepts Christ - which by definition Jews do not. The notion of &quot;false&quot; messiah arises only when there&#039;s a &quot;true&quot; messiah to whom to compare.<br><br>Without the notion of Jesus as the &quot;true&quot; messiah, leading to life beyond this plane, any other messiah is just fine and dandy.

This was Moshe&#039;s prayer invoking Divine Mercy on behalf of the Jewish People.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Mosad Hayesod&quot; cites the Vilna Gaon&#039;s commentary on the Zohar that &quot;the number 666 contains hidden within it exalted and lofty messianic potential.&quot; No other explanation is offered there.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We do know that the number six represents the physical world. The Torah describes the creation of the universe as a six part, six day, process. Our ancient sources describe the universe as emanating in six directions \u2013 north, south, east, west, up, down \u2013 from a central point. All physical space and all physical objects have these six dimensions.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;666 is six repeated three times. Repeating a concept three times represents the affirmation and strength of that concept. The number 666 could thus represent the strength and perfection of the physical world, which Judaism teaches will occur in the messianic era, when the physical world will reach its ultimate purpose, to be a vehicle through which the created experience the Creator.<\/span><br><br>It&#039;s all about *power*.

Because then he will be seen by their followers as being Chosen by G-d, the new messiah, to lead the Jews to ultimate power - and the rest of humanity to suffering and death.<br><br>I&#039;ll repeat, it doesn&#039;t matter whether you believe this is true.

This is significant because there is evidence suggesting that genetic similarity between couples might be linked with infertility and inbreeding. Women (of all races) are naturally attracted to superior genetics as well. There may be other complex reasons for choosing a mate, but genetics is one of them (and is largely subconscious).<br><br>Black people have less harmful mutations than whites. In 2008, a Cornell University study revealed that the genetics of Europeans have far more harmful mutations than people of African descent. These harmful mutations have continued to build up and continue to plague European bloodlines. The same Cornell University study also revealed that people of African descent had far greater variations in their genetics than their European counterparts (reinforcing the previous point).","filename":"IMG_0790","ext":".jpg","w":999,"h":925,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":231,"tim":1493239141700,"time":1493239141,"md5":"YIbntK6CLu2+oavhbhOdTg==","fsize":437785,"resto":0,"id":"eWC\/+9lt","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-blacks-are-superior","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122935666,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)16:39:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"In The Developmental Psychology of the Black Child, Dr. Amos Wilson analyzes studies conducted by white social scientists that revealed significant differences in how quickly Black babies seemed to develop compared to European babies. The study found that at only 9 hours old African babies were able to prevent their heads from falling backwards. It took European babies roughly six weeks to accomplish this. By the time African babies were 11 months old, they were able to climb the steps alone while European babies typically didn\u2019t accomplish this until they were 15 months old. The study focused specifically on African babies, but Wilson explains that the same trends were also found to be true in Black children of other nationalities.<br><br>The very pigment that gives superior black people their skin complexion is the source of many miraculous health benefits. Melanin provides incredible protection against the negative effects of ultraviolet radiation, neutralizes harmful effects of others forms of radiation, fights off signs of aging and so much more. Perhaps even more astounding is melanin\u2019s unique ability to absorb certain energy sources such as light and sound waves, and convert them into reusable energy.","time":1493239182,"resto":122935572,"id":"eWC\/+9lt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122935773,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)16:40:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Black individuals have higher tesosterone on average, leading to superior muscle development, speed, endurance, and fast-twitch muscle fibers.

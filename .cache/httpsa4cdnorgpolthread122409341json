Why wouldn&#039;t he give us all second chance like the people who will live during the rapture? They get to see God&#039;s might and power first hand and know for a fact that he&#039;s real and they can repent and change for the better. I had gone to a Christian elementary school and middle school and yet he never manifested himself to me, even when I was on the side of my bed crying for hours, praying for him to speak to me. Why didn&#039;t he show himself to me then? Did he want me to not believe in him? Why? I had been a dutiful Christian for 14 years, I prayed every morning and every night, at every breakfast and every dinner, and any time I had done something wrong. Am I just not important to save from hell? Why did he create me just for me to suffer? Why did he create humans just to see them suffer?","filename":"Lets-Talk-About-God-001","ext":".jpg","w":1546,"h":1117,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":180,"tim":1492944397648,"time":1492944397,"md5":"1b+6HmfH4l\/SdS3E2baM4Q==","fsize":643009,"resto":0,"id":"eaiAUNnq","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"god-is-a-real-meanie","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122409502,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)06:48:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122409341\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122409341<\/a><br>God is God, his plan we can&#039;t comprehend.

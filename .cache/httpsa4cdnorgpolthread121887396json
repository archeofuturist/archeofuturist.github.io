Meetup with like minded people, talk to people who seem sympathetic to us and get to come along. <br>TRANSPORT: Carpooling or bussing. There is strength in numbers, not only in the actual riot but in peoples perceptions of the strength of the movement. It is important to make attending as easy as possible. Not everyone who wants to come has the money to do so, so organise carpools and even hire a bus if that is what it takes.<br>PROPAGANDA: Have printed banners that are easy to read from a distance, make them clever so the media want to use them for clicks. We have the best memes so use them. This also means that the demo should have some responsible for sending photos of the protest to friendly media sources (along with numbers of attendees and how many people got arrested).","filename":"XMB5Hdjl_400x400","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492634851191,"time":1492634851,"md5":"ZCikiOG+3cONNX9xNIYg0w==","fsize":23770,"resto":121887396,"id":"vGrBDbAv","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121893918,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:47:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121893807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121893807<\/a><br>forgot pic","filename":"Krieg_Uniforms2","ext":".jpg","w":950,"h":656,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1492634865467,"time":1492634865,"md5":"BVXZiIyNov2VzH06BO9aDg==","fsize":243036,"resto":121887396,"id":"\/xLeRoFM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121893924,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:47:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121892949\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121892949<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;amazon.com\/s\/ref=nb_sb_noss_1?url=<wbr>search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=b<wbr>ike+armor<\/span><br><br>This is actually a pretty good suggestion.","time":1492634867,"resto":121887396,"id":"yCeU1Dwe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121894014,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:48:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121887473\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121887473<\/a><br>I always wanted a crusader style kevlar outfit.

At best, the smaller panels for houses are the route they should have been pushing, not those desert mirrors. Parabolic mirror water heating is also somewhat neat for small housing units, but alas, this tech is soiled by areas with low light. Next is wind, which is being placed in rather bad spots, and imo, not being used correctly. Geothermal is somewhat rare imo, though somewhat good price vs power. Hydroelectric is in the same boat, very good, but limited to water access. Natural gas is very, very bad in terms of longevity. Coal is amazing for power vs price, but waste is disastrous. <br><br>Out of the long term sources, nuclear is clamored as the best option in large scale operations. A major factor of it&#039;s decaying support to improve the sector comes from older generations looking at past plant failures and fearing another one happening. Those plants were built with 1950&#039;s tech. Fuki in jap was the most recent failure, and even they had numerous cut corners on safety for their plant, not to mention location was complete shit, and azns aren&#039;t well know for safety to begin with. As always, there is the shadow aspect to new energies, where as the existing giants of power try to sabotage new sources to remain in power. You&#039;ll see millions dumped into &quot;renewables&quot; that hardly put anything out, or go out of business within a couple months. These energies aren&#039;t expected to survive, but be a short payoff and smear. Real techs get bought and buried, or simply just &quot;taken out&quot;. <br><br>In all, I think there is a larger shift in finding more reliable ways to charge and store energy, than there is a way to generate it. Super super capacitors are becoming a thing, where as they take fractions of time to charge, and hold a charge much longer than conventional storage.

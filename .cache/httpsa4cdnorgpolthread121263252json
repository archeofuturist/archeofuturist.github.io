Pre-war buildings often have sash type windows at high levels - the Empire State being one - but I seem to recall hearing on the tour they were only allowed to open them up a little bit, like a crack, over a certain floor, and needed special keys to open them all the way, like for cleaning or repair. They have 90 floor apartment buildings with balconies, so who knows? <br><br>Both towers had observation decks on the roof, I was able to be up on one of them a year before the event. On the Trade Tower, you couldn&#039;t get that close to the edge, they had a platform you walked on, that stopped about 15 feet from the edge - probably to deter jumpers. The Empire State has the observation deck, but it&#039;s got a wire mesh cage to stop jumpers. People throw shit off them all the time - a penny won&#039;t kill you, like the urban myth, but it will leave a hell of a bruise - if it even reaches the street - up that high, you have more chance of shit landing on a neighboring rooftop than the street. The wind currents alone will blow anything small pretty far away.","time":1492309678,"resto":121263252,"id":"3ep\/Cwx3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121302507,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)22:28:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121268776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121268776<\/a><br>Why not the chegg?","time":1492309730,"resto":121263252,"id":"tGIousVb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121302525,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)22:28:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"I broke my ankle when I was young after climbing onto the roof of our house and wanting to see if an umbrella would slow my fall enough to hit the ground safely.

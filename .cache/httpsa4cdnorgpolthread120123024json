Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491652396466,"time":1491652396,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"Wuap9VPw","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":52,"images":9,"unique_ips":26},{"no":120123094,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)07:54:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120123024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120123024<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Atheism<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Religion<\/span><br><br>???","time":1491652441,"resto":120123024,"id":"dtYwOge3","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":120123117,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)07:54:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120123024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120123024<\/a>","filename":"1377780868968","ext":".png","w":186,"h":264,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491652460898,"time":1491652460,"md5":"yeSm6raxPxNNWvWQZHY+CA==","fsize":132379,"resto":120123024,"id":"nAV7ffKz","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":120123179,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)07:54:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120123094\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120123094<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;estonia<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;country<\/span>","filename":"1490616520210","ext":".png","w":1326,"h":550,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":51,"tim":1491652494019,"time":1491652494,"md5":"qh\/UW7z9gXZZzN0eQBrL3g==","fsize":74428,"resto":120123024,"id":"Wuap9VPw","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120123186,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)07:54:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120123024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120123024<\/a><br>4.5 to 1.8 <br>Wow, who cared in the first place with numbers so low to begin with.","time":1491652499,"resto":120123024,"id":"zp2U3dS9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120123285,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)07:56:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"*steps into mic*<br>China","time":1491652565,"resto":120123024,"id":"G2BQq2E7","country":"CN","country_name":"China"},{"no":120123364,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)07:56:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120123024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120123024<\/a><br>pictured is exponentially worse than a neet.","time":1491652617,"resto":120123024,"id":"IoONnpDB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120123422,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)07:57:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120123024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120123024<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wo<wbr>rldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-o<wbr>n-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chri<wbr>stian-nation-within-15-years.html<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If everyone in China believed in Jesus then we would have no more need for police stations.

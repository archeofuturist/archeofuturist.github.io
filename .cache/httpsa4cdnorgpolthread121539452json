However, where Bush had failed in Iraq because he falsely assumed sandniggers could be civilized (no offense middle-east bros), Trump might actually succeed. SK has already shown that they are capable of rebuilding from scratch after WW2, so with the right guidance it wouldn&#039;t be impossible for NK to do the same. So let&#039;s assume Kim and his whole goverment gets annihilated and replaced. The region becomes stabilized and the lengthy process of NK recovery begins with some help from SK (because USA would push them into it and they can&#039;t say no) and maybe even China (which would get some clay from this whole ordeal). <br><br>So what&#039;s the end result 50 years down the line? A decent new country which basically owns its existance to USA and is potentially another useful ally in the area. China also gets some land so they are happy and the relationship with the USA gets improved. After NK is able to stand on its own again they can have a healthy relationship with SK, perhaps even reunite. Of course, Trump is playing a game with some risk involved, even if that risk is relatively small, but as a businessman he knows that you can&#039;t win big unless you take some risks. <br><br>That being said though, as a chaosfag and a happeningfag I still want for this whole situation to escalate to hell and end with nuclear exchange to kick off WW3.

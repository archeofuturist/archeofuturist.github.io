Writing allows for cultural transmission to be much easier (i.e. the only requirement is that people can read), allows for the build up of knowledge over time even if unused and much more precise, as it is easier to preserve the original meaning. Also, one additional detail: what allowed writing to be a thing is that people actually had more time in their hands because no longer they had to be 100% self-sufficient, as people became farmers.<br><br>It is very common to ignore today the fact that our civilization is completely built on the shoulders of our ancestors because it is often assumed that everything that is traditional or not modern is old and bad. However, remove this cultural build up of knowledge,norms and practices, and we would all revert to cavemen. This idea of a cultural build up is literally a type of capital. Destroy your culture like we are doing today and you are destroying capital.

It goes against what we know from all the other cultures. Also, the reason why people formed cities is because being with others outside your direct kin group benefited you.

During the first four minutes nothing happened, then as the speed of the drumming, and the noise, increased, the big stone block started to rock and sway, and suddenly it took off into the air with an increasing speed in the direction of the platform in front of the cave hole 250 metres high. After three minutes of ascent it landed on the platform. <\/span><br>now i agree this sounds pretty ridiculous, but then there is this stuff<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZqR<wbr>A7m1KEGQ <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0K8<wbr>zs-KSitc<br><br><br>indeed it sounds like it underlies another principle than the story of the tibetians, but there were stories about levitating stuff with sound, and now we can actually do that. so my theory is that UFOs are based on an ancient technology the Nazis rediscovered and that underlie some principle completely ignored by mainstream science.","filename":"Vimana","ext":".jpg","w":350,"h":439,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492063220115,"time":1492063220,"md5":"Ka8EjH0HSOP38WBy+sBkzA==","fsize":51806,"resto":120866919,"id":"uRVPzEeS","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120876158,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)02:06:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120874262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120874262<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120875568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120875568<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120875611\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120875611<\/a><br>another thing i thought about is what if the ancient civilizations had technology like we do, but called it magic, or whatever magic is called in the specific language.<br>i mean we have TV which lets us see far away things, like a crystal ball. we can shoot fireballs with flamethrowers, shoot lightning with a teslacoil, even can fly around. then something happened, and barely anything of it remained. whenever someone came up with the &quot;magic&quot; the locals couldnt explain it and thus it became this magical, unexplainable thing. then we came to rediscover some of it, but since it wasnt unexplainable anymore it wasnt magic anymore, so we called it technology this time. and this is where we are now.<br><br>maybe those civilizations had a way to harness some energy from the magnetic field or the leylines if you want to believe in that and were actually more advanced than we are. they thus build buildings like the ruins in pic related which underlie the same or similar principle as our computer technology and thus seems like an ancient mother board or some circuits<br><br>allegedly stalin made experiments with them where he put just a small pyramid over some oilwell, and suddenly it produced more oil than without. some people say they experienced some feel of pressure while being in the pyramids of egypt. they are if im not mistaken also aligned with other monuments, the leylines if you want so, which maybe transfer information\/energy and the pyramids are a way to recieve\/harvest those. the pyramids are said to bring the pharao to the stars, but they werent used as tombs. now if we assume its not about an alien spacehangar, maybe it helped with astral projection, or remote viewing as the CIA likes to call it, helping you log into the grid and access the information. lots of questions","filename":"ancient circuits","ext":".jpg","w":259,"h":408,"tn_w":79,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492063572281,"time":1492063572,"md5":"425NAat6nItCJPDa\/+LbAA==","fsize":46831,"resto":120866919,"id":"uRVPzEeS","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120876755,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)02:12:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"what the fuck is this turn a gundam lol<br><br>this is exactly what happened there","filename":"url","ext":".jpg","w":259,"h":194,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492063956344,"time":1492063956,"md5":"ftia2BpHf33B\/9Cn1XO4Ww==","fsize":7335,"resto":120866919,"id":"2RZJuKa6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120877992,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)02:25:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"a megalith in baalbek, with human for scale.","filename":"Baalbek-Stone","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492064730096,"time":1492064730,"md5":"gE87zTTX5yHVPQAO8vlQ1w==","fsize":183706,"resto":120866919,"id":"uRVPzEeS","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120878241,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)02:28:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120876755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120876755<\/a><br>Literally the worst gundam series","time":1492064899,"resto":120866919,"id":"bROjLKkA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120878447,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)02:30:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120878241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120878241<\/a><br>that award goes to reco in g man","time":1492065047,"resto":120866919,"id":"2RZJuKa6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120879033,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)02:37:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120866919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120866919<\/a>","filename":"gobeklitepe","ext":".jpg","w":624,"h":387,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":77,"tim":1492065467887,"time":1492065467,"md5":"YBmM6XfdFWXitYOpYivg6w==","fsize":96090,"resto":120866919,"id":"5oo1jg4m","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120879230,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)02:40:10","name":"Anonymous","filename":"arakulski1","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":676,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1492065610266,"time":1492065610,"md5":"3iSLEe28ZQ+iyTckpi3\/zA==","fsize":453855,"resto":120866919,"id":"5oo1jg4m","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120879258,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)02:40:28","name":"Anonymous","filename":"arakulski2","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492065628632,"time":1492065628,"md5":"Pc+cAogw2AjBupUh7YUhvA==","fsize":69840,"resto":120866919,"id":"5oo1jg4m","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120879300,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)02:41:10","name":"Anonymous","filename":"bosniapyramid","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":516,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":67,"tim":1492065670550,"time":1492065670,"md5":"HukrbW\/LwIFFkFzB19fpNA==","fsize":183335,"resto":120866919,"id":"5oo1jg4m","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120879590,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)02:44:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120866919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120866919<\/a><br><br>The seas rose.

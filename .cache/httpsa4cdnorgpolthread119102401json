Here&#039;s what you do. Choose one tiny stupid insignificant thing to change that is easy when isolated (drink a glass of water everyday, don&#039;t eat out but enjoy grocery store junk food instead, take a short walk every day). You literally MUST start SOMEWHERE. After a month or so, once your new habit is ingrained, add another one. It will get easier and easier to add new habits as you go on.<br><br>Two more things that are simple, yet highly effective for discipline:<br>-morning routine: when you start every day at the same time and do the same activities (I started doing a morning walk that was easy, yet made me feel like superman ready and primed for the day), it becomes a springboard from which to maintain discipline for the rest of the day.<br><br>-meditation: learn how to do mindfulness meditation where you clear your mind and focus only on your breath for 10 minutes or so. There are great apps to help you get started, but eventually you want to do it without an app if course. This has some kind of almost magical effect of making you feel more balanced and in control, and the more consistent you are (aim for at least once a day), the more the effect builds. When I miss a few days if meditation, my other habits ALWAYS suffer.<br><br>And one last piece of wisdom: absolutely positively NEVER give up. The road to success is loaded with failures. I have been meaning to get my life together for 5 years now, but I only managed to get a foothold last year after countless failures. But I never ever told myself that I would just accept that failure. I always reassured myself that I would try again and again. Meditation can also help this mindset. You have to accept what &quot;is&quot; (you&#039;re someone who lacks control) in order to make change happen. Don&#039;t RESIST your nature. Just make slow changes over time. And watch motivational people on YouTube. Elliot Hulse, for instance, was almost like medicine for me, especially when I felt defeated.

The entire time I knew him, he exercised a strict as fuck diet, and worked out every day. He talked to me about how he hated fat people, but I hesitated to judge, because I knew the reason I was not fat was not because of any special motivation, I just naturally tended towards keeping my weight healthy, my diet was absolute shit. Some people are just lucky, like myself, but despite my luck, now I&#039;m eating clean, with even less motivation to do so than yourself.<br><br>One thing I will say is that you will never succeed so long as your motivation inherantly hinges on the external. If getting bitches is why you want to get skinny, you will never succeed, because you can improve your diet for months, but if you continue to not get bitches, eventually the motivation that was driving you will collapse. My only external motivation was people making fun of my terrible diet.<br><br>Only when you convince yourself, and not just trick yourself, but convince yourself that you want to improve your diet and live at a healthy weight for YOU, it will be very hard to succeed. Until you decide you want to go on a diet, not to impress other people, but so you can be proud of the respect you&#039;ve shown yourself, it will be very hard to improve your diet sustainably.<br><br>For me, I had to sort of hit a rock bottom, and learn about things that INSPIRED me to improve myself like listening to Peterson on youtube. Once you treat yourself like somebody you love, like somebody you couldn&#039;t stand to mistreat, that&#039;s when it becomes easier to eat right every day, because it becomes intolerable to mistreat yourself.","time":1490998342,"resto":119102401,"id":"YCmElnWj","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119107285,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)18:15:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Count calories.

I recommend, although this is unconventional, philsophy, self-reflection, and really figuring out what you want from life.<br><br>I learned what a good diet was long before I adopted a good diet.

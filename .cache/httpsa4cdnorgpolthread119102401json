At first, everyone around me was talking and enjoying the evening. Kids were laughing and having fun. Then through the noise and the chatter, I heard the screaming. I looked across the dark lawn that separated the property and saw a little ways away from where the kids were playing a patch of lawn with two pale hands clinging to it. <br><br>Without thinking, I ran as fast as I could. I got there right as one of the little hands slipped of. A boy, about 5, was playing with the others when he went off exploring. He had found the edge of the grass, and on the other side a 12 foot drop into a creek that was roaring like a river due to the recent rain. He had slipped and started to fall when he grabbed onto to clumps of grass at the edge. 10 seconds later and he would have fallen and drowned. <br><br>I hoisted him up and returned him to his mother. <br><br>I was a fat guy, and I started running and working out partly because if an emergency ever arose I&#039;d be pretty fucking useless and make it worse.

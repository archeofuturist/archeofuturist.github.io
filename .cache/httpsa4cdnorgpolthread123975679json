Government, she argues, is needed for three things;<br>a. army to protect us from external aggressors<br>b. police to maintain rule and order (i.e. those knifing rib jabbers).<br>c. judicial system ( which in the USA is made of both the judiciary, who uphold the laws and the legislative branch, who create the laws).<br><br>Unfortunately what tends to happen is that if a company wants to focus solely on making great products they soon find themselves called before congress and threatened with their companies being ripped apart. The only protection they have is, in effect to, to bribe, through lobbying, these congressmen to keep their company. examples of these companies who kept to themselves and found themselves in trouble are Rockefeller back in the day with his oil company and bill gates in the 90&#039;s. If you don&#039;t play the game you are ripped apart as a company. So by default large companies play this game.<br><br>Ultimately there are two ways of obtaining things from people.<br><br>1. through Force. This is what government is and is the reason the constitution are in fact limitations on the government... these limit their use of force. By creating monopolies maintained by the use of force, governments reduce innovation, which would lower the cost of living and so one needs less and less to actually survive.<br><br>2. business must use Persuasion i.e. good products at good prices for you to part with your money. <br><br>This is simply my opinion, but having such mixed economy, where government enforced monopolies thrive is akin to feudalism, the various corporations being different fiefdoms. <br><br>So if it weren&#039;t for the different labels she would be in agreement with you.","time":1493860068,"resto":123975679,"id":"+13x9mRr","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123995638,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:13:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123993408\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123993408<\/a><br><br>Thought I would check... looks like wikipedia disagrees ...

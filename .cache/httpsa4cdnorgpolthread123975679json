Actually, it is not the individual which is self-interested, but the genes the individual carries. That is why people sacrifice for their children and family. Governments attempt to force people to cooperate by making it their self interest to do so, through rewards and punishments. (Governments consist of people working together to force each other to behave collectively.)<br><br>A society is successful to the degree it can align self-interest with group-interest. Government policies should be chosen with the foreknowledge that people will behave in self-interest. This is why capitalism is more successful than communism. Enough people will always take the best option available to them that any system relying on altruism is doomed.

The only protection they have is, in effect to, to bribe, through lobbying, these congressmen to keep their company. examples of these companies who kept to themselves and found themselves in trouble are Rockefeller back in the day with his oil company and bill gates in the 90&#039;s.

By creating monopolies maintained by the use of force, governments reduce innovation, which would lower the cost of living and so one needs less and less to actually survive.<br><br>2. business must use Persuasion i.e. good products at good prices for you to part with your money. <br><br>This is simply my opinion, but having such mixed economy, where government enforced monopolies thrive is akin to feudalism, the various corporations being different fiefdoms. <br><br>So if it weren&#039;t for the different labels she would be in agreement with you.","time":1493860068,"resto":123975679,"id":"+13x9mRr","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123995638,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:13:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123993408\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123993408<\/a><br><br>Thought I would check... looks like wikipedia disagrees ...

Briefly, you do good to me and I&#039;ll do good to know. You don&#039;t do bad to me, I won&#039;t do bad to you. The Golden Rule and the Silver Rule are manifestations of this principle. Almost all minor acts of benevolence fall under this principle. As long as it remains mutual and doesn&#039;t become parasitic, it is a very admirable trait.

Ayn Rand, in her just hatred of parasites and encroaching socialist policies, fails to see that altruism itself is rationally selfish after a fashion.<br><br>Normal reciprocity is &quot;I will help him, because he helped me&quot;<br><br>A slightly longer term reciprocity is &quot;I will help him, because he helped me in the past.&quot; which acts as a kind of mutually beneficial relationship.

Or to summarize all that<br><br>1. Ayn Rand wasn&#039;t a cruel heartless monster, she was just reacting against a climate of pathological altruism.<br><br>2. She does however go too far in her reversal of that principle and her attempt to transform ALL benevolent behavior into purely self-interested behavior.

Innovation i.e. creation of compelling products where customers throw money at them, e.g. teals motors.<br><br>In a free society monopolies will eventually form, the only question is which form. <br><br>2.On &quot;Eugenics towards the intelligent&quot;:<br>Kindly note that in recent world history eugenics occurred, as far as I&#039;m aware, in non-free societies. e.g. Nazi Germany, Congo etc... Dictators tend to be in charge when things like this occur... even with the mixed systems in the USA the rule of law maintains justice. Incidentally, she ,Ayn Rand, was also disgusted by eugenics and the notion of culling inferior human beings. Therefore in a theocracy we would be more at risk of such events.<br><br>3.On &quot;People are just animals&quot;:<br>I would respectfully disagree. Man is noticeably different from animals. We lack big teeth and huge muscles(generally) and could not stand up against a tiger or elephant(one on one).

It&#039;s not to say things won&#039;t be difficult for some... it will be.

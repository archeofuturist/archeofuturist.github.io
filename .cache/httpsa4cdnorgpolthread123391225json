No. It&#039;s garbage. I weigh 150 btw so no im not some fat burger I just find it fucking stupid to punish everybody especially when this helped nobody","time":1493518386,"resto":123391225,"id":"Dhsir7Qc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123421124,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)22:13:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123420480\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123420480<\/a><br>How is it manly to accept to be roobed from your money by your country only to have your kids treated like dirt?<br><br>Fucking ape logic, not a surprise coming from the 60% country, heh.","filename":"1492115688069","ext":".jpg","w":916,"h":892,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1493518421645,"time":1493518421,"md5":"AXJrjpLOD22qugrEF7\/txw==","fsize":81589,"resto":123391225,"id":"X+dwKM7P","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":123421125,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)22:13:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"The food just went from being ok, to complete garbage. Schools started outsourcing their cafeterias to these companies that, instead of providing healthier foods, made smaller portions of the same greasy shit to meet the calorie regulations. All through high school I had to pay for three lunches everyday because I was always starving afterwards. This is probably one of the best things Trump could do to our country. I still despise Michelle Obama for single-handedly ruining four years of lunch for me.","time":1493518421,"resto":123391225,"id":"VUxayjlS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123421174,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)22:14:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123419978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123419978<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No idea what they serve now, but it can&#039;t be that bad.<\/span><br>its worse than garbage, kids would rather not eat or buy food now.","time":1493518450,"resto":123391225,"id":"f2vjCsjT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

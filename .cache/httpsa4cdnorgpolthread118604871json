They are all enlightening and frankly quite scary, but valuable resources for investigation. The current top investigator for the franklin scandal Nick Bryant is interviewed by famed expert on conspiracies Peter Levenda. Also Whitley Strieber, author of Communion discusses his traumatic memories of childhood seemingly related to MKUltra programming, even including ties to The Finder&#039;s Cult.<br><br>https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/Whitley<wbr>-Strieber_Dreamland_Intelligence-Co<wbr>mmunity-Child-Abuse\/01-JonRappoport<wbr>-IntelligenceCommunityChildAbuseDre<wbr>amland_01_09_10.mp3<br><br>And finally, the picture for this thread is a concise account of The Finders Case.

Cameron had been hoping to correct schizophrenia by erasing existing memories and reprogramming the psyche. He commuted from Albany, New York, to Montreal every week to work at the Allan Memorial Institute of McGill University and was paid $69,000 from 1957 to 1964 ($543,100 in 2016 dollars) to carry out MKUltra experiments there. These research funds were sent to Dr. Cameron by a CIA front organization, the Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology, and as shown in internal CIA documents, Cameron did not know that the money originated from the CIA.[52] In addition to LSD, Cameron also experimented with various paralytic drugs as well as electroconvulsive therapy at thirty to forty times the normal power. His &quot;driving&quot; experiments consisted of putting subjects into drug-induced coma for weeks at a time (up to three months in one case) while playing tape loops of noise or simple repetitive statements. His experiments were typically carried out on patients who had entered the institute for minor problems such as anxiety disorders and postpartum depression, many of whom suffered permanently from his actions.[53] His treatments resulted in victims&#039; incontinence, amnesia, forgetting how to talk, forgetting their parents, and thinking their interrogators were their parents.[54] His work was inspired and paralleled by the British psychiatrist William Sargant at St Thomas&#039; Hospital, London, and Belmont Hospital, Surrey, who was also involved in the Intelligence Services and who experimented extensively on his patients without their consent, causing similar long-term damage.<\/span>","time":1490675826,"resto":118604871,"id":"CQ5m5bDb","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118611502,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:39:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118611281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118611281<\/a><br>2 of 2<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Naomi Klein argues in her book The Shock Doctrine that Cameron&#039;s research and his contribution to the MKUltra project was actually not about mind control and brainwashing, but about designing &quot;a scientifically based system for extracting information from &#039;resistant sources.&#039; In other words, torture.&quot;[59] Alfred W.

On healthcare why doesn&#039;t trump alleviate issues by doing some tort reform? part of the reason the premiums are so high is because there is too many frivolous and fraudulent claims. legal fees mount up man.

The fact that they have to first buy liability insurance to work for free to treat the poor for free is rediculous.

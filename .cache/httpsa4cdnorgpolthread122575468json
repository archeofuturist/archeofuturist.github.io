I started with a 20 or 25$ deposit and turned it into quite a bit. <br><br>The downside is that although it&#039;s flexible hours, you&#039;re &#039;working&#039; all the time and I realized if I was going to work that hard I could be doing something better.

In 2006 it would often be 5 fish who had even less knowledge of the game, or maybe 1 &#039;shark&#039; who by today&#039;s standards would also be a fish.

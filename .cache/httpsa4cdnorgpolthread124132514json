Kind of interesting. Not sure if Jesus would approve. <br><br>Western Civ has evolved a kind of attitude towards war, that instead of total war (like the Romans or the Japanese Empire) we instead fight &quot;to end war&quot;, that is, we&#039;re fighting to end the enemy&#039;s ability to wage war, not to merely kill the enemy and take their territory. I like to think that history (and Jesus) will look favorably upon that particular institutional perspective. &quot;Play to end the game&quot; not &quot;play to eliminate the enemy&quot; kind of thing.","filename":"13214534_f496","ext":".jpg","w":496,"h":279,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493942467283,"time":1493942467,"md5":"MhzeQ0yevzyv6x1AAw6mFQ==","fsize":38718,"resto":124132514,"id":"zrE9NPXp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124134002,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)20:03:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124133737\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124133737<\/a><br>bantus very much did\/do kill each other","time":1493942606,"resto":124132514,"id":"aD3O+P29","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":124134081,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)20:04:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124132514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124132514<\/a><br>The Third Reich","time":1493942643,"resto":124132514,"id":"ye317zZG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124134467,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)20:06:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124134002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124134002<\/a><br>I was thinking of the pre-Zulu era.

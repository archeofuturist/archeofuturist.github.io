This discovery went public for one day on December 30, 1983 but Ronnie made sure the media could no longer discuss it for some reason. This is shameful beyond words as it is the true cause of Global Warming \/ Climate Change today. Not only on Earth but other planets in our solarsystem as well. 34 years later the media is still not allowed to discuss this matter. <br><br>In this youtube video below are three clips of Ronnie alluding to this discovery. When he mentions another species on another planet he&#039;s referring to the Annunaki, builders of the Pyramids, who reside on this traveling planet. However it&#039;s important to note the Annunaki has been banned from Earth and will not return to harass us at this time. However, as you can see, Ronnie is very concerned.<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/iQxzWpy7PKg","filename":"Planet_X","ext":".jpg","w":1010,"h":1291,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490558422945,"time":1490558422,"md5":"BK1nei40b9L\/Vpg3Vnw\/Sw==","fsize":435893,"resto":118400632,"id":"fXMTsiRp","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118407176,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)16:07:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118405403\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118405403<\/a><br>That picture triggers the fuck out of me.<br>I was born and raised in the city, young Hispanic. Hang out with blacks and ghetto Hispanics and became a gang member. Life was going to shit, then I turned 18 and enlisted in the Army. Got my associates degree while on Active Duty then went back to my old city. Shit was even worse, slowly start going back to the streets, get a girl pregnant, my tires slashed, windows broken and a lot of money want to kick my ass for various reasons. Start hanging out the homeboys again, because I needed them to back me up. Still, manage to finish my bachelors. (Just had a year left of school) Small rural town a few hours away needs police officers. Pay is actually pretty good, I was surprised that such a small town, payed their officers so good. I joined the force, and my life changed. Not because of the police, but because now I lived in some rural town in Eastern Texas. Life is quiet, nice. I can go out to jog without a car slowing down and staring me down because they recognized me, I can go to small neughborhood stores and not be afraid there will be a robbery and I will get shot in the process, and I dont have to worry about my kid ending up in a gang like everyone in my family seems to end up in. Just good old country living, fishing, shooting, hanging out with army veterans, listening to country and talking about deployments and time in the Army. Fuck the city life.","filename":"easttex","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":443,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1490558838105,"time":1490558838,"md5":"uCLswqUfcFtbCvqrdqVBXg==","fsize":411715,"resto":118400632,"id":"z2QZQoED","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118407242,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)16:07:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118406180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118406180<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;If by the whole country you mean DC then I agree<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No working people were actually happy about losing their jobs to China or being flooded with immigrants<\/span><br><br>No, but it&#039;s strange that they tolerated it for this long until anti-elitist sentiment developed, which was prompted by other things besides China and Mexicans.","time":1490558871,"resto":118400632,"id":"RWz\/k8qv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118407594,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)16:10:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118400784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118400784<\/a><br>This.

Nobody is on board with this. For the left, they&#039;d been sweeping this under the rug and not thinking too hard about it. Even if Cunton had gone into Syria they wouldn&#039;t have batted an eye. But it&#039;s different for the left if Trump does it. It helps that they received no warning or preperation beforehand, nobody expected Trump to actually do it (especially after his statements about leaving Assad alone), today he made the war and associated issues real in the minds of the general public. I don&#039;t think they&#039;d have done the hoax if they&#039;d known Trump would abruptly reverse direction like that. The left is now stuck in the position of carefully considering what it really means for them to be demanding action by Trump, since they&#039;ve just twigged that means giving him authorization to fire missiles wherever he feels like and their brainwashing is kicking in and telling them that&#039;s dangerous and to slam on the brakes. The left is scared, and their programming that tells them to oppose everything Trump does is going to bite the kikes in the ass.","time":1491564458,"resto":119929009,"id":"yeqzqpU9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119932081,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)07:27:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119931186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119931186<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;AmnestyDon<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;WarDon<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;NoWallDon<\/span><br>Only these 3 would make me not like Trump anymore.

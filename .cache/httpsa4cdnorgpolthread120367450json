Let&#039;s say clouds and wind are 100% manufactured. Artificial. Weather is 100% calculated. Let&#039;s say that&#039;s how deep this rabbit hole goes. And even deeper.<br><br>If that is true, if Jews really do control our lives that much, perhaps we should be thanking them instead of admonishing them. (You can fill in &quot;Jew&quot; with aliens, reptilians, Bogbros, etc.)<br><br>Well, admonishing them for being lying little cunts, but thanking them for the beauty of the world. <br><br>Think about it this way: Clouds are beautiful, right? They&#039;re nice and comforting to look at. They don&#039;t seem to harm us in any way, and if they do it&#039;s surely not noticeable. Now let&#039;s say clouds are produced from some factory in Antarctica run by the Jews. Kinda ruins some of the magic, sure, but are clouds suddenly scary? No. Manufactured or not, they&#039;re still beautiful. Nature is still beautiful regardless of Jew input.<br><br>That&#039;s really all I have to say. If we are being manipulated to this extent, don&#039;t let it scare you. Reach for the truth and for reality but think about how much more terrifying and hideous our overlords could have made our planet.","filename":"starsinthenightsky","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":798,"tn_w":169,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491786029157,"time":1491786029,"md5":"UQ0l5brV2RNnGqk6donyYg==","fsize":251743,"resto":0,"id":"gK\/YQmKa","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"not-a-shillslide-thread-some-comforting-words-for","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":120367964,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:04:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120367450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120367450<\/a><br>wrong.","time":1491786272,"resto":120367450,"id":"QZ1utmBZ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120368090,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:05:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120367450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120367450<\/a><br>you have stockholm syndrome OP, yes shits pretty but life isnt","time":1491786333,"resto":120367450,"id":"QZ1utmBZ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120368094,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:05:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Lay off the psychedelics, space cadet","time":1491786335,"resto":120367450,"id":"881jVmzj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120368096,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:05:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120367450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120367450<\/a><br>I wonder (((who))) could be behind this post","time":1491786335,"resto":120367450,"id":"ojIRoBxD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120368185,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:06:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"Like with my OP image, let&#039;s say they&#039;re a massive projection. I&#039;m sure if I try hard enough I could come up with all kinds of devious and horrible reasons for Jew overlords to project starry skies onto us every night, but let&#039;s be real here: That picture is gorgeous, is it not? If it is a projection, you can zoom in on every single one of those stars, even ones not visible, with a powerful telescope. That&#039;s a complicated fucking projection. Is it to serve as a distraction? Maybe. Or it&#039;s there because, well, they just think it looks neat. Maybe they even put it there to help us, to encourage us to explore and grow our brains. Maybe Earth is one giant social experiment\/eugenics simulator and our overlords have created every little thing they can to encourage natural intelligence and evolution.<br><br>That&#039;s not so scary if you think of it that way.<br><br>Of course, the lies and deceit are, I&#039;m not trying to cover that, but I know some people IRL who, ahem, literally shake from fear over the prospect of our world being completely and utterly fake.<br><br>If it is fake, it sure as fuck is pretty nice, all things considering. Yeah we fight and argue and the lower jews try to control the earth, but think of how fucking detailed everything is. Leaves have tiny little veins you can&#039;t see with the naked eye. We have itty bitty cells running through us, keeping us alive.<br><br>Isn&#039;t that kind of comforting, in a way? Our theoretical overlords care enough about us to provide our home with such beautiful things.<br><br>So breathe easy, terrified people.","time":1491786378,"resto":120367450,"id":"gK\/YQmKa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120368710,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:10:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120368090\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120368090<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stockholm syndrome<\/span><br>And you&#039;re depressed (so am I), which causes you to see things in a negative light.

Animals. Nature. They don&#039;t Jew you, kike you, screw you. Animals are predictable but not boring. Nature is unpredictable, sometimes scary, but also healing. (Depending on what kind of nature we&#039;re talking about. I&#039;m talking about a pretty sunset in early spring, not a fucking tornado.) Nature can be predictable to an extent as well, but is teeming with things that help us physically and mentally. Some of the &quot;help&quot; may be fake or even harmful, but most definitely a lot of it is real. <br><br><a href=\"#p120368094\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120368094<\/a><br>I&#039;ve never done drugs.

It&#039;s a private Christian school, so you&#039;d think it wouldn&#039;t be too bad, but since the nearby city is 43% black, we get force-fed BLM talking points all the time.<br><br>The black students cause the vast majority of the problems at school, but no one ever punishes them beyond a simple detention, because even that is evidence of racism, apparently. We often have &quot;class discussions&quot; about racism, which is really just the black kids and the white kids who pretend they&#039;re black complaining about everything while everyone else sits there and does homework while holding back our thoughts. If a white person ever suggests that perhaps racism is not as prevalent as one might think, they&#039;re of course racist or ignorant or dumb. (Never any arguments, just insults.) The icing on the cake, though, is when our black teachers &quot;reprimand&quot; the black students for going too far, yet say the same things the students do, just in politer terms.<br><br>Teachers also like to use non-black students as examples. One of my best friends moved here from the Philippines at age nine. She speaks perfect English, is ranked fourth in our class, and will become a citizen in a few months. Our English teacher chose to use her as an example of why even first-generation immigrants will be treated more favorably than blacks. I was used as another example; she said I could walk into a store and no one would treat me differently because of my skin color. A friend pointed out this would not be true if I was downtown and was immediately bombarded with accusations of racism.<br><br>Unless you live in an area where white people are the vast majority, you\u2019re going to face this stuff in school every day. It\u2019s just how it is, and it\u2019s a prison, because unless you want your academic career ruined, you can never, ever speak out about it.<br><br>Share your experiences with indoctrination at school.","filename":"IMG_1358","ext":".jpg","w":2592,"h":1936,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":186,"tim":1493250984849,"time":1493250984,"md5":"2YqNowJV3jdsCnT5sarCLw==","fsize":1847277,"resto":0,"id":"l8vLDvtL","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"indoctrination-at-school","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

They&#039;re generally intelligent people who study minute differences that qualify one animal as a different species with different behavior than another almost identical one, but they can&#039;t see the same thing in humans? It&#039;s not surprising that they&#039;d keep their mouths shut for fear of exile by other (((intellectuals))) just like Watson, the guy who fucking discovered DNA and then got shunned for making common-sense remarks about race.<br><br>I have an uncle who&#039;s a fairly prominent accomplished geneticist but I&#039;ve never really had the chance to talk to him since getting redpilled and he&#039;s always come off as kind of a beta cuck. But he has to at least suspect this shit, right?<br><br>I just don&#039;t see how they could they could be totally ignorant of what&#039;s right in front of their eyes every day.","filename":"Geneticists","ext":".png","w":889,"h":613,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":172,"tim":1492183354566,"time":1492183354,"md5":"8I3lg3vz2pMcIa0g9gXF+A==","fsize":599161,"resto":0,"id":"U6+qyVNw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-most-geneticists-secretly-redpilled","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121072206,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:24:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121072006\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121072006<\/a><br><br>some shit you don&#039;t say or you&#039;ll lose your funding","time":1492183458,"resto":121072006,"id":"A6AgGbeF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

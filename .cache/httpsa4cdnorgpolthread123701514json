Trump and the Congressional Republicans have once again cucked themselves and given away the game to the Democrats:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Democrats believe they have set the stage to block President Trump\u2019s legislative priorities for years to come by winning major concessions in a spending bill to keep the government open.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) secured nearly $5 billion in new domestic spending by exploiting disagreements between President Trump and GOP lawmakers over spending priorities.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Democrats\u2019 lopsided victory on the five-month deal, which is likely to be approved this week, means it will be very difficult \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 for the GOP to exert its will in future budget negotiations, including when it comes to Trump\u2019s 2018 budget blueprint.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That\u2019s because Republicans are hopelessly divided over how much to spend on government programs, with a small but vocal minority unwilling to support such measures at all. That has forced Republicans to work with Democrats to avoid politically damaging government shutdowns.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And that means Democrats are in the driver\u2019s seat when it comes to budget battles, even with Trump in the White House.<\/span><br><br>I&#039;m fucking pissed. What the fuck did we have an election for if our &quot;representatives&quot; are going to just emasculate themselves before Democrats when WE have all the branches of government under our control? I&#039;m done supporting this. These fucking turncoats deserve to be tarred and feathered, but I&#039;ll settle for voted out of office.<br><br>ITT: Discuss your thoughts on this, and post ways \/pol\/ can affect midterm elections to get actual Republicans\/Conservatives into the government, and get these fucking cowards the hell out.<br><br>https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/powe<wbr>rpost\/after-their-spending-bill-win<wbr>-democrats-confident-they-can-block<wbr>-trumps-agenda\/2017\/05\/01\/5be2915e-<wbr>2e97-11e7-9534-00e4656c22aa_story.h<wbr>tml?utm_term=.0c8d198ab850","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-05-01 at 7.52.29 PM","ext":".png","w":1950,"h":1084,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":138,"tim":1493686622650,"time":1493686622,"md5":"rmbk5Xwoxf\/bOEVIsZDYGQ==","fsize":1252306,"resto":0,"id":"EeWhHvnp","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"democrats-confident-they-can-block-trumps-agenda","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123701699,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:58:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123701514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123701514<\/a><br>Somehow I just know that this thread will get no replies, but every single BLACKED thread, vlogger worship thread, and &quot;what did kek mean by this&quot; thread will be 300+ replies and overflowing.

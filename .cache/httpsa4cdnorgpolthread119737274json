However Turkey pressured the Federal Republic to allow its citizens to become guest workers.[1] Theodor Blank, Secretary of State for Employment, was opposed to such agreements. He held the opinion that the cultural gap between Germany and Turkey would be too large and also held the opinion that Germany needed no more labourers because there were enough unemployed people living in the poorer regions of Germany who could fill these vacancies. The United States, however, put some political pressure on Germany, wanting to stabilize and create goodwill from a potential ally. The German Department of Foreign Affairs carried on the negotiations after this, and in 1961 an agreement was reached.[6][6]","filename":"1485857770721","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":890,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":115,"tim":1491486154732,"time":1491486154,"md5":"bYidwE65ct1kJg2kxgECWw==","fsize":156500,"resto":119737274,"id":"kGwHTLSA","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119743493,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)09:42:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119743382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119743382<\/a><br><br>Go be pathetic somewhere else","time":1491486162,"resto":119737274,"id":"INeR9xos","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":119743918,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)09:47:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119743493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119743493<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Go be a worthless parasite somewhere else.<\/span>","time":1491486467,"resto":119737274,"id":"wSDNPmOC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119744526,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)09:54:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119743478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119743478<\/a><br><br>https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tur<wbr>ks_in_Germany<br><br><br>Holy shit we go way back.","time":1491486868,"resto":119737274,"id":"INeR9xos","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":119744588,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)09:55:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119743918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119743918<\/a><br>Go be an annoying bitch somewhere else","time":1491486910,"resto":119737274,"id":"INeR9xos","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":119744765,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)09:57:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119737274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119737274<\/a><br>Good on the social\/economic side of Germany.<br><br>Bad on the military side.","time":1491487034,"resto":119737274,"id":"hlz3Ibtj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

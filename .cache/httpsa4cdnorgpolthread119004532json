Art today revels in either idolizing weakness and the obscene or it is so abstract that it does nothing but confuse and disorient people who look at it.<br><br>When the current paradigm of art is seemingly designed to appeal exclusively to either weak people who viscerally hate the idea of bettering themselves or to the mentally ill then it&#039;s no surprise that sane people aren&#039;t interested in it.<br><br>If you want to make art that&#039;s designed to inspire people to strive towards an ideal that&#039;s greater than themselves then you won&#039;t get any where in the art world. If you paint pictures of gluttonous obese women and make exhibits with rotting flesh and decapitated animal heads then you will be welcomed wholeheartedly into the art world.","filename":"AFP_Getty-142322210","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":801,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490929193819,"time":1490929193,"md5":"wFfF1+PZSC8fgC2JrummmA==","fsize":161354,"resto":119004532,"id":"yz4HvsdR","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119010501,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:00:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119009170\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119009170<\/a><br><br>Looks nice anon, keep it up.<br><br><a href=\"#p119008450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119008450<\/a><br><br>Fashwave is shit.

The concept art is always better than the actual game because the game takes the worlds that the artist has created in his mind and then it shrinks, deforms, and reshapes it so that it can both fit within the practical limitation of what can be included in a video game and also incorporate all of the gameplay elements that the customer expects. <br><br>Video games take worlds that exist inside the mind of the artist and they turn them into cheap, hollow amusement parks for customers.","time":1490930501,"resto":119004532,"id":"yz4HvsdR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119012869,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:23:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119004532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119004532<\/a><br>excuse me all of youtube are artist<br><br>we have pewdiepie markiplier jontron and more who are alt right artists","time":1490930586,"resto":119004532,"id":"UHtOz19b","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119012889,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:23:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119004532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119004532<\/a><br>My doodles get some good circulation","filename":"useful_idiots_doodle","ext":".jpg","w":1444,"h":1800,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490930593354,"time":1490930593,"md5":"cLL3E8Gjg+A\/2Ou7I8GmUg==","fsize":1056556,"resto":119004532,"id":"l9L9evQq","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119012986,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:24:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119008369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119008369<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;go stick your cock in a microwave you instant just add water piece<\/span><br>Who did this art performance?

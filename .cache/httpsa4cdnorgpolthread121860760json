Instead of using the rational of contemporary feminist anti-sex SJWism, they justified their change by appealing to traditional American conservatism as being in opposition to &quot;Extreeeem&quot; Millennial man-child marketing.<br><br>They&#039;re actually going to piss off SJWs even more, because they made it look like they made the switch on their own terms, and by referencing values that SJWs absolutely hate.

The picture shows the percentage reduction in the effective tax rate at each income level. The first thing you notice is that the percentage reduction is positive for everyone. You will notice at the tail end there is a small uptick (after a steep decrease from start of the x-axis). However, that tail end is an asymptote that never rises above the 36.88% level of the bottom 90% income earners. Nobody in the top 10% will have their taxes reduced by a greater percentage than anybody in the bottom 90%. And those in the bottom 90% will have their taxes reduced by a lot. So in sum, the middle class is not having their taxes increased by his proposed plan. In any case, this was not something that has been signed into law, let alone on the first day of his administration.","filename":"dfd233","ext":".png","w":676,"h":576,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":106,"tim":1491299201577,"time":1491299201,"md5":"h9+wudQKQDHc5Vpua9tYcA==","fsize":95042,"resto":119451406,"id":"ZkLwZvN0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119453247,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)05:47:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119453105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119453105<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;being in this much denial<\/span>","filename":"mfw","ext":".jpg","w":447,"h":444,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491299242610,"time":1491299242,"md5":"+6xtjxq43Bav0Qu7XqdC8g==","fsize":15308,"resto":119451406,"id":"d93VMv\/b","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119453283,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)05:47:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119453102\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119453102<\/a><br>Yeah I do, because that&#039;s how privacy works smartass.<br>That&#039;s also why Obongo requests for directly tapping in Trump&#039;s tower communication were denied and he had to do shit the stealthy way.<br>But if you want to ride that conspiracy dick all the way up to your bowels be my guest.","time":1491299279,"resto":119451406,"id":"yXuteqJL","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":119453342,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)05:48:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119453198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119453198<\/a><br>Nice fake graph<br><br><br>http:\/\/www.investopedia.com\/article<wbr>s\/taxes\/111716\/trumps-uppermiddlecl<wbr>ass-tax-increase.asp","time":1491299339,"resto":119451406,"id":"d93VMv\/b","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119453346,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)05:49:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119452893\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119452893<\/a><br>The key word in your post is &quot;scheduled&quot;.

My 8 year old son&#039;s only friend seems to be this asian kid at school, but I want him hanging around his own. He&#039;s a bit too young to understand why its important to stick with your folk, and my wife has gotten mad at me for trying to quash the friendship by keeping him at home after school. My job lets me work remote so I&#039;m considering moving us to a more rural area where my son is more likely to make ties with his own kind, but selling a house can take time. Any advice for the mean time?","filename":"234398653674","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":349,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493748537521,"time":1493748537,"md5":"SJb44l3yjHd7X7FllCPhIg==","fsize":69902,"resto":0,"id":"+mIS+23f","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"po-dad-advice-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":0,"unique_ips":9},{"no":123797176,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:12:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"East Asian or wears toilet paper as hat Asian?","time":1493748767,"resto":123796678,"id":"uPmwIh1\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123797513,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:15:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;son has only one friend<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;crush that friendship for autistic reasons<\/span><br>Your son is going to end up a friendless NEET who will probably shitpost here","time":1493748904,"resto":123796678,"id":"1X0\/XdoN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123797661,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)14:16:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123797176\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123797176<\/a><br>East, I think.

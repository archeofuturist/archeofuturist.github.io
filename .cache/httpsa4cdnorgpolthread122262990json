The numbers:<br><br>Le Pen - 25%<br>Melenchon - 21.7%<br>Macron - 21.0%<br>Fillon - 20.2%<br>Hamon - 5.2%<br><br>Shut up an trust me on that. I will be right. Le Pen historically always overperforms her polls unless there is another credible right wing candidate for her votes to go to. There isn&#039;t. I have used a variety of other methods to calculate the other numbers; to be very brief, always remember that Macron&#039;s base is FRAGILE (1\/3 of voters could change minds) and is attracted to Melenchon&#039;s base, where as Fillon has stalled because of Penelopegate, and there is no reason to vote for Hamon as Melenchon becomes the candidate for the Left. <br><br>2nd Round will be 51.43% for Le Pen and 48.51% for Melenchon. Polls after the first round will show roughly a 54\/46 race, favouring Melenchon. <br><br>The crucial moment will come when Fillon ENDORSES Le Pen (or several prominent members of his party). Why would he\/they do that, you ask? Because they support Le Pen AGAINST the commie Melenchon (he wants 100% tax on rich). ALSO, they will have a parliamentary majority, and want to get shit done. THEY CAN GET SHIT DONE WITH LE PEN, BUT NOT WITH MELENCHON. This is crucial to remember.<br><br>This will be the FINAL BLOW. Currently (((polls))) predict the abstention rates of Fillon supporters in a 2nd round Le Pen\/Melenchon to be approximately 50%. (i.e. 50% do not vote at all). Fillon\/his party&#039;s endorsement of Le Pen will reduce this rate to approximately 30%, which results in the 51.43% victory I described above. So, add all these factors in and Le Pen will Make France Great Again. I&#039;m waiting, \/pol\/. Shortly, you will see that I was right.","time":1492860530,"resto":122262990,"id":"jffcbJsw","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122267113,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:29:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Voting for Fillon here as well.<br>Sorry I don&#039;t want to be poor as fuck, Marine doesn&#039;t know shit about economy.","filename":"ff","ext":".jpg","w":940,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":53,"tim":1492860562942,"time":1492860562,"md5":"iwspNxz9S\/m46rEN6iPP2Q==","fsize":8318,"resto":122262990,"id":"bdupS3Fs","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122267126,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:29:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122266969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122266969<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh political philosophy<\/span><br>irrelevant","time":1492860571,"resto":122262990,"id":"6TxlAVI9","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122267173,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:29:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122262990\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122262990<\/a><br>In all seriousness we can&#039;t let her get the nuclear codes.","time":1492860595,"resto":122262990,"id":"+EVZeiky","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122267182,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:30:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122262990\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122262990<\/a><br>I would smash her","time":1492860601,"resto":122262990,"id":"JxSzVs14","country":"KR","country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":122267222,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:30:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122267173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122267173<\/a><br>only rural and suburban retards will vote for Marine","time":1492860636,"resto":122262990,"id":"edZ4zc8G","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122267228,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:30:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122267113\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122267113<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Marine doesn&#039;t know shit about economy.<\/span><br>didn&#039;t know she was running for the finance minister post<br><br>really makes you think, huh?","time":1492860642,"resto":122262990,"id":"6TxlAVI9","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122267240,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:30:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122267083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122267083<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s the retarded australian again<\/span>","time":1492860650,"resto":122262990,"id":"Xh2LD8OJ","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122267256,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:31:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122267083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122267083<\/a><br>Nice copypasta<br><br>With the terror incident last night I&#039;d bet my money on a Fillon vs. Le Pen instead of M\u00e9l or Mac.","time":1492860661,"resto":122262990,"id":"XOxB76xj","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122267286,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:31:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122267083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122267083<\/a><br>Those are very precise numbers you&#039;re mentioning there.

Forget about all the times I was asked for a selfie by strangers, secretly clicked on a beach in Goa, or the stares I invite when walking the streets (even in my worst outfits, greasy hair, no make-up and pimples all over my face). I have never got this close to feeling like a celebrity.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What really upsets me are incidents such as the one I recently experienced at Delhi\u2019s party neighbourhood, Hauz Khas village. My German friend, Petra, an Indian friend and I went out for dinner to a restaurant called Imperfecto. They had a nice rooftop, just what we were looking for. So the three of us entered and found the perfect table, waiting for another (Indian) friend of ours to arrive.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He was running late and then called to say that he got held up at the entrance by the staff who demanded that he pay Rs 1,000 as cover charge. I rushed downstairs to clarify that since the three of us - who had arrived only 10 minutes before him - hadn\u2019t been asked to pay the entrance fee, there must be a misunderstanding. I imagined a little persuasion would do the trick. Clearly, I was far-off.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The young girl at the entrance had an I-care-a-damn attitude about her when she strictly told my friend and I, \u201cHe has to pay now. It\u2019s already after 9.\u201d No argument would convince her that we didn\u2019t pay either, having arrived at 9:50 pm. After a while, she snapped: &quot;You were two American girls with one Indian guy, that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t have to pay. He is Indian, he has to pay!\u201d<\/span>","time":1490468343,"resto":118237804,"id":"3dNtJn8v","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118257629,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:59:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118257518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118257518<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There it was. She didn\u2019t have to say it. We understood: You are white, that\u2019s why you didn\u2019t have to pay. My friend, Biren, gasped for air, as I impulsively stated: \u201cBut we are from Germany, not from America.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In hindsight, it must have been my brain, now overloaded with the sudden experience of racism, which had made me fight for the correctness of my origin. It took some time to sink in, but then we exploded. Biren was furious and heartbroken; I was shocked. The four of us left the premises devastated and in disbelief, struck by what had just happened.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Like I said before, from my first encounter with the fairness cream at a supermarket to this day, I have had several confrontations with India\u2019s love for fair-looking skin. But that night it dawned on me that India has turned my concept of racism upside down. Normally, racism works this way: You think your own race is superior to another. In India, however, when it comes to skin colour, it\u2019s the other way around.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;White: good, dark: bad.

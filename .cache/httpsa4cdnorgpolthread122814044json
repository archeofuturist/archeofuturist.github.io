The goal isn&#039;t to kill a whole bunch of people, it&#039;s to scare the shit out of them to the point that they no longer use reason or logic and therefore become desperate to get themselves and their families out of the zone of contamination. The authorities then loose control as the masses begin to panic and a state of anarchy is born. Now, under the guise of panic and chaos, you can rob banks, armored cars, ATMs, and apartments\/houses. arm yourself with whatever is left in armories, police stations, gun shops, private gun collections, etc. Over run a federal building and take hostages, demanding money from authorities who are already stressed and spread thin. over run a manor outside the city and take hostages, and then make them and their friends give u their money. kill people who, before this incident, were much harder to get to.<br>Or pull a Soros and find some way to make money off all the chaos.

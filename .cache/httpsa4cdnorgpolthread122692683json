In the decades that followed, the use of the term neoliberal tended to refer to theories at variance with the more laissez-faire doctrine of classical liberalism, and promoted instead a market economy under the guidance and rules of a strong state, a model which came to be known as the social market economy.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the 1960s, usage of the term &quot;neoliberal&quot; heavily declined. When the term was reintroduced in the 1980s in connection with Augusto Pinochet&#039;s economic reforms in Chile, the usage of the term had shifted. It had not only become a term with negative connotations employed principally by critics of market reform, but it also had shifted in meaning from a moderate form of liberalism to a more radical and laissez-faire capitalist set of ideas. Scholars now tended to associate it with the theories of economists Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman and James M. Buchanan, along with politicians and policy-makers such as Margaret Thatcher, Ronald Reagan and Alan Greenspan.[4][21] Once the new meaning of neoliberalism was established as a common usage among Spanish-speaking scholars, it diffused into the English-language study of political economy.[4] By 1994, with the passage of NAFTA and the Zapatistas&#039; reaction to this development in Chiapas, the term entered global circulation.[3] Scholarship on the phenomenon of neoliberalism has been growing.<\/span><br><br>So I still have no idea what it means when it calls me a neolib :(","time":1493100725,"resto":122692683,"id":"lSgfa0Fs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122701973,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)02:12:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"capitalism is by far the greatest engine of prosperity humanity has been able to come up with so far.<br><br>I sincerely think only very young people or academics can be against it.","time":1493100751,"resto":122692683,"id":"ATuB4w7u","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":122701982,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)02:12:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"come at me","filename":"index","ext":".png","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493100758784,"time":1493100758,"md5":"9iCj43+d7YJAwPSbrS9YUg==","fsize":59248,"resto":122692683,"id":"YC4zJezp","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":122702126,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)02:14:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122698097\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122698097<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122700693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122700693<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122699898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122699898<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122699222\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122699222<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122700359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122700359<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122699598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122699598<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122699406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122699406<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122700536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122700536<\/a><br>You&#039;re retards.

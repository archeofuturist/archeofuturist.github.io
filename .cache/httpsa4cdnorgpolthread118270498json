She had copious amounts of debt and now her debtors are demanding it to be paid. There are about 20 debtors demanding money to be paid. She was an Indonesian citizen, my in-laws tell me that their ustad says debt transfer after death is supported in Islam. I&#039;m a convert and have no education on this matter, will someone please help me and provide some evidence one way or the other?<br>The ustad says that it is the responsibility of the sons and daughters to pay the debt. My wife is telling me they can choose to either pay or not to pay, if they don&#039;t pay then it will decrease\/lose all their rewards for their good deeds in life. But they have the option to not pay.. I&#039;m just looking for solid answers.<br>I am still in mourning and just distraught about the whole situation.<br>Also, hypothetically, if she received loans from loan sharks\/loaners who are affilliated with gang like intimidation to family to receive their payment, would that alter any kind of ruling?

But when they finally brought us to a Mosque in social studies, I got to see REAL devotion. The people there were so humble and soft-spoken; the Imam was so articulate, kind and wise. I know that most of you still believe the lies spread by the (((jewish))) media, but I&#039;m not angry; you&#039;ll understand when your worldly governments sell your futures for profit.

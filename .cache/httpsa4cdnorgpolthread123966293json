They started WW1, killing millions of whites, just because they were jealous of the British Empire. Rather comically, they lost the war and lost territory to the British Empire as a result of their ineptitude. Also, unbeknownst to many, the G*rman invented communism and spread it to Russia during the war to weaken them. Eventually, this would kill millions of whites. The G*rman, deeply consumed by shame and anger, sought to re-establish himself as a somewhat relevant regional power. To try and achieve this, they elected a socialist, who fought in the aforementioned war and held a great grudge against the Anglo. In his bitterness, the G*rman created lies about G*rman superiority, to try and justify his lust for power and his neighbours\u2019 lands. Thus war was declared, and with all too much predictability, the G*rman lost another war, with many millions of whites being killed. Again, comically, the G*rman had his own lands taken over by Anglos. The G*rman was defeated. For now. Many years passed, and under the divine mercy of the Anglo, the G*rman was allowed to rebuild, and even to thrive. But the seed of guilt had been implanted in the minds of G*rmans, so as to keep them weak. The G*rman, utterly humiliated, now put his hope in the EU instead of his conquered homeland, and in his autism invited the Middle East to Europe. This was done so that G*rmans could finally live beside a people lower than them. And so it was the G*rman&#039;s blood lust continued, as these new guests killed many whites. But alas, just as the G*rman began to feel a fell hope, the Anglos had defeated them again with Brexit. Who knows what the future holds, but there is one thing certain - the Anglo will always be here to thwart the G*rman devil.","time":1493846542,"resto":123966293,"id":"n7T+rFel","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123966450,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:22:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Marine pr\u00e9sidente!","time":1493846567,"resto":123966293,"id":"HIZAeRH8","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123966493,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:23:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"CAN&#039;T BEGONE THE MACRON<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CAN&#039;T BEGONE THE MACRON<\/span><br><br>CAN&#039;T BEGONE THE MACRON<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CAN&#039;T BEGONE THE MACRON<\/span><br><br>CAN&#039;T BEGONE THE MACRON<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CAN&#039;T BEGONE THE MACRON<\/span>","time":1493846587,"resto":123966293,"id":"PgZOXsS9","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":123966500,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:23:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"She&#039;s wasting her entire finale monologue on autism","time":1493846590,"resto":123966293,"id":"4EZXdH\/5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123966517,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:23:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"wanting to leave EU = yuro version of<br><br>WE","time":1493846596,"resto":123966293,"id":"+YzXGPRB","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123966554,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:23:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"wtf I love Macron now","time":1493846610,"resto":123966293,"id":"c58vxBFV","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":123966566,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:23:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why does Le Pen get the shitty translator?

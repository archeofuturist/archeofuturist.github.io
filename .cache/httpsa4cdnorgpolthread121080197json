This is a time of rampant kikery and cultural rot. Always question what the speaker has to gain by saying what they&#039;re saying and having you believe it. Logic is the best tool to separate the wheat from the chaff, along with a well developed bullshit meter (you have to build that intuition over time). Use reason to build a coherent idea of how the world works and what&#039;s going on, but don&#039;t assume others are guided by it. Dilbertman is on to something when he says people are 80-90% irrational.","time":1492188094,"resto":121080197,"id":"Ps6oLvEH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121081396,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:42:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Just tune out and focus on your life.

The video, which also includes images of North Korea\u2019s military and is narrated by a woman, was released by Uriminzokkiri, a state-run media outlet, and posted to YouTube.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This isn\u2019t the first time North Korea has released a propaganda video aimed at the USA.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Back in March 21st 2013, North Korea\u2019s military threatened to attack American naval bases in Japan and an air base in Guam, where nuclear B-52 bombers took off earlier that week to join the drills that were happening in South Korea at the time.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;North Korea said on Thursday that week, the U.S. will meet catastrophic end by the strong military counteraction of the DPRK, if the bombers are flown again over the peninsula and saying on Thursday that American bases in Guam and Japan are within striking range.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We can\u2019t sit idly by and allow North Korea to threaten other countries, whether they\u2019re bluffing or not.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The government should make North Korea more punishable for their actions by imposing even bigger sanctions. Although this is already happening on a certain level, More could be done about this issue.

We once had healthcare without major government involvement. Then came along Obamacare which seized control of the health industry by instituting its mandates. The government has proven that they cannot even maintain the VA, but still put us under their thumb and destroyed private healthcare. Now the same bureaucrats, they are all the same, are pushing out this new plan under Trump which still keeps healthcare under the control of the government. None of this is designed to help us, but only give an appearance of it. I guarantee that whenever the next administration comes into office that this new healthplan will be scrapped like Obamacare. The bureaucrats are just moving us inch-by-inch into a single-payer government control system.","filename":"image","ext":".png","w":680,"h":680,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493937198851,"time":1493937198,"md5":"R0gCvMT28y7VX64O6u3B8Q==","fsize":109707,"resto":0,"id":"rgwdP5N8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"it-is-all-a-setup","country_name":"United States","replies":15,"images":1,"unique_ips":9},{"no":124122444,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)18:35:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124122090\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124122090<\/a><br>The government is going to seize healthcare whether you like it or not because it&#039;s a vector for gun grabs and the &#039;justifiable&#039; trampling of basic rights.<br><br>You&#039;re not allowed to protest sir, you&#039;re not well.","time":1493937344,"resto":124122090,"id":"48F2sk3d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124122580,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)18:36:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"your finally beginning to see the problem.

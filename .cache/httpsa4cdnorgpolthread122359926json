The Green Card is slang for Permanent Resident Card and has a 10-year span before it has to be renewed. The card is issued by the Citizenship and Immigration Services of the Department of Homeland Security and contains a photo and fingerprint. Years ago the Green Card was green, but today it looks something like a driver&#039;s license.<\/span>","filename":"1492676436180","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1129,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1492911719235,"time":1492911719,"md5":"LhQdvrj7oZwF9RtcYbEoAA==","fsize":312431,"resto":122359926,"id":"mT3b0PC8","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122360358,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)21:42:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122360124\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122360124<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122360132\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122360132<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122360229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122360229<\/a><br>Shame, the best you can do here is join the retarded blue helmets and give candybars to niglets in some african shithole.","time":1492911726,"resto":122359926,"id":"NBq1MYJE","country":"UY","country_name":"Uruguay"},{"no":122360548,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)21:43:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122360358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122360358<\/a><br>Russian Army allows foreigners to join their army, even those without residency.

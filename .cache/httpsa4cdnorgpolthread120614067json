I think rather like Hobbes the great English theorist 400 odd years ago against whom British cultural theory reacted. Hobbes was an authoritarian, an absolutist, a semi-elitist, a non-democrat, and even an atheist in a deeply religious age. So, he was quite a shocking combination. He appalled both the Royalists and the Cromwellians. I\u2019m quite enamored of Hobbes, in a way, who of course is close to the English version of Machiavelli in his doctrine of statecraft.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hobbes\u2019 idea of the society that is organic and where the mind and the body are integrated influenced me a great deal. I think the contemporary West suffers from an extraordinary mind-body split. And the intelligentsia has gone off and talks to themselves and doesn\u2019t connect to the bulk of people in Western societies at all. There is a degree to which I personally think that if you put into currency ideas and cultural forms which have a primal element, have a primordial element, have in some respect a pagan dimension, I think you can knit the mind and the body back together again.<\/span>","filename":"bowden7","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":282,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491927795930,"time":1491927795,"md5":"Yef6ooJZzfdMQvapEx2B3w==","fsize":18455,"resto":120614067,"id":"vWhcDk1f","country":"GB","trip":"!!nIHFObhTBdm","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120616807,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:23:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120616685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120616685<\/a><br>sorry ladd","filename":"Darjeeling Eu Victory#","ext":".jpg","w":2300,"h":1725,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491927816604,"time":1491927816,"md5":"n9wpQoUhuv5v3UvmS1wHVA==","fsize":1590137,"resto":120614067,"id":"w13kxb0y","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120616883,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:24:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120614258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120614258<\/a><br>Look forward to it.","filename":"295502_675250575824889_1031242942_n","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491927859910,"time":1491927859,"md5":"tJfTxr09BIq0DewlwuoEnQ==","fsize":33567,"resto":120614067,"id":"VS7jn9O5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120616917,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:24:41","name":"Anonymous","filename":"4euiorghuioghavnaobaeygbyriobfiv","ext":".jpg","w":1023,"h":682,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491927881413,"time":1491927881,"md5":"NS1n8\/Jyl1djN8t5O7E3Dw==","fsize":361780,"resto":120614067,"id":"VS7jn9O5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120616939,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:24:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120616352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120616352<\/a><br>kek be ex terrorists getting payed for a job dont even turn up westminister being this cucked","filename":"eire pepe","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491927892740,"time":1491927892,"md5":"YmKGIuLrTz2TJPnimZwnJQ==","fsize":321926,"resto":120614067,"id":"\/8n3b0t\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120616964,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:25:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120616883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120616883<\/a><br>There&#039;s nowt appealing about that thing, lad","time":1491927901,"resto":120614067,"id":"7hfCymFT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120616965,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:25:03","name":"Based Bowden","com":"<a href=\"#p120616761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120616761<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I also think it\u2019s very important, and something that political people nearly always miss, that rationalism is not enough. I think you move people at a level beneath the mind, psychologically and in terms of the emotions. In fact, the Right is more powerful when it appeals as much to the subconscious as much as the conscious mind. I think an enormous number of people, including the Right\u2019s bitterest and harshest opponents, are slightly subconsciously attracted to it in spite of themselves. That\u2019s why they can never stop talking about it, even from an oppositional perspective.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I do believe in cultural inversion, that you can get into sub-consciousness of the era that you\u2019re in and begin to turn it around. I\u2019m also very aware that movements of the \u201920s and \u201930s were based upon, in part, a Romantic counter-culture that stretches back to the 1870s if not before. The counter-culture as we perceive it is purely Leftist and comes from the 1960s. I agree with Ezra Pound that the artistic community is like the antennae of the civilization that they\u2019re a part of and that they feel the tremors in the web or in the ether before anyone else. That\u2019s why a lot of twentieth century art is about trauma and alienation and ugliness and neurosis, because that\u2019s what the intelligentsia feel, and that\u2019s what the artistic part of the intelligentsia feel. I see Right-wing cultural formations everywhere, even though they wear other hats, even though they seem to be denouncing the Right. But you have to view these areas artistically and not completely in a linear or rational way.<\/span>","time":1491927903,"resto":120614067,"id":"vWhcDk1f","country":"GB","trip":"!!nIHFObhTBdm","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120617026,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:25:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120616964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120616964<\/a><br>Chemisty.

The West, in my view, is an anti-theocratic and open-minded civilization, but the idea that because of that we don\u2019t believe in anything is utter nonsense. We have a fundamentalism of our own, and I think it\u2019s the guilty conscience of most Western intellectuals, particularly liberal-minded people in the arts. An enormous number of Western artists and writers and intellectuals, even through reversal and antagonism, were attracted to fascism in the first 30 to 40 years of the twentieth century, and they were often attracted in an emotional way at a level deeper than reason, because they were attracted to the ur-discourses, the foundational and fundamentalist beliefs, classical and yet Romantic combined, of our own civilization.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It\u2019s interesting to note, in relation to modernism for example, many of the early modernists\u2014Eliot, Wyndham Lewis, Marinetti, C\u00e9line, Ezra Pound, and so on\u2014were deeply attracted to the extreme Right. They were attracted because they saw in it fundamentalist cultural energies. It\u2019s very interesting that late modernism has been taken up as the pet of the liberal establishment and completely denuded of nearly all of those energies, and it\u2019s ended up in often decadent and squalid vistas that deconstruct almost everything the West is about and laughs whilst the process is going on.<\/span>","filename":"1490457759255","ext":".jpg","w":669,"h":540,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1491928920867,"time":1491928920,"md5":"sMS5ampxj3NZRsCtqEMS0A==","fsize":67000,"resto":120614067,"id":"vWhcDk1f","country":"GB","trip":"!!nIHFObhTBdm","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120619030,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:42:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120618882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120618882<\/a><br>How dare you not like what I like","filename":"IMG_1711","ext":".png","w":597,"h":116,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":24,"tim":1491928936665,"time":1491928936,"md5":"BpYYNcECzc7tNVTZQRl2BA==","fsize":16630,"resto":120614067,"id":"mm+B3ouQ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120619064,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:42:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120618939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120618939<\/a><br>I&#039;m a 30 year old man.","time":1491928952,"resto":120614067,"id":"jXUT1aWm","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":120619095,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:42:43","name":"Nigel Fucktrumpet","com":"Because most adult children work full time, and if someone needs care enough they have to move in with them, being able to care for them from 7-8 in the morning and 6 till 10 at night just isn&#039;t long enough<br><br>Unless you mean one could take full time off and get some sort of government care allowance","time":1491928963,"resto":120614067,"id":"mIb1mQM3","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120619146,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:43:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120618882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120618882<\/a><br>pic related<br><a href=\"#p120618953\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120618953<\/a><br>don&#039;t be stupid","filename":"ABD95C46-212D-40A3-B815-DD1ACE086892-1696-000000E9A3860B95","ext":".png","w":500,"h":668,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491928990380,"time":1491928990,"md5":"5vOGZsSEgrHGa6tkeX0ABA==","fsize":189146,"resto":120614067,"id":"45zKbuwG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120619245,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:43:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120619064\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120619064<\/a><br>So?<br><br>Get yourself a nice 22 year old you fucking idiot","filename":"inspquot2","ext":".jpg","w":712,"h":750,"tn_w":118,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491929034913,"time":1491929034,"md5":"Oz4iKDQELOchvkfxt4sUsA==","fsize":70248,"resto":120614067,"id":"7hfCymFT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120619285,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:44:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120618715\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120618715<\/a><br>*exhale* Andrewwwwwww","time":1491929054,"resto":120614067,"id":"A4oPMHmx","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120619297,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:44:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120619064\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120619064<\/a><br>asian women are extra vapid when they hit a certain aged<br>you also sound like a poorfag","time":1491929058,"resto":120614067,"id":"5Q2d1N7c","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120619326,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:44:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120615929\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120615929<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;british isles<\/span><br>Lol, that desperation to cling onto last fleeting notions of imperial grandeur 72 years after a Pyrrhic victory that made the UK largely irrelevant.","time":1491929072,"resto":120614067,"id":"1+EiqeUp","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120619340,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:44:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120619146\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120619146<\/a><br>You don&#039;t have a gf, yellow-fever anon?

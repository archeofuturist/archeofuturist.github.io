I believe that everything comes down from above, and I believe that the spirit is the brain of the mind and the mind dominates the body. But the mind, of course, is only a part of the body. I think rather like Hobbes the great English theorist 400 odd years ago against whom British cultural theory reacted. Hobbes was an authoritarian, an absolutist, a semi-elitist, a non-democrat, and even an atheist in a deeply religious age. So, he was quite a shocking combination. He appalled both the Royalists and the Cromwellians. I\u2019m quite enamored of Hobbes, in a way, who of course is close to the English version of Machiavelli in his doctrine of statecraft.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hobbes\u2019 idea of the society that is organic and where the mind and the body are integrated influenced me a great deal. I think the contemporary West suffers from an extraordinary mind-body split. And the intelligentsia has gone off and talks to themselves and doesn\u2019t connect to the bulk of people in Western societies at all. There is a degree to which I personally think that if you put into currency ideas and cultural forms which have a primal element, have a primordial element, have in some respect a pagan dimension, I think you can knit the mind and the body back together again.<\/span>","filename":"bowden7","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":282,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491927795930,"time":1491927795,"md5":"Yef6ooJZzfdMQvapEx2B3w==","fsize":18455,"resto":120614067,"id":"vWhcDk1f","country":"GB","trip":"!!nIHFObhTBdm","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120616807,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:23:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120616685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120616685<\/a><br>sorry ladd","filename":"Darjeeling Eu Victory#","ext":".jpg","w":2300,"h":1725,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491927816604,"time":1491927816,"md5":"n9wpQoUhuv5v3UvmS1wHVA==","fsize":1590137,"resto":120614067,"id":"w13kxb0y","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120616883,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:24:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120614258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120614258<\/a><br>Look forward to it.","filename":"295502_675250575824889_1031242942_n","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491927859910,"time":1491927859,"md5":"tJfTxr09BIq0DewlwuoEnQ==","fsize":33567,"resto":120614067,"id":"VS7jn9O5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120616917,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:24:41","name":"Anonymous","filename":"4euiorghuioghavnaobaeygbyriobfiv","ext":".jpg","w":1023,"h":682,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491927881413,"time":1491927881,"md5":"NS1n8\/Jyl1djN8t5O7E3Dw==","fsize":361780,"resto":120614067,"id":"VS7jn9O5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120616939,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:24:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120616352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120616352<\/a><br>kek be ex terrorists getting payed for a job dont even turn up westminister being this cucked","filename":"eire pepe","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491927892740,"time":1491927892,"md5":"YmKGIuLrTz2TJPnimZwnJQ==","fsize":321926,"resto":120614067,"id":"\/8n3b0t\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120616964,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:25:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120616883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120616883<\/a><br>There&#039;s nowt appealing about that thing, lad","time":1491927901,"resto":120614067,"id":"7hfCymFT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120616965,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:25:03","name":"Based Bowden","com":"<a href=\"#p120616761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120616761<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I also think it\u2019s very important, and something that political people nearly always miss, that rationalism is not enough. I think you move people at a level beneath the mind, psychologically and in terms of the emotions. In fact, the Right is more powerful when it appeals as much to the subconscious as much as the conscious mind. I think an enormous number of people, including the Right\u2019s bitterest and harshest opponents, are slightly subconsciously attracted to it in spite of themselves. That\u2019s why they can never stop talking about it, even from an oppositional perspective.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I do believe in cultural inversion, that you can get into sub-consciousness of the era that you\u2019re in and begin to turn it around. I\u2019m also very aware that movements of the \u201920s and \u201930s were based upon, in part, a Romantic counter-culture that stretches back to the 1870s if not before. The counter-culture as we perceive it is purely Leftist and comes from the 1960s. I agree with Ezra Pound that the artistic community is like the antennae of the civilization that they\u2019re a part of and that they feel the tremors in the web or in the ether before anyone else. That\u2019s why a lot of twentieth century art is about trauma and alienation and ugliness and neurosis, because that\u2019s what the intelligentsia feel, and that\u2019s what the artistic part of the intelligentsia feel. I see Right-wing cultural formations everywhere, even though they wear other hats, even though they seem to be denouncing the Right. But you have to view these areas artistically and not completely in a linear or rational way.<\/span>","time":1491927903,"resto":120614067,"id":"vWhcDk1f","country":"GB","trip":"!!nIHFObhTBdm","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120617026,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)12:25:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120616964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120616964<\/a><br>Chemisty.

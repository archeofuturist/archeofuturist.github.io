My favorite ever, along with the Prisoner, X-Files, Northern Exposure and The Twilight Zone.<br><br>The Twilight Zone. Original one with Rod Serling only. The Outer Limits is amazing too. The two best science fiction\/horror shows of all time imho, though Serling&#039;s Night Gallery had some good shit too. VERY creepy title sequence too. A more comic cult classic in the horror category is The Night Stalker with Darren McGavin, VERY recommended.<br><br>The original Star Trek. I hate all the sequels and variants, though Data is a character worthy of the original show. If you like sci-fi the older Doctor Who episodes are fun. Jon Pertwee especially. This show was so much better without politics.<br><br>The Prisoner: Very \/pol\/ and \/x\/ combined. Groundbreaking, truly original, magnificently paranoid and brilliant. Must see. It will change the way you look at everything.<br><br>Kung Fu with David Carradine--I think you guys would love this. It&#039;s unique. Kind of forgotten since he died, but a really great show.<br><br>Secret Agent (older Patrick McGoohan spy show, a genre classic and veddy British.)<br><br>Hogan&#039;s Heroes is hysterical and twisted. Bob Crane was a sick motherfucker and it shines through.<br><br>Bewitched is so weird and very funny. Agnes Moorehead steals the whole fucking thing every time.<br><br>Northern Exposure--whimsical, semi-\/x\/, character driven show put together by the man who later did the Sopranos. Slightly David Lynch-ish, in a much less nightmarish way. It&#039;s unique. There&#039;s nothing else like NE.<br><br>The X-Files: you must see this show<br><br>I Love Lucy: probably the funniest show ever made. Cheers me up every time. I love William Frawley, he was such a funny old asshole.<br><br>The Honeymooners is, with All In The Family, the most un-PC, utterly blue collar, utterly American show ever.

Bob&#039;s lovable qualities make it much more comfy watching though. It totally has that early 1970s vibe.<br><br>More: <br><br>A little known 1960s gem is Johnny Staccato, a very dark and stylish detective show with John Cassavetes, incredibly charismatic in the lead. I REALLY recommend this.<br><br>Fawlty Towers is, with Lucy, the funniest show ever. Like wear Depends because you will piss yourself laughing. Monty Python&#039;s Flying Circus is very good as well. Another must-see.<br><br>The Carol Burnett Show and Laugh-In are underrated\/underappreciated nowadays but they are also incredibly fucking funny.<br><br>The Rockford Files, recommended, along with Murder She Wrote.<br><br>A few more worth the hunt include 77 Sunset Strip (pure kitsch), Route 66, Alice (everyone forgets this waitress sitcom but it&#039;s very funny), I Dream of Jeannie (because Barbara Eden), the original Batman, the Jack Benny Show, The Courtship of Eddie&#039;s Father, Peter Gunn, The Fugitive, and The Wild Wild West.<br><br>I generally hate Western and medical shows, but Gunsmoke was excellent.<br><br>Sweet old shows for the sentimentally inclined include Father Knows Best, Andy Griffith, Leave It To Beaver, I Remember Mama, and the Ghost and Mrs. Muir.<br><br>The Mary Tyler Moore show is a wistful look at first wave feminism, anchored by the beautiful Mary Tyler Moore. If only women had stopped there. Great supporting cast. <br><br>That Girl w\/Marlo Thomas is similar but not as good. The Dick Van Dyke show is another funny old sitcom with MTM as Dick&#039;s wife.

Maybe it&#039;s a bigger deal in California for some reason but near D.C. there are tons of them and I&#039;ve never had any kind of bad experience with any of them. We get a lot of El Salvadoreans here in particular. Entire restaurants are staffed with them and the cleaning maids are mostly them. No problems.

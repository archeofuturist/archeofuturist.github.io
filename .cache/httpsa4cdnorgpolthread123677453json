Nowdays everything is totally corrupt and fucked up. You can&#039;t get a decent job with decent money and without working like a slave all day. You are considered lucky if you score even an underpaid shitty job while you have to work like a dog. Ofcourse don&#039;t even think of getting rich or making your dreams come true or something. Seems like we are put on this earth just to work shitty dead end jobs. <br><br>Morals are destroyed, the idea of family is destroyed. You can&#039;t find a decent girl because we all know how femminism and social media made them sluts and made them believe they are special snowflakes. Oh and speaking of social media, those shitty sites like facebook or instagram tottally ruined human contact. Whenever I go into a bar people instead of talking with each other, they are stack on their fucking smarthphones browsing facebook. Most people go into bars nowdays just to do a &quot;check in&quot; on normiebook.<br><br>Human relationships seem so vain and fake today, that you can&#039;t really trust nobody, and you are on your own. Forever. That seems so lonely. Everyone uses you for their personal gain. I believe friendship and true love don&#039;t exist anymore. The only person who might love you is your mother (and since you are on 4chan, she probably dosen&#039;t, like mine)<br><br>You can&#039;t even visit any country in Europe without seeing shitskins and hijabs everywhere, and without being in fear of a truck running over you or something. Thats real progress!<br><br>Every time I see a 60s, 70s or 80s movie, life seemed much more simple and more honest back then.

The baby boomers held power and sway (culturally or politically) since the 1960s at least. The 20th century way of life worked from 1950-1990 but collapsed in the 2000s, yet the baby boomers still hold power and still cling to the methods of the past but they&#039;re clearly not working for the modern world. We need new blood for the new era. Boomers still hold many jobs, wealth, cultural (the marxist\/hippie left wing mainly) and political power. Their time is up, but they&#039;re not ready to relinquish their stranglehold on power. Things might just change for the better once they die off.","time":1493676508,"resto":123677453,"id":"TNmc3k+u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123681028,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:09:56","name":"Texasfag","com":"<a href=\"#p123679880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123679880<\/a><br>Like what?

Even if both the ruling class and the normal citizens of a country choose to do their best to make a worki g communist government where dissenters were not immediately sent to gulag, communism works under the assumption that the average human is generally capable of being content, that they should be happy to live their modest life because it is just as good as anyone else&#039;s and certainly better than poverty in some third world shithole somewhere else. the problem with that is that humanity is generally ambitious and selfish to some extent, and for someone to succeed, someone has to fail, and to take means for someone else to no longer have. Basically communism is an idealism at best and a tool to control the masses at worst, although it certainly has its appeal on paper.","time":1490431285,"resto":118203709,"id":"zCrZ2Zwo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118204866,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:42:13","name":"Uno Sekoj","com":"<a href=\"#p118203709\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118203709<\/a><br>Communism- where each individual is assigned the labour that best suits their abilities so that the society as a whole can maximize productivity.

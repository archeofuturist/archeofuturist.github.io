They sell oil for dollars and then transmit the money back, literally giving resources for free. <br> Putin&#039;s daughters live in Western World, as well as Lavrov&#039;s (Minister of international affiars) son is a permanent resident of US, as well as Peskov&#039;s (Putin&#039;s Press secretary) daughter live in Paris. The majority of their relatives are on the West. Russia never will attack US or UN, because that means they attack their own family and money. <br> Russia is just a colony of Western World. <br> The West can destroy Putin&#039;s regime in ONE day through blocking US and UN bank accounts of oligarchs and top state officails, through blocking SWIFT and so on. But nobody do that, because current state of Russia is what the West wants. <br> That&#039;s all what I want to say. All of you are a hypocritical bastards, who don&#039;t have anything good. <br> I wish there could be nuclear war. But it never will.","filename":"c8toolnuaaettwd","ext":".jpg","w":571,"h":572,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491731135194,"time":1491731135,"md5":"PcPMp7ELaDPbcwMKpoJBHA==","fsize":39236,"resto":0,"id":"KuTGQ74Q","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"truth-about-relationship-between-russia-and-us","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":10,"images":2,"unique_ips":8},{"no":120265434,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:52:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1491731533,"resto":120264949,"id":"JtfmsYp1","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120265592,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:54:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120264949\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120264949<\/a><br>Wow what&#039;s a Leaf doing with a russian flag","time":1491731651,"resto":120264949,"id":"vvdrtHa2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120265747,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:56:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"This.

Hopefully this doesn&#039;t become too long:<br><br>During the 60s and 70s the church was more or less infiltrated by total liberals. The church being a gerontocracy it took until now for them to get into the highest ranks of power (though there were obviously a lot in power in the 70s too). BUT: because theyve been teaching this watered down shit for three generations, the liberal catholics rarely raised their children to really be catholic and so they never stayed a part of the church.<br><br>This is kind of a positive feedback loop and the number of nonbased catholics has declined every generation to the point where it is now the minority in the younger generations of catholics even in White countries. Only the devout stuck around through the hard times and really taught their kids to stay with the faith. It also helps that really trad catholics have a lot of kids.<br><br>So the movement toward traditionalism is becoming pretty overwhelming in the yougner generations of N and S american CAtholics as well as Euros and Flips. <br><br>I only really care about europeans, but if you look in France and Switzerland for example, the church is shockingly quickly being taken over by traditionalists. Like really hardcore traditionalist organizations like the SSPX and their slightly less hardcore brothers in the FSSP. <br><br>Even the modernist (in a catholic sense, not a in social sense) opus Dei is beginning to make up a huge portion of the more liberal crowd.<br><br>Outside of the vatican the church is on a VERY good track. The only real shitshow is in africa where the africans are really taking to the novus ordo mass and dumb shit like liturgical dace. The upswing is they are very socially conservative and they will be a good voice in the church in that regard.

Whenever you tried to attack one of these apostles, your hand closed on a jelly-like slime which divided up and poured through your fingers, but in the next moment collected again. But if you really struck one of these fellows so telling a blow that, observed by the audience, he couldn&#039;t help but agree, and if you believed that this had taken you at least one step forward, your amazement was great the next day. The Catholic had not the slightest recollection of the day before, he rattled off his same old nonsense as though nothing at all had happened, and, if indignantly challenged, affected amazement; he couldn&#039;t remember a thing, except that he had proved the correctness of his assertions the previous day.<br>Sometimes I stood there thunderstruck. I didn&#039;t know what to be more amazed at: the agility of their tongues or their virtuosity at lying. Gradually I began to hate them.","time":1490655315,"resto":118557532,"id":"9IPPQOMj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118574996,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:55:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118574686\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118574686<\/a><br>Eh, race doesn&#039;t matter to me.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;back when I was a filthy degenerate I used to bang a muslim chick.

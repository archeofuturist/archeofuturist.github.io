Flynn Jr is directing BTFO tweets at Schumer, Schiff etc on almost daily basis on Twitter, while backing Trump to the hilt.<br><br>There is a lot of opinion now that Flynn fucked up the Turkey disclosure on his forms, and they can get him on that (that&#039;s why he wants immunity). There&#039;s also talk on social media that he&#039;s gonna take the stand to get even with Obama\/Clinton (over why they hounded him out a few years back).<br><br>I get a very strong feeling that Trump would try and pardon him if he gets done, but what kind of shitstorm coud that potentially create?<br><br>Would conservatives care? Or would they still back Flynn because of his service etc??","filename":"Tweet_1","ext":".jpg","w":892,"h":651,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":182,"tim":1491156441349,"time":1491156441,"md5":"VkOhTaRgdYxXmZLgKU5pMQ==","fsize":117886,"resto":0,"id":"Z6P4oqgI","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"very-real-possibility-trump-would-pardon-flynn","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

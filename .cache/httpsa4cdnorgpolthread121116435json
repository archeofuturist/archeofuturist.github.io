Sure we can all sit around and fantasize what some sort of ideal world might look like. But thats not the real world. The only reason we even have the cabaility of exploring space is because our ancestors toiled through centuries of blood, sweat and tears. Civilization has to be built from scratch then continuously refreshed and maintained. And as soon as you have built something, youre going to have to be willing to put your life on the line to defend it or you will lose it to someone stronger. Humanity is still tethered to the brutality of the natural world. When society fails to maintain civilization, we revert to our ape-like state. Scaled up to a global scale, this means that diplomacy can only go so far. We can create complex systems if trade and treaties and such, but at the end of the day humanitys inherant imperfection means we can only create inherantly imperfect peace. Something must give eventually. Sometimes we can narrowly dodge a catastrophe, sometimes we can&#039;t. History rolls on either way.<br><br>Point being, war is as natural to civilization as killing an antelope is natural to a lion. Sometimes certain factions become so entrenched and fundementally opposed to eachother that only bloodshed can refresh the wheels of time. This current Korea crisis isn&#039;t just a mere dick measuring contest. Its a geopolitical showdown thats been brewing for decades.

Common sense is king, and even that is frequently challenged by politicking by senior NCOs and officers. If anything being smart will only create frustration, as you will witness retardation on levels you wouldn&#039;t have thought possible. Unless you go intel or something along those lines, being a HWINDU triangulation tier autist is going to only fuck you over in most enlisted career fields. Back when I went through basic those types were some of the dumbest motherfuckers in our flight, as they overthought simple tasks and had terrible social skills, and BMT at it&#039;s core is just a teambuilding\/janitorial training exercise that involves running, sleep deprivation, and getting tear gassed. Once you get through that, keep your \/pol\/ock opinions to yourself, as the air force has become a PC social experiment gone wrong.

Also most jobs are cake, with normal business hours and weekends off. If you like it rough get a flightline job, or be a cop if you truly enjoy a painful existence.

Just never get into trouble for drinking, don&#039;t get married while you are in, don&#039;t use drugs. Try to find an apartment with a few of your buddies to split rent with, don&#039;t fuck with any of the females in the Navy because you&#039;ll get jammed up for something. If you get any tattoos after bootcamp make sure they don&#039;t see them. Try to cover your chief&#039;s ass and make him look good whenever possible, because one day he&#039;ll cover your ass. That&#039;s about it really.","time":1492255633,"resto":121168707,"id":"6LYS\/3Ri","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121201507,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:37:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121193825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121193825<\/a><br>Sorry to tell ya, Lawton sucks..Hanging out at the refuge and hiking is pretty cool.","time":1492256261,"resto":121168707,"id":"\/5YEQxkh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121203676,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:07:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is anyone in the army?<br>I always wanted to enlist but I&#039;m afraid of the difference between lifestyles and the PT since I&#039;m a hungry skeleton manlet.<br>Is it worth doing?","time":1492258058,"resto":121168707,"id":"DA4qUxpM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121203837,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:09:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121171114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121171114<\/a><br>Philipino mafia?","time":1492258182,"resto":121168707,"id":"q+2mp5ZO","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":121204498,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:18:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121181942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121181942<\/a><br>I&#039;ve seen SSBN people post on 4chan many times before lmao.

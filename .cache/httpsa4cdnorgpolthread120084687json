Assad, with Russia&#039;s blessing, essentially said let&#039;s see how the new guy (Trump) responds to this (we know the old guy blew a lot of smoke). This new guy has been talking a lot like the old guy with words flying in every direction (to NK, to China, to us, etc.). I&#039;ll test him to see if he&#039;s got the cajones to step up and if he just sits on his hands like all the other guys (previous President and other world leaders), maybe we can just fast track an end to this uprising. BTW, NK and China...watch this.<br><br>Well, they got their answer. The new guy is not the old guy.<br><br>As for \/pol\/.. everyone overacted and thought he was declaring war or something and got real butthurt.

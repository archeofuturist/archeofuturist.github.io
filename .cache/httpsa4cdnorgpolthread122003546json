Now that we&#039;re here , I just wanted to ask you this: What is your opinion on Rpmanian politics and Romanians themselves? This question stuck with me since I was to a friend of mine to Germany where he introduced me to the &quot;stereotypical Romanian&quot;. I was quite amused of the stereotype , seeing as it was as generic as an 80&#039;s Saturday morning cartoon. This being said , I don&#039;t mind if you call me anything really , I&#039;ve heard so many slurs whilst visiting Central and Western Europe , that I&#039;ve grown somewhat of an indifference.

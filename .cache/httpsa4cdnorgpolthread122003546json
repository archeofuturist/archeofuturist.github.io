Now that we&#039;re here , I just wanted to ask you this: What is your opinion on Rpmanian politics and Romanians themselves? This question stuck with me since I was to a friend of mine to Germany where he introduced me to the &quot;stereotypical Romanian&quot;. I was quite amused of the stereotype , seeing as it was as generic as an 80&#039;s Saturday morning cartoon. This being said , I don&#039;t mind if you call me anything really , I&#039;ve heard so many slurs whilst visiting Central and Western Europe , that I&#039;ve grown somewhat of an indifference. Cheers.","filename":"Flag_of_Romania","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":853,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492701110639,"time":1492701110,"md5":"fnPWhHo7icng2SJdHdXKsQ==","fsize":5149,"resto":0,"id":"7EYcapol","country":"RO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"probably-a-bad-idea","country_name":"Romania","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":122004293,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)11:20:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"de cacat!","time":1492701627,"resto":122003546,"id":"caRwTLZB","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":122004401,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)11:21:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122003546\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122003546<\/a><br>I don&#039;t know if people on this board grew tired of calling Romanians gypsies or if there are less Romanians that there used to be but I haven&#039;t heard this in a while.<br><br>People in France may call you gypsy because that&#039;s the only thing you&#039;re exporting to our country but I think that most normies don&#039;t even care\/know about your existence (or eastern Europe in general), let alone your politics.<br><br>Which is sad, I guess, since from what I understood you guys used to be francophile 2 or 3 generations ago, and some Romanians were immigrating to our country to flee Ceausescu. <br><br>I had a biology teacher, a music teacher, a vet and a student friend that were Romanians.

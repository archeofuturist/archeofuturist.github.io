Why would they? The first time I ever heard of the idea was when Iran&#039;s Ahmadinejad said it years ago and it sounded like the craziest thing in the world. I&#039;ve heard this term so often on tv lately though... Sean Spicer&#039;s oy vey moment, Trump&#039;s speech today, and dozens of times on the news in the last couple months.

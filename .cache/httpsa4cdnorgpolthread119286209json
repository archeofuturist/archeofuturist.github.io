They&#039;re an incredibly small group that uses political influence and high positions in academics\/media to make you think otherwise. That&#039;s exactly how marxism operates. Top-down gradual subversion. That aside, the fact that SJW shit fails to make money is a symptom that the demographic itself is small, and not necessarily that they don&#039;t buy shit. Why do I know this? Because women respond much more strongly to marketing than men do (just look at any women&#039;s product ever vs men&#039;s versions). Fake nerds are a thing, and they validate themselves by spending money on merch and shit (semi-related, but look at fujos in Japan, they are a HUGE market now in anime because of their buying habits) I believe SJW posers actually do buy these things.<br><br>This is how small the SJW crowd actually is despite all that. They are pathetically small, and just have a fuckhuge megaphone.","filename":"1331519237383","ext":".jpg","w":442,"h":720,"tn_w":76,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491201701302,"time":1491201701,"md5":"sHJuuNXFUEETtJ5U1k5mRw==","fsize":31422,"resto":119286209,"id":"uKvZ9wiv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119300820,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)02:42:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119300350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119300350<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;b-buh muh china market<\/span><br>WHY THE FUCK WOULD PRINCESS AND THE FROG BE POPULAR IN CHINA?<br><br>THE IS NOT A LARGE AMOUNT OF NIGGERS IN THE U.S., EUROPE, CHINA, OR JAPAN FULLSTOP<br><br>Again, stop being a dumb fuckcunt.<br><br>Princess and the Frog did fine.<br>So did Moana.<br><br>Now, try to put up the same asinine argument that those markets are full of blacks but they didn&#039;t go see it because they hate themselves, you one-trick cuck.<br><br>And in case you forgot the original shitty argument you decided to defend:<br><a href=\"#p119295531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119295531<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Even niglets want to be the White princess.<\/span><br><br>There is a reminder, twat.","time":1491201771,"resto":119286209,"id":"DPS1j+KI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119300837,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)02:43:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s the suit or mask that makes the hero\/villian.

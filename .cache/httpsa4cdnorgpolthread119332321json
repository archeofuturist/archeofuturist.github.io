to. What, people asked me, has happened to the native English? Once they conquered the world with discipline and courage; now they are sunk in drunkenness, hooliganism, and welfare dependency. Why?<br><br>As always with matters of national character, the answers are long and complex, too much so for a diary entry. A key point to grasp, though, is that English national character, like so much else in the universe, is binary.<br><br>Yes: The impeccably correct English gent and his female counterpart, with their stiff upper lips, good tailoring, and the Three Indifferences (to food, sex, and the weather) are still a feature of the Island Race, as they have been for centuries. So, however, are the drunken louts and their drunken slut consorts. That\u2019s been the case for centuries, too. There\u2019s a good historical survey of that latter element in Jeremy Paxman\u2019s 1998 study of the English national character, Chapter 11.<br><br>Perhaps it was exactly this combination of dutiful rigor and feral coarseness that, by some kind of chemistry, made for historical success. The Duke of Wellington famously described his troops as \u201cthe scum of the earth \u2026 enlisted for drink.\u201d I bet he was right; but they won his battles for him.","filename":"4euiorghuioghavnaobaeygbyriobfiv","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491229406995,"time":1491229406,"md5":"Zs\/Ye1digyFwXE4BDhJ1EQ==","fsize":130473,"resto":119332321,"id":"7wykxkH\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119333242,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)10:24:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119332898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119332898<\/a><br>If you have sex with people below the age of consent in the country you&#039;re in, you&#039;re breaking the law and will be considered a paedophile, regardless of whether you personally agree with it or not.","time":1491229453,"resto":119332321,"id":"uE1wD6SS","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119333383,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)10:25:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"There is a case to be made that English soccer hooligans represent the true soul of our people \u2014 that, in fact, England is a nation of hooligans.

The 16th-century adventurer Sir Francis Drake is regarded as a great patriot and exemplar by all red-blooded Englishmen.

These communities flourished in port cities strongly involved in the slave trade, such as Liverpool [40] and Bristol. By 1795, Liverpool had 62.5 per cent of the European Slave Trade.[40] As a result, Liverpool is home to Britain&#039;s oldest black community, dating at least to the 1730s. Some Black Liverpudlians are able to trace their ancestors in the city back ten generations.[40] Early black settlers in the city included seamen, the mixed-race children of traders sent to be educated in England, servants, and freed slaves. Mistaken references to slaves entering the country after 1722 being deemed to be free men are derived from a source in which 1722 is a misprint for 1772, in turn based on a misunderstanding of the results of the Somerset case referred to below.","time":1491244211,"resto":119332321,"id":"NM4ycX\/j","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119361009,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:31:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119360691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119360691<\/a><br>we all have to get married and breed like rabbits<br><br>with white women only","time":1491244260,"resto":119332321,"id":"4FQmPsL3","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119361044,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:31:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119360849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119360849<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1\/4 of Israel economy is run by Europeans of Germanic and Celtic descent<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;superior <\/span><br>Slav bydlo please","time":1491244276,"resto":119332321,"id":"NM4ycX\/j","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119361093,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:31:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119361009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119361009<\/a><br>But how the hell am I supposed to do that?","time":1491244298,"resto":119332321,"id":"yAwY3NEp","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119361334,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:33:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119361093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119361093<\/a><br>you&#039;ll meet a woman in everyday life unintentionally, she will then want to marry you and have children with you<br><br>it&#039;s just how it works<br><br>trust me, i&#039;m a 24 year old virgin","time":1491244409,"resto":119332321,"id":"4FQmPsL3","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119361410,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:34:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119360050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119360050<\/a><br>A fu(a)nny thing, I&#039;m more than welcome here, because I&#039;m the best goy ever.","time":1491244441,"resto":119332321,"id":"lvKBa1lQ","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119361415,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:34:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119360691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119360691<\/a><br>If you think Englans is bad have a look at the statistics for the rest of Europe.<br><br>Germany: 8% Muslim, 20% Muslim under 5&#039;s.<br><br>France: 12% Muslim, 25% Muslim under 5&#039;s.<br><br>Bulgaria: 12% Muslim, 15% Muslim under 5&#039;s.<br><br>Russia: 20% Muslim, 35% Muslim under 5&#039;s, Muslims are a majority of the Russian Army as well.<br><br>Macedonia: 46% Muslim, 54% Muslim under 5&#039;s.<br><br>Italy: 6% Muslim, 14% Muslim under 5&#039;s.<br><br>Switzerland: 6% Muslim: 16% Muslim under 5.<br><br>Belgium: 12% Muslim, 34% Muslim under the age of 5.<br><br>The Netherlands: 9% Muslim, 14% Muslim under 5.<br><br>In comparison: The UK: 4.9% Muslim, 8% Muslim under the age of 5.","time":1491244445,"resto":119332321,"id":"cQfakm0+","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119361458,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:34:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fresh OC, lads.","filename":"Falk &#039;n&#039; Gib","ext":".png","w":3555,"h":2198,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":77,"tim":1491244460378,"time":1491244460,"md5":"ZJOmv+YVQMaUJw4NzKbPGw==","fsize":494107,"resto":119332321,"id":"wGKMghPW","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119361483,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:34:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Gibraltar&#039;s chief minister called Donald tusk a cuck<br><br>What did we do to deserve this timeline","filename":"Screenshot_20170403-192302","ext":".jpg","w":1021,"h":939,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1491244466892,"time":1491244466,"md5":"0gbPsxP+1wDVnI1RIMQRhQ==","fsize":269646,"resto":119332321,"id":"HfGVLpLn","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119361607,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:35:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119361334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119361334<\/a><br>There&#039;s someone out there for everyone, anon.","time":1491244523,"resto":119332321,"id":"gPjCheX\/","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":119361610,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:35:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119361415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119361415<\/a><br>thank god for the channel, it&#039;s a blessing","time":1491244524,"resto":119332321,"id":"4FQmPsL3","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119361633,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:35:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"What exactly goes on in the Spanish parliament over Gibraltar?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;We should have Gibraltar!&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Yes!&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;g-give it Britain&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;g-give it...&quot;<\/span><br><br>It must be a fucking embarrassing discussion.

to. What, people asked me, has happened to the native English? Once they conquered the world with discipline and courage; now they are sunk in drunkenness, hooliganism, and welfare dependency. Why?<br><br>As always with matters of national character, the answers are long and complex, too much so for a diary entry. A key point to grasp, though, is that English national character, like so much else in the universe, is binary.<br><br>Yes: The impeccably correct English gent and his female counterpart, with their stiff upper lips, good tailoring, and the Three Indifferences (to food, sex, and the weather) are still a feature of the Island Race, as they have been for centuries. So, however, are the drunken louts and their drunken slut consorts. That\u2019s been the case for centuries, too. There\u2019s a good historical survey of that latter element in Jeremy Paxman\u2019s 1998 study of the English national character, Chapter 11.<br><br>Perhaps it was exactly this combination of dutiful rigor and feral coarseness that, by some kind of chemistry, made for historical success. The Duke of Wellington famously described his troops as \u201cthe scum of the earth \u2026 enlisted for drink.\u201d I bet he was right; but they won his battles for him.","filename":"4euiorghuioghavnaobaeygbyriobfiv","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491229406995,"time":1491229406,"md5":"Zs\/Ye1digyFwXE4BDhJ1EQ==","fsize":130473,"resto":119332321,"id":"7wykxkH\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119333242,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)10:24:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119332898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119332898<\/a><br>If you have sex with people below the age of consent in the country you&#039;re in, you&#039;re breaking the law and will be considered a paedophile, regardless of whether you personally agree with it or not.","time":1491229453,"resto":119332321,"id":"uE1wD6SS","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119333383,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)10:25:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"There is a case to be made that English soccer hooligans represent the true soul of our people \u2014 that, in fact, England is a nation of hooligans.

The 16th-century adventurer Sir Francis Drake is regarded as a great patriot and exemplar by all red-blooded Englishmen.

If you&#039;ve read Art of the Deal, or even if you haven&#039;t and are just following what he does, you&#039;ll know that this is some 37d backgammon. The Democrats are excited right now, they&#039;ve won a battle in Healthcare. However, they are distracted by this, and it will keep them from doing anything about it for at least a year assuming Trump keeps the pressure on Congress to like he did with this vote. <br><br>In case you haven&#039;t noticed, the ACA is going to start costing far too much in the coming months, the end of 2016 saw some of the largest insurance premium and deductible increases of all time, and many providers are leaving the market place. This time next year the ACA will be a huge issue, which is unfortunate for the Democrats because this will also be primary season. Because the ACA passed with 0 Republican votes, the Democrats own the ACA, and all the glory and grief that goes along with it. Once the voters notice that they will no longer be able to afford the insurance the Democrats promised them, they will turn on them for not doing their jobs. Only the hardest hardliners will try to rationalize it, while the Republicans and Trump will be tut-tutting the Democrats, saying &quot;you could have worked with us last year, but you refused to even listen!&quot; This play could result in the largest majority of a single party of all time, giving the Republicans the ability to pass amendments. This is the end goal, and the Democrats are walking right into it.","time":1490410347,"resto":118171002,"id":"wi7SnqI2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118175693,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:53:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;wrote the shittiest bill possible<\/span><br>that&#039;s where i stopped reading","time":1490410411,"resto":118171002,"id":"eFIy1Izi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118175861,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:54:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118174019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118174019<\/a><br>So you want the guy who puts his religion above his nation?

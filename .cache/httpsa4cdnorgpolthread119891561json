THE KEKING OF LEFTISTS<br><br>Leftists worldwide have been pushing for some kind of intervention against Syria for years. Obama was a weak faggot as Trump has pointed out repeatedly, with his &quot;red line&quot;. <br><br>Now suddenly the hooker arrives and their dicks are limp. It was all a bit too much. They start backing away from their former stance. Trump and America confirmed for having mastodontic penis.<br><br>2. THE SUPPORT FOR TRUMP<br><br>Trump&#039;s been praised by McCain, Netanyahu, Schumer, Pelosi, various media cucks, even some faggot from New York Times. Even if they don&#039;t want to, they have to if they have backed action on Syria previously.<br><br>3. THE CONTINUED GOOD RELATIONS WITH RUSSIA<br><br>Trump warned Russia of this using the red de-escalation phone, no Russians killed<br><br>4. THE LACK OF AN IMPACT ON SYRIA<br><br>This was a barebones airfield in the middle of nowhere, most likely few if any casualties. It was a symbolic act.<br><br>5. SYRIA IS NOT TOO PISSED OFF<br><br>Syria said it&#039;s &quot;an act of aggression&quot;, notably not &quot;an act of war&quot;. <br><br>6. NO REGIME CHANGE YET<br><br>If there is regime change, it will be after ISIS is defeated and the country stable. That gives leftists &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;MUH REGIME CHANGE&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; but Assad is replaced by a secular Alawite just like himself with a less bloody past, probably his cousin or something, leftists and muslims get cucked because they got the regime change they wanted but it&#039;s business as usual<br><br>In summary: Trump played 20-D chess to commit a symbolic attack against Syria killing pretty much nobody, not triggering WW3, cucking leftists by showing his initiative, destroying the Russian narrative, leftist cucks worldwide have to praise him for &quot;&quot;&quot;action on Syria&quot;&quot;&quot;. End result: Huge gains for Trump, a paved tarmac in the middle of nowhere blown up, few\/no casualties, gas attack issue handled.","filename":"2d6ec6d130a6c0f58bbbd6e2fe29399ad5bda3cad469941adef73402004d65ae_0","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491549648710,"time":1491549648,"md5":"4glnMIdnjoSvj8Ina0seEw==","fsize":83915,"resto":119891561,"id":"T7FpQ3\/k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119906282,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)03:21:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119905699\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119905699<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119904560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119904560<\/a><br>Atleast there is still some of us left, but yeah things were a lot better before reddit arrived and the whole god emperor kek bullshit started getting taken seriously","filename":"IMG_2374","ext":".jpg","w":222,"h":346,"tn_w":80,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491549679364,"time":1491549679,"md5":"VQ3SNELKOBWWQHK2QYethg==","fsize":52009,"resto":119891561,"id":"D00cXU4J","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119906389,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)03:22:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119906282\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119906282<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Atleast there is still some of us left, but yeah things were a lot better before reddit arrived and the whole god emperor kek bullshit started getting taken seriously<\/span><br> I think people underestimate how influential the_donald really is.

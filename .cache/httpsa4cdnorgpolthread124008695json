Trump&#039;s personality disorder (which includes hypomania) is also displayed through a lack of impulse control and empathy, and &quot;a feeling that people ... don&#039;t recognize their greatness.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;We&#039;ve seen enough public behavior by Donald Trump now that we can make this diagnosis indisputably,&quot; says Gartner. His comments run afoul of the so-called Goldwater Rule, the informal term for part of the ethics code of the American Psychiatric Association saying it is wrong to provide a professional opinion of a public figure without examining that person and gaining consent to discuss the evaluation. But Gartner says the Trump case warrants breaking that ethical code.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.usnews.com\/news\/the-rep<wbr>ort\/articles\/2017-01-27\/does-donald<wbr>-trumps-personality-make-him-danger<wbr>ous<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 psychology is a jewish plot<\/span><br><br>Not only can you not read, but looks like you did too.

I noticed this while a was walking pass police controls and shocked swedes. Whole way up through Odenplan towards Valhallav\u00e4gen (where many muslims don&#039;t go), it was the same story, those people in muslim clothing smiled happily and enjoyed their day while shocked swedes passed by. Saw 3 somali women in niqab and running shoes that laughed loudly while you saw how troubled a swedish man behind them was.<\/span>","filename":"1491598543981","ext":".jpg","w":595,"h":396,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491645757431,"time":1491645757,"md5":"27kYguojpXcx7b+mw3wx6g==","fsize":60584,"resto":0,"id":"\/VftUxGQ","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"muslim-reactions-to-terror-attack-in-stockholm","country_name":"Sweden","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120114352,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:03:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120114256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120114256<\/a>","filename":"SwedenTranslationAccurate","ext":".png","w":488,"h":389,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":99,"tim":1491645828009,"time":1491645828,"md5":"YRzLYMR\/yeUA+UB+TkylHA==","fsize":241282,"resto":120114256,"id":"xOtj\/ees","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120114911,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:11:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sweden earned it.

These are: (1) libertarian-<br>ism\u2019s analysis of the concept of freedom and the<br>supposition that any sort of property right can be<br>grounded in it; (2) the notion of \u2018self-ownership\u2019<br>(supposedly parallel to Locke\u2019s claim that we each<br>have a property in our own \u2018persons\u2019); (3) the idea<br>that an individual can acquire a property right in<br>a natural resource by removing it from the<br>common stock, or from an unowned state, in<br>certain specific ways (Locke\u2019s claim that such a<br>right can be acquired by \u2018mixing one\u2019s labour<br>with nature\u2019 being an example); (4) the claim that<br>one necessarily acquires a property right in that<br>which one produces. Attas deploys an array of<br>arguments in order to demonstrate that none of<br>the foregoing can withstand close analysis. He is<br>particularly \u2013 and persuasively \u2013 dismissive of the<br>last, insisting that \u2018the modern developed market<br>economy is a mechanism of joint production\u2019<br>(p. 165). From this it follows that the libertarian<br>representation of such an economy as a set of<br>ongoing bilateral exchanges \u2013 individual entitle-<br>ments being transferred from one person to<br>another at each stage \u2013 is fundamentally<br>unrealistic.<br>The great virtue of this book lies in its detailed<br>approach, something to which it is impossible to<br>do justice in a short review. Contrasting interpre-<br>tations of libertarian claims are outlined, tested<br>and found wanting. The cumulative effect is a<br>devastating critique from which libertarianism<br>will not easily recover.

The crisis of the welfare state requires new blood so as to feed the panoply of government programs politicians put in place so as to buy themselves new constituencies. Since the white population of the west, perhaps in part because of the tax burden imposed on it due to this very welfare state, has elected not to replace itself naturally, government have little choice but to place their natural heir into a state of complete marginalization at the benefit of of minorities so as to insure that the state will have some taxable base in the future to insure the sustainability of its redistribution programs.","time":1492694158,"resto":121978617,"id":"\/fvO+mob","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121994618,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)09:31:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121993434\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121993434<\/a><br>From Raico, historian of the libertarians:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That states lends itself legitimacy through the welfare state by buying off more and more constituencies. [...] But now every group in America that&#039;s worth pandering to gets benefits and feels that it has a stake in the modern welfare-warfare state. What could possibly represent an end to this? How could this end? I don&#039;t see that the welfare state is gonna come to an end by itself. What I see is that as it becomes more and more intractable as we approach the crisis of the welfare state there will -- the politicians and the people in control of the system -- will bring in what has already been suggested by politicians in Europe, including in Germany for instance, and that is &quot;What we need are &#039;young&#039; taxpayers to support the pension and the medical care and so on for the retired older non taxpayers now, retired people. Where are these young taxpayer to come from since the Europeans don&#039;t seem to be very interested in having kids? And in America the white population does not replace itself. So where are these new taxpayers to come from? And that is then from the third world. [...]<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But what will have happened in the meantime is that they will have destroyed the identity, first of all, of the European nations -- there is no such thing, at least as far as I can see, of a France that&#039;s one third muslim or an Italy that&#039;s one third muslim. I mean there&#039;s an Italian STATE, but there&#039;s no such thing as an Italian identity that is one third muslim or moore for that matter. So they&#039;ll destroy the identity of the European peoples and eventually the American people [...] and I don&#039;t think anybody could have predicted that [...] that in order to salvage this never ending system of welfare [...] they would have to simply destroy the historical identity of the countries.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/mises.org\/library\/10-classi<wbr>cal-liberalism-and-welfare-warfare-<wbr>state","filename":"Ralph Raico 2005","ext":".jpg","w":240,"h":299,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492695062538,"time":1492695062,"md5":"0RLqG1mObGyzQkQQBJAUlg==","fsize":9952,"resto":121978617,"id":"\/fvO+mob","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121995100,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)09:36:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121993330\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121993330<\/a><br>I can give you another philosopher&#039;s trick:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no one would WILLINGLY be in error if they could avoid it<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;some people chose on the basis of error<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(they are in error has to what is good for them)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but I, superior philosopher, have pierced the true secret of knowledge and-or life<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thus my pronouncements on what&#039;s good should trump the will of those lower people who were not blessed with a superior intellect and-or a philosophical education<\/span>","time":1492695411,"resto":121978617,"id":"\/fvO+mob","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

These are: (1) libertarian-<br>ism\u2019s analysis of the concept of freedom and the<br>supposition that any sort of property right can be<br>grounded in it; (2) the notion of \u2018self-ownership\u2019<br>(supposedly parallel to Locke\u2019s claim that we each<br>have a property in our own \u2018persons\u2019); (3) the idea<br>that an individual can acquire a property right in<br>a natural resource by removing it from the<br>common stock, or from an unowned state, in<br>certain specific ways (Locke\u2019s claim that such a<br>right can be acquired by \u2018mixing one\u2019s labour<br>with nature\u2019 being an example); (4) the claim that<br>one necessarily acquires a property right in that<br>which one produces. Attas deploys an array of<br>arguments in order to demonstrate that none of<br>the foregoing can withstand close analysis. He is<br>particularly \u2013 and persuasively \u2013 dismissive of the<br>last, insisting that \u2018the modern developed market<br>economy is a mechanism of joint production\u2019<br>(p. 165). From this it follows that the libertarian<br>representation of such an economy as a set of<br>ongoing bilateral exchanges \u2013 individual entitle-<br>ments being transferred from one person to<br>another at each stage \u2013 is fundamentally<br>unrealistic.<br>The great virtue of this book lies in its detailed<br>approach, something to which it is impossible to<br>do justice in a short review. Contrasting interpre-<br>tations of libertarian claims are outlined, tested<br>and found wanting. The cumulative effect is a<br>devastating critique from which libertarianism<br>will not easily recover.

These are: (1) libertarian-<br>ism\u2019s analysis of the concept of freedom and the<br>supposition that any sort of property right can be<br>grounded in it; (2) the notion of \u2018self-ownership\u2019<br>(supposedly parallel to Locke\u2019s claim that we each<br>have a property in our own \u2018persons\u2019); (3) the idea<br>that an individual can acquire a property right in<br>a natural resource by removing it from the<br>common stock, or from an unowned state, in<br>certain specific ways (Locke\u2019s claim that such a<br>right can be acquired by \u2018mixing one\u2019s labour<br>with nature\u2019 being an example); (4) the claim that<br>one necessarily acquires a property right in that<br>which one produces. Attas deploys an array of<br>arguments in order to demonstrate that none of<br>the foregoing can withstand close analysis. He is<br>particularly \u2013 and persuasively \u2013 dismissive of the<br>last, insisting that \u2018the modern developed market<br>economy is a mechanism of joint production\u2019<br>(p. 165). From this it follows that the libertarian<br>representation of such an economy as a set of<br>ongoing bilateral exchanges \u2013 individual entitle-<br>ments being transferred from one person to<br>another at each stage \u2013 is fundamentally<br>unrealistic.<br>The great virtue of this book lies in its detailed<br>approach, something to which it is impossible to<br>do justice in a short review. Contrasting interpre-<br>tations of libertarian claims are outlined, tested<br>and found wanting. The cumulative effect is a<br>devastating critique from which libertarianism<br>will not easily recover.

The crisis of the welfare state requires new blood so as to feed the panoply of government programs politicians put in place so as to buy themselves new constituencies. Since the white population of the west, perhaps in part because of the tax burden imposed on it due to this very welfare state, has elected not to replace itself naturally, government have little choice but to place their natural heir into a state of complete marginalization at the benefit of of minorities so as to insure that the state will have some taxable base in the future to insure the sustainability of its redistribution programs.","time":1492694158,"resto":121978617,"id":"\/fvO+mob","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121994618,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)09:31:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121993434\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121993434<\/a><br>From Raico, historian of the libertarians:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That states lends itself legitimacy through the welfare state by buying off more and more constituencies.

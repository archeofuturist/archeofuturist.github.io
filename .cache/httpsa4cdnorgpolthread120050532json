As soon as I try to people either blatantly agrees while thinking about all of the &quot;idiots&quot; that they&#039;ve met (while they themselves are exactly the same more or less) OR they draw some weird conclusion from my message due to the exact thing that I&#039;m talking about and misunderstand what I&#039;m trying to say.<br><br>I&#039;m so tired of how everything needs to be black or white, how we struggle to just be open to different perspectives and not just simply see things in the light that we want them to be seen. How it can be so hard to have something be partially right and wrong depending on a multitude of factors.<br><br>It&#039;s so silly, because I have to say that I&#039;m not perfect or that I&#039;m not talking about how dumb everyone is and how smart I am to avoid being misunderstood and once again be ignored due to the mindset that I am talking about. We are all like this more or less as we are programmed to be, but I feel like it&#039;s stupid to not at least try to learn more about yourself to gain some partial understanding to you as a person, maybe understand your reasoning for some things and understand why you act the way you do in some situations.<br><br>cont","filename":"evilmorty","ext":".png","w":285,"h":373,"tn_w":191,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491609718144,"time":1491609718,"md5":"GE7TzhH9Cf+P+n4Nq5o1KQ==","fsize":104355,"resto":0,"id":"6nI2Axsg","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-starting-to-get-tired-of-how-people-constantly","country_name":"Sweden","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":120050602,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)20:02:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"This isn&#039;t related to anything political or so, just us as humans in general.

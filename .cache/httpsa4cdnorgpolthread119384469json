Yet on the day of the results, they learned that they were lied to by all these ((((political analylists))), cancerous celebrities, maybe even by their very own family members, and told that UK will leave the EU.<br><br>Same happened with american elections. The entire (((mainstream media)))), every single celebrity, political commentrator, living president and most politicians said Trump will not win, even going as far as John Oliver, announcing that Trump absolutely should run, just so he could subsequently lose in a landslide and be humiliated. Yet, come the election day, boyfriends who admitted to their girlfriends to vote Clinton changed their minds and voted Trump. All those quiet people nobody ever talks about or notices came through and voted for Trump. And so he won, to the horror of all these smug lefties with horrible narcissistic personality traits, who felt absolutely robbed of what seemed to be such an easy victory.<br><br>Look at this picture of a crying wojak. The left is losing a grasp of their own narrative they are preaching to the world. Around the world, you see how their narrative becomes less and less believable. Sandnigger crime in Europe and Nigger crime in America keep showing how multiculturalism just doesn&#039;t work, something your ancestors knew as a fact, but what the modern whites refuse to believe.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tl;dr this crying wojak is a good symbolification of the lefties and how they constantly get BTFO these days<\/span>","filename":"M1O8U-0uRyLQqtJvKKA-AX7Q8cqRdy_EfamOlQH5BAw","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":700,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491255514519,"time":1491255514,"md5":"aqPd8COWyc2t9SpOzIAtzA==","fsize":78219,"resto":0,"id":"GA+fsugU","country":"EE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"look-at-this-picture-of-crying-wojak","country_name":"Estonia","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119384922,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)17:42:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119384469\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119384469<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There is no better image to summarize the feelings of the left wing in 2017 than this picture.<\/span><br><br>*leans into the mic*<br><br>WRONG","filename":"wifes sons wojak pepe","ext":".jpg","w":539,"h":719,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491255722916,"time":1491255722,"md5":"7SAuXtlu7bxJiQC7HvNrbA==","fsize":105154,"resto":119384469,"id":"KwRWg96x","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":119385433,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)17:45:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119384469\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119384469<\/a><br>he&#039;s right honestly<br><br>no hugs for them though","time":1491255959,"resto":119384469,"id":"kcTTMRio","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119387734,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)18:04:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"i know some lefty normies. it&#039;s sad how for them the news blurbs on the radio and stuff on CNN is completely 100% the only reality they know.

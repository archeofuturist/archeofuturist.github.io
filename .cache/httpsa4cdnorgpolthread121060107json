They are accessible to clients of Trac-B Exchange, a program run by the Las Vegas Hard Reduction Center.<br><br>And the machines don&#039;t take money. Instead, drug users scan a card and enter a unique ID number in order to vend one of the colorfully gift-wrapped boxes inside.<br><br>The center worked in collaboration with the Southern Nevada Health District and the Nevada AIDS Research and Education Society (NARES) to install the new machines, which will be available at three different locations by the end of May. Each client will be limited to two kits a week; each box contains syringes, alcohol wipes, safe sex supplies, and a sharps disposal box.<br><br>Nevada is the first U.S. state to launch a vending machine program for clean syringes, but the vending machine model has been in use for several years in Puerto Rico, Europe, and Australia.<br><br>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), heroin use among young people ages 18-25 has more than doubled over the past decade. And between 2002 and 2013, the rate of heroin overdose deaths more than quadrupled.<br><br>In January 2016, Congress ended a ban on federal funding to syringe exchange programs. The move was made partially in response to the highly publicized 2015 HIV crisis that hit a tiny county in rural Indiana \u2014 where nearly 200 people were diagnosed with HIV in relation to a &quot;close network&quot; of drug users sharing hard-to-find needles.","filename":"syringevendingmachines","ext":".jpg","w":1782,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492176662633,"time":1492176662,"md5":"D6\/F7dinx\/qXECrXeTS9Ag==","fsize":224556,"resto":0,"id":"Ng879foz","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"syringe-vending-machines-coming-to-las-vegas","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":0,"unique_ips":7},{"no":121060229,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:32:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"vegas is cool","time":1492176732,"resto":121060107,"id":"lfYa\/vY7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121060285,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:32:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121060107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121060107<\/a><br>Sounds too complicated.<br>Why not just open special centers with nurses and clean needles like we did?","time":1492176779,"resto":121060107,"id":"zkSAhl6v","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":121060438,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:34:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121060285\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121060285<\/a><br>I&#039;m not sure if these places have nurses on staff but generally people are opposed to medical professionals helping addicts in such a way that could be seen as enabling.","time":1492176874,"resto":121060107,"id":"Ng879foz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121060699,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:37:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121060438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121060438<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;people are opposed to medical professionals helping addicts<\/span><br>And at the same time those medical professionals are creating addicts.

Otherwise there were few overt expressions of love. &quot;We didn&#039;t feel the need to communicate everything all the time,&quot; Chris continued. &quot;We&#039;re not emotionally bleeding all over each other. We&#039;re not touchy-feely. [...] In my family, the boys could not express feelings. We relied on unspoken understandings.

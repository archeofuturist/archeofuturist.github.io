People WANT a grey and boring suit who is identical to the last guy. Anyone who is well-spoken or has new innovative ideas is immediately discarded by the average voter, probably because of the association charisma and innovation has with the nazis. Best to go wit what you know and not risk another Hitler right? It&#039;s political and societal stagnation.<br><br>Americans on the other hand have a low opinion of government in general and love people who are loud and don&#039;t give a fuck about what other think of him. Hence they got Trump, because he is a walking caricature of an American. A loud and boisterous businessman who speaks his mind and isn&#039;t afraid to speak up when he disagrees.<br><br>Europeans however are just boring and crave a continued status quo. They want a stuffed suit who say the same old platitudes that they have heard for 50 years. They want to be able to plan their life out meticiously without any surprises, every year is the same shit with the same policies and politics perhaps with the exception of tax rates.

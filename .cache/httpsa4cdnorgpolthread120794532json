He&#039;ll come up with a compromise wall. A bit here, a bit there, but there won&#039;t be a wall. Obstacles both politically and on the ground are too great. Immigrants he&#039;ll tighten up on. There&#039;s a lot of room for that, and shittons of illegals, he&#039;ll deport some. The overall situation of mega amounts of illegals won&#039;t change though.

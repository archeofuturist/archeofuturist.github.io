As the Supreme Court has observed, \u201c[t]he United States frequently employs Armed Forces outside this country\u2014over 200 times in our history\u2014for the protection of American citizens or national security.\u201d United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 273 (1990). On at least 125 such occasions, the President acted without prior express authorization from Congress. See Bosnia Opinion, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 331. Such deployments, based on the President\u2019s constitutional authority alone, have occurred since the Administration of George Washington. See David P. Currie, The Constitution in Congress: Substantive Issues in the First Congress, 1789-1791, 61 U. Chi. L. Rev. 775, 816 (1994) (\u201c[B]oth Secretary [of War] Knox and [President] Washington himself seemed to think that this [Commander-in-Chief] authority extended to offensive operations<br>taken in retaliation for Indian atrocities.\u201d) (quoted in Bosnia Opinion, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 331 n.4). Perhaps the most significant deployment without specific statutory authorization took place at the time of the Korean War, when President Truman, without prior authorization from Congress, deployed United States troops<br>in a war that lasted for over three years and caused over 142,000 American casualties. See Bosnia Opinion, 19 Op. O.L.C. at 331-32 n.5.<br><br>Also, keep in mind that Trump has not declared war.","time":1491667911,"resto":120146952,"id":"5sOhj5fo","country":"KR","country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":120148108,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)12:13:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120147943\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120147943<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;in response to the threat of an armed attack<\/span><br>Which didn&#039;t happen.<br><br>We&#039;re fighting the Syrians&#039; war for them again.","time":1491667991,"resto":120146952,"id":"\/HKcgVFs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120148209,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)12:14:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120148108\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120148108<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We&#039;re fighting the Syrians&#039; war for them again.<\/span><br>Kek, you&#039;re attacking the Syrians now","time":1491668049,"resto":120146952,"id":"bXGZZL3l","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120148247,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)12:14:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120148108\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120148108<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;particularly<\/span><br>You missed a key word.","time":1491668067,"resto":120146952,"id":"5sOhj5fo","country":"KR","country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":120148382,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)12:15:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120148209\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120148209<\/a><br>Yeah, but we&#039;re supposedly fighting the Syrians to protect them from other Syrians.<br><br>Kind of how we fought Iraq to protect them from other Iraqis.","time":1491668138,"resto":120146952,"id":"\/HKcgVFs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120148404,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)12:15:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"People went to a voting booth and tried to give BERNIE SANDERS the power to spend other people&#039;s money.

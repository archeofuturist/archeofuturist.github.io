My friend literally goes to the city and walks up to woman, says something like &quot;I think you&#039;re cute&quot; and gets a conversation going. Most women respond well, some give him their numbers. Once you have that skill, and especially once you get a woman talking about herself, listen carefully for red flags and things that you find interesting. If you get a good vibe from her, just say you&#039;d like to stay in touch or catch up for tea (coffee in America), and take it from there.<br><br>As to the seduction, unless you&#039;re a &quot;12-year-old refugee&quot;, there are a few steps before you whip your penis out. Simply develop the discipline to say No when she starts to take her panties off.

That&#039;s like playing a game on hard mode and not dying once. So accept that we live in a dysfunctional society and it&#039;s simply the cost of working these things out.

If she has had *several* partners (and multiply the number she gives you by three), she would have to be an absolutely outstanding human being in every respect to make up for it. A woman who has slept around has proven that she naturally has poor judgement, poor impulse control, can&#039;t defer gratification, and is almost a guaranteed liar. For a woman with a sexual history to be worthy of marrying, she would have to put herself through years of therapy and make an almost superhuman transformation to achieve the requisite level of self-knowledge and wisdom. 99% of the time you&#039;ll be on a hiding to nothing with such a woman, and the 1% will still be a rocky road.<br><br>You&#039;re too young and too smart and too red pilled for that.

Tell them about sex, and porn, and show them the data on why looking at porn and having premarital sex is likely to mess you up, etc. You can&#039;t MAKE your kids choose life\/flourishment, but you can certainly give them every reason to.

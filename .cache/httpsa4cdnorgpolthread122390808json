Yes this is political.<br><br>As a young guy, I see how bad girls are right now. Feminism, divorce courts, the (((media))) all incentivize them to be dissatisfied instead of committed. <br>I also see that the Western world will not flourish unless our countries are made up of the genes which made our countries great in the first place. <br>At this point, I&#039;m 21, and I&#039;d like to be a reconstructive plastic surgeon, which would net me &gt;300K\/year easily. <br>If I go through with this plan, I won&#039;t be done school until I&#039;m in my 30s, at which point I will have a choice to find a 21-22 y\/o wife and settle down, or continue the bachelor lifestyle as the Western world crumbles.

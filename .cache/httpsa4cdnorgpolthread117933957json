Psychedelics expand your mind in the sense that it speeds up your thoughts and literally connects the brain through neurotransmitters being released at very high level. This means that you will not think about anything you have not already thought or experienced. All of the people claiming psychedelics are bad either haven&#039;t tried them or don&#039;t have the emotional intelligence to overcome their issues.<br>Those of you spergs who don&#039;t like psychedelics are just pussies who can&#039;t handle their own thoughts. It&#039;s all about set (your current emotional state) and setting. If you are an idiot and don&#039;t understand what the shit does to you and you haven&#039;t got the brain power to calm yourself down of course you&#039;re going to have a bad time. That being said obviously if you are a dropkick loser and you take a drug you will not suddenly become enlightened. You just become more confident in your bullshit. <br><br>The ultimate redpill is being redpilled to begin with and microdosing to speed up your thoughts on the issues.<br><br>Some people prefer to be ignorant than read the psychiatric research, not here to convince any of you faggots of anything except that you should maybe trust your gut and emotions less and your logic more. Unless you&#039;re a fucking retard in which case logic goes out the window anyway and you should probably just drink until you choke you die choking on your own puke. If this applies to you don&#039;t do psychedelics they will make you cry like a bitch and break you in half.","time":1490283450,"resto":117933957,"id":"GitYZogL","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117943916,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)11:38:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117935363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117935363<\/a><br>Proof in case that psychedelics, if anything, don&#039;t change your actual perception as much as make you think you&#039;re smarter than everyone else for eating cow shit fungus.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no dude u hafta open ur 3rd eye xD<\/span><br><br>For real, has anyone else noticed that psychelic enthusiasts will go on and on about how changed their life is?

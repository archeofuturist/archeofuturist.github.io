Apparently it never occurs to them that you can&#039;t make rapid, drastic changes in the technology and the economy of a society without causing rapid changes in all other aspects of the society as well, and that such rapid changes inevitably break down traditional values.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The breakdown of traditional values to some extent implies the breakdown of the bonds that hold together traditional small-scale social groups. The disintegration of small-scale social groups is also promoted by the fact that modern conditions often require or tempt individuals to move to new locations, separating themselves from their communities. Beyond that, a technological society HAS TO weaken family ties and local communities if it is to function efficiently. In modern society an individual&#039;s loyalty must be first to the system and only secondarily to a smallscale community, because if the internal loyalties of small-scale communities were stronger than loyalty to the system, such communities would pursue their own advantage at the expense of the system. <\/span><br><br>Was he right?","filename":"Ted Kaczynski","ext":".jpg","w":630,"h":354,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492131284637,"time":1492131284,"md5":"4G6ZREwRjJ7nQqgtc4YTtg==","fsize":49262,"resto":0,"id":"OHB+sjh1","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-conservatives-are-fools-they-whine-about-the","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":120993381,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)20:57:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"He didn&#039;t predict the Internet so no.","time":1492131449,"resto":120992978,"id":"7eP0trAr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120993481,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)20:58:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120992978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120992978<\/a><br>yes, being amish is the ultimate redpill","filename":"amish","ext":".jpg","w":698,"h":350,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1492131484648,"time":1492131484,"md5":"g4\/psTQmd5qEWvLKQCZebw==","fsize":77740,"resto":120992978,"id":"5TPb8JSW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120993893,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)21:00:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120992978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120992978<\/a><br>Yes","time":1492131655,"resto":120992978,"id":"A1Q5kGx7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120994500,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)21:05:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120992978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120992978<\/a><br>Yes.

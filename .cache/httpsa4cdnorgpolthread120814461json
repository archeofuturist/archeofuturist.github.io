I think of it as a tendency of the mind, as a psychological constitution which is a possibility for all mankind, but which has become actual in the most conspicuous fashion only amongst the Jews. Antisemitism itself will confirm my point of view.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; ...Thus the fact is explained that the bitterest Antisemites are to be found amongst the Jews themselves.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The true concept of the State is foreign to the Jew, because he, like the woman, is wanting in personality; his failure to grasp the idea of true society is due to his lack of free intelligible ego. Like women, Jews tend to adhere together, but they do not associate as free independent individuals mutually respecting each other&#039;s individuality.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; As there is no real dignity in women, so what is meant by the word &quot;gentleman&quot; does not exist amongst the Jews. The genuine Jew fails in this innate good breeding by which alone individuals honour their own individuality and respect that of others. There is no Jewish nobility, and this is the more surprising as Jewish pedigrees can be traced back for thousands of years.<\/span>","time":1492033482,"resto":120814461,"id":"ola1YIQR","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"}]}

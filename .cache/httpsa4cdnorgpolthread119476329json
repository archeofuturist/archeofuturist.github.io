They&#039;re simply making fun of one ideology, while indirectly defending their own. Sure, many comedians are good at picking apart and ridiculing the double standards in their opposition&#039;s political ideology, but they&#039;re completely blind when it comes to seeing their own double standards.<br>It&#039;s particularly grating in the modern world, where comedians ironically represent the ruling elite, by promoting political correctness.

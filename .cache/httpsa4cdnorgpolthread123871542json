You&#039;ll learn more from Farrakhan&#039;s sermons regularly posted to YouTube about (((them))) than anywhere else online. I expected it to be Kangz + fuck whitey, but 70% is about Israel, Rothschilds, Talmud, and tons of redpilled Hollywood shit. He talked about Michael Hastings&#039; death one time. <br><br>He also mentioned the JQ in his interview with Alex Jones. <br><br>He&#039;s where I first heard about the Star of David having six points, six capsules, six angles. Also, learned that Bill Cosby&#039;s son was killed by the son of an elite Jewish mobster in cold blood, and this sent Cosby off the deep end against (((them))). <br><br>\/pol\/ could use its own Farrakhan, desu &gt; Milo, Shapiro.","time":1493787078,"resto":123871542,"id":"mdpYEBsS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

I am seventeen years old. Over approximately the past week or so I have been listening to Adolf Hitler\u2019s \u201cMein Kampf\u201d. Through this I have come to know a totally new understanding of the world, and while I do not necessarily agree with the author\u2019s methods of realizing his ultimate thesis, I do in fact understand the ideas which pertain to said thesis, and even by the modern liberalistic standards of today, they are not unreasonable in the slightest.<br> I believe that if I could truly sum up his ideas that it would be in the age old, yet hardly used idiom \u201cOnly the strong will prevail.\u201d As I said, I do not believe this to be an unreasonable assumption. For many years I have seen the decline and abhorrence towards my people grow, I have witnessed unspeakable acts of societal degeneracy in the name of \u201ctolerance\u201d or \u201cequality\u201d. As a result, I have but a single thing to say: No longer. I have seen whites degrade themselves, I have seen them be indoctrinated by a media controlled by a corrupt globalist political sphere and depress our traditions out of self-hatred and unutterable guilt.<br> In all my short life, never in my studies of the annals of history have I ever heard of a people wishing to degrade themselves instead of wanting to place themselves in the sun. They hate themselves so much, for so little. For a brief and minor \u201csin\u201d if it can be called that. I now have a deep caring, and longing to reassert my people as decent, and benevolent lords of the world as we were so long ago; to celebrate my history and heritage. I myself (to my knowledge) am mostly Anglo. My ancestors hail from the British Isles, and were conquerors and masters of the earth itself despite the vastness of their foes and adversaries.","filename":"Pure badassery","ext":".png","w":600,"h":643,"tn_w":233,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490847184641,"time":1490847184,"md5":"ps2wZWzo\/I7zXuLjSPZMWg==","fsize":341750,"resto":0,"id":"60hAMWZ\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-know-now-12-this-was-a-journal-entry-from-a","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118881158,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:15:18","name":"Thos","com":"My entire life, I felt somewhat of a sense of guilt for my ancestors, only now, knowing everything that I know, I feel full pride. Furthermore, I feel that the reassertion of my people into power will beget an era of prosperity and progress to the contrary of what has happened in these latter years of our nation. There is nothing wrong with being proud of your heritage. There\u2019s nothing bad about wanting to preserve it genetically or otherwise.<br> Security for the existence of your people is not a bad thing, security for the existence of others is not of your interests, and the extermination of others is of such moral impotence that it could be declared that degeneracy has reached its height with this action. I am white, I am proud of it. I will secure the future of my people, and I will, regardless of outcome, secure the future for my future children.","filename":"download","ext":".jpg","w":225,"h":224,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490847318684,"time":1490847318,"md5":"VlTVubexNUcSzqX0Y3MasQ==","fsize":10842,"resto":118880916,"id":"60hAMWZ\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118881918,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:22:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;I am seventeen years old<\/span><br>underage; reported","time":1490847761,"resto":118880916,"id":"Gn0SU8hn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118881966,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:23:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"If you&#039;re writing a journal, keep your thoughts in your journal.

That\u2019s a difference of \u00a367 billion from the bill without tariffs. But EU membership costs only \u00a38.5 billion? So how much is the UK going to lose from Brexit? \u00a358.5 billion pounds.)<br><br>Sovereignty? nope (We will go from one of the biggest global players, creating framework for European economy and foreign policy, reduced to desperately seeking allies and trade agreements on the other side of the globe, bending over backwards for Trump. It&#039;s going to cede sovereignty bit by bit across the globe as we scrabble for rushed trade deals.)<br><br>Democracy? nope (The UK gets a say at every part of the democratic process, and the people who make these processes are decided at both a domestic General Election level and the European Election level in the Commision, the Council, and the Parliament.) <br><br>The opportunities offered by Brexit are either elusive or they were already there for the taking.

The entire North Korean military is hopelessly outdated and untrained. The bulk of their artillery is dumb\/blind, dating back to World War 2 surplus Soviet shit. Their air force is a mix of prop driven bi-planes and Korean War era surplus soviet shit, their tanks are likewise a mixture of World War 2 era Soviet Surplus shit and some Vietnam era Chinese tanks that are cheap knock offs of the Soviet variants from that time period. <br><br>They also have no deployment capacity. Most of the units in the North Korean Army have to grow their own food because they receive little to no supplies from the central government. They also have no fuel with which to invade with, which means what World War 2 era tanks they do have won&#039;t get very far. Ditto for their Chinese trucks. Any invasion would have to be conducted on foot. As for their reserves (peasants guards) they are untrained and don&#039;t have any weapons because the central government does not want the Peasants revolting. <br><br>The actual North Korean military (that is fed, armed and trained) is probably around 100,000 strong. The so called &quot;Special Forces&quot;. Special in that they get to eat and shoot their rifles once a year. <br><br>South Korea would wreck their shit without the USA. With the USA the battle would be over really fast.","filename":"Glorious Military Tractors","ext":".jpg","w":964,"h":619,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":160,"tim":1492543292660,"time":1492543292,"md5":"rrGzIeGcz\/3Vx+Cu2qyp1Q==","fsize":147036,"resto":0,"id":"GvtXUbxM","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"north-korea-v-south-korea","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":121726126,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)15:22:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"They literally just have to point their shitty artillery in the general direction of Seoul and they kill thousands and cause millions in damages","time":1492543348,"resto":121726007,"id":"lfA5Iv3X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121726264,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)15:23:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121726007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121726007<\/a><br>Stop talking and more killing.","time":1492543409,"resto":121726007,"id":"03bDX86j","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121726549,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)15:25:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121726126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121726126<\/a><br>yep, desu thats all they have to do.<br>considering about 1\/4 of the south korean population live\/live near seoul, even with shitty north korean artillery its gonna be hard to miss the entire city.","time":1492543544,"resto":121726007,"id":"BHSUZQgC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121726939,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)15:28:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121726007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121726007<\/a><br>Because Seoul is so close to the border that even their WWII era artillery can reach it, and half of South Korea&#039;s population lives there.","time":1492543732,"resto":121726007,"id":"HaZZbpN\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

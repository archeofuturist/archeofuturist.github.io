Decent troll attempt, with that said, let&#039;s say you were real about this; appropriately, you&#039;d be laughed at considering any decent future chances at employment for our children will involve science. As a former engineer and now attorney, I can confidently tell you that if our country doesn&#039;t strength scientific efforts, then the west is done. You can fix the schools without losing the science. If this is a faith thing, then I&#039;ve got all kinds of bad news for you regarding faith v. Science and the law. Keep your faith personal, after the boomers die out in the next decade you need to understand that gen x and y won&#039;t be nearly as sympathetic.","time":1492927576,"resto":122387934,"id":"3gBMSx+E","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122389241,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)02:10:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122388724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122388724<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;any decent future chances at employment for our children will involve science<\/span><br><br>Which is why science will be taught in college, when people are at an age to decide for themselves if science is real or just a theory and make up their own mind without political bias.

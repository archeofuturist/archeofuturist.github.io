He detailed his findings in a book, Ringmakers Of Saturn (there are only 27 copies of this book). Bergrun is no amateur. He was a scientist at what became NASA&#039;s Ames Research Center, worked for Lockheed Missiles and Space Company and Douglas Aircraft, and established his own research and engineering company. Bergrun became fascinated by the rings of Saturn after studying photographs from the NASA Voyager I and II missions. They arrived at Saturn nine months apart in 1980 and 1981 and Bergrun saw blatant differences in the rings. &quot;That was the starting point for me. I&#039;ve been researching this ever since.&quot;, he said. Images from NASA&#039;s Cassini mission, which arrived in 2004, confirmed all his conclusions. He said that some astronomers and physicists had speculated that the rings were much younger than the Universe and maybe about 100 million years old, &quot;but one pair of pictures shows a change in five minutes!&quot;<br><br>Constant change in Saturn&#039;s rings was revelatory enough given the belief in their permanence by mainstream science; but Bergrun went further. His long and detailed study of NASA images from three missions led him to conclude that the rings are made by what he calls &#039;gigantic electromagnetic vehicles&#039;. When he says gigantic he is not kidding, with some of them estimated to be three times the size of Earth and more. Not possible? Consider the size of Saturn compared with Earth. We are not talking about the same relative perception of &#039;big&#039;. Bergrun said of these electromagnetic vehicles:<br><br>&quot;Such an immense propulsive body implies a space engine possessing unheard-of capacity and capability.&quot; Or a completely different form of propulsion involving electromagnetism.

He said:<br><br>&quot;On each extremity of Saturn&#039;s rings, cylindrical bodies have been photographed spewing emissions. These emissions assume complicated patterns while contributing compositional material for the rings. A time-varying appearance of Saturn&#039;s disc is a natural consequence of this process. The B ring and inner-and-outer A rings are separate entities because different vehicles fabricate these rings..... Presence of electromagnetic vehicles near other planets is intimated by a finding of rings, the signature left by exhaust and emission products persisting in orbit.&quot;<br><br>Bergrun refers to the substance making the rings as trails of effluent or exhaust discharged by the vehicles, but I would connect this to some crystalline or similar material related to the transmitter-receiver systems of Saturn. Bergun said of his findings:<br><br>&quot;These are not conclusions you ordinarily would expect from someone with such a traditional background, but upon applying scientific rigour to the study of Saturn, its rings and its moons, the facts keep pushing me toward some inescapable conclusions.&quot;<br><br>This all fits with my contention that we live in what is basically a computer simulation (that I call &#039;the Matrix&#039;, for short) and that Saturn (a computer system in effect) has been infested with the Demiurge virus and transformed into a colossal broadcasting system delivering at least part of the Matrix information source to human decoding processes.

In Idaho, for example, a 2-million-year-old clay figurine was unearthed in 1912. But even this discovery does not mark an outer limit. Bones, vertebrae and even complete skeletons have been found in Italy, Argentina and Kenya. Their minimum datings range from 3 million to 4 million years. A human skull, a partial human skeleton and a collection of neoliths discovered in California have been dated in excess of 5 million years. A human skeleton discovered at Midi in France, paleoliths found in Portugal, Burma and Argentina, a carved bone and flint flakes from Turkey all have a minimum age of 5 million years.<br>How far back can human history be pushed with discoveries like these?

So it should come as no surprise that our civilisation, which is about 28,000 light-years away from the centre of our galaxy, is primitive and nigger-tier (including even Western Civilisation) in comparison to other civilisations that exist further afield in our galaxy.","filename":"galaxy","ext":".jpg","w":2181,"h":2989,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490163285725,"time":1490163285,"md5":"on+yWV55xDSJT6jS1qFNZQ==","fsize":3622610,"resto":117696485,"id":"zB0V9bPO","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117729391,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:15:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117702892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117702892<\/a><br>That almost sounds like they made 3 really. <br>The first being the actual program, another to hide the real one, and one more to trick the Russians...?","time":1490163316,"resto":117696485,"id":"iPxepBNI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117729411,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:15:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117729357\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117729357<\/a><br><br>We ought to adopt nationalist principles to prevent the globalist plan of ending Western Civilisation and causing the extinction of the white race from succeeding even while REMEMBERING who and what WE REALLY ARE - Pure Consciousness (which is INFINITE AND ETERNAL) having an experience in a temporary human form.

They want us to think that the average person is powerless to positively change the world, but the TRUTH is that we have INFINITE POWER - both individually AND collectively. There&#039;s only one of us here. If you hit yourself on the head with a baseball bat, they&#039;ll put you in a mental hospital, yet that&#039;s EXACTLY what people are doing on a global scale. You can call Pure Consciousness &#039;God&#039; if you want, but I don&#039;t because the word &#039;God&#039; has religious connotations that I would rather avoid.

One of the ways that they have manipulated us so deeply for so long is by suppressing our sense of the possible. What we call &#039;reality&#039; is COMPLETELY ILLUSORY and thus MALLEABLE - and they KNOW THIS, while most other people do NOT. EVERYTHING IS ILLUSORY, EXCEPT PURE CONSCIOUSNESS ITSELF. NOTHING is impossible in a universe that is ILLUSORY TO BEGIN WITH. People are AWAKENING to a MORE EXPANDED CONCEPTION of the world and life in general and this is a PROFOUNDLY GOOD THING. We owe it to our innate intelligence to QUESTION EVERYTHING and that includes EVERYTHING that I tell you. We have the power to transform this prison illusion into a PARADISE ILLUSION, so let&#039;s USE that power.","filename":"image","ext":".png","w":581,"h":552,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1490163327766,"time":1490163327,"md5":"R\/z8uoO6vDm+FWOmJ0wqmA==","fsize":677458,"resto":117696485,"id":"zB0V9bPO","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117729461,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:15:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117729411\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117729411<\/a><br><br>We&#039;re all one - and the beauty of this is that we don&#039;t have to be cucks despite this fact (and it IS a fact).

Every part of the whole contains the whole and, to be more accurate, IS the whole. And just as a drop of water contains the same qualities as an entire ocean of water, we likewise contain all that exists within us - but merely on a smaller scale.

There are no laws, only habits. There are no coincidences, only synchronicities. There are no truths, only experiences. Heaven and Earth shall pass away, but my message shall NEVER pass away. The message is more important than the messenger.","filename":"astronaut","ext":".jpg","w":1331,"h":1024,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1490163358931,"time":1490163358,"md5":"tLjlxebt5H\/KwnFCDnopIA==","fsize":177664,"resto":117696485,"id":"zB0V9bPO","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117729505,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:16:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117728666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117728666<\/a><br>Tripppsy Satan planet story bub","time":1490163393,"resto":117696485,"id":"yYxDAljT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117729600,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:17:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117696657\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117696657<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117698528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117698528<\/a>","filename":"1489993627143","ext":".jpg","w":384,"h":384,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490163476969,"time":1490163476,"md5":"sAMZlsJHm3VIoq2ZxSsxuA==","fsize":21816,"resto":117696485,"id":"3+LymnEb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117729736,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:19:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117700031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117700031<\/a><br>No one is falling for your argentine lies no matter how robust your efforts are to disparage the queen the Falklands will belong to us forever and you will always be non white. <br>Take it somewhere else Santiago.","filename":"1483131227244","ext":".jpg","w":666,"h":430,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":80,"tim":1490163583897,"time":1490163583,"md5":"Q3NRqFJVts0WdjbdRyTvbw==","fsize":83389,"resto":117696485,"id":"J8uLn6Dj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117729746,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)02:19:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117701645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117701645<\/a><br>Irredeemable.

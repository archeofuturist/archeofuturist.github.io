The intelligence gap is genetic. Environment, economic status, and education all have very minor effects compared to your genes. He goes on to say the controversy over this is simply a &quot;moral panic&quot; on the left that this issue is even being discussed at all. <br><br>Most people here already know this stuff, but hearing a public figure like Harris say it is still shocking. <br><br>It&#039;s all pretty good but if you are just looking for the TL;DL version then just listen to the first 9 minutes.","filename":"1492983018786","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493360856489,"time":1493360856,"md5":"3fH1Di67wa34duuGGcTvsA==","fsize":14880,"resto":0,"id":"MpUBUsYJ","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sam-harris-takes-the-red-pill-on-race-and","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Many of you should also be aware that Easter is this Sunday (the day after the ICBM test). This is no coincidence. Today is Good Friday, the day when the world remembers the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. From 3 o&#039;clock today until Easter Sunday is the time when Jesus was dead and his soul in Hell. It is the time in which Satan has his greatest influence in this world. It is very clear that a great disaster is coming upon the world. I doubt that Armageddon is upon us, but many people are about to die.<br><br>It is for this reason that I urge you men of \/pol\/ to accept the Cross and invite the Holy Spirit into your lives in what may be one of the darkest hours in the history of mankind. Even if you are skeptical of the faith, I beg of you to take two minutes out of your day to do this prayer. It could save your soul.<br><br>Below are the Baptismal Vows. Whether you are already baptized or not, please join with me by responding &quot;I do.&quot; to the following questions. You can either respond &quot;I do.&quot; in this thread or speak it out loud.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do you reject Satan?<\/span><br>I do.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And all his works?<\/span><br>I do.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And all his empty promises?<\/span><br>I do.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do you believe in God, the Father Almighty, creator of heaven and earth?<\/span><br>I do.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only Son our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary was crucified, died, and was buried, rose from the dead and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?<\/span><br>I do.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do you believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy universal church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and life everlasting?<\/span><br>I do.<br><br>God, the all-powerful Father of our Lord Jesus Christ has given us a new birth by water and the Holy Spirit, and forgiven all our sins. May he keep us faithful to our Lord, Jesus Christ for ever and ever. Amen.","filename":"jesus-nuclear_1965174a","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":388,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":156,"tim":1492197506389,"time":1492197506,"md5":"8XeHLdje8JwpWQwu+XCWVA==","fsize":39136,"resto":0,"id":"DyWpwTe7","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"preparing-your-soul-for-approaching-nuclear","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":2,"unique_ips":5},{"no":121099923,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)15:19:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121099744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121099744<\/a><br>Satan has made trillions of dollars for the Church.

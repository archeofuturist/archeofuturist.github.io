People often imagine a day once upon a time when the Suffragettes reigned and all was good. But what if this were never the case? Trivially the very word \u201cFeminism\u201d by definition excludes half of the human population. More, if you include gays. <br><br>Consider. <br>1. Suffragettes in 1920<br>2. Women&#039;s Libbers in 1970<br>3. University Feminists in 1990<br>4. Internet Feminists in 2010<br><br>In each case one was the daughter of the prior generation. Building upon an edifice. But what happens if the edifice were built upon false premises and false evidence and false reasoning? Trivially one inspects. <br><br>1. The Suffragettes arose from the WKKK and were related to the Prohibitionists. They were racist, classist, sexist, xenophobes who were driven by self interest at the expense of men (and women) at the bottom of the Life Pyramid. <br><br>2. The Women&#039;s Libbers were Gloria Steinem et al. They got the vote and wanted work and to be at the top of the Life Pyramid. Society was engineered to make it so, by some ill-considered statistical measures. Conversely they had zero interest in engineering society so as to be equal at the bottom of the Life Pyramid. <br><br>3. The University Feminists were the \u201cloud and proud\u201d daughters of the Women&#039;s Libbers. They attended Yale in numbers. They got tenure and created fields of study based upon their beliefs. The created a academic manifestos to re-engineer society and to explain away civilization via oppression and hatred by one group against another. No other thinking was ever allowed. This echo chamber controlled education from grade school to grad school. It had results. <br><br>4. The Internet begat internet Feminists. 3rd Wavers. The N-th wave always hates the (N-1)th wave! They have unabashed misandry. Not like Misogyny ever was. Not like Racism in 2000. But like Racism in 1900. Outright. Even questioning them will get YOU repercussions.

No one wants that shit, and China DEFINITELY doesn&#039;t want Kim to level South Korea because that would send China and the world economy in a Crisis. <br><br>How would China assassinate Kim? Would they send a bunch of Chinese Government people there and have him escorted out of the country, and someone else taking over until a referendum can be reached on how we want to continue. Will Korea be unified? Probably not. Will China basically go into nation building mode and set up a way for North Korea to remain intact? Maybe.","filename":"8b58915db1cc5eb58512704c31503d32dfd423c7","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":518,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":161,"tim":1492066940860,"time":1492066940,"md5":"hhGA++8zV7fJuvqhwfVqPw==","fsize":54320,"resto":0,"id":"BjZaMEGw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"will-china-turn-on-kim","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120881896,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)03:10:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Better question: when will China turn on Trump?","time":1492067406,"resto":120881237,"id":"ZFACPqpf","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

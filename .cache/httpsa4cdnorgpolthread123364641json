Illegals get everything free and get to see the same doctors that the middle and upper class does who are happy with their health care. I guess that also means anyone in the world can just fly into LAX, go straight to Cedars Sinai and get free health care (if any doctors even stay in the state). Look into Ricardo Lara and Kevin &quot;Identity Theft is no big deal&quot; De Leon. These smooth talking, corrupt Latino politicians will destroy the state just like they destroy all Latin countries. How long will rich white liberals in Silicon Valley and Hollywood put up with it?","filename":"ricardo-lara","ext":".png","w":900,"h":518,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":143,"tim":1493491577373,"time":1493491577,"md5":"4\/eD7XZLTGJgM8au6sepeQ==","fsize":662394,"resto":0,"id":"CM16lw9x","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"free-health-care-for-illegals-coming-to-ca","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123364768,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:47:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Dude I wonder why healthcare costs so much now","time":1493491647,"resto":123364641,"id":"MkXxpSkV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123365561,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:53:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123364768\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123364768<\/a><br>Most middle and upper class Californians are happy with the health insurance they get from their job.

However, in the US, the culture is not about social class. Here social class is also racial class. Hispanics, like niggers and Native Americans, have a huge inferiority complex because they come from a long line of losers. They have no inheritance, no histories of accomplishments and are fully aware that they are in the US because their families were the losers and failures of Mexico. They failed in Mexico and they fail here in the US. They were fully aware that their parents and grandparents are losers and nothing to be proud of. Sure, HARDWORKING losers but losers nonetheless. They don&#039;t grow, better themselves, evolve, adapt, assimilate, and set goals for themselves. They constantly remind their kids &quot;Never end up like me when you grow up.&quot; Which is telling the kids don&#039;t be a loser like your family. That&#039;s why they are like that.","time":1490843094,"resto":118869521,"id":"X+I8vqie","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118873744,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)23:06:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118872055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118872055<\/a><br>FUCKING LIAR","time":1490843206,"resto":118869521,"id":"F3QZ6bQP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118874384,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)23:13:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118873560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118873560<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They constantly remind their kids &quot;Never end up like me when you grow up.&quot; Which is telling the kids don&#039;t be a loser like your family<\/span><br>sounds like &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;the greatest generation&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;get an office job :^)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;buy a new car :^)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;vote democrat :^)<\/span>","time":1490843596,"resto":118869521,"id":"l4ho7Kre","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

We both end up on a deserted island, just us two. Mike, being a alt-light cuck, knows nothing of how to survive, while my hours lurking in the woods has taught me how to make fires and live somewhat off the land. We&#039;d spend years together on this island. He would come to rely on me for survival. Eventually, he\u2019d become my friend and we&#039;d talk about the gorilla&#039;s mindset for hours on end. After a few years of discussing fake news, some debris would wash ashore allowing us to finish the construction of a raft, a la Castaway.<br><br>During the voyage home, Mike and I would get separated, but we&#039;d both make it home. Him, picked up by his brown wife&#039;s helicopter, me by a commercial grade fishing boat. We&#039;d both think that the other had died. I would make it home a month or so later, while he was taken home immediately, being Mike Cernovich washed up.<br><br>Upon returning home, I turn on the television and see him on Cernovich Media doing an interview about his time on the island. I watch the whole thing from beginning to end, and at no point am I mentioned. He&#039;s trying to tell everyone that he survived alone for half a decade. Enraged, I take my savings and go on a trip to the USA. I find my way past Mike\u2019s wife and break into his jungle gym while he&#039;s alone.<br><br>Standing behind him, I cock my gun to get his attention. I ask him how he could so such a thing and he begins deeply sobbing. Barely able to talk through the enormous gasps for air, he yells: \u201cFAKE NEWTH!\u201d. At this point, we fuck. The greatest fuck I\u2019ve ever had. The most passionate, beautiful fuck that ever fucked. Then, after I come a few times, I ask to hotdog his ass. Then, while I&#039;m doing that one last time, I grab a vase off a nearby table and cave his fucking skull in.","filename":"mike cernovich gorilla","ext":".jpg","w":926,"h":1024,"tn_w":113,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492030374439,"time":1492030374,"md5":"MokdWgm8TXCjC5f3snm3rg==","fsize":82755,"resto":120806567,"id":"d\/n7KjUL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120806967,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:52:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120806730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120806730<\/a><br>He&#039;s looking worse and worse.<br><br>So soon.","filename":"1487255895817","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492030377323,"time":1492030377,"md5":"bnzlBmIy\/Jk92ZSE5nPJlw==","fsize":245955,"resto":120806567,"id":"R6+kl3qY","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120806995,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:53:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/ptg\/ neocons now attacking bannon rather than admit trump is a kike<\/span>","time":1492030387,"resto":120806567,"id":"WpLyO+XV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120807037,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:53:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120806904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120806904<\/a><br>he failed trump on the travel ban twice","time":1492030407,"resto":120806567,"id":"PhcPPQrW","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120807050,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:53:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Now that I think about it-these threads are no longer needed, now that Trump turned on us and sold us out, these threads have become pointless and quite frankly a breeding ground for cancer and trolls<br><br>When this thread reaches 300 posts, do NOT make a new thread, please and thank you in advance<br><br>-honorary janitor","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":505,"h":565,"tn_w":111,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492030412276,"time":1492030412,"md5":"CN0Jmx\/6QOapBykP6JUaTg==","fsize":30438,"resto":120806567,"id":"SgkHjlTR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120807061,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:53:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120806920\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120806920<\/a><br>women&#039;s studies","time":1492030416,"resto":120806567,"id":"GscRVts7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120807075,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:53:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120806879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120806879<\/a><br>Produced massive amounts of Liberal salt.","time":1492030422,"resto":120806567,"id":"zHV9mA48","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120807086,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:53:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120806904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120806904<\/a><br>He&#039;s realizing that Trump doesn&#039;t like people who are shit at their jobs.","time":1492030425,"resto":120806567,"id":"mqWjcDBP","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120807122,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:54:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120806920\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120806920<\/a><br>gender studies","time":1492030440,"resto":120806567,"id":"N8DdHFFr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120807140,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:54:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;charlie murphy is ded<\/span><br><br>OH FUCK","time":1492030449,"resto":120806567,"id":"PhcPPQrW","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120807141,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:54:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"A warning that a raid is inbound and occurring right now.","filename":"1489111572983","ext":".png","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492030451183,"time":1492030451,"md5":"2l1kCBl+1bwxatAeo1d1Mw==","fsize":805931,"resto":120806567,"id":"v057ykPN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120807178,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:54:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120807037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120807037<\/a><br>Did he really?

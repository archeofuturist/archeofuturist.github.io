He tried to ban Muslims and once he gets Neil Gorsusch in Supreme Court he will. Obama care is Republicans fault. They had 7 years to draft the bill and this Ryancare bullshit was the best they could come up with. Now Obamacare will fail on its own and make Dems look bad and they will be forced to approve a more conservative healthcare bill. They are using American steel once they use up the steel they already bought. What are they supposed to do throw it away? If Hillary is being investigated they are not going to tell the public until they have proof of any wrong doing. He has 4 years to build wall and he will. He can&#039;t force Mexico to pay but he can tax them on imports, tax outgoing U.S. dollars, not give aid so yes the money is coming from Mexico regardless. The military will not let him invade Syria but they are defeating ISIS. We will see about the swamp. It&#039;s not like he can go in and publicly hang Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi from trees in the rose garden","time":1490754066,"resto":118730282,"id":"AOPCORXm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118734128,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)22:23:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118731843\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118731843<\/a><br>i thought defeating isis only takes 30 days at best?","time":1490754201,"resto":118730282,"id":"AP8lF8dH","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

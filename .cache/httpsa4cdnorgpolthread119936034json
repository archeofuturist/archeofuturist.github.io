But hasn&#039;t Israel also done that? or North Korea? Syria is the same neocon blowjob that always comes up when one is elected president. <br><br>We&#039;ll go to war, and in the process further erode Russias petrol dollar, which is helping hold their economy up amid sanctions. This is just the first step. i expect a no fly zone within a year depending on how Trumps approval ratings are affected by this last move.","time":1491571972,"resto":119936034,"id":"+\/HNP3s4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119947016,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)09:33:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119936246\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119936246<\/a><br>I literally was calling out this jewish kike during the president but \/pol\/ let it&#039;s guard down and let the_donald JIDF subverters in","time":1491571985,"resto":119936034,"id":"PrvNgRAr","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119947116,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)09:33:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119936246\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119936246<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. reddit<\/span>","filename":"Reddit spotted","ext":".jpg","w":1154,"h":643,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1491572024108,"time":1491572024,"md5":"HjANqcsGmpD44phyi+Eh5g==","fsize":54692,"resto":119936034,"id":"GQnMJgW\/","country":"BE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":119947136,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)09:33:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119946026\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119946026<\/a><br>100% this","time":1491572033,"resto":119936034,"id":"sedMDTxp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119947255,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)09:34:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119936034\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119936034<\/a><br>FUCK OFF REDDIT REEEEEEEEEEE<br>ONLY REDDIT SUPPORTS TRUMP NOW HOW FUCKING IRONIC","time":1491572075,"resto":119936034,"id":"Nt+n36pY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119947417,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)09:35:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119936246\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119936246<\/a><br>Go fuck yourself your Warmonger piece of shit.

The Sahara is a giant fucking desert, the soil of the Congo (and most jungles) is very infertile, and scrubland is pretty fucking shit for farming especially if you are starting from scratch. <br><br>As a result the vast majority of Africa didn&#039;t evolve socially or technologically until Europeans arrived making Africa from a backwards shithole where you spent your time as hunter gatherers into a modern shithole where you are drafted into an army at age 8 rape a girl with no clitoris at age 14, get AIDS from said rape, rape a virgin girl ate age 20 to try and cure your AIDS and die from said AIDS at age 24. Essentially colonizing Africa was morally reprehensible as we gave people socially unprepared for such technology access to modern technology. It is like giving cavemen access to automatic rifles and agriculture and being surprised when their population explodes and they are perpetually fighting wars over inane bullshit that seems imaginary to us but is important to their highly tribal mentalities.","time":1491517038,"resto":119783668,"id":"JrnTwqP4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119804660,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)18:17:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119804303\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119804303<\/a><br>amazing how you could fit the whole of eastern europe in that picture of a business building","time":1491517039,"resto":119783668,"id":"G7LNN2SU","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":119805094,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)18:20:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119804132\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119804132<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;UAP Tower is owned by UAP Old Mutual Holdings, an insurance conglomerate headquartered in Kenya. <\/span><br><br>Owned, not built.

He was against Trump throughout the election, and deep down he&#039;s still against Trump.<br>So, this budget plan that was worked on heavily by CuckRyan, which gives little money for any of Trump&#039;s projects and plenty to the Dems will have a few effects:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dems get a minor victory by dragging their feet in the dirt, get the leftover Obamabux for some of their failed ventures<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Obamacare will fail regardless, but now that failure is on the Dems<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;More crime in sanctuary cities, also on the Dems<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Defense spending increase, but that&#039;s on the Republicans.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Republicans can take credit for the benefits (strong military) but blame the failures on the childish Dems, showing how partisan they are, and how they don&#039;t care about the American people.<\/span><br>Trump&#039;s been tweeting his discontent with the budget, and this gives him the perfect reason to boot Ryan, highlighting that the budgets failures could&#039;ve been avoided if Ryan strong-armed the Dems.<br>At the same times the Dems lose even more support because what they want to spend money fails. Meaning they are ripe for the chopping block in 2018.<br><br>A lot of these factors (especially for the Dems scenario) depend on whether the budget passes, but if Trump vetoes it, he can still outst Ryan for being a cuck.<br><br>Also, The Wall is going to be built, one way or another. Through fed funds, or that sweet sweet drug-money.","filename":"IMG_1864","ext":".jpg","w":422,"h":422,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493741821344,"time":1493741821,"md5":"D0216ny61tksmhIKoa+oBQ==","fsize":128170,"resto":0,"id":"e\/kD0D\/w","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"possible-4d-chess-scenario","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

He tends to wake up early and begin his Twitter rants at around 7:30am eastern time. In the rare instances where he\u2019s begun ranting on Twitter late at night, he\u2019s tended to keep at it for half the night, growing more outrageous with his tweets as the night goes on. And of course this comes the night before James Comey is scheduled to testify regarding the FBI\u2019s very real investigation into Trump\u2019s Russia scandal. So Trump\u2019s maniacal tweeting may well continue into tomorrow.

He is known for having &quot;discovered&quot; the a priori link between democracy and de-civilization, arguing that the transition from monarchy to democracy after WWI was in fact an enormous mistake. He is also the &quot;Physical Removal Man&quot; and argues that anarcho-capitalism (the logical end of libertarianism) would invariably decrease the degeneracy and &quot;abnormal behavior&quot; in society.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Austrian School, eh? So he&#039;s one of the (((chosen)))?<\/span><br>Nope. His writings have drawn from St. Thomas Aquinas, the Scholastics, and he himself praises Christianity for the role it had in establishing somewhat successful universal ethics under monarchy and throughout Western Civilization in general.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is he the &quot;libertarian fascist&quot; I keep reading about?<\/span><br>Hoppe is not a fascist. Fascism implies statism and statism implies economic\/cultural control. Hoppe simply argues that a stateless society would end up culturally conservative because families and traditional ways of life are as a matter of fact better suited for human advancement, the protection of private property, and for lowering time preferences and crime rates. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How does he reconcile anarcho-capitalism with cultural conservatism?<\/span><br>Anarcho-capitalism implies there won&#039;t be a state to subsidize degenerates. This implies that degenerates will either have to pay the full price of their degeneracy or try to socialize it by imposing the costs on society. However, this society operates under a profit-and-loss structure, and the more degenerates there are, the harder it is for healthy social behavior to prosper and for economic activity to exist peacefully. Hence, degenerates (alcoholics, drug addicts, single parents, beggars, vagrants, criminals, etc.) would be literally forced to choose: &quot;either change your ways or be thrown off the property whose value you are diminishing.&quot;","filename":"Hoppe God_00000","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490369722819,"time":1490369722,"md5":"vVN1aB6ZzFi5GphBMB4WUQ==","fsize":971251,"resto":118091093,"id":"taCbKUox","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":118092560,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:40:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;And what to do about the rich homosexual, or the celebrity alcoholic, or the left-wing real estate developer?<\/span><br>Under anarcho-capitalism, all property is private. This implies that several property owners could form alliances and merge properties (&quot;covenants&quot;), in which the path to admission would be as loose or as restricted as they saw fit. There would be exclusively-white covenants, exclusively-black covenants, exclusively-Hindu covenants, you get the whole picture. There are 7 billion people on Earth; the chances you wouldn&#039;t find a relatively large group of similar-minded people with which to live peacefully is almost zero. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When do we get to physically remove democrats and communists?<\/span><br>When they try to forecefully impose their ways of life onto you or your tenants.

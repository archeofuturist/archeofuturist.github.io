Metal isn&#039;t for everyone, and I hate popular metl, but I grew up being trained in music theory, and I like it because it is incredibly complex rhythmically and very different melodically. For example &quot;Prog&quot; means you have a good amount of polyrhythms, but if you made the album darkside of the moon with distortion double bass and faster bpm, metal fans wouldn&#039;t consider it prog because they have higher standards for what complex rhythms are.","time":1490501806,"resto":118313283,"id":"bGkN4jk\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118318313,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:16:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118318158\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118318158<\/a><br>nigger","time":1490501815,"resto":118313283,"id":"QBFhFNaB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118318536,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:19:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"A shit ton of metal bands come from old nordic Europe and I firmly believe it&#039;s just them channeling their ancestors age old Viking rage when they play their music","time":1490501966,"resto":118313283,"id":"6NwOd9DH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118318545,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:19:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118318158\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118318158<\/a><br>I agree.

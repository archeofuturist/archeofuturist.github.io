I thought only metalheads with a decent IQ were capable of that.<br><br>What metal taught me:<br><br> - Only death is real. Everything else in life has to be earned and maintained. Nothing is sacred except that which we choose to uphold as sacred.<br> - Conflict is healthy. It builds character and weeds out the weak. Not only is metal inherently confrontational, but being a metalhead often leads to conflict and street fights. <br> - Nothing is sweeter than the juicy insides of OP&#039;s mom. A bit on the wider side, but I always keep coming back for more.<br> - A life without honor is not worth living. I&#039;ve wet my blade plenty of times, but never dishonorably. <br> - If you are a false don&#039;t entry because you&#039;ll be burned and died<br> - Beer can always be worse. <br> - Most lagers are actually meant to be watered down, count your blessings.<br> - Chuck died of AIDS.<br> - &quot;Autism&quot; is a label neurotypicals use in laughable attempts to put their betters below them.<br> - If you use your stove to boil water, it is best to use wide containers so it boils faster. This is why teakettles are so wide at the bottom.<br> - Meyhna&#039;ch statem--no, scratch that.<br> - To pick up on subtlety and to not mistake symbol for reality. Normies have recently picked up on &quot;minimalism&quot; that is not quite minimalism in spirit. It is not eschewing the unnecessary, but simply dressing up the unnecessary in plain clothes. Meanwhile, good metal is often an exercise in minimalism - crafting grand structures from basic instrumentation and simple riffs. Very rare in popular music. Normie attitudes cannot understand songcraft, let alone appreciate it. In teaching me how to widen my attention span, metal has allowed me to expand my brain to widths incomprehensible to the neurotypical mind.

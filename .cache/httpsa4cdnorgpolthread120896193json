It is, however, a bit of a personal army one. I&#039;m looking for an actual proof of any of the myriad economic conspiracy theories, from Rothschilds controling most of the worlds central banks, to DeBeers holding back most of the mined diamonds to inflate the price, photovoltaic solar panels being fundamentally cost-ineffective and down to minuscule shit like light bulbs being made to fail, and electronics having a sabotage devices inside to make them fail right after warranty runs out.<br>My wife is delivering a lecture on &quot;Global economy and its conspiracies&quot; so this is a good chance as any to subtly redpill some normies. And since i&#039;m frequenting this Botswanian stamp collecting mailing list, I might as well help her with some uncomfortable truths for the masses.<br>Also a general proofs of conspiracies tread. I know some of you autistic faggots have all your conspiracy article links right there on your fucking desktop in a txt file.","filename":"ROTHSCHILD-IMF-World-Bank","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492080501979,"time":1492080501,"md5":"Krc9Q3gcfabat4pjxAp54g==","fsize":310580,"resto":0,"id":"hK9sAWj\/","country":"RU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"alright-pol-heres-the-deal-this-is-not-a-shill","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120897577,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:06:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120896193\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120896193<\/a><br>don&#039;t be stupid. Think of world banking system as computer motherboard, where money doesn&#039;t really mean anything. For casual observer it is designed to look like pin ball machine, but in reality it&#039;s well oiled rube goldberg machine powered by the energy of inquiring minds of donkeys like you. Rothschilds name and family is just another &quot;brand&quot; created entirely from scratch by madmen for madison avenue.

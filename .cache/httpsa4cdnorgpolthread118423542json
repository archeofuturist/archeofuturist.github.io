All of their kids will have to come to the cities and be exposed to diversity and tolerance and see how much<br>better it is that hate and bigotry that Trump represents. We will also grant citizenship to the tens of millions of undocumented immigrants, and allow more non-white people to come in, further solidifying a <br><br>progressive diverse America that votes in universal health care, socialism and social justice policies that help everyone and dismantle white power structures that Trumpets want to preserve.<br>They know they are losing.

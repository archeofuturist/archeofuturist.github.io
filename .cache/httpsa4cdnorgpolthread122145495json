You are advocating that the government allocate how the land should be used. <br><br>Capitalist would leave this to the free market. This means all the actors (persons, groups, organisations and businesses) through voluntary cooperation decide to trade their economic resources together. This produces the best allocation of goods.

Finite resources would be allocated based on price. Say I have a huge swath of land far away from the city and far away from a suburban area. It wouldn&#039;t be in my interest to develop housing. If my land is fertile I might grow corn, and let&#039;s say the soil I have is perfect for corn but not for tomatoes, potatoes or anything else besides corn. Meaning if I grow corn and say the entire processing of planting, watering, protecting, and harvesting my crop per year is $600,000. This is regardless of whether I plant tomato, carrots or potatoes. <br><br>Since my goal is profit I want the plant which will yield the most fruit. Since the soil is suited to corn. I&#039;ll plant corn since if I planted tomatoes I wouldn&#039;t get as much yield and I might find that the plants begin to rot or become vulnerable to insects. <br><br>By simply setting profit as my goal, which wouldn&#039;t be hard to impose on people since when people decide to open a business they do so mostly with the express purpose of making money, the free market has allocated the resources to their best use simply because the best use is the most profitable.","time":1492790035,"resto":122145495,"id":"inO5xog\/","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122150061,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)11:55:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122145860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122145860<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fiat currency collapses<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;enforcement power of state fails<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;i won&#039;t shoot folks for free!&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wtf we&#039;re somalia now<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;people choose<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;some choose to be assholes and form ministates<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;others choose not to be assholes and remain ancap because it&#039;s the natural state of mankind<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anbaps meanwhile never even notice and thrive<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;now they are having fifteen or twenty living children a family<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;now one hurts them because they are the only ones who know how to do anything at all anymore and unless you want to go to los angeles and play cannibal durby they are good to have around<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;eventually all other ways of life die out<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all n. america becomes a pristine wilderness speckled with anbap colonies which never exceed 250 people<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hunting, fishing, gathering all possible again<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;massive forests harvested by two-man saw and mules<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;innovations in beauty and truth we cannot even imagine<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a thousand years later, everyone has become indigenous again<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the end<\/span>","time":1492790100,"resto":122145495,"id":"d4Y4GEJb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122150101,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)11:55:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122147645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122147645<\/a><br>I remember voting for something like this and the results came out as like 50% 50% libertarian\/fascist","time":1492790123,"resto":122145495,"id":"JHpgVYd1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122150218,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)11:56:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Equality is a false god","filename":"8values","ext":".png","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492790208394,"time":1492790208,"md5":"2g506vNaI5UU0O+MnCLVuA==","fsize":54980,"resto":122145495,"id":"jZdbVmo0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122150267,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)11:57:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122150061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122150061<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;99.99% of everyone who lived in the country is now dead<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this is a good thing<\/span>","time":1492790238,"resto":122145495,"id":"NsTqrNqi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122150362,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)11:58:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122149927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122149927<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trag<wbr>edy_of_the_commons<\/span><br>Top kekekek - this is an argument in favour of private property.

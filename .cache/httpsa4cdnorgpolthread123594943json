An imageboard specifically created to be a base of operations for anti-SJW wankery. Just like how we in prosperous non-commie countries provide spaces and institutions for ungrateful leeches to entertain their sedition towards the state that fed them well. They will never pool their sorosbux to make their own imageboards. And even if they did... It doesn&#039;t matter. The pendulum will swing back to us. 4chan isn&#039;t the only imageboard. It&#039;s just the biggest English language one. All anonymous imageboards dedicated to free speech will look like us.","filename":"1491761403229","ext":".jpg","w":555,"h":504,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":113,"tim":1493627954475,"time":1493627954,"md5":"+gco7nkpMSEiZPvQw59ouA==","fsize":142183,"resto":123594943,"id":"vi\/tGR3X","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123597437,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)04:39:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;yes goyim, everyone&#039;s talking about these &quot;dank&quot; marxist memes, look how hip they are<\/span>","time":1493627961,"resto":123594943,"id":"6QcOezEt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123597457,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)04:39:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123596555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123596555<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aoX<wbr>De8HxHBA<br>Here come dat Hillary","time":1493627978,"resto":123594943,"id":"tOE4WVJo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123597465,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)04:39:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123595205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123595205<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a couple of daily \/leftypol\/ shitposters<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/pol\/<\/span>","time":1493627989,"resto":123594943,"id":"VJ2PXcwm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123597496,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)04:40:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123597199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123597199<\/a>","filename":"1491445159576","ext":".jpg","w":767,"h":767,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493628017565,"time":1493628017,"md5":"41b4jVY1Agst6JmG0juxEg==","fsize":75543,"resto":123594943,"id":"paDd3VcE","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":123597513,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)04:40:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123594943\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123594943<\/a><br>Wow, fuck vice.

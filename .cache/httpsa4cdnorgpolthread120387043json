Libtards still 100% voted it in despite their constituents vehemently being against it. Theres still hope outside the libtard refugee centers that are gta and quebec. Problem is they control like 180 seats out of the 290ish. Our media is still too condensed into liberal jew cesspits like cbc. Rebel is a complete joke for conservative\/right leaning news. Conservative politicians are a joke too and just trying to emulate Trump for votes and have no actual movement or policies to back the rhetoric up. <br><br>We need a charismatic party leader to pull us back from the brink. The people will vote for him. They dont want this refugee and mudslime trash. Thats not what Canada is or was. We were 90% white when they made up the fucking melting pot bullshit and pedalled it in schools and tv. People still remember when Canada was great.

We could dramatically increase our military aid to anti-Assad rebels, giving them sufficient anti-tank and antiaircraft missiles to threaten Russian, Iranian, Hezbollah and Syrian helicopters and fighter jets and make them bleed, maybe enough to want to open negotiations. Fine with me.<br>What else? We could simply back off fighting territorial ISIS in Syria and make it entirely a problem for Iran, Russia, Hezbollah and Assad. After all, they\u2019re the ones overextended in Syria, not us. Make them fight a two-front war \u2014 the moderate rebels on one side and ISIS on the other. If we defeat territorial ISIS in Syria now, we will only reduce the pressure on Assad, Iran, Russia and Hezbollah and enable them to devote all their resources to crushing the last moderate rebels in Idlib, not sharing power with them.&quot;<br><br>https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/column\/thom<wbr>as-l-friedman?action=click&amp;contentC<wbr>ollection=Opinion&amp;module=ExtendedBy<wbr>line&amp;region=Header&amp;pgtype=article","filename":"Thomas_Friedman_2005_(5)","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":3072,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492121482082,"time":1492121482,"md5":"igW5tbQrl3mzAUDMbAI4Tg==","fsize":2021433,"resto":0,"id":"daWEO0+8","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"jew-york-times-author-thomas-l-friedman-says-us","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":120972379,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)18:16:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump should want to defeat ISIS in Iraq.

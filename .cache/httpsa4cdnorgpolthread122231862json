Really hated it, but, was kind of ingrained in me from an early age to have a good work ethic, so I started up as soon as I got a work permit from school. When I turned 18, I moved out and was moderately stable on my own, about as well as any 18 year old without a trust fund could be anyway. When I was 19, my mother kept asking me to move back in with her, as I have 4 younger siblings who needed to occasionally be babysat at the time. After a year of her constantly asking, I decided to agree. Agreement was I moved back to her city, get another job, and occasionally babysit. Seemed fine to me, got free rent n food so I went along with it. <br><br>&quot;Occasionally babysitting&quot; turns out meant 60 hours a week. Couldn&#039;t work because I needed to babysit the little shits all the god damn time. So, I ended up being stuck. Couldn&#039;t move out as I had given up my savings to pay for her rent when I got in because she lapsed, (should have been a red flag), and couldn&#039;t get a job to recoup it. So I was fucked. Couldn&#039;t leave, and staying meant I was stagnant. Ended up being that way for two fucking years, lost all of my friends as I couldn&#039;t pay for anything or even buy a tank of gas as I had no income, my social life was non-existant, couldn&#039;t afford anything fun. I was miserable.<br><br>But, the silver lining was that while I was stuck at home, I discovered, and self taught day trading, which is what I currently live on. Three years later, I am 25, and making far more than I otherwise would have, and am completely and totally economically FREE. I report to nobody, bills are all paid, I am in control of my life. No boss to tell me when and where I have to be, what I can wear, what I can say. It&#039;s all me.<br><br>I guess the morale of the story here is that the shittiest situations give light to good opportunities. Just have to look around. It may look bleak now, but you can find an out.","filename":"tenor","ext":".gif","w":462,"h":498,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492835216812,"time":1492835216,"md5":"IXoXlQ9b4x2ZyJ\/AsSI00w==","fsize":392288,"resto":122231862,"id":"vI85gd5V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122235408,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:27:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122235256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122235256<\/a><br>Andropause is strong for this one.","time":1492835226,"resto":122231862,"id":"HQxGqmND","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122235454,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:27:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122234950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122234950<\/a><br>Sign up for grade 13, do better next year","time":1492835255,"resto":122231862,"id":"tgpvomyO","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122235500,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:28:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122234681\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122234681<\/a><br>this<br><br>PERSISTENCE","time":1492835287,"resto":122231862,"id":"TM7eM\/Zb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122235527,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:28:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Seriously some people on this board are such crybabies.

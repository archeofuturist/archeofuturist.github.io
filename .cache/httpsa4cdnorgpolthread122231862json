Believe me, I wish I could go back and love those people in my life harder, but thats no longer an option. <br><br> There will ALWAYS be someone with a bigger house or more cars or what have you. But if those people in your life dont love you then it wont matter if your rich or homeless. <br><br>&quot;Im a neet with no friends\/life\/etc&quot; just be nice to every person you see and expect nothing in return. Kindness is contagious and I thought it was a load of horse shit until I tried it for a month for fun, as a joke, in my dead end job. Doors started flinging open, and I gained so much mor respect. But I personally believe it only worked because I started to become more genuine, and people really connect with that.","time":1492833948,"resto":122231862,"id":"Fr7O3DFE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122233314,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:06:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122231862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122231862<\/a><br>You should be on the right path by 21 but that doesnt mean you need to have your career and family figured out already.

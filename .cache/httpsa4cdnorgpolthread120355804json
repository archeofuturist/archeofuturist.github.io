None of this would have been possible pre-printing press of course, as in the word of God would have become misquoted etc.... so the centralized power of the catholic church was needed. However, Martin Luther is so revered because he was the first to point out the absolute herasy of the catholic churches practice of paying for indulgences and non-biblical teachings that were literally made up from catholic priests.","time":1491792898,"resto":120355804,"id":"q6ScyuZ\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120381291,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)22:56:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120379662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120379662<\/a><br>The problem has nothing to do with a lack of belief in a god.

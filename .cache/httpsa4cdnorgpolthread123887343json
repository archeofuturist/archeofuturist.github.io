TV cameras shake as an associate producer shits her pants. A 27-year-old grad students falls over the audience railing and snaps both ankles, impervious to pain as xhe descends into hysteria. The entire front row, between tears of joy, begins a &quot;I&#039;M WITH HER&quot; chant, complete with fist pumps and choreographed dance. A woman prematurely goes into labor after severe abdominal strain caused by intense laughter.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is gay.<\/span><br><br>The audience feverishly bumrushes the sage and carries off the entire staff. Rioting in the street begins at 11:40 pm that evening and lasts six days. A million-man march is organized and the Emmy nomination board is held hostage in their offices. The frothing masses demand immediate and decisive action to ensure &quot;The Late Show&quot; wins ever category the following year. Trained baboons are released and taught to build idols and statues of Stephen Colbert. The United States Federal Government cease their grants for cancer research and instead transfer them to generating Stephen Colbert embryos for in-vitro fetilization.<br><br>And that&#039;s just the first 5 minutes.","time":1493799669,"resto":123887343,"id":"727POf3c","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123890370,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)04:21:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123889956\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123889956<\/a><br><br>Try telling that to the T_D drones","filename":"COtlr9KUkAAI-fO","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493799671810,"time":1493799671,"md5":"I2x8xxK4lEjssgM9BIWabQ==","fsize":30016,"resto":123887343,"id":"4PwatP2F","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123890379,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)04:21:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"You guys know that the FCC doesn&#039;t care what happens on tv after 10 pm, right?","time":1493799686,"resto":123887343,"id":"ojvXwbnR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123890392,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)04:21:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123890234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123890234<\/a><br>I called AT&amp;T with my best faggot voice.

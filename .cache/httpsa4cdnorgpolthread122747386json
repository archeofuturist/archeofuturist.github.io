Will he swing harder into the right and start openly calling for genocide and ethnic homogeneity? Maybe he takes the green pill and spends his youtube money on a plot of land and permacultures \/ homesteads with animals and growing his own food?<br><br>To me he is a useful case study, because he represents about 80% of the failed generation (the internet addicted, computer games, video on demand nerd types) who never got jobs and basically live on the pittance and pity of others. He&#039;s very successful at it currently, but most of his ilk will be financial burdens on their families until their parents die of old age and they inherit enough money to survive alone with sex robots.<br><br>I walk through university campuses and I see two faces: Indian and Asian. Over and over, these kids from third world developing nations are here and are taking advantage of the education on offer to enrich themselves and slowly they will take control of western society. Give it 10 years they will be a dominant majority in all the professions and high earning jobs.<br><br>Has the white man made a drastic mistake turning away from education and back into spiritualism and self-obsession? Are NEETs the canaries in the coalmine of a slow excruciating death of the great pan-european expansion?

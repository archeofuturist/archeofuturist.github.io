Think of it like your company, all MIC Paramilitaries have fiefdoms. Alot of what CIA does, like having their own internal cyberarms R&amp;D program would piss off the other agencies (NSA, NRO, DIA). A Trump Audit would likely remove 50% of their budget. At the moment, like the Russian GRU, CIA is nearly the entire &quot;lit&quot; Congress Budget. So, CIA and alot of CIA line managers could lose their entire operating department in a Reorg. <br><br>Thats the Ghist of it. Imagine &quot;The Office&quot;, except Michael Scott gets a burn bag and Dwight is well, Dwight. This is a pure turf war and CIA feels that if Trump wins, they will be bumped out for a SOCOM\/DIA leading role in MIC.","filename":"raymond-reddington-sunglasses","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":736,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491009357191,"time":1491009357,"md5":"6p4irO60VHGQfnx+HaZFKA==","fsize":65411,"resto":119124574,"id":"2ENpwJb1","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119126423,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:24:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

is in reasonably good nick, all things considered.<br><br>- the first is obviously 6 years of war<br>the army was not really on a war footing when things kicked off. And from a open battle perspective the war has been around for about 4-5 years.<br>In that time, we have all sorts of things happening, including fresh blood having come out of school. U must understand that a population of 15 million can sustain the supply of soldiers for a long time.<br><br>There is little evidence of being strained to breaking point - e.g. youth whose siblings have been martyred in battle do not have to serve ( thus ensuring that families continue ) - this kind of &#039;luxury&#039; policy is not a signal that things are about to hit the skids.<br>The army is on a better footing that it was before the uprising\/invasion. It is better supplied, better trained and has better command structures. It probably also has better moral as the sides one can pick from as a combat age Syrian are already pretty well cast.<br><br>In comparison rebels are likely feeling the pinch, they are surrounded for the most part, and being slowly reduced in number. This both due to russian and syrian actions but also due to continuous infighting. <br><br>ISIS videos for instance show that the vast majority of suicide truck drivers are much older than they were just half a year ago. back then it was all young men. Now it&#039;s all grey beards and 15 year olds. This is evidence that their command structure needs to keep combat age individuals in combat instead of glorychickening themselves to the inner thighs of 72 whores.<br><br>Furthermore, the long term strategy of the Assad govt has been to surround and force rebels to negotiation. The results of negotiation are complete surrender or green buses to the last strong holds of rebel resistence in idlib. <br><br>This strategy free&#039;s up government forces. Over the last few days 10k government troops became redeployable due to the removal of thousands of rebels to idlib","filename":"maemae1greenbus","ext":".png","w":476,"h":723,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492212036549,"time":1492212036,"md5":"pTWwZEDM33JxrbRsnA0Psg==","fsize":404279,"resto":121121289,"id":"n+JBtL59","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":121130982,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:21:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121127308\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121127308<\/a><br>Stop using &#039;google translate&#039; Ahmed<br>And ease down with the VPN<br>You should quit doing drugs too by the way","filename":"arab_stoned","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":900,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492212075058,"time":1492212075,"md5":"2f0B2ZyPPxgVcAHbYfPPsw==","fsize":183604,"resto":121121289,"id":"OHfTSLT2","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121131122,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:22:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121129879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121129879<\/a><br>south africa is definitely a bright incandescent red","time":1492212141,"resto":121121289,"id":"n+JBtL59","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":121131298,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:23:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121130982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121130982<\/a><br>mais mon ami je suis aussi fran\u00e7ais que vous","time":1492212215,"resto":121121289,"id":"DCt2u\/Zm","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121131391,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:24:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121127442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121127442<\/a><br>He&#039;s a semite which means he&#039;s guilty since his birth","filename":"rare-bashar-al-assad","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":641,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492212264176,"time":1492212264,"md5":"dpnvtxX2ihHkjJYHre3xnQ==","fsize":63259,"resto":121121289,"id":"OHfTSLT2","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121131467,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:25:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;121131075<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;6 Jun 2015<\/span>","time":1492212301,"resto":121121289,"id":"nC1Mp9J\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121131488,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:25:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"answer!<br><br><a href=\"#p121131122\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121131122<\/a><br>didnt know it was that bad","filename":"1481748982604","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":320,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492212310230,"time":1492212310,"md5":"QMSzHhEl7fhizgUyV2VZJg==","fsize":15139,"resto":121121289,"id":"wU1o4I+Y","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":121131495,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:25:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121129879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121129879<\/a><br>Montenegro is about to join NATO.","time":1492212314,"resto":121121289,"id":"pq3WAAQj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121131689,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:27:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121130017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121130017<\/a><br>just ask pertinent questions, don&#039;t lecture, dont preach. but when u hear a assad is a bad guy, ask for evidence. keep asking a questions that brings them to the conclusion. e.g. whats the evidence for that? so if there is no evidence and colin powel lied about iraq in 2003 - that doesn&#039;t worry u? <br>it&#039;s not about being right or left wing, these things don&#039;t exist exceptin peoples heads and identity badges. it&#039;s about applying the correct standards, international law, evidence, due process.<br>underminng the rebels is easiest, minority ridden by foreigners, foreign money, propped up with us weapons. the more questions u ask, the more puzzle pieces will fall into place in your friends heads.<br><br>never make it personal. never insult them. just be a good guide, answer what you can and test their understanding. most people can reason - you just have to feed their reason","time":1492212427,"resto":121121289,"id":"n+JBtL59","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":121131842,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:28:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;121131075<\/span><br>On the contrary.

I imagine that most Muslims are pretty moderate, and it&#039;s just Salifi\/Wahabi Islam that&#039;s the problem; and that the only reason that that is so much more fucked up than Evangelical Christianity is because of the greater lack of privilege in their education and economic prospects. <br><br>I always shake it off and remind myself they&#039;re filthy moon-worshipping, camel-fucking, clit-cutting pagan scum, and that it&#039;s our destiny to drive the Saracen back to the desert and then glass the desert.

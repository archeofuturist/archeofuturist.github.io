It is a coping mechanism to allow you to understand the process. Atheists probably just see a &quot;rational human being&quot; that explains what is happening to them.

To us, a &#039;ghost&#039; would not look solid - but to that &#039;ghost&#039;, we are the ones who would not look solid.

Are they SOL?<\/span><br><br>That was something I had a hard time understanding myself and at times it led me to stop believing completely because I could not get 100% of the answers. From what I&#039;ve learned, (and this question is a fair one, but not new, as you will find it within writings from centuries ago) is that God does reveal the messiah in different ways to different cultures, but ultimately only he knows how each person was tested and whether they accepted it or not. We cannot penetrate absolutely through God&#039;s vast ocean of knowledge and then claim it doesn&#039;t exist due to our lack of ability to see.<br><br>It&#039;s the answer nobody likes to hear, but it&#039;s simply we do not know why and it&#039;s futile to question it, because there are certain things only God knows and asks us to trust in him. Even if that answer seems to make people angry, over time as you develop a relationship with God you&#039;ll find there are limits to human knowledge and insight, but we cannot let our lack of ability turn into excuse for never believing out of vanity for not having every question revealed to us on a silver spoon.","filename":"triumph-of-christianity","ext":".jpg","w":785,"h":1200,"tn_w":81,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491749127336,"time":1491749127,"md5":"\/ChmAazgHmzrGp8g1mnWIw==","fsize":570230,"resto":120276454,"id":"BvdWBycd","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120289345,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)10:47:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120288590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120288590<\/a><br>how is anybody this stupid?","time":1491749223,"resto":120276454,"id":"zQNoDvqh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120289457,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)10:48:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120289193\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120289193<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is that God does reveal the messiah in different ways to different cultures, but ultimately only he knows how each person was tested and whether they accepted it or not.<\/span><br><br>but see, this isn&#039;t an answer. this is a copout that has to be supplemented with faith. this still doesn&#039;t work for me.

And frankly, it\u2019s at the center of freethinking and research.&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;So we\u2019re urging the Government of Hungary to suspend implementation of the law. We want to see a review and discussion in order to address any concerns through dialogue with the university itself and other affected institutions going forward.\u201d<\/span>","filename":"e","ext":".jpg","w":983,"h":850,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":216,"tim":1491989857726,"time":1491989857,"md5":"RIaTAlbU\/2SWb2xknbMx6Q==","fsize":203614,"resto":0,"id":"rKHlDdza","country":"HU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"acting-spokesperson-of-us-department-of-state","country_name":"Hungary","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":120737522,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:39:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120737371\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120737371<\/a><br>Fuck them, do your worst.<br>Burn it if you have too.","time":1491989990,"resto":120737371,"id":"PUHJ8wlh","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":120737722,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:43:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120737371\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120737371<\/a><br>America&#039;s Israeli puppet-masters don&#039;t even try to hide anymore.

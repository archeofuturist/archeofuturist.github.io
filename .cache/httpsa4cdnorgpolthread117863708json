Just came across your thread. I&#039;m happy to have a conversation with you if you&#039;d like. If you&#039;re just here to troll, that&#039;s fine, I&#039;m just not going to waste my time. <br><br>I&#039;ll start with your initial question. Yes, there are things that have been corrupted. As humans, this is an impossible task to avoid. Fundamentally, we are flawed.<br><br>But...<br><br>We also change with time. Our stories and our words to describe our world change over time as well. This doesn&#039;t make them any less true and doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re corrupted. And I&#039;d ask you, why is it okay to look at Science as empirical and not religion.<br><br>Let&#039;s use evolution, as our example. How is the theory of evolution any different than the concept of our religion, our stories, our words, being passed down from generation to generation? They change slightly, yes, as we change and as our world changes around us. Does that make our stories and our words that we use to describe our world corrupt or any less true? In the same way that species and our DNA has had subtle changes through evolution, can not our ideas and our words have subtle changes and still contain the same core truths?","time":1490235433,"resto":117863708,"id":"+7SCkrbt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117871190,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)22:17:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117870528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117870528<\/a><br>As a Christian, it would be punishable by eternity in hell to unsuccessfully convert me to Christianity.

God is the Word. The Word is truth. <br><br>So, let me ask you, if you have a Son (you personally, I mean) and, as you raise him and start giving him advice and teach him how to be a man, are you going to lie to him?

Your usage will be monitored by machines and cut off when you reach the limit. These machines will be placed across residential areas and control the supply of resources.<br><br>These resources are delivered to households, but the limits apply to people, so a household with more than one person will have their limits increased to meet needs.<br><br>Most jobs will be done by machines, so human involvement in the workforce is minimal. For example, machines will grow and harvest crops and those crops will be processed and distributed to people. The people don&#039;t have to raise a finger. They can live their lives while the machines work and supply for them.<br><br>Schooling will begin at 6 and end at 14. You will learn: English, mathematics, how to operate machinery, science, health and nutrition (with farming), and our history. It will be entirely free but compulsory. Extended education can be obtained through private institutions that can demand payment.<br><br>You can still be hired by businesses for a salary. Any money you earn will not be taxed at all. It&#039;s yours. You can also make money from military and community service. Housing is cheap and will cost a 2 years salary. After you buy a house with the proper utensils (clothing, dishes, cutlery, washing machines, etc...) you can relax for the rest of your life, if you can live with the resource limits.<br><br>The population will be limited to 500,000 people, so urban expansion will not be an issue, neither will resource demand.<br><br>The country will be an isolated constitutional one-party state. Preferably an island.","filename":"1492612529762","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":235,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":235,"tim":1492709458335,"time":1492709458,"md5":"5nW\/zN9\/6ieh6UnDEUHGyg==","fsize":4914,"resto":0,"id":"3pKv8Ez+","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-country-for-the-people","country_name":"Australia","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122017895,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:34:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122017538\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122017538<\/a><br>You&#039;re free to do whatever the fuck I want.","time":1492709656,"resto":122017538,"id":"oZWBsISV","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122018050,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:35:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122017538\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122017538<\/a><br>How does your meme country address the race problem?","time":1492709750,"resto":122017538,"id":"8J4x\/qlh","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":122018672,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:41:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122018050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122018050<\/a><br>There is no race problem because no whining bitches are allowed inside","time":1492710105,"resto":122017538,"id":"T2k8XK3u","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122018712,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:42:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122018050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122018050<\/a><br>If it could come from a pre-existing country (say Australia), all races would be divided into seperate states.

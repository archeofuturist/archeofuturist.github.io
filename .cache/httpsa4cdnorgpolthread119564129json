I stopped after Equestria Girls came out since the fandom was going hyper autism but since the first I&#039;ve started watching the show again. It&#039;s comforting to say the least desu, it kinda helps me relax from all the blackpilling shit I see everyday (I live in a shitlib hotspot area). I&#039;m not into buying plushes or anything just like I was before, I&#039;ve learned to let this show help my life for the better, not consume my life.

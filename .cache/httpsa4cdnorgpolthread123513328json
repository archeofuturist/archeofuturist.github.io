Welcome to the New United States.<br>I hop on YouTube, there&#039;s a guy being harassed by TSA to give up his cash when he didn&#039;t do anything.<br>I go to the store, a mother of four is begging me for money to feed her children, and she appears legitimate. I cannot offer her money, as I&#039;m a broke joke as well.<br>I go to the pharmacy for my asthma meds, $500 or I can not pay and be a corpse in a few weeks time.<br>Everyone is scared of the government that doesn&#039;t represent them in any way. No one will do what needs to be done to make a difference.<br>The empire is crumbling, and we allowed it by looking the other way when the evil do&#039;ers gained power, and now they&#039;re fairly impossible to stop. I&#039;m at fault too.","filename":"1490469837216","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":777,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":189,"tim":1493580078970,"time":1493580078,"md5":"K+IrKikP4tcaV\/A8B7WmHw==","fsize":134641,"resto":0,"id":"pJVf1jew","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"land-of-the-terrified-and-poor-in-wealth-and","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

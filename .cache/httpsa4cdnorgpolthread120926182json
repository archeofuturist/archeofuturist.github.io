At the cocktail he had said people often remarked how prior to speaking his manner became harsher. I could certainly sense pressure\u2014the dark demonic force, the Vril\u2014building inside him. Jonathan\u2019s alter ego, Kratos, was taking over.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What followed has since become part of American nationalist folklore. Jonathan was introduced by Jared Taylor, who, unfamiliar with Jonathan\u2019s biography, had earlier approached him for details. Jared delivered his introduction in his characteristic genteel style. Jonathan waited by his side, looking grim, scorning eye contact. Jared\u2019s introduction done, Jonathan stepped in behind the podium. His manner was not only commanding, but impatient. He then did what no one had dared to do before: with contempt, he swept the microphone aside. He did not need it.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u2018I HAVE A VERY LOUD VOICE,\u2019 he barked, filling the ballroom.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jonathan then hit the ground running, fast and hard, and orated for an hour. The intensity was electrifying. Everyone was paralysed. Had anyone not been too transfixed to look, not turned into a salt statue, he would have found jaws all over the floor. It felt like history being made. And who can remember what he said? Few would be able to tell you today. Something about dispelling the cloud. It doesn\u2019t matter. It\u2019s the way he said it that counts. It\u2019s the energy he expelled, and what it did to the audience, that was important. From that alone everyone knew how they needed to feel, what had to be done, and, most importantly, that whatever it was that had to be done could and would be done, without half-measures or apology. Jonathan received a standing ovation. Applause went on and on, for centuries, and is still going. And he stood there, sphinx like, the Iron Man, as if nothing.<\/span>","filename":"walks towards you","ext":".gif","w":320,"h":242,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1492101220503,"time":1492101220,"md5":"z8DFcUSxaD8\/AF1+Rw8wDw==","fsize":2223160,"resto":120926182,"id":"NQbWlslL","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120928516,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:33:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Attach a Karen to your post please everyone","filename":"1486994543088","ext":".jpg","w":1096,"h":806,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1492101223177,"time":1492101223,"md5":"ZNnGqrflsam4NSw+Icg7yw==","fsize":93224,"resto":120926182,"id":"FG0c6Hed","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120928560,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:34:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Boris Johnson is absolutely right, don&#039;t accept Russia back in G7 until it starts export something other than the oil, it kills our economy and strengthens authoritarianism.","time":1492101244,"resto":120926182,"id":"EauX6FmO","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120928583,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:34:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120928428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120928428<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3rd<\/span>","filename":"Disgust","ext":".png","w":300,"h":319,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492101253175,"time":1492101253,"md5":"OUkm9z1dTsNQuTJQLYpcvQ==","fsize":155162,"resto":120926182,"id":"TW2qgthn","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120928607,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:34:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120928428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120928428<\/a><br>Well the MoD likes to waste money on tranny rights and drugs.","time":1492101267,"resto":120926182,"id":"o+Et9CVE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120928691,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:35:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120928248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120928248<\/a><br>BBC Agenda is absolutely right, you&#039;re a subhuman goy.","time":1492101310,"resto":120926182,"id":"EauX6FmO","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120928747,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:35:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/art<wbr>icle-4409038\/Coalition-kills-18-fri<wbr>endly-fighters-Syria-mistake.html","time":1492101339,"resto":120926182,"id":"o+Et9CVE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120928777,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:36:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_<wbr>of_countries_by_level_of_military_e<wbr>quipment<br><br>we&#039;re a bit shit","time":1492101361,"resto":120926182,"id":"FJ5xLxRs","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120928892,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:37:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120928428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120928428<\/a><br>America is the problem","filename":"1485903395169","ext":".jpg","w":539,"h":477,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1492101428339,"time":1492101428,"md5":"eN9iUdjyv\/d0D08WR0cgNg==","fsize":35122,"resto":120926182,"id":"jHEHMVrv","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120928934,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:37:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120928069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120928069<\/a><br>Why?<br>https:\/\/www.thejc.com\/this-national<wbr>-monument-will-fulfill-a-vital-educ<wbr>ational-role-1.434096","time":1492101445,"resto":120926182,"id":"3mzvrVdb","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120929063,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:38:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120928069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120928069<\/a><br>that well known British Holocaust.<br>why should we care about dead Germans and Poles? we don&#039;t any memorials for dead Armenians, Ukranians or Chinks who were also genocided","time":1492101520,"resto":120926182,"id":"5PN\/8ni8","country":"SG","country_name":"Singapore"},{"no":120929184,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:39:50","name":"Hull\/fag\/","filename":"3EF2E24E00000578-4379096-image-a-41_1491347373547","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":227,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":44,"tim":1492101590917,"time":1492101590,"md5":"0EPwi1tjCe2ErkAu9F1oog==","fsize":50951,"resto":120926182,"id":"pTbQMaBu","country":"GB","trip":"!!cPFjrjAdPLx","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120929257,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:40:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Canadians take the banter way too far<br><br>http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/2017\/03\/09\/w<wbr>orld\/robin-camp-rape-comments-judge<wbr>-resigns-trnd\/index.html","time":1492101626,"resto":120926182,"id":"7WmXcWIy","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120929288,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:40:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120928511\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120928511<\/a><br><br>this sounds amazing.

Old London town is seen to fillet up a curvature of day; desiring, as it did so, to release its temperature. Does one detect its needs? Certainly now, Basildon Lancaster --- that\u2019s me --- foundered on a new consciousness or deliverance, and this was irrespective of being rapt by lusts.

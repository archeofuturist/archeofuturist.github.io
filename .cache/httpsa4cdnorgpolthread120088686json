Because of Trump and the &#039;alt-right&#039;, the Republican party is destroying itself. Because of political correctness and Bernie being cheated of the nomination, the Democratic party is destroying itself. Because of this as well as other factors such as WikiLeaks and Snowden, people are waking up to the truth of the deep state, the globalists, and the military-industrial complex. The establishment is weakening.<br><br>Now is our chance to strike. We need to convince everyone that Republicans, Democrats, neocons, neolibs, Clinton, Bush, Trump, Obama, etc are all the same, by showing that they all support war in Syria, that they&#039;re all interventionist warmongers, that they all serve the same masters.<br><br>The reason is to turn everyone against both parties. The people in power keep people fighting each other in the two-party dichotomy, Republicans versus Democrats. This prevents people from fighting the real enemy. It keeps people complacent.<br><br>We have the power to meme the collapse of the Republican party, Democratic party, similar parties in other nations, and ultimately the globalist-zionist state.<br><br>We have to choose who our enemies are and who our allies are. No more infighting. Our allies are all who stand against our enemies. Libertarians, national socialists, \/pol\/acks, redditors, activists, anarchists, Anonymous, WikiLeaks, freedom of information activists, even some social justice activists. Everyone who wants to see the fall of the globalist state. We all must stand together and bring down our enemy. Unity is our greatest strength. Our unity will lead to the collapse of the globalist power structure.<br><br>Operation: Collapse initiated.","filename":"Operation Collapse","ext":".png","w":800,"h":510,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":159,"tim":1491627134432,"time":1491627134,"md5":"\/EHebVDySjZrk\/Kby2UWjw==","fsize":749545,"resto":0,"id":"nGOt8al3","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"operation-collapse","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":120088742,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)00:52:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"We start the same we we started with Trump: Make things go viral on the internet. Create meme images, hashtags, videos, and other forms of propaganda, and make them go viral. This is key in the modern age. We need to spread redpills about the corruption of the government, the deep state, the identical nature of neocons\/Republicans and neolibs\/Democrats, the Federal Reserve, the Rothschilds, and the military-industrial complex. We need to make people seek unity and put aside differences such as differing political views, we need to make people militant, we need to mentally and physically prepare people for global insurrection.<br>As our agenda is progressed, we need leaders to give inspirational speeches and rally people to our cause. We need to turn this into a global movement of freedom fighters.<br><br>We need a cult-like following and we need people to value unity above all else. We need everyone to stand together against our common enemy. I don&#039;t give a fuck if you&#039;re a libertarian and member of the Oath Keepers or a femmequeer glitterfairy ponykin SJW. All who stand against the globalists stand with us.<br>And that means we have to appeal to everyone. Libertarians, alt-right, SJWs, normal people, conspiracy theorists, Anonymous, and everyone else. Unity is our greatest strength. We have to unite with everyone who shares our goal. That means everyone who shares our enemy, because our goal is to destroy our enemy, the zionist-globalist state\/NWO.<br><br>The most important thing right now is unity. Unity with all who share our enemy. All who value freedom. All who fight for a better world. We don&#039;t have to agree on politics. We only have to all share a vision of a world free from the control of the zionists\/globalists\/NWO. Our enemy is strong because they keep us divided, they keep us fighting each other. United as one against our common enemy, we are unstoppable.","time":1491627161,"resto":120088686,"id":"nGOt8al3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120088846,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)00:53:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"We need to be uncompromising.

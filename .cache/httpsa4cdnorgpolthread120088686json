Because of Trump and the &#039;alt-right&#039;, the Republican party is destroying itself. Because of political correctness and Bernie being cheated of the nomination, the Democratic party is destroying itself. Because of this as well as other factors such as WikiLeaks and Snowden, people are waking up to the truth of the deep state, the globalists, and the military-industrial complex. The establishment is weakening.<br><br>Now is our chance to strike. We need to convince everyone that Republicans, Democrats, neocons, neolibs, Clinton, Bush, Trump, Obama, etc are all the same, by showing that they all support war in Syria, that they&#039;re all interventionist warmongers, that they all serve the same masters.<br><br>The reason is to turn everyone against both parties. The people in power keep people fighting each other in the two-party dichotomy, Republicans versus Democrats. This prevents people from fighting the real enemy. It keeps people complacent.<br><br>We have the power to meme the collapse of the Republican party, Democratic party, similar parties in other nations, and ultimately the globalist-zionist state.<br><br>We have to choose who our enemies are and who our allies are. No more infighting. Our allies are all who stand against our enemies. Libertarians, national socialists, \/pol\/acks, redditors, activists, anarchists, Anonymous, WikiLeaks, freedom of information activists, even some social justice activists.

This never happened. Dulles and the CIA told Kennedy this to mislead him into a position where he would have been forced to militarily intervene after the initial invasion. Kennedy refused to do so after being lied too, and it was after the invasion that Kennedy told Arthur Schlesinger (Special Assistant to Kennedy) that he wanted to &quot;splinter the CIA into a thousand pieces and scatter it to the winds.&quot;<br> <br>The Bay of Pigs provoked the installation of Soviet Missiles as Castro needed a way to deter further US invasion. Once the CIA found out about the missiles from U2 spy images, Kennedy&#039;s defense advisors, chief of staff, and the CIA all told him to attack the missiles and to invade the island, despite their knowledge of 40k+ Soviet soldiers being on the island. Kennedy ignored all of them and negotiated with Khrushchev to have the missiles withdrawn from Cuba as we withdraw missiles in Turkey. <br><br>By this time, the (((defense establishment))) deeply despised Kennedy, and it was with Kennedy&#039;s American University &quot;Peace Speech&quot; that they decided to sign his death warrant. Kennedys speech called for a reexamination of how we viewed the Cold War and how to relate with the Soviet Union. Kennedy also rejected Pax Americana as a military means to enforce &quot;peace&quot; on the Earth through force. He also called for wide multilateral disarmament (which he would worked towards with the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty) between the US, the Soviet Union and other world powers. <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5oo<wbr>tEGoVKy4","filename":"jfk cia","ext":".jpg","w":767,"h":431,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491633446832,"time":1491633446,"md5":"QbJwHnArp6rgIwq04Sr6eg==","fsize":35396,"resto":120088686,"id":"AciCb0YG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120099633,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:37:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120099225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120099225<\/a><br>Is that the gif that killed Kurt Eichenwald?","time":1491633463,"resto":120088686,"id":"9iJekn9l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120099835,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:39:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120099633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120099633<\/a><br>probably dude. that was intense.

He made it his goal to prevent any further kind of escalation and to reduce nuclear arms before they wiped out humanity.

All they needed was a patsy, which enters Oswald. <br><br>What needs to be said about Oswald is the fact during his time in the marines he was a radar operator at a CIA base in Japan that they flew U2&#039;s out of. He had an above top secret Crypto clearance. He knew all about their radar capabilities and the U2&#039;s capabilities. It should come as major a surprise to everyone then when he defected to the Soviet Union in 1959 and was able to return a year later, even after renouncing his citizenship and telling the US embassy in Moscow that he was going to pass over state secrets. Should be noted, when he returned, the State Department gave him a loan, instead of arresting him for treason.<br><br>What should be brought up is that in 1959 the Office of Naval Intelligence started a spying program to place 30 or so men into the Soviet Union to gather intelligence. Oswald of a CIA-ONI connected spy and was not a Marxist according to Judge Botelho, Oswald&#039;s former friend and roommate at Santa Ana Marine military base where he was also a radar operator after his service in Japan.<br><br>Once Oswald came back to the United States, he was kept in contact with CIA middle-men, one being George De Mohrenschildt, who at one point convinced Oswald to move to Dallas and quickly got him a job at a DoD connected graphic arts company, which help with U2 imaginary\/photography logistics. When Mohrehschildt confessed to this in an interview in 1977, he went home and suddenly &quot;committed suicide.&quot; <br><br>When put all together, the Military Industrial Complex not just wanted Kennedy out, they needed him out. Killing him was not an issue with them.

To top it all off, Syrians entered Lebanon at the invitation of the Phalangists, and the Phalangists tooks Israels side against their own people later on all the way until 2000, then were left off the hook and not punished post-Israeli withdrawal.

It was only because Omar was naive that he let the Persian language survive.

Tell me if you are one of those Iranians who say Iranians love america and the west, in what logical world would a group of people like the western governments who destroy their economy, and threaten to attack their country? The anniversary of the Islamic Revolution this year had record turnout. I will admit it Trump&#039;s rhetoric and threats probably played a role in that, but it clearly contradicts the view that Iranians hate their government.<br>As for why we fund Arab militias and help Arab countries is because we are hospitable people who care about our fellow muslim brothers and look out for their safety and will protect them from Israel, KSA, and the west.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why do we need to help them? Why can&#039;t the government look to it&#039;s own people first?<\/span><br>Because they are fellow muslims, and the Islamic Republic is meant to serve all muslims, not just Iranians.

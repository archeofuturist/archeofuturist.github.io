So if we are to view Simon Peter as the &#039;rock&#039; that the church was founded on, he founded both east (Antioch, who&#039;s title is Patriach of Antioch and All East), and west (Rome, who until Benedict XVI, held the title Patriarch of Rome, and all West), thus dismissing the primacy of one over the other, as they were founded by the same person. In context of the time, the Pope grabbed more power, and made his doctrines unquestioned in the west, because the east was dismissed. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thats kind of the point Im trying to help lead people towards.

Find a flaw<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to distributists, property ownership is a fundamental right,[12] and the means of production should be spread as widely as possible, rather than being centralized under the control of the state (state socialism), a few individuals (plutocracy), or corporations (corporatocracy). Distributism, therefore, advocates a society marked by widespread property ownership.[13] Co-operative economist Race Mathews argues that such a system is key to bringing about a just social order.[14]<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Distributism has often been described in opposition to both socialism and capitalism,[15][16] which distributists see as equally flawed and exploitive.[17] Thomas Storck argues: &quot;both socialism and capitalism are products of the European Enlightenment and are thus modernizing and anti-traditional forces. Further, some distributists argue that socialism is the logical conclusion of capitalism as capitalism&#039;s concentrated powers eventually capture the state, resulting in a form of socialism.[18][19] In contrast, distributism seeks to subordinate economic activity to human life as a whole, to our spiritual life, our intellectual life, our family life&quot;.[20]<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Distr<wbr>ibutism","filename":"pic_giant_082314_Hilaire-Belloc_920","ext":".jpg","w":920,"h":537,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":72,"tim":1491666276901,"time":1491666276,"md5":"yvCuvvYdi9ua4RHWJwzNgQ==","fsize":51332,"resto":120130424,"id":"oqcnIZrv","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

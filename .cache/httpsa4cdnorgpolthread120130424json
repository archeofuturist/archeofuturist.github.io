The Church has intense measures to detect and apprehend pedophiles at all levels of the Church. After vatican 2 and the modernist chaos thousands of homosexuals infiltrated the Church. Most of the &#039;pedophiles&#039; were actually just homosexuals (though it&#039;s still horrible). Before you can even enter seminary nowadays you need to undergo extensive psychological evaluations and if you have the slightest hint of pedophilia you&#039;re banned full stop. Homosexuals can sometimes still go through but the process takes far longer and they&#039;re watched very closely.

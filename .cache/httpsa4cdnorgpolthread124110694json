They seem to have border security completely figured out.<br> First pic is the Bush border &quot;fence&quot; in Arizona. What do you think? Is it actually effective where it exists at? or is there a flaw in its design? If we have to go with this design for the WALL I would like to see some razor wire rolls along the top and even wrapping around each beam of the fencing.<br><br>But theres something I like a lot more.","filename":"Border_wall-AZ","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":399,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493932152281,"time":1493932152,"md5":"waBRymgzbFdB4IFXnlUJeA==","fsize":76781,"resto":0,"id":"zbRVdb4f","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-do-we-want-the-wall-when-do-we-want-it-now","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":3,"unique_ips":1},{"no":124110894,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)17:10:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"THIS bad boy right here.

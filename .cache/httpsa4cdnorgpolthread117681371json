If they start full blown political censorship they will only shoot themselves in the foot.<br><br>But it&#039;s clear this is coming. Like &quot;Fake News&quot; we&#039;re seeing them test the cultural waters with a few articles. Vice just ran one stating that youtube was dominated by &quot;Far Right&quot; vloggers and that it needed to &quot;do something&quot; to &quot;empower&quot; the &quot;disenfranchised and marginalized&quot; while pretending that youtube was not doing enough to promote Left Wing views and empowering Hate Speech.","time":1490138798,"resto":117681371,"id":"+K\/v4lgc","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117686728,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:26:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117685955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117685955<\/a><br>Seeing who&#039;s been naughty or nice Goyim.","time":1490138815,"resto":117681371,"id":"yMrDbNvX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117686826,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:27:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117684469\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117684469<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;demonetize their channels and begin crowdfunding instead.<\/span><br>You think Google won&#039;t swoop on that as well?

They have to boil the frog.<br><br>- First, in conjunction with &quot;pressure&quot; from large companies, Google begin to squeeze back on the ad revenue.<br>- Next, in partnership with Patreon and others, they work to curb the traffic being directed to &quot;extremeist&quot; channels for profit.<br>- They intermittently ban, de-subscribe, or lock down any leaders of the pack trying to find ways around.<br>- There is a new system of soft shadow bans, where channels simply don&#039;t come up naturally on recommended videos, or google searches.<br><br>The goal will not be to ban outright. It will be to algorithmically and economically contain. Why pay for a police crackdown when you can move everyone involved to the figurative digital Shetland Islands? Transport them digitally to the e-Australian penal colonies. Etc. Google is not just going to sit around and allow alternative media of any kind to grow and threaten the cozy deal they and the other global multinationals have carved out for themselves. They&#039;re working on putting this genie back in the bottle as we speak. So are Facebook and the rest.

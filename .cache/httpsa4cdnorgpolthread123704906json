I&#039;m at uni now not too far away, in Louisiana: fewer black people but the same climate mostly. I used to be a librul but I smartened the fuck up when I found \/b\/ 4 years ago and \/pol\/ soon after, and I&#039;ve been here ever since. I&#039;ve absorbed all of the arguments you guys throw out about socialism and guns and shit, but I&#039;ve never used them before: I&#039;ve never engaged a socialist yank, until today.<br>It was a dude I&#039;ve seen every so often on campus the whole time I&#039;ve studied here. Slightly above-average sized skater dude type guy.<br>The only reason I met him was because he came to &quot;help&quot; a freshman engineering major with his robot code, but she left as he arrived so those of us left started talking to him.<br>Right off the bat he sarcastically casually dissed every idea we discussed. Just just with him but those discussed just in his general presence. This inevitably led to political argumentation. Slowly everyone but me left (except for a black dude doing his own thing) so I was the only one to keep this going.<br><br>I really felt like I lost.<br>We only argued for another 10 minutes or so, and it didn&#039;t get heated, but that&#039;s because<br>1.) I couldn&#039;t find my counterarguments that you guys seem to be able to pull from a desk drawer at moment&#039;s notice (figuratively)<br>2.) I was really hesitant to use a lot of the arguments I did remember, basic shit like free speech and fuck socialism, because I really felt the need to avoid a high-decibel confrontation.<br><br>I&#039;m a fucking pussy guys but because of the circumstances under which I met this guy, we will probably argue again eventually.<br><br>What do you guys do? What can I do to BTFO him casually without inciting someone to raise their voice? How can I remember the arguments better?<br><br>I&#039;m still fairly close to the river and right next to the dime-a-dozen shithole of Monroe, meaning I&#039;m still surrounded by blacks. Got to stay away from the racial stuff.","filename":"images","ext":".jpg","w":227,"h":222,"tn_w":227,"tn_h":222,"tim":1493688379563,"time":1493688379,"md5":"+j\/RwbPvCxo9MAD9mIytOg==","fsize":11116,"resto":0,"id":"L0rywci1","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-i-need-advice","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

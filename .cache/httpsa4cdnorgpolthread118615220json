If this resolution passes the House of Representatives and Trump doesn&#039;t veto, that will no longer be necessary. Your information will be sold, your browsing history will be tracked, and if we don&#039;t stop this here, it will be restricted. <br><br>We all know the average idiot doesn&#039;t really understand how bad this can be, but everyone here knows the importance of anonymity. Forget what your political affiliations are, we all agree that this much government intervention is too much. It WILL get out of hand quickly.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But I use TOR\/VPNs!<\/span><br><br>How long before VPNs become restricted as well? You can say what you want about TOR but that doesn&#039;t change the fact that this sets a precedent.

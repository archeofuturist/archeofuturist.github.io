This 28 yo veteran who is described as being raised in a churchgoing, liberal household kills a 66 yo nigger, with a sword? And then completely fessed up to it, lays out all his plans and intentions in broad daylight? Something doesn&#039;t smell right here. <br><br>Why would you target an elderly man, and with a sword? &quot;A practice run&quot; as the murderer called it seems so ridiculous, it&#039;s like when you can tell someone is lying when they add a bunch of convoluted, unnessecary details. It feels manufactured. <br><br>Why use a sword? Why not a silenced gun? I guess so it couldn&#039;t be traced? But then why not a knife in a dark alley way? It seems like the target and the weapon were chosen so that a minimum amount of damage could be dealt to someone who was already old and could be a justified death, if one were justifying deaths in a false flag attack. The whole incident sticks. <br><br>What do you guys think? Am I being a retard, seeing things that aren&#039;t there, or is there something more to this?","filename":"stab","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":498,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490638956502,"time":1490638956,"md5":"SCY0Z84rAOZjOteAEnRXWw==","fsize":31449,"resto":0,"id":"VWnDxxA3","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"does-anyone-else-find-the-story-attaches-to-pic","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118541471,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)14:24:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1490639068,"resto":118541225,"id":"VWnDxxA3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118541670,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)14:26:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Buried by shills","time":1490639160,"resto":118541225,"id":"VWnDxxA3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118541969,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)14:28:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"link?","time":1490639296,"resto":118541225,"id":"y5WZ6m9r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118542012,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)14:28:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"And to top that off, his lawyer does seem to care that he&#039;s confessed so profusely, his lawyer was only interested in getting the murderer off on account of psychological problems.

Everyone knows there is corruption in Russia at every level of government. <br><br>Sledkom does do its job and puts the people commiting corruption on a &#039;small&#039; level in prison or gives them fines. The only way to defeat corruption in Russia is to put the oligarchs and other rich and powerful people into prison. Sledkom can&#039;t do that. Why? Because those powerful people have so much power they can destroy anyone in sledkom who tries. The only one who can go after corruption at that level is Putin. And he tries. But he can&#039;t just go stepping on people&#039;s toes or risk bloody revolution and instability. So he negotiated with them instead. Corruption will resolve with time as long as the country remains stable and tries to change the mindset of children to engage in less corruption when they grow up. Anyone who does propaganda knows that in order to change public opinion\/culture you must first change how kids think.

India is not next to US and you have to buy a plane ticket to US. This serves as a big filter to poor and stupid people just walking over the border. A plane ticket from india is about $1200 more than what most of the population makes in a year.<br>2. People who can afford plane tickets come from super affluent families. WHich means better schools and more connections.<br>3. US immigration code filters on criminals, stupid people, sick people, and poor people. <br>4. Most Indians who come here know that the only way they can come is through work visas<br>5. Indians aren&#039;t the most attractive people in the world - so they don&#039;t usually come as American brides. Thus at a young age they have to go to college and pick careers that US wants.<br>6. Affluent families are really good with money and don&#039;t over spend. Sure some will buy Mercedes, but keep in mind those can probably afford a Lamborghini. Those who buy a Honda could probably afford Mercedes.<br>7. Compare work visa immigrants to refugees. Refugees need only claim political oppression. India is an ally of US so NO refugee status.<br>8. Strong family structure - they will pool money to get people over here.<br>9. They don&#039;t have as many gangsters smuggling them in shipping containers - this is why chinese aren&#039;t the richest because of all the illegal chinese which came in containers via shipping routes.<br>10.

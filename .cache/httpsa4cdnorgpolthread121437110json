Just yesterday i had was opening up the hx on this hispanic chick and it crashed he computer. When i was finally able to see it, she had come to the ER over 700 times over 5 years. Thats over a couple million in fees., that she neverpaid. Also, theres the mentally ill that come in almost everyday for nothing, and medicaid covers it, but they only pay like 10% of the bill and like 2 years late. The ER is the least profitable unit in a hospital. I hate working in a sanctuary city. Idk a single Dr. or nurse here that isnt redpilled.

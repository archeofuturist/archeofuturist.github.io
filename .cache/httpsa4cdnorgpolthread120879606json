You can&#039;t just ignore it nor simply shout things like &quot;fallacy fallacy!&quot; when someone calls you out on a fallacy. If your thinking and your argument are fallacious, your argument is simply invalid. That means your conclusion does not follow from your premises. &quot;b-but you haven&#039;t proved me wrong,&quot; isn&#039;t a valid argument either and is only an attempt to shift burden of proof. A fallacy fallacy is also only committed when it&#039;s concluded that the conclusion of an argument is false just because the argument is invalid, which is fallacious. Obviously, the conclusion can still be right by accident. One does not commit a fallacy fallacy simply by citing how your argument is fallacious. Fallacies are not simply meaningless words you can nullify with some canned, banal comeback, like &quot;not an argument.&quot;<br><br>This shit is important for the conception of rational thought, and without it, you&#039;re all just a bunch of babbling idiots.","filename":"d0810c8d3a052045dfa55f5e7776822a[1]","ext":".png","w":3820,"h":2436,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":159,"tim":1492065874156,"time":1492065874,"md5":"0IEMjToFIEXfpV9ed3aCKg==","fsize":815218,"resto":0,"id":"MfEcK8ML","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-people-need-to-learn-to-recognize-fallacies","country_name":"United States","replies":93,"images":19,"unique_ips":43},{"no":120879862,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)02:47:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fuck off, Marx was wrong, get over it.","time":1492066040,"resto":120879606,"id":"wrJQiJvT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120879971,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)02:48:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120879606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120879606<\/a><br>All logic is circular.<br><br>Fallacy does not make argument moot, its a fallacy on itself to think they tackle an argument.","filename":"1491784290950","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1893,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492066106240,"time":1492066106,"md5":"jeOeU+mNhcjM6n5p2W5ybQ==","fsize":766486,"resto":120879606,"id":"3jmi8GeD","country":"FI","m_img":1,"country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120879996,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)02:48:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120879606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120879606<\/a><br><br>No-one cares what you think faggot","time":1492066122,"resto":120879606,"id":"XjZj31Or","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120880004,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)02:48:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120879862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120879862<\/a><br>no u deal with it and get over it.

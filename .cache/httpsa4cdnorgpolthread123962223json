History doesn&#039;t remember the brilliant mix-up that gets beaten by an autocorrect wake-up shoryuken. The superior strategy is the one that wins, and sometimes the superior strategy is subverting your opponent with seemingly inferior strategy. The superior strategist defeats an inferior strategy by &quot;respecting stupid&quot; (as they say in the fighting game community) and addressing it. Hillary couldn&#039;t do that, she spent her whole life dealing with superior strategy and naively assumed stupidity wasn&#039;t in play. Trump&#039;s inferior strategy was superior, whether that be through earnest buffoonery or playing to the gallery. Trump won and he spent MUCH less money doing it. That makes his campaign superior. Hillary can put her &quot;superior strategy&quot; participation award on her mantle if she feels like, but it didn&#039;t win her the Presidency.","filename":"1481812321027","ext":".jpg","w":845,"h":1112,"tn_w":94,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493846743841,"time":1493846743,"md5":"OdwuXn4aCJHBSchEiAyTQw==","fsize":174381,"resto":123962223,"id":"sjTvbTtp","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123966908,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:25:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Calling potential voters deplorable is pure genius.","time":1493846748,"resto":123962223,"id":"XsPn\/fw7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123967020,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:26:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Consultants who get paid millions have stated Clinton ran a better campaign by paying consultants whereas Trump didnt waste money err I mean spend very wisely and get a huge return on his investment by hiring consultants.","time":1493846795,"resto":123962223,"id":"1VW4OKiR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123967145,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:27:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123962223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123962223<\/a>","filename":"IMG_3671","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":336,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1493846857003,"time":1493846857,"md5":"GVJm4sjEcv\/UVK6cp\/zZFQ==","fsize":33838,"resto":123962223,"id":"W0q6QhKa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123967153,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:27:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123962223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123962223<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Silk was quick to acknowledge that Trump\u2019s campaign failed by most metrics that have been used to judge political campaigns<\/span><br><br>How about winning","time":1493846860,"resto":123962223,"id":"lS7sHt1p","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123967216,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:28:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123962223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123962223<\/a><br>The media did it all for her and they FAILED.","time":1493846891,"resto":123962223,"id":"TB69jwuG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123967315,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:29:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123962223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123962223<\/a><br><br>I&#039;ve had it with Trump, I&#039;m a #Cruzmissle now!","filename":"ted-cruz-ap","ext":".jpg","w":368,"h":512,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493846941817,"time":1493846941,"md5":"nha1LoTwl9QK\/9D+IPiWCQ==","fsize":29777,"resto":123962223,"id":"3hUzvGtU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123967352,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:29:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123962223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123962223<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;superior campaign<\/span>","filename":"no","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":269,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":112,"tim":1493846955889,"time":1493846955,"md5":"zkWs1agpcuOXHm8iZG9ElQ==","fsize":27892,"resto":123962223,"id":"3FBtyYdr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123967367,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:29:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123965438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123965438<\/a><br>lol nice damage control you little dick trumplet virgin, but you&#039;re the one who doesn&#039;t know how to troll and is getting mad right now because we know how thin skinned your little orange oompa loompa fake Russian president is I bet you jerk off to anime all day you little virgin lol","filename":"1485507704697","ext":".jpg","w":583,"h":490,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":105,"tim":1493846962496,"time":1493846962,"md5":"DraDrl6yRnrroImkX5wIsQ==","fsize":37600,"resto":123962223,"id":"l70Sy0vH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123967384,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:29:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123962223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123962223<\/a><br>This is so pathetic its embarrasing.<br>Trump won<br>Get over it","time":1493846971,"resto":123962223,"id":"crA5p3zQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123967533,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)17:30:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123966895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123966895<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The best swordsman in the world doesn&#039;t need to fear the second best swordsman in the world<\/span><br>He should.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the person for him to be afraid of is some ignorant antagonist who has never had a sword in his hand before<\/span><br>Wrong.

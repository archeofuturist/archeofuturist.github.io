Diese werden zuerst get\u00f6tet. Diese nat\u00fcrliche Selektion dient der ganzen Herde, weil durch diese regelm\u00e4\u00dfige Auslese der schw\u00e4chsten Mitglieder die Schnelligkeit und Gesundheit der Gemeinschaft erhalten oder sogar verbessert wird. Ganz \u00e4hnlich kann das menschliche Gehirn nur so schnell arbeiten wie die langsamsten Zellen die elektrischen Signale passieren lassen. Neueste epidemiologische Studien haben gezeigt, dass durch \u00fcberm\u00e4\u00dfigen Alkoholkonsum zwar Hirnzellen abget\u00f6tet werden, dabei aber die langsamsten und schw\u00e4chsten Zellen zuerst angegriffen werden.Regelm\u00e4\u00dfiger Alkoholkonsum hilft also schwache Hirnzellen zu eliminieren und macht das Hirn zu einer immer schnelleren und effizienteren Maschine. Die Resultate dieser umfangreichen Studie best\u00e4tigen und bekr\u00e4ftigen den urs\u00e4chlichen Zusammenhang zwischen Wochenendpartys und beruflichen Leistungen.

But (((some people))) don&#039;t have an interest in paying adequate wages. They want their labor as cheap as possible. This is why they a) outsource it and b) shill for getting low wage workforce into the country.<br><br>These people happen to have the money to buy politicians and the media. They are actively brainwashing the people of Europe (especially since the second world war) and pushing their agenda.<br><br>The action we should take is not doing the USP job for a low wage but rather take power away from government so that the corruption can&#039;t take place.","time":1492952942,"resto":122411096,"id":"kSHEVNXu","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122421940,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)09:11:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122411096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122411096<\/a><br>we are facing the upcoming automation from AI, so the last thing we need is people for manual labor that will not be employed","time":1492953078,"resto":122411096,"id":"l5hkyHI5","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122422055,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)09:12:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122420573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122420573<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122420865\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122420865<\/a><br><br>You two are completely right. My support for it is conditional based upon national self-interest. It&#039;s the fish and child again. We&#039;ve got ourselves into a situation where we don&#039;t make enough of our own doctors. Every effort should be made to correct this, the issue is what to do in the meantime; either suffer without enough skilled workers for important postions or fuck over another country in your own self-interest. In this case, I err on the side of stealing the fish from another kid to feed my own until I get my hands on a fishing rod. Naturally, I cannot fault any nation for doing the same to us, or for making every effort to prevent us from poaching their people. It is my hope that this situation is rectified as soon as possible.","time":1492953159,"resto":122411096,"id":"bpHuIfq8","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122422069,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)09:12:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122421687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122421687<\/a><br>Or raise and enforce minimum wage?","time":1492953169,"resto":122411096,"id":"wCijb3lH","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122422117,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)09:13:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122419502\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122419502<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but you guys had a choice.<\/span><br><br>Kill yourself.

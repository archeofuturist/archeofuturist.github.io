My parents agree with most of my political views, I have one male friend who isn&#039;t a completely indoctrinated political leftist... and that&#039;s about it. I&#039;m running out of friends and social circles.<br><br>My girlfriend of several years was recently horrified when I leveled with her about how I thought that Islam was an inherently toxic ideology, how the womens&#039; marches following Trump&#039;s inauguration were nonsensical and in some instances morally bankrupt. She tried for two hours to make me admit that blacks in America commit more crimes because of slavery, and for no other reason.<br><br>Is there a way to gently redpill? Is there any kind of well-tested entry-level material that can set people on the path of objectivity rather than lefty indoctrination? I just would like to be able to get the wheels in my friends&#039; heads turning without completely ostracizing myself. I never drop any information I consider particularly controversial, but it always seems like it&#039;s too much for people to handle, even in the most private of settings.<br><br>pic unrelated","filename":"100476","ext":".jpg","w":1500,"h":1600,"tn_w":234,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493181975135,"time":1493181975,"md5":"hKnbhv5DmuaVppCocIim4Q==","fsize":835558,"resto":0,"id":"pP9pgshx","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gentle-redpills","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122844532,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)00:47:51","name":"New Rhodesia (Allies: Kingitata o Toastie)","com":"<a href=\"#p122844381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122844381<\/a><br>Tell her that since no US whites alive ever owned slaves, that that&#039;s not an excuse","time":1493182071,"resto":122844381,"id":"BQOMukur","country":"US","trip":"!!d5dTtzVXtem","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122845282,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)00:55:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122844532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122844532<\/a><br>You know well that that isn&#039;t going to solve her malfunction.

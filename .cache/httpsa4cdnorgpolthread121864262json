Bathroom law is stupid to me. Use the bathroom that people will realistically think you need to use. If you look like a man in a wig, don&#039;t use the women&#039;s bathroom.

You&#039;ll just use the bathroom and leave. If a woman is uncomfortable when a bearded caveman in a dress comes into the women&#039;s bathroom, that is perfectly understandable.

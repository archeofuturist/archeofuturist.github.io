How can a man be so entirely and utterly devoid of inner fire that they would not fight for their own kind? How can a Father cower in fear while his son is tortured to death in the same fucking room? Where is the fighting spirit in these moments? I will never lay my life down like this so easily, especially not when the lives of my loved ones are on the line. How a man can hear the agonizing screams of his wife and children being mutilated, and not be filled with such blinding blood lusting rage baffles the everloving shit out of me. I pray to God every day that if this happens to me, that I will have the courage to die with honor and fight.<br><br>It is always better to fight and die with honor than to live (or die) a coward. Western men need their god damn balls back. We have no warrior spirit anymore, I don&#039;t give a shit what killed it. I&#039;d hope you faggots would have enough gumption to die with honor if this ever happened to you.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic related<\/span><br>Look at every man it that photo, how many of them fought for their lives \/pol\/? How many of them defended their loved ones? Yes, the other thread got me triggered as hell. I would fight tooth and fucking nail until someone had to put me down before I passively let this shit happen.","filename":"2E7E985400000578-3332140-image-a-3_1448383444340","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":423,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492472646678,"time":1492472646,"md5":"Z9mpRpf3c3ZefLonrHgLiw==","fsize":113368,"resto":0,"id":"x39+Jgym","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"men-of-the-west","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":121603566,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:44:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sons of Gondor! Of Rohan! My brothers! I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me! A day may come when the courage of men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship.

By all that you hold dear on this good Earth, I bid you stand! Men of the West!<\/span><br><br>Ask yourself now \/pol\/, will you be ready if you find yourself in a situation like these men did? Make the decision now. will you fight?

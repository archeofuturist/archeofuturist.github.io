It is a losing paradigm, and the evidence is all around us. Capitalism could have worked relatively long term if humans were careful about how we controlled our population, we haven&#039;t, so currently our species is in a massive population overshoot. People just keep shitting out kids without a care in the world.<br><br>With declining EROI on fossil fuels every single year, it&#039;s not difficult to see where we are headed. Most living in America and western European nations are too ignorant and comfortable to see the big picture. Our ridiculous cozy lifestyles have a very real cost, it is a fact that not one corporation or company in the world would be profitable if it had to take into account the &#039;natural&#039; cost of extracting resources and then restoring the ecosystems which they destroyed to get those resources. In the business world it just written off as &#039;externalities&#039;, which is just a good way of saying that it is someone else&#039;s problem.

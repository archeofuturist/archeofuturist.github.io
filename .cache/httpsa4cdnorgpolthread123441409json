We\u2019re from 2 different worlds, yet it feels so perfect. She\u2019s smart, beautiful, and hurting more every day. She\u2019s lost, and I can find her. Ahhhh, ya\u2019ll are gonna think I\u2019m fooling, but you don\u2019t know me. The heart wants what the heart wants\u2026<br><br>Dear Huma,<br><br>You can do so much better. You may not know me, but I sure know you. Why do smart people like us always feel so stupid? You had a plan. On paper, who would argue? You\u2019re a beautiful woman, doe eyed and ready to taste the world. An untamed wild stallion\u2026.<br><br>You made all the right moves and became the assistant to the 1st lady. You married an up and coming politician who looked like the future of the party. You didn\u2019t take his last name (strong, feminist move\u2026 or hedging your bets?). He was Jewish, you a Muslim making you bit of an odd couple, but maybe if that stereotype breaking, odd couple can make it work, so could the world.<br><br>Sometimes life doesn\u2019t go the way we plan.<br><br>How were you to know it would come crashing down? Maybe after the 1st dick pic the public would forget. Then came another, and another it seemed. The name \u201cWiener\u201d became synonymous with\u2026 well, you know. Plus it turned out, Hillary didn\u2019t have a likable bone in her body. Who knew? (except everyone)<br><br>How were you to know some loud mouth billionaire would be more relatable than a former 1st lady? You tried to be strong, and you were, my brave little toaster, you really were. Underage girls? Messes you were cleaning up for your boss? FBI took the computer? I saw the picture of you crying from October, my little spoonful of coriander, and if I\u2019m to believe the rumors, you\u2019re trying to \u201cwork it out\u201d with Anthony Weiner?? How many times do you bet on the same losing horse before you shoot it??<br><br>Your way isn\u2019t working.","filename":"mylove","ext":".jpg","w":645,"h":363,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493530030849,"time":1493530030,"md5":"DLsa71fS+qfyFRT6y8MNRw==","fsize":77936,"resto":0,"id":"\/Cp4Fo+6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-love-her-guys-and-she-doesnt-even-know-i-exist","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":5,"unique_ips":6},{"no":123441553,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)01:28:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123441409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123441409<\/a><br>I\u2019m here for you. Now I\u2019m sure people on my side think I\u2019m sarcastic, and people on your side will dismiss me as a troll, but if this gets to you, I want to feel, whole heartedly, that it could be a world for just me and you. I\u2019m saying you have options. Hillary? Weiner? Stop! Not if papa bear has anything to say about it. There\u2019s another way for you, Huma; another way\u2026 for us.<br><br>I\u2019m 33 years old. I\u2019m a film director who\u2019s helps run Proud Boy Magazine. I have a lot of tattoos (some might say too many). I love music. I drive a Jeep Wrangler. My future isn\u2019t a black, endless void made of shit. On my down time I like to tend to a small vegetable garden behind my house and play hockey. My biggest short coming is my optimism gets in the way of my instincts. I\u2019m ambitious and patient. And as a lover, I\u2019m the devil himself. Really.<br><br>I\u2019d fuck the brown off your eyes, you little freak. (I know the freaks when I see them).<br><br>I\u2019ll fuck you till the room stinks.<br><br>I\u2019ll fuck you till you make cat noises.<br><br>I\u2019ll eat you\u2019re pussy like an angry scorpion.<br><br>We have our differences. I spent my life hanging out with punk rockers, right wingers, drug addictions, and loud mouths\u2026. and you\u2019ve spend you\u2019re life hanging out with human garbage. I\u2019m willing to overlook that\u2026 let\u2019s face it, I\u2019m overlooking a lot of things here, Queen Baggage. Take a page outta Sharia Law and have a little humility when reading this.<br><br>Is it really so ridiculous? What are you doing right now?

We can getting far better chicks than that 70 year old Real Estate lady. The things she makes you do. The outlandish unsubstantiated whispers she can only get off if you fart in each other mouths or whatever. Deplorable! No more! Not my Huma-nator.<br><br>Huma you are beautiful, ambitious, well intention, and now\u2026 completely attainable. You just fell in with a bad crowd. If nothing else, I hope I made you laugh, but I hope I planted some seeds. Hate me, judge me, argue with me, nothing I do can be worse than your reality and I can only make it better. Let\u2019s have one cup of coffee together. You\u2019ve been in the bubble for so long, why not have a friendly conversation with a strong masculine type, like myself. Maybe on the car ride over we can both think about, what you have left to offer\u2026 me.<br><br>We make rules for this topsy-turvey space ship we call life.

Can&#039;t remember their units, only actually worked with the Marines in the field but on base there was a distinct difference in attitude that I&#039;d hesitantly call &quot;professionalism&quot; that the Marines had that the Army didn&#039;t (I hesitate because that doesn&#039;t really seem like a good word for it, but I think you know what I mean when I say it). Even that&#039;s just half the story though, other half is the fact pretty much everyone I&#039;ve ever worked with who I&#039;ve spoken on the matter seems to hold the Marines in higher regard then the US Army.

Marines gave us Mattis, the Army is bogged down in retarded political bullshit.

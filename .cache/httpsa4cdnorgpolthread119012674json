Last I checked Hillary was exposed as a criminal and Russia is an ally. if Russians hacked into hillarys illegal private servers, why is it considered a bad thing? <br><br>I think it&#039;s likely that liberals are so used to getting participation awards that when the time came and trump won, they snapped and they can&#039;t handle losing. this obsession with Russia is an Alex jones level conspiracy theory. Russians aren&#039;t turning the frogs gay and they didn&#039;t have a NEGATIVE effect on the election.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490930468276,"time":1490930468,"md5":"n6qA5stRL4Lctnbvlbgq4g==","fsize":134080,"resto":0,"id":"oJt8WaZm","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-does-the-liberal-media-care-so-much-about-the","country_name":"United States","replies":20,"images":6,"unique_ips":11},{"no":119012846,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:22:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119012674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119012674<\/a><br>It would be extremely painful","time":1490930572,"resto":119012674,"id":"yLodx2\/t","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119013066,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:25:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119012674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119012674<\/a><br>(((They))) are trying to convince the people that Russia is the enemy.

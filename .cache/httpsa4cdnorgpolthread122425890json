I like to use specialty breads bought fresh in the morning along with thin slices of cheese. Thin slices melt more easily and you can layer them over top of things like chopped ham or garlic. Be sure to fry both sides to get the bread nice and golden buttery crisp all the way through and the hot bread helps the cheese melt when you flip it. My favorite is probably<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jalapeno cheddar bread<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pepper jack cheese<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;chopped bacon<\/span><br><br>I love this food because if you under or over cook it, it&#039;s still really good unless you WAY WAY over cook it. It&#039;s sort of a nice challenge to achieve that perfect level of burnt on the bread, getting just the right heat level so the cheese is melty enough to really stick together when you put the two pieces together on the plate. I also enjoy flipping the buttery slices and carefully layering the cheese and any fillings. Fun cooking helps you add more love to the food which in turn makes it more delicious.","filename":"20160127_131849","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492957961159,"time":1492957961,"md5":"xCByHAxuU79Slr5J523cIg==","fsize":216977,"resto":122425890,"id":"2GdQfTqU","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122430832,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)10:37:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122428947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122428947<\/a><br>Will there be tomato soup for dipping the grilled cheese sandwiches in?","time":1492958245,"resto":122425890,"id":"2GdQfTqU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122430864,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)10:37:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122430313\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122430313<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s sort of a nice challenge to achieve that perfect level of burnt on the bread, getting just the right heat level so the cheese is melty enough to really stick together when you put the two pieces together on the plate.<\/span><br><br><br>as cheesy as it sounds this is a good allegory for what we&#039;re tryna to do<br><br><br>Is ketchup plebe level?

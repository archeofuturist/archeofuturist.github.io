Twenty people died when a United States Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler aircraft, while flying below cables for the sole purpose of amusement, cut a cable supporting a gondola of an aerial tramway, causing it to plunge 80 m (260 ft) to the ground. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Joseph Schweitzer, one of the American aircrew, confessed in 2012 that upon return to the American base, he burned the tape that contained incriminating evidence. The pilot, Captain Richard J. Ashby, and his navigator, Captain Joseph Schweitzer, were put on trial in the United States and were found not guilty of involuntary manslaughter and negligent homicide. Later they were found guilty of obstruction of justice and conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman for having destroyed a videotape recorded from the plane and were dismissed from the Marine Corps. The disaster, and the subsequent acquittal of the pilots, strained relations between the United States and Italy.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/archive.fo\/4fkcQ<br><br>This incident alone should be enough justification to have all 50 American military bases closed in Italy, if not the remaining 250+ bases in the rest of Europe.","filename":"ph0y98ij","ext":".png","w":3076,"h":2309,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490626836614,"time":1490626836,"md5":"JDv3n1RUd6+8pIbhfPrz9w==","fsize":3852017,"resto":0,"id":"fKxuENjf","country":"NL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"remember-when-american-soldiers-accidentally","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118521033,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)11:09:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118520188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118520188<\/a><br>Bumpity bump.<br>The military industrial complex is real.","time":1490627361,"resto":118520188,"id":"zcSzi3h8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118521390,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)11:12:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118520188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118520188<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Argentina<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Brazil<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Chile<\/span><br><br>LOOOL C\u00dcCKS","time":1490627565,"resto":118520188,"id":"MPBptl5A","country":"UY","country_name":"Uruguay"}]}

Ultimately, the truth that works best for you is already in your head, so find what makes sense and follow it. <br>One of the main ideas that runs throughout all of the teachings is that you have direct access to the divine due to your own divine spark, so there isn&#039;t any reason to look further than your own thoughts. <br>You do have to be careful though, there are other things in you that are far from divine. Learning the difference between the forces that guide your thinking is the most important part of getting started. Think of it like the devil and angle on your shoulder. Discern which is which and you won&#039;t have too many problems.","time":1493320789,"resto":123069297,"id":"dFobGTFC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123074426,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)15:25:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123073393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123073393<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isn&#039;t this the gist of many so called self proclaimed gnostics today?<\/span><br>No.<br>None of what you said makes any sense.

George Gurdjieff&#039;s teachings (which as I understand a lot he picked up in his travels in Asia) also are very very close to the dogmatics of Christianity in my opinion.","filename":"1489700000452","ext":".jpg","w":683,"h":539,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":98,"tim":1493322244671,"time":1493322244,"md5":"\/9I9iv280DYnO\/EUUNXy3A==","fsize":71895,"resto":123069297,"id":"Zmbn6fN\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Ultimately, the truth that works best for you is already in your head, so find what makes sense and follow it. <br>One of the main ideas that runs throughout all of the teachings is that you have direct access to the divine due to your own divine spark, so there isn&#039;t any reason to look further than your own thoughts. <br>You do have to be careful though, there are other things in you that are far from divine. Learning the difference between the forces that guide your thinking is the most important part of getting started. Think of it like the devil and angle on your shoulder.

Thanks for clarifying. Anyway this reminds me of the story of Lucifer, you know being the highest and falling down and becoming the lowest, so as I found out (there are multiple correct levels of interpretation to this story I&#039;d say) Lucifer from one point of view represents\/symbolizes the Sun from dawn till the time of its setting, symbolizing (from this certain viewpoint which is I think is the whole point of the story) egoism, the feeling of pride and likewise chasing deceitful shadows (materialism) yet ultimately it all comes to an end, using biblical terminology it can be said it signifies the flesh, the flesh and the spirit are incompatible with each other, likewise I heard Sadhguru or was it Santos Bonacci mention the struggle of the higher self verses the lower self, and this type of teachings I assume is not new at all but very old, speaking of the east (India, etc) that is. Anyways I said that because the Sun symbolize Lucifer and both the OT God quite well from different viewpoints, and actually it can be said Lucifer indeed is the Sun.","time":1493326348,"resto":123069297,"id":"Zmbn6fN\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123086716,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)16:57:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123085143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123085143<\/a><br>Christianity has a tradition of natural theology.

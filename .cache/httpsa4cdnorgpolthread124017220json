You may want to do so and it&#039;s probably comforting, but wanting to believe something doesn&#039;t make it true. There is zero evidence for the existence of a god, and the formation of the earth and humanity can be explained without needing to invoke god (the only exception is the cause of the universe, but &quot;god did it&quot; doesn&#039;t work either as you run into the exact same problems). Better yet, god as presented by christians (omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good) cannot be reconciled with the fact that the world is full of evil. This god is not only not real because there is no proof, but is logically disproven as it yields a contradiction. Honestly, I find the fact that nothing I do will ever matter and that there is no cosmological voyeur watching my every move and judging me by a set of standards that even christians can&#039;t agree on to be relatively comforting. <br><br>Just accept that god doesn&#039;t exist and none of the religions are right.","time":1493876768,"resto":124017220,"id":"3jyTc8gG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124026473,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:48:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124025755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124025755<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/philosophy.stackexchange.c<wbr>om\/questions\/7899\/st-thomas-aquinas<wbr>-contingency-proof-for-the-existenc<wbr>e-of-god<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;everything has a beginning<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there must have been something without a beginning to begin it all<\/span><br>Yea I guess that&#039;s unrefuteable as long as you throw our your base assumption","time":1493876916,"resto":124017220,"id":"YWpNkIvN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124026522,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:49:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124025645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124025645<\/a><br>Illogical incoherent contrarian&#039;s lives maybe.","time":1493876953,"resto":124017220,"id":"WGvNc8jZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124026732,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:51:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124017220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124017220<\/a><br>You seek the law of one my brother.","time":1493877094,"resto":124017220,"id":"qTJfouQN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124026838,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:53:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124017220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124017220<\/a><br><br>Try Advaita Vedanta OP!!","time":1493877180,"resto":124017220,"id":"BfZYFNUT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124026953,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:54:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124026105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124026105<\/a><br>(((Hinduism))) (((Judaism)))","time":1493877264,"resto":124017220,"id":"g2vWHObI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124027173,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:56:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s a good thing that you want to change that&#039;s the first step to recognize who you are and what you are doing and you have done that and now you want to change your path and get on the correct one wonderful , you should regularly start going to a Catholic Church and ask the Father in the church to help you in understanding our ways and to help you find the right way , do not go to a Protestant church cuz its filled with lies and wrong teachings","time":1493877412,"resto":124017220,"id":"4aaSWBRa","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":124027244,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:57:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124026522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124026522<\/a><br><br>A simple perspective.","time":1493877460,"resto":124017220,"id":"JUOlEuEo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124027722,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:02:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124026091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124026091<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if you lookup on the compexity of the simplest cell.

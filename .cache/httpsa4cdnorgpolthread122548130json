I&#039;m no expert, I just find Kek to be an interesting topic that&#039;s unfortunately suffered at the hands of the Eternal Redditor, wandering across the internet in search of memes to endlessly regurgitate.<br><br>First I&#039;ll describe what Kek is. It&#039;s the male form of an androgynous part-frog and part-human deity, with a female form known as Keket. The two forms represent duality, as the male and female forms are opposites. As a whole, it represents darkness and chaos, but also the ushering in of the light at the end of the darkness.<br><br>That last bit is what ties Kek into Hindu mythology and Esoteric Hitlerism. While Adolf Hitler, the Man Against Time, was the penultimate incarnation of Vishnu, Kek is the final incarnation also known as the Kalki, who will bring about the end of the Kali Yuga or Dark Age and usher in the light. Because of its dualistic nature, it represents not only chaos, but also order. More specifically, it is order through chaos, creating a new order through the chaotic destruction of the old and corrupt.<br><br>tl;dr: Kek is Hitler born again and will descend from Heaven to bring truth and enlightenment.","filename":"1473823944565","ext":".gif","w":600,"h":1049,"tn_w":142,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493011729165,"time":1493011729,"md5":"Pu66Ve2\/IHRFa\/VkW0jBqg==","fsize":183684,"resto":0,"id":"wEr1y\/Nx","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"esoteric-kekism","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122549447,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)01:42:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; the ushering of light and the end of darkness<\/span><br><br>BRING IT ON","filename":"the final light","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":281,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493012574512,"time":1493012574,"md5":"AuIpom+DnYZgyUAL7E3t6g==","fsize":510900,"resto":122548130,"id":"4wnF9j4O","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"}]}

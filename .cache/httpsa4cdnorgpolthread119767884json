Their empire at it&#039;s peak was Spain and a bunch of American colonies that they took off jungle people with sharp rocks. I&#039;m not saying that the Spanish were bad, just that I feel Britain at it&#039;s military peak sneaks ahead of them. And I think it&#039;s a bit ignorant to limit military achievements to Europe, considering the scale of conflicts that European powers waged against each other in their colonies across the globe. Britain might not have ever singlehandedly won a ground war in Europe, but we certainly won against European powers in contest for control of other parts of the world.","time":1491515139,"resto":119767884,"id":"WWzs1nXY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119800243,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:46:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119768294\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119768294<\/a><br>dude i don&#039;t think your people will be willing to fight in a war.","time":1491515183,"resto":119767884,"id":"4zEmQoIG","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":119800385,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:47:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119768294\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119768294<\/a><br><br>top post.<br>keks were had<br>have a (you)","time":1491515253,"resto":119767884,"id":"7BhfaWv0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119800403,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:47:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119790175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119790175<\/a><br>This is why I refuse to buy a glock.","time":1491515261,"resto":119767884,"id":"jpORmQe9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119800439,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:47:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119767884\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119767884<\/a><br>DELET THIS","filename":"1490853647998","ext":".jpg","w":526,"h":526,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491515276157,"time":1491515276,"md5":"qBcNztxdSa4LcrnKQQSGKg==","fsize":13180,"resto":119767884,"id":"AfIJGLA2","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":119800442,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:47:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119770522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119770522<\/a><br>no my britainan friend you saved us<br><br>lots of time :3","time":1491515276,"resto":119767884,"id":"4zEmQoIG","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":119800526,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:48:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ottoman Empire was badass at one point, but their problem was the Janissaries became entrenched and government and went from an elite fighting force to a corrupt decadent aristocracy, and by WWI they were the sick man of Europe.<br><br>Ataturk tried to save the roaches but its looking like he failed.","time":1491515314,"resto":119767884,"id":"Yn6wlQev","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119800640,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:49:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119767884\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119767884<\/a><br>Sure, although I&#039;d argue we should get a special &quot;Eternal Tier&quot;","time":1491515368,"resto":119767884,"id":"X1YKJfp3","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119800751,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:50:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119767884\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119767884<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;germany<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;god tier<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;literally 0-2 in world wars<\/span><br><br>lmao","filename":"1434421520908","ext":".jpg","w":211,"h":212,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491515409698,"time":1491515409,"md5":"ALLZ8cH3xuzRLBFPtPEQaw==","fsize":11194,"resto":119767884,"id":"ul5ZevI2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119800767,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:50:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119768294\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119768294<\/a><br>Kek.

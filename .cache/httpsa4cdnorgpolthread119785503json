I also can&#039;t stand the drive by media all echoing &quot;Assad has systematically killed his own people for years&quot; without a shadow of a doubt like they have him on camera in a firing squad.<br><br>Now, that being said, <br><br>Has he historically been corrupt or a war criminal? (not a fake war criminal, like actual proof he&#039;s done wrong?)<br><br>Did he fight in any wars or battles before?<br><br>Any prior ties to known extremists?<br><br>I am torn on this, I hate feeling like trump is playing into their hands because I know he&#039;s not fucking retarded. But when children are dying and the circumstances are so bad (even though cnn can get in there for a child to facetime asking trump to help) what the FUCK is he supposed to do? It&#039;s not like other shit where he can act like its not a big deal, or fake news. Children were killed so he can&#039;t pivot from that, even if he knows it wasn&#039;t Assad","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491508638937,"time":1491508638,"md5":"xfPnkjWFv6teCn0a163Gpw==","fsize":86342,"resto":0,"id":"6iRL3Efq","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"does-anyone-have-history-about-assad","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119785662,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:58:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"read the wikipedia on him burger, he is defintely the last hope for syria.","time":1491508707,"resto":119785503,"id":"ob7XKbNF","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119785681,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:58:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119785503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119785503<\/a><br>Lol wrong maxresdefault.jpg","filename":"maxresdefault (1)","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491508715054,"time":1491508715,"md5":"OZYpc93SkB852O+uBbmLVQ==","fsize":270237,"resto":119785503,"id":"6iRL3Efq","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119785733,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:59:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119785503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119785503<\/a><br>lurk \/sg\/","time":1491508743,"resto":119785503,"id":"3ydT58MJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119785753,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:59:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119785503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119785503<\/a><br>he is just another corrupt shit head<br>yeah the media is lying, but thats what you have to do to get normies to support you<br>it does not change the fact hes a shit head that deserves to be removed","time":1491508749,"resto":119785503,"id":"m\/cuS9H2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

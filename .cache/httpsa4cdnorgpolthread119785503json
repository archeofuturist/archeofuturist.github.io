But when children are dying and the circumstances are so bad (even though cnn can get in there for a child to facetime asking trump to help) what the FUCK is he supposed to do? It&#039;s not like other shit where he can act like its not a big deal, or fake news.

Another anecdotal case (Both from NPR interviews, so this is not from pro-Assad shills) of his neighbor Saddam was the guy interviewing Saddam saying something like &quot;Saddam looked at me and told me &quot;You guys have lost.&quot; I thought it was ridiculous, I told him &quot;We have you imprisoned, your government is gone, how did we lose?&quot; and Saddam told him &quot;Running this country is a lot harder than you all think it will be.&quot;<br><br>Martin Friedman writing about the Mid-East wars of the 70s-80s and early 90s coined the &quot;Hama Rules&quot; maxim.

Hama rules does not just refer to being brutal to your civilians but rather to having no limits to your morality or strategy.

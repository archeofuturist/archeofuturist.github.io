Essentially we take the fact that the wsj employs fritz when he&#039;s a know white supremacist (or so they&#039;ll think). we could support this with the daily stormer article written about him and the tweets in which he&#039;s made. Then we could tie it back to the two writer that worked with him saying something like they knew that he&#039;s like this and their in support of him. Doing this we could build this idea of a group of white supremacist in the wsj. we vould have to find who ben fritz has collaborated with and who shown any support to him to add to this &quot;Group of white supremacist&quot;. something like that idk might be a small idea.","filename":"WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social","ext":".gif","w":977,"h":513,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":131,"tim":1491023178193,"time":1491023178,"md5":"bHVds+dKJj852qMXu+\/i8g==","fsize":12519,"resto":0,"id":"QH+oCyzA","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"anyone-up-for-knocking-these-guys-down-a-peg","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

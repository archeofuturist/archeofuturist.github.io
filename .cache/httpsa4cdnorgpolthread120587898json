We had opened Africa and kicked them out. Then we invaded fucking Italy.

It literally decided the biggest tank battle in history and gave that dumb fucker what he wanted, AND HE STILL BITCHED IT WASN&#039;T ENOUGH. So fuck it, we invaded Normandy too. And if the fucking Army had bothered to listen to the Marines on how to conduct an amphibious landing, it wouldn&#039;t have been as severe of a shit show. Either way, &quot;real combat troops&quot; were used on all fronts, the problem was there weren&#039;t enough. It&#039;s why the German 6th Army had Romanians, Hungarians, and Italians guarding it&#039;s flanks as opposed to Germans.

There is no way out of it. This has been a theological\/philosophical problem for millenia. Some anon on 4chan isn&#039;t goning to have a satisfactory answer. Calvinists abandoned libertarian free will for Compatibilist free will. Others opt for open theism. Everyone else just doesn&#039;t care enough about the problem to directly address it. <br><br>Free will is hard to reconcile with any idea of causation, or even lack thereof. It doesn&#039;t matter anyway though, I don&#039;t worry about it because subjectively we have free will. Color isn&#039;t &quot;real&quot; in the sense that it isn&#039;t a fundamental aspect of reality, it is an interpretation of the visual input we receive. Much the same, though free will may or may not be &quot;real,&quot; it is the interpretation of reality that our minds make for us. Asking if it is real is very similar to asking of consciousness is real. No one really knows, but it seems likely that qualia\/consciousness is real. Hard problem is some crazy stuff, it&#039;s what got me into Philosophy of science and phil. of mind. <br><br>No one really knows in the end, but the divine foreknowledge problem is a huge issue for theism. It also relates to the problem of evil, specifically with regard to natural evil. The only agent possibly responsible for natural evil is God, as God comes before all else, and made everything that exists except for himself. To have a coherent picture of God, I think you have to opt for open theism like Gregory Boyd&#039;s or a Neo-Calvinist view that God&#039;s plans are actually perfect (a more detailed version of Liebnez&#039;s theodicy).<br><br>Religion isn&#039;t meant to answer questions like this.

If there&#039;s no reward, you won&#039;t have risk. Why would you go out on a limb to start a new business if it wouldn&#039;t raise you above your current situation? Owning your own business requires a fucking TON of work. My dad worked like 14 hour days for the first 3 years and didn&#039;t even make a profit while he was getting started. Why would anyone do that for no material benefit? No new businesses means no new ideas, no new products, no new services. <br><br>I could start a business but I don&#039;t want to. I want to make a good but not large income and have less risk. That is a decision I have made.","time":1493097534,"resto":122691065,"id":"+VRJTTLs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122696856,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:19:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122696705\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122696705<\/a><br>Honestly i want fucking independence from canada. the biggest mistake in BC history was joining canada","time":1493097540,"resto":122691065,"id":"jdzvmlsA","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122696887,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:19:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122696712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122696712<\/a><br>It will be called Chexit","time":1493097557,"resto":122691065,"id":"fjwxECL2","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122696899,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:19:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122696098\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122696098<\/a><br>well that bit is true at least","time":1493097562,"resto":122691065,"id":"nCqDtzsW","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122697040,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:20:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"So I should spend all my money now while it&#039;s not AS worthless?","time":1493097647,"resto":122691065,"id":"6EKoxOq0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122697049,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:20:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122696607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122696607<\/a><br>those are all &quot;within&quot; the gta more or less.<br><br>anywhere within 30 min of downtown toronto is usually fine.<br><br>try places that are one to two hours away. guelph, sudbury, london, st catherines, milton, waterloo, cambridge, st thomas etc. fucking kill me.<br><br>when you live somewhere like newmarket or schomberg, you are living in an area that is large enough that you can hop to the next town and be in a completely different place.<br><br>when you live in a place like guelph, you are stuck in guelph unless you feel like driving aimlessly down the highway for an hour to the next shitty small town. you are stuck seeing the same people. no one comes in and out except shitty truckers. everything is isolated. if someone belligerent and horrible moves in, you can&#039;t just move away and still be in the same place.<br><br><a href=\"#p122696712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122696712<\/a><br>try extending the skytrain from BC to china, that&#039;s where you&#039;re headed anyway you cucks.","time":1493097652,"resto":122691065,"id":"I2tc+8Ld","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122697061,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:20:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 another Canadian thread where everyone ends up saying their province shouldn&#039;t ever have joined the union<\/span>","filename":"riel 1","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":498,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":103,"tim":1493097657342,"time":1493097657,"md5":"sbFstnIh1\/q2WBE1DJKSCQ==","fsize":99443,"resto":122691065,"id":"fjwxECL2","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122697087,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:21:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"The math is very simple.<br><br>Companies do not like paying people a living wage.<br><br>People do not enjoy work.<br><br>People are bad at work.<br><br>The only problem with basic income is that the only thing people like less than work is the idea of other people not having to work.<br><br>The only other solution is just getting rid of money entirely and running the entire society on the honor system.

Democrats now will literally shut down everything the next time they get 50 + 1 in the Senate. 200 years of precedent thrown out just so he can get the only real bullet point he has in terms of accomplishments.

I bet it got him a lot of his support. I&#039;d agree with the sentiment that expecting so much in 100 days is ridiculous, especially when the media is going out of their way to brag about all the ways they&#039;re trying to hold him up all the time. But he really has no one but himself to blame for this one unfortunately. Maybe he can blame some strategist or speech wriiter or whatever. It was a good speech though and I still believe he meant what he said and still has the intent to do what we wanted him to do.","time":1492867417,"resto":122272427,"id":"S7Xq2nGz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122277268,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)09:36:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122272427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122272427<\/a>","filename":"1492007656150","ext":".jpg","w":448,"h":508,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492868219533,"time":1492868219,"md5":"lFKIk1PDJUvTv75vSr9oxQ==","fsize":75331,"resto":122272427,"id":"BcipMmJi","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122277427,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)09:38:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;He wanted to elect Trump to do something<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not just so he can be walking meme President<\/span><br>Your loss","filename":"1264015","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492868327794,"time":1492868327,"md5":"n3e8jiwawRp5t+c2XFLPqQ==","fsize":30253,"resto":122272427,"id":"PCC0Qm0I","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122277496,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)09:39:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Working hard for your pennies huh blue boys?","time":1492868375,"resto":122272427,"id":"p1lSeHJ2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122277647,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)09:41:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122277496\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122277496<\/a><br>This is the_donald, tactic, btw.

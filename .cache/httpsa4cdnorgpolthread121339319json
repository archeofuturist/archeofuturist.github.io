As the protests become more like grand battles, we must be prepared so that we can fuck them up like we did today at Berkeley(4\/15).<br>I know that not every person can afford to build these things I&#039;m going to describe, so you can always improvise. These things are supposed to be as simple as possible in order to be adaptable.","time":1492334097,"resto":121339319,"id":"wyIypEF9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121339962,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:15:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"punch them in the pussy","time":1492334105,"resto":121339319,"id":"Cq5+YmU+","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":121340023,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:15:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"The first weapon of choice is the stick. Like based Stick Man&#039;s weapon of choice. But its a little less effective in extremely close quarter battle. Thats where this comes in handy. Its a shorter single hand melee stick. It can be made of anything, but no less than 1 foot and a half and is at least as thick as a Broom stick. Use tape as a grip. Customize it to do more damage or something. Used at the right time, it can falter all enemy advances. Its a decent blunt melee weapon. <br><br>Now we have the shield. I like those old Roman shields where there like hollow car doors, but you can use a wooden board or a trash can lid. Make sure you can grip the shield from the interior with a band or some thing. Classy points if you paint your shield red with a dollar sign on it. Using a shield is good for a charge, so get some big heavy guys behind the shields and ram the enemy to the curb. +100 Effectiveness if you ram as a group, like the Spartans lining their shields up. If you actually do this, make sure the shield men at the edge of the line charges first so that you can flatten the enemy into the center.","time":1492334152,"resto":121339319,"id":"wyIypEF9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121340072,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:16:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Basic armor is a helmet, whether an old baseball helmet, a football helmet or a bike helmet. If you have some weird cosplay Spartan helmet or even a real steel helmet, that would work too. If possible, paint MAGA on the back and front for quick identification. Eye armor is sunglasses. They work. Don&#039;t be an antifa fag and cover up your whole face with an ISIS wannabe mask. Just use a bandana and don&#039;t go out there looking like the enemy. Use face armor if needed because Antifa will guaranteed attack you in that region.<br>The simplest counter to those faggy ass face masks is a bucket of sugar water. Its probably hot in that unneeded gear, and they probably get distracted with all that sticky shit on the insides of their masks. Absolute hell. Great for stalling large crowds. One bucket of sugar water will fuck up at least 20 people, and if there was a constant stream barrage of that sticky water, then countering the enemy couldn&#039;t be easier. Use water balloons or water guns. If available, then use paint. Will fuck up all forms of clothes.","time":1492334190,"resto":121339319,"id":"wyIypEF9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121340140,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:17:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"The Berkeley police is probably weak compared to a fucking mall cop due to the anarchist liberal Mayors, but still treat them with respect.We&#039;re not Black Lives Matter. Speaking of BLM, if they ever do show up, then they will be ferocious. If they start chimping out and screaming at you, use sugar water and knock them in the face while they happen to be easily distracted. Pulling their monkey hair is recommended. <br>Other somewhat needed things would be a couple bull horns, radios, a couple drones for surveillance, but make sure you listen for some dude in a bull horn yelling to step back. <br>Chances are, alot of people won&#039;t read this outside of pol, but these tips will help. It is nearly impossible to get the crowds fighting into a combined army of Deus Vult legions, but even if you ignore everything I&#039;ve said here, just remember the sugar water trick.","time":1492334240,"resto":121339319,"id":"wyIypEF9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121340191,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:18:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"throw rocks at them","time":1492334293,"resto":121339319,"id":"UyPTilaV","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"}]}

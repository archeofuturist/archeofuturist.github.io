The problem with it is the fact that its outlook is American (the &quot;Old Right&quot; being retarded Neocons like George Bush rather than actual traditional conservatives\/old right like Hitchens, Scruton, Burke, etc.).<br><br>Another problem is the fact that it compares the intellectuals of the left with the standard followers of the right. There&#039;s no doubt that the intellectuals and leaders of the extreme left were highly intelligent, but the standard communist\/extreme leftist now isn&#039;t very intelligent at all. It should either compare the intellectuals of each movement with each other (in which case they&#039;d all be of moderate intelligence and above) or compare the standard followers with each other, in which case the results would be more varying.","time":1490292929,"resto":117956616,"id":"Y4ja6t5M","country":"GB","trip":"!!XKy4PC1RH+2","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117962347,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)14:15:55","name":"Designated Leftist","com":"<a href=\"#p117959640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117959640<\/a><br>Here&#039;s the real page 17, it&#039;s about Shannon Matthews.","filename":"1462948023966","ext":".png","w":439,"h":566,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490292955008,"time":1490292955,"md5":"LQqNuwDf5DPDb6BvaZU7hA==","fsize":170740,"resto":117956616,"id":"f7BOIAVt","country":"GB","trip":"!!80w9cz1G8ZX","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117962391,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)14:16:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117961696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117961696<\/a><br>Nah, he&#039;s a fag but he&#039;s not suspicious.<br>Whiny yes.","time":1490292977,"resto":117956616,"id":"20fne4PA","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117962453,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)14:16:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117960730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117960730<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We will march on the heart of our democracy and reclaim our streets in honour and respect of those that fell yesterday.<\/span><br>The nerve of these cunts.","filename":"march","ext":".png","w":977,"h":380,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":48,"tim":1490293007656,"time":1490293007,"md5":"kiI7D2mJIyipTJnL7VHfLQ==","fsize":58183,"resto":117956616,"id":"Qnlns6OT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117962480,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)14:17:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117961743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117961743<\/a><br>It means the newspaper people were getting a little bit excited and attributing stone tools to species without having any hominid remains in association.<br><br>Chris Hedges at the Natural History Museum has written two good books that&#039;ll help you: &#039;The Origin of Our Species&#039; about Homo sapiens evolution and &#039;Homo Britannicus&#039; about hominid occupation of Britain.<br><br>Antecessor -&gt; Heidelbergensis -&gt; Sapiens is correct as we currently understand it I think.

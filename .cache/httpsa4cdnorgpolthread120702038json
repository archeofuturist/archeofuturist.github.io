You have to decide what you want out of an establishment you&#039;re planning to frequent though. If you just want a place to get out of the house and see acquaintances, the corner dive bar will work. If you&#039;re like me though, and you&#039;re looking for a little light networking and opportunities to get laid, you have to search out bars that have good looking staff. <br>Whatever you desire, you need to put in the time and money. Plant yourself right at the bar, talk to the staff, whatever. Over time they&#039;ll remember you and you can network those acquaintances to make more acquaintances. <br>Before it closed down, I had a local bar I frequented for nearly a decade. It was ideal because the staff was always early to mid twenty something girls and a handful of men in the kitchen and on security. They had a variety of drink and games like pool and what not. I had made such in roads there from going often enough, that any time new staff started working there, they quickly learned who I was and made efforts to get to know me. This lead to several of the men playing videogames with me and also lead to countless sexual encounters between myself and the waitstaff and female regulars. You lay one and then everyone talks, giving social proof and opening other options. I even had my first threesome (mff) with a pair of the waitresses thanks to all of that time I spent there. <br>Point is, most people aren&#039;t going to open themselves up to stuff like sex and other stuff without having a lot of time to get to know you, so you&#039;re going to have to spend time getting to know people (it&#039;s why work and school are such common places for couples to meet). That&#039;s it, that&#039;s the purpose of bars. They&#039;re local watering holes and the owners make money on the human desire to socialize and gather in groups.","time":1491968615,"resto":120702038,"id":"s8KydoeD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120708608,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)23:44:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120703433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120703433<\/a><br>My go to.","time":1491968657,"resto":120702038,"id":"qGRyYoKe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120708725,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)23:45:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120702038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120702038<\/a><br>where in america are 6 packs only $4?","time":1491968724,"resto":120702038,"id":"pzeh0XhA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120708818,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)23:46:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120708725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120708725<\/a><br>ExpressMart","time":1491968779,"resto":120702038,"id":"nj+4NGMn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120708857,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)23:46:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120702038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120702038<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;go to bar<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;find a spot<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ask person next to spot if it&#039;s taken half out of courtesy half to break the ice<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; a good percentage of the time start a conversation and if not just enjoy my beer<\/span><br>i know were on 4chan but come on ya sperg","time":1491968793,"resto":120702038,"id":"a1UEe5Sx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120709027,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)23:48:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120702038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120702038<\/a><br>Just sounds like you&#039;ve got some faggy friends","time":1491968896,"resto":120702038,"id":"6AH6kA2w","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120709046,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)23:48:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"This really is an \/r9k\/ thread tbqhf","time":1491968903,"resto":120702038,"id":"LdGpbGxs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120709070,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)23:48:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120703178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120703178<\/a><br>Lol what a fucking autist<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;real men dont...<\/span><br><br>You dont know what youre talking about.

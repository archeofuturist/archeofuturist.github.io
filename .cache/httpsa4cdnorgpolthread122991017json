For someone who isn&#039;t a total retard to believe in a religion requires a certain amount of mental gymnastics. Simply saying &quot;I don&#039;t know, but there&#039;s no evidence of a god&quot; doesn&#039;t. That&#039;s why I&#039;m not surprised at all. We already know that atheists are generally smarter and better educated than those who are religious, so that&#039;s not really the issue. <br><br><a href=\"#p122994577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122994577<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; tfw he&#039;s actually right and you don&#039;t have a response.<\/span>","time":1493267846,"resto":122991017,"id":"vpB1vOoc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122995890,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:41:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122991017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122991017<\/a><br>The author of this article is a complete moron.<br>He isn&#039;t an actual scientist as he fails in <br>having a neutral, unbiased approach to the<br>subject.","time":1493268072,"resto":122991017,"id":"1PS9Ej+c","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122995909,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:41:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122991017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122991017<\/a><br>&#039;I have too many brains to be an atheist!&#039;<br><br>\/pol\/ in one sentence","time":1493268079,"resto":122991017,"id":"Mf663O3+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122996206,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:44:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122991017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122991017<\/a><br>Projecting: The Post<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mental gymnastics requires more mental power<\/span><br>golly gee, who woulda thunk it","time":1493268253,"resto":122991017,"id":"oSziHDBj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122996429,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:46:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122991017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122991017<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wasting brain power on religion<\/span><br>only the religious would be the ones to do so","time":1493268393,"resto":122991017,"id":"1JZ72CYA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122996501,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:47:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Joel McDurmon<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Christian reconstructionist<\/span><br>Abso-fucking-lutely biased.<br>The research that went into this is most likely nonexistent.","time":1493268435,"resto":122991017,"id":"cH9a8UDO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122996700,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:49:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122996501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122996501<\/a><br>Wow, you make atheism look like a fucking religious cult.","time":1493268593,"resto":122991017,"id":"Qmr03YQN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122996964,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:52:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122993211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122993211<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the parts of the brain used for logic and reasoning<\/span>","filename":"1406493227923","ext":".webm","w":500,"h":281,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493268775079,"time":1493268775,"md5":"IMVYvSdD75A13I3w8KZBQQ==","fsize":2830983,"resto":122991017,"id":"xRnDtKuX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122997074,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:54:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122994132\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122994132<\/a><br>so happy to see my taxpayer money is spent well, now im off to work some more","filename":"22bw","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493268843910,"time":1493268843,"md5":"G4OFJNJObd44MeunICWOHw==","fsize":26993,"resto":122991017,"id":"A1jwSy1s","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122997090,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:54:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122991017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122991017<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Conservative<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Agnostic<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not retarded<\/span><br><br>Checkmate fuckos","filename":"M-HIGH ENERGY","ext":".jpg","w":514,"h":536,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493268857989,"time":1493268857,"md5":"\/d576PY1OUSYtIs1BwZ+pg==","fsize":55694,"resto":122991017,"id":"eso6AVcr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122997224,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:55:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122993944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122993944<\/a><br>Underrated post","time":1493268945,"resto":122991017,"id":"49E2m1zx","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122997337,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:56:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122996700\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122996700<\/a><br>Wow, spouting the atheist cult meme.

I voted Cruz in the primaries, but got turned into an ardent defender of Trump and bought a MAGA hat and that sort of thing. My conservative circle has largely turned on Trump but I&#039;ve stayed a strong supporter and I have to credit this board for giving me a lot of arguments to keep them convinced. <br><br>What&#039;s the deal with the Wall Street Journal? I have a subscription and while I did mind the NeverTrump bullshit, did something happen with them? Are they full on liberals now? I seem to remember that in 2010 they defended Sarah Palin and the Tea Party and seemed to be pretty staunch conservatives since then.

Do you member that at that time homosexuality was treated as something very strange and distant by society. Something like aliens and UFO&#039;s. Homosexuality would be discussed by using loaded questions such as &quot;nature or nurture?&quot;. Of course it&#039;s very simple ruse - nobody is born gay in nature or in human nature. It&#039;s always sign of inhuman nurturing. So DADT is another interesting blip in this incursion where they issued ultimatum implying something about their first rule of fight club. So if you&#039;re asking or telling - you&#039;re asking for it. Of course DADT coincides with chicken coming home to roost where new generation of roosters were raised since the establishment of NAMBLA. That is just scratching the surface of these cooked books. The reality is always something.","time":1493036022,"resto":122575128,"id":"HKpm66X\/","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"}]}

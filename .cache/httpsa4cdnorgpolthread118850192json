Unless the location you were at was in certain areas of North or West Philly, there would be no need for such high levels of security and even in those locations they probably wouldn&#039;t even bother. As long as you aren&#039;t walking in those areas wearing clothing that makes you look rich you likely won&#039;t be harassed except for maybe being offered drugs. I lived in North Philly for about 2 years and not once had a single incident where I felt my life was threatened.

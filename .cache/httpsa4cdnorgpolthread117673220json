Revisions in 1981 streamlined the municipal construction grants process, improving the capabilities of treatment plants built under the program. Changes in 1987 phased out the construction grants program, replacing it with the State Water Pollution Control Revolving Fund, more commonly known as the Clean Water State Revolving Fund. This new funding strategy addressed water quality needs by building on EPA-state partnerships.<br>Over the years, many other laws have changed parts of the Clean Water Act. Title I of the Great Lakes Critical Programs Act of 1990, for example, put into place parts of the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement of 1978, signed by the U.S. and Canada, where the two nations agreed to reduce certain toxic pollutants in the Great Lakes. That law required EPA to establish water quality criteria for the Great Lakes addressing 29 toxic pollutants with maximum levels that are safe for humans, wildlife, and aquatic life.","filename":"ethan","ext":".png","w":791,"h":936,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490134949584,"time":1490134949,"md5":"09M\/1ooiljWRbWDk4UE7iw==","fsize":731759,"resto":117673220,"id":"8F9AeIYm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117679418,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)18:22:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117678913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117678913<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dude Ron Paul lmao<\/span><br>I&#039;m not following.

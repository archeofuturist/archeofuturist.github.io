The fact that a foreign lobby has such clout in Washington is a fucking disgrace.

How is this the sign of a healthy democracy? There is no consistency on the issue of lobbying at all - libtards rail against ebil corporations lobbying in their own interests but somehow it&#039;s fine if political contributions go to jews and not, say, Monsanto. It&#039;s fucking infuriating. Even if concervacucks were right and Israel was indeed the greatest ally, and an essential beacon of democracy in the middle east, meaning that this relationship needed to be cultivated, there is no reason for AIPAC to have such power. Canada has done exponentially more for America (memes aside) than Israel obv, and yet the idea that there would be a Canadian lobby that everyone would bow down to is ludicrous.

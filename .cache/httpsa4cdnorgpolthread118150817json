It&#039;s part of what makes us so adventurous which during the late middle-ages was a great advantage to our development.<br>2: Breeding with Neanderthals<br>Contrary to popular belief there is evidence to suggest that Neanderthals were actually more intelligent than Homo Sapiens, the Jimi Sapiens which migrated out of Africa interbred with the Neanderthals and were left more intelligent as a result.<br>3: Environmental differences<br>The environment of Europe with it&#039;s cold and harsh winters and bountiful springs at first slowed the progress of Europeans relative to for example the ancestors of the Arabs who lived in a more consistently hospitable climate however this slow start was balanced by the necessity of different breeding practices which favoured those who were able to prepare effectively for the harsh winters in order to benefit from the spring and summers.

When we invaded Iraq the last time, all our troops were in MOPP level one over the whole initial offensive. Within thirty seconds of hearing a gas alarm called, every single motherfucker woulda been protected. Gas is pretty worthless against military targets, because they have the gear and training to protect themselves.

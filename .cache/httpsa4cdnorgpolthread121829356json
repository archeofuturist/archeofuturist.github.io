In chess, an opening gambit is when you sacrifice pawn in order to gain tempo in your next move. Trump is sacrificing some things, like what happened in Syria, Trumpcare, etc. in order to gain tempo on things in the future.","time":1492597646,"resto":121829356,"id":"HN3Vmfnv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121829494,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)06:28:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121829356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121829356<\/a><br>Daily Dose:<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/detM0cKxWro<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/oBSvUlkB61s","filename":"sbr_color_v20_070","ext":".jpg","w":1520,"h":546,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":44,"tim":1492597684719,"time":1492597684,"md5":"xKaaIyijEVAK\/utlX7cq7Q==","fsize":373881,"resto":121829356,"id":"Sxsoyhii","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121829503,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)06:28:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121829453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121829453<\/a><br>I&#039;m not talking about Trump, I&#039;m talking about Barron","time":1492597688,"resto":121829356,"id":"YEulBRgi","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121829605,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)06:29:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121829503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121829503<\/a><br>Is Barroncare a thing too?","time":1492597786,"resto":121829356,"id":"yKm5Klag","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121829930,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)06:35:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121829503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121829503<\/a><br>Oh, that becomes even more complex. There is another thing we call in chess. It&#039;s called Zugzwang. It&#039;s German, I believe. This occurs when you force your opponent to make a bad move. Barron is going to force Democrats to make bad decisions and lose their popularity. An example of this is the race war. Democrats are sooner or later going to force blacks to fight a race war because of all the violence they create in the country. What does Barron have to do with this? Barron is actually the puppeteer of Trump. Right now, Trump is just following orders from Barron so that Barron doesn&#039;t get hate. It&#039;s a shield, if you will. The point of this is when he gets older he can finally become president himself.","time":1492598111,"resto":121829356,"id":"HN3Vmfnv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121830062,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)06:37:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"metahuman intelligence through autistic specialization <br><br>all normies will die","time":1492598261,"resto":121829356,"id":"mudFJXui","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121831238,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)06:55:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121829356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121829356<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What&#039;s his plan?<\/span><br>MAGA","time":1492599357,"resto":121829356,"id":"uOPbHAlG","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121831318,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)06:57:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121829356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121829356<\/a><br>barron will make amiga great again!","time":1492599423,"resto":121829356,"id":"rr2MQFDM","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121831465,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)06:59:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"make bank","time":1492599563,"resto":121829356,"id":"NGDCYB0i","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]}

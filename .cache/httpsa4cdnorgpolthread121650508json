Most girls around this age are already fat.<br>2. Significantly less guys around this age are fat and a large portion of them play sports or work out and have an above average looking body.<br>3. Women are less likely to care about 10 or twenty extra pounds on a guy but men are definitely likely to care about this.<br>4. Women will choose a man who has the body builder physique 9\/10 over one with an average physique.<br>5. It&#039;s safe to assume 90% of guys in this age group are not overweight enough to be undesirable to women (eg 230lbs or more, but even that is debatable)<br>6. Only about 10% of girls are still considered desirable for most men.<br><br>Alright now that I have gotten that out of the way let me explain if you aren&#039;t picking up on this already. When our parents were growing up the vast majority of older teens and twenty somethings were of normal weight. Ugly guys could date ugly looking girls with decent bodies and hot guys could date hot girls. The dating world wasn&#039;t a terrible place yet.<br><br>Now you have about 90% of guys still in the game pursuing about the 10% of women left that are not fat pigs. <br><br>In the 70s and 80s as a 20 year old you were competing with maybe only 3 or 4 other guys. Rejections would still happen but it stands to reason that after asking out 3 or 4 girls you would have a date Friday night.<br><br>This is not the cast now days. You are competing with realistically about 70 other guys. This is because you not only have to factor in the 9 - 1 ratio that you are directly competing with in person, but also the literally hundreds of Tinder matches, DMs, and Texts messages. On top of that a decent looking girl can reach out to any decent looking guy she wants to online and get a date with him within the next few days. <br><br>Realistically you are up against 500 other options. If you are not ripped, very smart, and funny, you&#039;re fucked.","filename":"1489903948122","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492497444751,"time":1492497444,"md5":"Ua\/BkyAA7ho4PvhrlsNPYQ==","fsize":111294,"resto":0,"id":"NyF91sne","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-is-why-you-are-single-and-alone","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121650793,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)02:40:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121650508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121650508<\/a><br>I&#039;m aware that public society is ruined OP, thanks for the reminder.","time":1492497651,"resto":121650508,"id":"S9c3HyOT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

During hot summer, people wandered there half naked or even naked. But the times change. The banks become favourite places for shitskins picknicks. You can imagine how the place look like when they left home? I am curious, what will be situation in summer - will be there any culture conflicts? <br><br>Yes, Vienna is infested with shitskins and it became more visible during past 2 years. It is getting worse and worse. I realise burgers, limeys, frogs do not see it as something special, because they are lost already.<br><br>Is there hope for Central Europe to avoid this downfall?","filename":"Vienna_Danube_01","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":540,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493034032704,"time":1493034032,"md5":"6xEhDiEwwNuh2ANRtNa5Gg==","fsize":190122,"resto":0,"id":"y\/ydK9ZY","country":"SK","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"for-years-the-danube-bank-in-vienna-and-entire","country_name":"Slovakia","replies":17,"images":9,"unique_ips":8},{"no":122576594,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)07:41:15","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Vienna_Danube_02","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":540,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493034075973,"time":1493034075,"md5":"0SY0YLxZIp1RfsO8mlyZmw==","fsize":162922,"resto":122576548,"id":"y\/ydK9ZY","country":"SK","country_name":"Slovakia"},{"no":122576648,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)07:41:57","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Vienna_Danube_03","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":540,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493034117668,"time":1493034117,"md5":"KQJOia+4geoKpQ1SpGOqlw==","fsize":223558,"resto":122576548,"id":"y\/ydK9ZY","country":"SK","country_name":"Slovakia"},{"no":122576705,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)07:42:41","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Vienna_Danube_04","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":540,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493034161857,"time":1493034161,"md5":"4rVzGFvC0JPLx+3BQcg\/\/w==","fsize":248446,"resto":122576548,"id":"y\/ydK9ZY","country":"SK","country_name":"Slovakia"},{"no":122576761,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)07:43:24","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Vienna_Danube_05","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":540,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493034204089,"time":1493034204,"md5":"+dQ+MgT3kaB+60h1W6dbmA==","fsize":159378,"resto":122576548,"id":"y\/ydK9ZY","country":"SK","country_name":"Slovakia"},{"no":122576791,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)07:43:52","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Vienna_Danube_06","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":540,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493034232050,"time":1493034232,"md5":"yMyzf\/6oDetKgeFmvHp+dw==","fsize":236862,"resto":122576548,"id":"y\/ydK9ZY","country":"SK","country_name":"Slovakia"},{"no":122576816,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)07:44:11","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Vienna_Danube_07","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":540,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493034251556,"time":1493034251,"md5":"T+vLgmupNenlRXNjTlkgUQ==","fsize":241292,"resto":122576548,"id":"y\/ydK9ZY","country":"SK","country_name":"Slovakia"},{"no":122576863,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)07:44:50","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Vienna_Danube_08","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":540,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493034290891,"time":1493034290,"md5":"GQndTloaOJzRKV2L\/DpxNw==","fsize":264768,"resto":122576548,"id":"y\/ydK9ZY","country":"SK","country_name":"Slovakia"},{"no":122577086,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)07:47:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fueling The hate","filename":"C__Data_Users_DefApps_AppData_INTERNETEXPLORER_Temp_Saved Images_1491989620293","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":499,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493034440502,"time":1493034440,"md5":"1a4vu\/fECzzdHAwjL4Dvrg==","fsize":29871,"resto":122576548,"id":"jeoKREFn","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122578245,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)08:01:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Are you happy now, Austrians?","time":1493035314,"resto":122576548,"id":"y\/ydK9ZY","country":"SK","country_name":"Slovakia"},{"no":122578434,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)08:04:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"lol they camp there a u faggot portrait it as if they lived there","time":1493035457,"resto":122576548,"id":"m13BRCEa","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":122578639,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)08:06:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"What in the fuck...","time":1493035591,"resto":122576548,"id":"Qr\/9Itoe","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":122578706,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)08:07:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122578434\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122578434<\/a><br>hey, Hakon, read with understanding. they are having picknick there and the let a lot of trash afterwards. it is not normal in Austria.","time":1493035638,"resto":122576548,"id":"y\/ydK9ZY","country":"SK","country_name":"Slovakia"},{"no":122578804,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)08:08:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122576548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122576548<\/a><br>i find this disgusting. if they were tourists then no problem but they&#039;re not.","time":1493035707,"resto":122576548,"id":"Whu5j4NX","country":"UA","country_name":"Ukraine"},{"no":122579049,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)08:11:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122576548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122576548<\/a><br><br>Prepare to be enriched, infidel!

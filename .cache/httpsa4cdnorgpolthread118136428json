Anons of little faith, surely you haven&#039;t forgotten Trumpian Brilliance? He&#039;s a master escape artist. <br><br>Just wait for his next rally and press conference.<br><br>No matter what, irrespective of what Trump does, the economy is going to collapse this year, Trump even predicted this and talked about it during a few rallies throughout 2015\/2016 saying, &quot;hang in there folks, in 2017 it&#039;s all going down, but we&#039;re gonna get through it together&quot; etc etc. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump &amp; Bannon know what&#039;s up.... if they passed a TrumpCare bill and acted like it was a success, then the economy collapses in the ensuing months, the blame would be pinned on Trump and he would be derided as a clusterfuck failure, the Nationalist movement would die, and USA would be the eternal laughing stock of all time.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump instead is allowing Obamacare to collapse on its own accord later this year, that way it will be used as the excuse for why the economy collapses.

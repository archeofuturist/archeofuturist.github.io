God is generally defined as being omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent, transcendent, and ultimately incomprehensible. Imposing purposely silly definitions on Him (or any definition), aside from being an appeal to ridicule, does not function as a valid reduction to absurdity because any and all imposed definitions conflict with His actual definition. For example, a &quot;flying spaghetti monster&quot; is either not omnipotent by definition, or its form isn&#039;t necessary and therefore arbitrary and non-definitive. If or when the intention is merely to show God is &quot;as ridiculous&quot; as any fantastical thing using false analogies, it is only a redundantly-fallacious appeal to the stone. It&#039;s also akin to saying &quot;Look, I can make things up. Therefore your God is made up,&quot; and yet these are the kind of unsophisticated arguments atheists use, presumably all because they refuse to conceive of possibility outside our comprehension, lest they have to admit we may be held accountable to something outside ourselves.<br><br>You are delusional.","time":1492605021,"resto":121838203,"id":"AJ4DRNn+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121838754,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:32:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121838560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121838560<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you literally can&#039;t understand what god really is<\/span><br>Nice argument, i converted to delusionalism on spot.","time":1492605154,"resto":121838203,"id":"g8qo5LA0","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":121838758,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:32:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121838203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121838203<\/a><br>I dont have a problem with most of those, if done by my side, of course","time":1492605155,"resto":121838203,"id":"khR0py7M","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":121838830,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:33:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121838203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121838203<\/a><br><br>Ironically After the Soviet Union and Communist China, Left wing Secularism\/Atheism might be in the lead in the &quot;human misery index&quot; as it relates to ideology.","filename":"DasKapital","ext":".png","w":616,"h":725,"tn_w":106,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492605211998,"time":1492605211,"md5":"fdrPKKVAkSL3gPBe3asyxA==","fsize":123776,"resto":121838203,"id":"O7xpSgSy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121838864,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:33:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121838754\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121838754<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m stupid therefore God doesn&#039;t exist.<\/span><br>If there&#039;s anyone here whose opinions should not be cared about, it&#039;s you.","time":1492605230,"resto":121838203,"id":"AJ4DRNn+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121838953,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:34:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121838203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121838203<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cucked<\/span><br><br>Not the word I&#039;d use for a Jew shitting on religion.

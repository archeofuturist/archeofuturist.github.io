Now, we could start yelling phrases at them, but that would make us look like complete fucking idiots. What we need is a silent hand signal. Something we obviously spread around a lot and they can find out what it means and declare it as a &quot;hate symbol&quot;. When we see a libtard in public, we flash them the hand signal, they start freaking out making them look like the provoker and the crazy one. Ideas on what the hand signal should be? My idea is to fold our fingers to make a &quot;AR&quot; like in the attached image. I&#039;ll post this on candid too.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":4032,"h":3024,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490662849084,"time":1490662849,"md5":"uszBnrcPnDJijtIxf+ljYg==","fsize":1848716,"resto":0,"id":"faG\/4hCt","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"public-triggering","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":4,"unique_ips":12},{"no":118589155,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:03:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118588886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118588886<\/a><br>your signal looks a bit too complicated, it should be something more simple<br>other than that, i like this idea","time":1490662999,"resto":118588886,"id":"IQtOWdo5","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118589832,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:09:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"we already hijacked the victory sign and ok sign.. why not roll with them","time":1490663345,"resto":118588886,"id":"h8X8HkcO","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118589876,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:09:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why not this?","filename":"3303518","ext":".jpg","w":753,"h":1024,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490663366906,"time":1490663366,"md5":"XRW5pYUuq6NPrpXCqF3pkw==","fsize":562282,"resto":118588886,"id":"OKdNPDJv","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118590339,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:10:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"I like a good ol&#039;fashioned bellamy salute","time":1490663459,"resto":118588886,"id":"awpURtQZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118590428,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:11:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;newfag doesnt know we already have a symbol<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Id: faG<\/span><br>Wew","time":1490663503,"resto":118588886,"id":"ESG03xpG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118590438,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:11:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118588886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118588886<\/a><br>liberals are pussies who would never throw a punch.

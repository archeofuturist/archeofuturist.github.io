Long term market forecasts predict that the UK faces certain market volatility over the short to medium term. In the toubled times of market instability and contagion, reducing the number of risk factors the world economy is exposed to is an absolute must. Brexit Britain represents as much of a third of global financial market exposure, having an impact on insurance rates, reinsurance, consolidated debt vehicles and so forth.<br>From an environmental perspective this could improve cod stocks in the North Sea, by bringing more nutrients into the basin and extending the benefits of the favourable tropical currents to more diverse areas on Europe and the EU.<br> <br>The longer term view will have a smoothing effect on pollution indicator volatility and fish stocks should again be exploitable within the late medium term range. This means more investment and jobs in the fishing industry, particularly on the North Sea shore, although fleets from further afield will be able to participate due to the drop in consumption in the UK market.

There is a rule in Bible prophecy that some predictions apply to two separate events usually separated by a long span of time. I guess you could say that God instructs us to learn about future events by observing past events. Much of the prophecy in Isaiah 17 was fulfilled during the Assyrian invasion of Damascus in 734 BC. However, Damascus was not destroyed at that time. As a matter of fact it continued as an important city of the Assyrian Empire. So Isaiah\u2019s dire predictions may also apply to future events.<br>Please allow me to defend the future fulfillment of the destruction of Damascus. Many Bible scholars claim that the destruction of Damascus has already taken place. They say that the Assyrian conquest of Damascus in 734 BC fulfills the Damascus prophecy. Well Damascus was conquered by Assyria in 734 BC and several cities around Damascus were burned with fire but Damascus has never been completely destroyed. These Bible teachers argue that the Assyrian conquest of Damascus happened shortly after Isaiah gave his prophecy about the destruction of Damascus.<br>Isaiah 17:1-2 The burden of Damascus.

A lot of Bible buffs say that Damascus will be destroyed suddenly. They say that Damascus will probably be obliterated by a nuclear bomb. I don\u2019t see that scenario communicated in scripture. Instead Jeremiah 49:27 says, \u201cI will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus\u201d. This terminology is used several times in the Old Testament. To kindle a fire means that God will send an invading army against Damascus; just as God sent the Assyrian Army to invade Damascus in 734 BC.<br>God has certainly sent an army against Damascus today. The \u201cFree Syrian Army\u201d is fighting in Damascus against the Syrian Army. By the way, after Assyria invaded Damascus they turned south into Israel. It is possible that the armies invading Damascus today may also turn south to come against Israel. We are allowed to learn from past events!<br>Isaiah 17:1-2 The burden of Damascus.

God is saying that Syria as well as northern Israel will be conquered and carried away captive so that not many people are left in their land. This is exactly what happened long ago. Assyria took Syrians captive into north western Jordan and Israel was carried away into today\u2019s Iraq! The following verses definitely describe what happened long ago, but they also seem to describe a future ruin of Syria and northern Israel. During Israel\u2019s future seven year \u201cTribulation\u201d period only a few Jews will remain in the entire land of Israel (Zechariah 13-14).

The film focuses primarily on the General Motors EV1, which was made available for lease mainly in Southern California, after the California Air Resources Board (CARB) passed the Zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate in 1990 which required the seven major automobile suppliers in the United States to offer electric vehicles in order to continue sales of their gasoline powered vehicles in California. Nearly 5000 electric cars were designed and manufactured by Chrysler, the Ford Motor Company, General Motors (GM), Honda, Nissan, and Toyota; and then later destroyed or donated to museums and educational institutions.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The film details the California Air Resources Board&#039;s reversal of the mandate after relentless pressure and suits from automobile manufacturers, continual pressure from the oil industry, orchestrated hype over a future hydrogen car, and finally the George W. Bush administration.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A portion of the film details GM&#039;s efforts to demonstrate to California that there was no consumer demand for their product, and then to take back every EV1 and destroy them. A few were disabled and given to museums and universities, but almost all were found to have been crushed. GM never responded to the EV drivers&#039; offer to pay the residual lease value; $1.9 million was offered for the remaining 78 cars in Burbank, California before they were crushed. Several activists, including actresses Alexandra Paul and Colette Divine, were arrested in the protest that attempted to block the GM car carriers taking the remaining EV1s off to be crushed.<\/span>","filename":"hero&#039;s journey 1423976500900","ext":".jpg","w":996,"h":1024,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493640521566,"time":1493640521,"md5":"rPq2hWjzTJS2DgAAIxWjYw==","fsize":136182,"resto":123599148,"id":"EbRem0PX","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":123613010,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)08:09:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123599148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123599148<\/a><br>Hes read this faggots book on marketing","filename":"images (11)","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":216,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":122,"tim":1493640566705,"time":1493640566,"md5":"K8vZW9WQideSrgWFrbDwSg==","fsize":6421,"resto":123599148,"id":"Qh+g45BA","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123613037,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)08:09:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123599148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123599148<\/a><br>bitching about a white male moving us towards electric cars and outer space and shit<br><br>meanwhile the whole fucking earth economy right now is one giant ponzi scheme<br><br>you need to chillax","time":1493640582,"resto":123599148,"id":"1\/9YERqF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123613171,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)08:11:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123612922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123612922<\/a><br>There has been made research for batteries quite alot.

Have fun spending tons of money in a drawn out civil suit, only to have a massive judgement against you. Liens will be placed and recorded on any property holdings you own; the liens accrue interest at 10% a year. They&#039;ll find your bank accounts, and freeze any money you have in those too. Oh, you own a car? That&#039;s nice, a lien against your car will be filed with the DMV too.<br><br>These are just the civil consequences you&#039;re facing for the stupid and illegal shit you pulled, not even talking about criminal law consequences.<br><br>There&#039;s nothing noble or brave about what you did. You can&#039;t excuse aggravated battery, against a peaceful protester no less.<br><br>I&#039;m legitimacy curious about hearing back from you about your side.

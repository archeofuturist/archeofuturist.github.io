It is estimated that Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad and Syria now have about a quarter of a million rockets and missiles between them. In the most extreme scenario, with Iran joining the melee, the number of missiles increases considerably.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The most ominous threat now facing Israel is the possibility of a surprise rocket and missile attack in which all of its enemies \u2014 Hezbollah, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Syria and Iran \u2014 fire tens of thousands of rockets and missiles at Israel in a single day, in a coordinated attack. Israel compares such a scenario to the &quot;1973 Yom Kippur surprise,&quot; in which Egypt and Syria attacked Israel simultaneously. As of now, Israel has no response to such an attack.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The assessment is that, in such a scenario, the Israeli air force will successfully destroy thousands of long-range missiles and launchers, mainly those belonging to Hamas and Hezbollah. Similarly, Israel&#039;s missile defense systems will intercept many more missiles. Nevertheless, the Israeli Home Front will still suffer hits from thousands more rockets and missiles, the most accurate of which could reach Israeli air force bases, impeding the air force&#039;s capacity to respond. One senior Israeli military official told Al-Monitor on condition of anonymity that &quot;the only response to such a threat is deterrence. Our enemies know exactly what price they will pay for initiating such a move, and it will be much higher \u2014 incomparably higher \u2014 than the price paid by Israel.&quot;<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.al-monitor.com\/pulse\/ori<wbr>ginals\/2017\/04\/israel-syria-hezboll<wbr>ah-hamas-islamic-jihad-iran-missile<wbr>s.html","time":1492071952,"resto":120868839,"id":"JBUQzbA9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120887294,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)04:28:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120886510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120886510<\/a><br>&quot;We all felt that democratic socialism was the most effective bulwark against totalitarianism.

We don&#039;t want to see any irresponsible move from any side. Because, given the current situation, it would be very dangerous. We hope that all relevant parties can help deescalate the tension in the region instead of being provocative and adding fuel to the flame. We believe that it is in everyone&#039;s interest to deescalate the tension and preserve peace and stability of the region.<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.china-embassy.org\/eng\/fy<wbr>rth\/t1453181.htm","time":1492082333,"resto":120868839,"id":"bTT2Lw60","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120898484,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:18:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120897461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120897461<\/a><br>I WANT TO BELIEVE<br><br>(but I don&#039;t yet)","time":1492082333,"resto":120868839,"id":"DdbjMmWV","country":"MK","country_name":"Macedonia"},{"no":120898521,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:19:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120898296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120898296<\/a><br>kek I got it from \/ptg\/ not even lying.","time":1492082361,"resto":120868839,"id":"ctrgeVB+","country":"HN","country_name":"Honduras"},{"no":120898522,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:19:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120898381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120898381<\/a><br>Why the fuck would they forbid airstrikes on ISIS territory","time":1492082361,"resto":120868839,"id":"gbm1obCH","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120898536,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:19:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120897460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120897460<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw drumpf decides to bomb washington<\/span>","time":1492082372,"resto":120868839,"id":"JEfO9fag","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":120898562,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:19:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120898483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120898483<\/a><br>Did Trump think that China was going to call in it&#039;s fleet to sail next to the American for some kind of parade in front of North Korea?","time":1492082392,"resto":120868839,"id":"DdbjMmWV","country":"MK","country_name":"Macedonia"},{"no":120898568,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:19:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120898381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120898381<\/a><br>And how do you know it&#039;s not related to start of Phase 4 (announced earlier today) of Raqqa operation, or it&#039;s not related to talks in Russia, cause maybe someone gave an idea &quot;alright, show us what you can do, relieve pressure on Deir ez Zor&quot;<br>Don&#039;t sperg out like a nigger in the peak of cotton-peaking season if you don&#039;t know shit.","time":1492082396,"resto":120868839,"id":"663F1nBw","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120898571,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:19:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120897460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120897460<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120897849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120897849<\/a><br>What BS.<br>Obviously false flag to accuse ISIS for the chemical attacks.","time":1492082398,"resto":120868839,"id":"l1O56tyk","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":120898605,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:20:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"FRESH<br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120898565#p120898565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120898565<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120898565#p120898565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120898565<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120898565#p120898565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120898565<\/a>","time":1492082427,"resto":120868839,"id":"I3s8ZGkj","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120898631,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:20:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120897849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120897849<\/a><br>WTF Trump gassing innocent childrens tomahawks fucking when","time":1492082445,"resto":120868839,"id":"Dtjx0FSg","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120898636,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:20:50","name":"Syrian Geneal","com":"<a href=\"#p120898381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120898381<\/a><br><br>first of all russian AA dont cover Deir Ezzor","time":1492082450,"resto":120868839,"id":"kZ1YI7fK","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":120898701,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:21:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120869314\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120869314<\/a><br>oh oh OH please give something that would tie him to this compa!","filename":"1482857376464","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":374,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492082499492,"time":1492082499,"md5":"ctoG4uN1IpjVkLPc2u1XJA==","fsize":21083,"resto":120868839,"id":"BykJ0oLI","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120898705,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:21:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120898571\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120898571<\/a><br>HAHAHA","time":1492082501,"resto":120868839,"id":"gbm1obCH","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120898740,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:22:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120898381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120898381<\/a><br>Only agreement that &quot;helps prevent incidents&quot; was revoked.

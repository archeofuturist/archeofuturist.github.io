Could make America become at least 80% white in the next 50 years. <br><br>Trump has recently stated he will be replacing the current immigration act with a merit based system. Hopefully this could make it somewhat easier for Europeans to come here as it will be far more difficult for non-whites to enter the country. <br><br>The ones that would move here would be the ones that supported populist parties or are against their marxist leaders. The Lefty loons would most likely stay back in Europe to get raped by hordes of shitskins. <br><br>Europeans are more likely to have children in America as there&#039;s more room to start families in. This could raise the white birth rate higher which will keep America from becoming Brazil 2.0.

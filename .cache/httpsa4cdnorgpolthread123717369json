Traits like albinoism or gigantism show up in the genepool 99% of them are retards with low chances of survival much less breeding but the 1% actually grows a trait that makes them better suited to their environment so they have more kids on average than the regular member of the species. Repeat this over thousands of years with new traits popping up now and again while new physical stresses of the environment happening like volcanoes erupting or forests burning down causing migrations and population segmentation and you get many different potentially new genes getting worked into the population at the same time. Now stretch that over millions of years and eventually those gene patterns will become so divergent from each other that animals with the same common ancestor will be unable to breed, but since you have survival of the fittest constantly weeding out the 99% of useless gene malformations, the new populations that emerge are stable and suited to their environments.<br><br>Its sound.

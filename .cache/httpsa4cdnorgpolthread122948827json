Did you read nothing? The estate tax being cut ONLY benefits the rich. <br><br>The 15 percent business tax rate could open a huge loophole for people to receive business income through a limited liability company or other pass-through entity instead of as wages. Depending on how the law is drafted, that could enable some people to pay that low 15 percent rate on their earnings instead of an individual income rate up to 35 percent. People who already receive their income through investment vehicles wouldn\u2019t have to change anything for a windfall.<br><br>The plan would reduce the top rate on individual income tax \u2014 now 39.6 percent for income over around $470,000 for a married couple \u2014 to 35 percent. But that\u2019s only part of the gain for high-income earners. It also would eliminate a 3.8 percent tax, used to help fund Obamacare, that applies to investment income over $250,000 for a couple.<br><br>The plan would cut the 35 percent corporate income tax to 15 percent.

By consolidating the tax brackets, this threshold will increase (I haven&#039;t seen exactly what it will be but I&#039;ve heard ~$25k , maybe someone else can confirm this?). This means that all the money that anyone with a job makes between $9-25k (so $16k worth of income) will be taxed at 10% instead of the 15% it is taxed at currently. This effectively raises take home pay by $800 per year just on your first $25k of income.

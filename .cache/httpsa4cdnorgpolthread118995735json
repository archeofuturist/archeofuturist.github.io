However, one study that examined 125 Colorado dogs who had contracted marijuana toxicosis between 2005 and 2010 found that only two dogs died as a result of ingesting marijuana edibles, and in both cases it was unclear whether the toxicity in question came from the ingestion of THC or from items toxic to canines that were also found in said marijuana edibles, such as chocolate and caffeine.[16][17][18]<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In March 2015, it was revealed DEA agents were participating in drug cartel-funded sex parties with prostitutes.[19] Agents were given expensive gifts, weapons and money. Surrounding the scandal, Leonhart announced her retirement.[2] In April 2015, twenty-two members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee said in a joint statement they had lost confidence in Leonhart&#039;s leadership.[20]<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xjZ<wbr>B08r4Y6s<br><br>Why don&#039;t you burgers publically execute people like this?","filename":"Cast.Away.2000.1080p.BrRip.x264.YIFY.mp4_snapshot_01.11.12_[2017.03.11_21.17.24]","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490921540857,"time":1490921540,"md5":"NTze8sPKIS1BlhT54CPprA==","fsize":793790,"resto":0,"id":"yPSNvflc","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"in-2014-leonhart-openly-criticized-president","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":118995885,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:53:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Seven of the 10 DEA agents alleged to have participated in the gatherings \u2014 most of which took place at an agent\u2019s \u201cquarters\u201d leased by the U.S. government \u2014 admitted to having attended the parties, the report found.

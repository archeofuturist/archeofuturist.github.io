Nihilism is a part of life but you have to basically not be a self indulgent lazy piece of shit thinking you can do so because you solve everything with the notion that it doesn&#039;t really matter in the end. You must not give in because when you do and others start to do so you unleash self destructive hell upon civilization. Life does matter. Why? Because you get to do it only once. You don&#039;t get a second try at it. You can entertain reincarnation or fantasy after life scenarios all you want but the truth is nobody has a fucking clue and you know what? That is OK. Its fine. You want to give in to the inner demon of hopelessness then that is your choice alone and nothing will save you if you do. You have to live your life for something even if it is simply playing video games and watching anime. At this point when there is a desperate need to counter nihilism a simple purpose is good enough. A song, a video game, a favorite anime or character, a place you&#039;d like to visit, a hobby you enjoy, or even just browsing 4chan every day doing nothing. Peterson summed it up perfectly in one of his speeches.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;weak and pitiful as I am, I can still stand up to the great tragedy of life and prevail, and thats good enough. <\/span><br><br>Unless you&#039;re a libshit postmodernist neomarxist trying to critically deconstruct everything that got western civilization to where it currently is and you misrepresent Nietzsche&#039;s teachings like some pseudo intellectual prick going around screaming &quot;nothing matters! God is dead! Fuck religion!&quot; then you can have my blessing and kill yourself and get eaten up by your own narcissistic ego. Its people like this that did not understand a single thing Nietzsche wrote. Atheists claiming &quot;God is dead&quot; as a victorious slogan to praise the apparent death of religion. Guess what? <br><br>Real quote &quot;God is dead, and we have killed him, and we&#039;ll never find enough water to wash away the blood&quot;","filename":"Dresden_Night","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1139,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":74,"tim":1490657945099,"time":1490657945,"md5":"5neWUQeQf7TbTjKNgf2+\/A==","fsize":389828,"resto":118576397,"id":"bfXZ6rm3","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118581054,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:48:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118577959\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118577959<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118576397\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118576397<\/a><br><br>There&#039;re no perfect answers. One thing to keep in mind is that atheistic modernity and uncertain postmodernity are social constructs, as much as you might be existing within them now - i.e. they don&#039;t have any more inherent validity than anything else. This doesn&#039;t create meaning or purpose, but it does open up a space for it.<br><br>Striving creates meaning to an extent. To that end you can identify a system of personal virtue and pursue it. Read up and you&#039;ll find that self-mastery, internal consistency and self-unification alongside conventional masculine virtue exists as an ideal very broadly throughout history and across cultures. Politically, if you&#039;re an ethnonationalist, you&#039;ve got fatherhood and family as a goal to pursue.<br><br>You won&#039;t fix it for everyone by coming up with something though. For people at large, they&#039;re going to follow wider processes, and at the moment they&#039;re married to liberal-democracy and materialism as long as those systems ensure their physical safety, keep them prosperous and stop their political enemies from hurting them too much when in government. The opportunity for breaking them out of it comes when the system breaks its promises and there are people there to provide an alternative.","time":1490658507,"resto":118576397,"id":"Y3j42LKi","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118582465,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:01:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118576397\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118576397<\/a><br>I&#039;m somewhat of a nihilist but not in a &#039;don&#039;t care why do anything&#039; way.

Not only would I save billions of taxpayer dollars by not pursuing them, but I would boost the economy and lower inflation all at the same time.","time":1492833133,"resto":122225447,"id":"VT4CONSf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122232045,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:52:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122225447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122225447<\/a><br>I&#039;m fine with abortion, homos and DUDE WEED","time":1492833165,"resto":122225447,"id":"ZEviqwmL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122232079,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:53:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122225447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122225447<\/a><br>communists are not people and deserve to hang","time":1492833189,"resto":122225447,"id":"fc\/Rt7mt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122232487,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:57:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122225447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122225447<\/a><br>face in the dirt, ass in the sky","time":1492833463,"resto":122225447,"id":"U9NYvh4Q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122232587,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:58:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122230992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122230992<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;coloreds and whites sharing drinking fountains and restrooms.<\/span><br><br>gtfo nigger lover","time":1492833528,"resto":122225447,"id":"vwelHfeZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122232661,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:59:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122225447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122225447<\/a><br>Ejecting non-whites alive rather than dead","time":1492833575,"resto":122225447,"id":"8O5J9pc\/","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122232668,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:59:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122225447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122225447<\/a><br>Liberal as in valuing the principles of liberty?

You lay expectantly upon the matress, as I traverse the little room you call home every night. My hand is the first limb of mine that befalls the bedding, and then your soft, recently shaved legs. You giggle as I slowly pull off the cute thong protecting your private parts from my lustful, hungry figure. I dip a finger into your opening, and greedily taste the fluid that I find lapped around my finger. You&#039;re so warm. You&#039;re so wet. A few circuits around your clitoris, you&#039;re ready. I unzip my trousers as I bring more of myself onto the bed. My swollen member, aroused by your submissive seduction, peeks out. You gasp as the rod you&#039;re been waiting for all night rises in all it&#039;s glory. We kiss, and then so do our privates. A little prodding, and my penis is swallowed by your pussy, eliciting a gentle moan from your bitch mouth. The next hour is filled with only the sound of my hairy balls slapping against your ass as I pummel your pussy furiously. You scream my name out to the world for all to hear, as we both reach our climax. I fill you with my thick, sticky seed, and flee the scene as your parents open the door. I leave a letter, on the bedside table, promising more nights to come.

He lies. Constantly. When people say you should pay attention to what he does, not what he says, thats the same as saying he doesnt do what he says.<br><br>2. He vociferously led us to believe that Hillary would face justice. Immediately after the election, he pretended it was a joke. There is no justice for Hillarys crimes. Not even an investigation.<br><br>3. There was no repeal. What he offered was not a repeal, and may well have been meant to fail. One thing we can thank him for is revealing we do not have two parties, but one party with two factions. When Republican leaders are pressed to make good on the things they claim to object to, they suddenly run for the hills.<br><br>3. He does not lead. Signing papers to undo other papers Obama signed is not leading. Its paperwork.<br><br>4. He did not stand by Flynn. Personally, I am glad Flynn is gone because he did not disclose he is a foreign agent, literally, which is gross misconduct. But he was on the team and it could&#039;ve been handled better. Moreover, I dislike that he brought in an anti-Russia weasel that the left media was fine with.<br><br>5. The Wall. The GOP is pulling funding for it from the budget, meaning we can expect no action on that either.<br><br>6. He repeats that the XL pipeline will be made with American steel. The pipes were bought (contracted) before he was elected. He keeps repeating this claim.<br><br>7. His two executive orders on travel bans both had no legitimate basis in law and it was obvious. Instead of moving ahead with the authority conferred upon his office, he kowtowed to two rogue judges and doesnt even seek to have them impeached as examples.<br><br>8. In his era of &#039;law &amp; order&#039; we have sanctuary cities becoming sanctuary states. Mayors are dictating to Washington what laws they will and will not comply with, and they face no consequences for it.

It has been less than three months, and he is already filling the White House with neocons, Bush-ites and a lot of creepy Jewish ghouls. While in itself it may have been sufferable, he is simultaneously preparing to expel the intellectual core of his campaign that I supported, Steve Bannon.

A few days after election he said that it &#039;wasn&#039;t possible to drain the swamp&#039; because lobbyists were the only ones with experience. Then why make the claim during the election? Either he didn&#039;t know that, which makes him incompetent, or he did and was lying.<br><br>15. In his theme of America First, he was comfortable slashing spending for foreign aid to every country.

After repeating for years that we should not enter mid-East entanglements, going as far as to deliver sound reasons not to bomb Assad, he commits a full reversal and expects us to believe he was moved by pictures of wounded children, in the same way Bush wanted &#039;democracy in the Mid East&#039; and Lincoln cared so much about the plight of negroes that he had to roll in troops to removed a democratically elected government. These are pretexts. Leaders do not make military moves based on sentiment. It was not even clear what the nature of the chemical attack was or from where, and without spending a nickel on the wall, delivered a $70 million gift to Israel to destroy a nearby base that had been a concern for them for a while. Yet while pro-Israel politicians are cheering the missile strike, they suspiciously dont mention the benefit to Israel. We are now preparing for consecutive military action in the region.<br><br>To point #1: He lies. He keeps lying. It never ends. What he says has absolutely nothing to do with what he does.

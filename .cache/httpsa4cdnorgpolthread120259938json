This is one of the reasons it&#039;s supposed to be difficult for a president to declare war. Unfortunately, Congress is full of cowards who don&#039;t want war to be their responsibility, so they&#039;ve made the president omnipotent in his ability to declare war.

This is dangerous. Trump has now learned that he can get the establishment and media respect he craves and a sense of strength by bombing someone. This will continue.<br><br>MSM is particularly disgusting. The moment a war starts large media institutions immediately turn into state media.

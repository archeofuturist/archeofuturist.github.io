Surnames are being bred away.<br><br>Look no further than America \/pol\/<br><br>Garcia, Rodriguez and Martinez surnames are on the rise. Smith and Johnson increased in frequency as well but a lot but other great names are decreasing! What is peculiar is that Martinez was absent from the top 10 in 2000, but in 2010 it replaces Wilson for the 10 most frequent by a substantial margin. <br><br>Asians are also increasing in occurrences with Li, Patel and Zhang also being a part of the fastest growing surnames. Another worrisome statistic is that on a global level Smith and Johnson don\u2019t make it to the top 100 most common lastnames. Martinez is 74thand increasing.<br><br>These are undisputable facts that great lastnames are being bred away! We are well aware that a certain Pedophile who went by the name, \u201cMohammed\u201d has practically become the top British Baby name. Many people here at \/pol\/ and beyond expressed their worries on Muhammed\u2019s name increasing in Britain. What isn\u2019t being discussed is that a person\u2019s surname says a lot about their background.

Latino surnames are incredibly non-diverse. We are all named Garcia, Rodgriguez, Martinez, Gonzalez, Gomez, or Sanchez. Go turn on a Spanish soccer game, or really any baseball games. I guarantee you 90% of the latino dudes will have those names. We resort to nicknames because we&#039;ve all got the same last names. There is so little variation, it&#039;s ridiculous. I knew 20 other people named &quot;Gomez&quot; growing up and 9 other people named &quot;Luis Gomez&quot;.

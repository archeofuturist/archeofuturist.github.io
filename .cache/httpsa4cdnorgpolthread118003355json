Some &quot;informations&quot; a completly false or true and you can proof it. Some are completly true or false, but you can&#039;t proof it. The thing is, since we are humans we mostly operate in a grey zone between completly flase and true, so that statments aren&#039;t completly false or true, but have some truth to it and some haven&#039;t. The information in order to be relevant obviously can&#039;t be completly false at least, if it is easily to disprove it. It could be false and impossible of nearly impossible to be disproven or be in the said grey zone humans operate within, but technically it isn&#039;t a completly false information then. The Information has to relate to meaning of the targets and create meaning itself to the targets. I think this is a really complicated process and maybe you could build up something with meaning to all, possibly by conecting the informations to many other informations to make it suitebale for every target group, but I think this is next to impossible.","time":1490313556,"resto":118003355,"id":"cdZi5UQz","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

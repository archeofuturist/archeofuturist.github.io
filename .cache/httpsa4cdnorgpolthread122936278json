Was looking up bhuddist hell the other day. Shit is not cash. Shit is SCARY. And the truth is I am fearful. Because I didnt love my enemies. <br><br>I hated them. They hurt me, I hurt them 110%. I wanted them to suffer, and they did. <br><br>I said some cruel shit, I made fun of people parents divorces. I took the hate I saw in the world and I gave it to the people that I felt deserved it. <br><br>I took the same cruelty they inflicted on other and I gave it back to them. The lines blurred. <br><br>I enjoyed it, the evil in. Being right. Winning. But it comes at a terrible cost. Hate breeds hate. Hurt people, hurt people. The pain I inflicted will no doubt create more pain. <br><br>The truth is the most racist people are hurt themselves. They are lashing out from inner pain. And instead of healing them, I hurt them more. <br><br>How do I atone? <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 KYS<\/span><br><br>How can I do I build the fortitude and patience to receive the vilification of my enemies, and instead of giving them the wrath of a demon, instead give them the understanding and patience of a supreme being. Is it impossible in a place like this? or the ultimate training room. <br><br>How do I be like Jesus and do what he did. And love no matter what so death can never defeat me. How do I take back the evil I put forth.<br><br>Can I just apologize and say it was just bantz?<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Narak<wbr>a_(Buddhism)","filename":"reincarnation","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":340,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":118,"tim":1493239461901,"time":1493239461,"md5":"3WKRLCcW35B7gcQNoO0cNw==","fsize":70844,"resto":0,"id":"7MDlbsNZ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-it-just-bantz-or-are-we-really-hurting-each","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

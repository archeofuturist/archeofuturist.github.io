Before I start though, I want to say that I fucking love America. I think it&#039;s a fantastic and fascinating country.<br><br>My question is: why does America so often look back and try to regain moments in its history, when in reality looking forward is what made it so great? In every era of American history people wanted to look back, but change continued to occur and America continued to grow. It went from a bunch of colonies to the biggest economic, social, military and cultural power to ever exist in world history, and it did this in 200 or so years. 1000 year old European nations failed to achieve half of what America has.<br><br>I supported Trump but I now wonder why the idea &quot;MAGA&quot; had any appeal to me. America never stopped being great and never will. If America stayed rooted and never changed, would it be where it is now? Would it have abolished slavery before the rest of the world did, awarded civil rights, landed on the moon, conquered the west economically and culturally, torn down the Berlin Wall, etc? Maybe you argue slavery should never have been abolished and women should never have been given the vote, but if that&#039;s the case, how can you as an American continue to celebrate your nation&#039;s journey to the top? You can&#039;t be selectively nationalist, you either celebrate the American success story or you don&#039;t. <br><br>I consider myself pretty conservative (UKIP and Leave supporter) but wonder whether trying to MAGA is the right way to approach things. If that idea had won in previous American political contexts, the USA wouldn&#039;t have become top dog.","filename":"640px-USA_Flag_Map.svg","ext":".png","w":640,"h":402,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":157,"tim":1492795774930,"time":1492795774,"md5":"AULQlQBFAlThOIZt0Etwhg==","fsize":63439,"resto":0,"id":"LQi+GZ75","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-great-american-paradox","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

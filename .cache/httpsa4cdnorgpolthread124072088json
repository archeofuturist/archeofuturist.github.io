From what I&#039;m hearing, SJWs are uploading torrents and DDLs of The Red Pill to various websites, but instead of it actually being the film, it&#039;s some other video and it&#039;s bundled with some sort of malware. They&#039;re talking about shit like &quot;punishing the MRAs for trying to watch TRP&quot;. <br> <br>So yeah, be careful of any torrents\/other downloads of TRP. Make sure to run a virus\/malware scan on them just in case.","filename":"red-pill","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493912580252,"time":1493912580,"md5":"M69WnRZY9hxuf8QleHHwYw==","fsize":36259,"resto":0,"id":"pQExT8Qb","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-guys-just-wanted-to-give-you-a-heads-up-about","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

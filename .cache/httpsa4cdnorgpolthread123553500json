Not because there isn&#039;t a biological race based reason they are dumber, which is likely, but because it buys into the false premise multiculturalism is built on.<br> The false premise is from some dead Western philosophy that purports that we are our brains, that we can all be appealed to by reason, that when any human has been shown the way of a more reasonable way of being we will adopt it like putting on a new suit.<br> In fact, in reality, as Heidegger proved, we EMBODY practices. We learn how far apart from each other to stand in an elevator or how far apart to stand from each other when talking from being in the world with other people. Only from being in the world from people who ENCOUNTER problems and solve them intelligently can we pick up the disposition. Being in the world Is how we socialize, how we learn what to be embarrassed about and how to have grit. You can&#039;t simply tell or teach a low life deadbeat to be ashamed to sell crack or not raise his kids, you can&#039;t &quot;teach&quot; him to work hard with some information, with showing. It takes decades of being in the world.<br> Phenomenology, which is a deeper and truer way of looking at stupid brown people than subject\/object type IQ testing shows the case for racism much stronger because we aren&#039;t just getting people who we can reason into being at a mean 10% dumber than us. All the white non racists can do is go into the backwards brown areas and &quot;BE&quot; with them to elevate them above animals. No white people on the right or the left are going to do this so let&#039;s pay them to leave now.","filename":"heidegger","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":338,"tn_w":184,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493599800575,"time":1493599800,"md5":"2jyNxpEiEAxjD25ov8OS7Q==","fsize":19049,"resto":0,"id":"+ssfpiVj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"recent-chatter-about-race-and-iq","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123554681,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)20:59:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;All the white non racists can do is go into the backwards brown areas and &quot;BE&quot; with them to elevate them above animals.

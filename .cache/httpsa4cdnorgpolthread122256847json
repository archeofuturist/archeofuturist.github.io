Up until then it will drift between 50 at most and 35 at least, when the numbers meaning nothing at all.","time":1492853043,"resto":122256847,"id":"5BZ33b1m","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":122258173,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:24:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122256847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122256847<\/a><br>post AWOO pls.","filename":"1488012780337","ext":".jpg","w":850,"h":599,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1492853049997,"time":1492853049,"md5":"QtPw\/wAceg7L\/QjI1ecbKw==","fsize":370247,"resto":122256847,"id":"VN8wkicB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122258177,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:24:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122258080\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122258080<\/a><br>not to mention they are still using the buzzfeed peepee dossier as the sole source","time":1492853055,"resto":122256847,"id":"9fxMFD9U","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122258194,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:24:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122257960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122257960<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;((((((((((sources)))))))))<\/span>","time":1492853071,"resto":122256847,"id":"bk+g5PP8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122258195,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:24:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"awooooooooo","filename":"4Dchesslol","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":409,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1492853071684,"time":1492853071,"md5":"lyBKdF92EXwMrEgx0hJT1w==","fsize":69334,"resto":122256847,"id":"+penUkSQ","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":122258198,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:24:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122258149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122258149<\/a>","filename":"1485148130681","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":250,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492853075016,"time":1492853075,"md5":"X0lNdNKY7gEPPnkFqagyqw==","fsize":91808,"resto":122256847,"id":"Q2zzOkUG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122258202,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:24:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122258129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122258129<\/a><br>probs not but if it gives america a chance to swing its dick around with minimal consequences i&#039;m all for it","time":1492853076,"resto":122256847,"id":"CZ92ZGug","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122258229,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:25:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122258084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122258084<\/a><br>I don&#039;t remember committing a sin 2000 years ago, fampai.","time":1492853101,"resto":122256847,"id":"AnpisNU\/","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":122258230,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:25:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122258173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122258173<\/a><br><br>Too lewd.","time":1492853101,"resto":122256847,"id":"kUosCF67","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122258239,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:25:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122258195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122258195<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump supporting ISIS in Indonesia now<\/span><br><br>All part of the 4 d chess?

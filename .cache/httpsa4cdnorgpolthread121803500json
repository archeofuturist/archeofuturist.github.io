Here&#039;s why:<br><br>1. Most people join for combat arms positions because that&#039;s the Corps&#039; basic purpose and the general culture of machismo that surrounds them. The problem with combat arms is that your career prospects when you get out of the service are fairly slim. Younger folks might argue that they&#039;re going to make a career out of it, but almost every young kid joining up says that. I know I did.<br><br>2. Advancement in the Corps is a bitch. Especially if you&#039;re in combat arms. Your chances of making to E4 or any higher in your first 4 year enlistment aren&#039;t great. What does this mean in practicality? First you&#039;re going to make less money. Next is the fact that the Marines, more than any other service, is strict about adherence to rank and chain of command, and as a private or at the very best a lance corporal, you&#039;re going to be everyone&#039;s bitch. The Navy, Air Force, and even the Army have easier paths to advancement. I joined the Navy and took advantage of a program that allowed me to come out of boot as an E-3 and make E-5 after about a year and a half of total service. <br><br>3. In general and culturally, the Marines is for dumb guys and latinos with short-man&#039;s syndrome. There&#039;s a certain nobility to living a spartan lifestyle, and being able to make due with being treated like shit, but I personally don&#039;t think it&#039;s worth it.","time":1492582627,"resto":121803500,"id":"IqWgULiS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121812697,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)02:17:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121812569\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121812569<\/a><br>It&#039;s funny you keep suggesting this to me because my particular city\/area code has a literal shortage of cops, since apparently nobody wants to become a cop in my city...I&#039;m just worried about passing that &quot;psych evaluation&quot;, but maybe at this point I&#039;m just self-sabotaging and making excuses","filename":"1473711753155","ext":".jpg","w":2464,"h":1648,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492582626173,"time":1492582626,"md5":"Dh9WUjw\/5dEiaLzaV+T6\/Q==","fsize":375060,"resto":121803500,"id":"cJVWqSPv","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121812747,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)02:17:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121812119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121812119<\/a><br>Most whites I met in the infantry and combat jobs were pretty level headed, very common sense heavy but those are becoming far and in between by the time I was getting out<br><br>It was shitty watching all the solid Marines with combat experience being forced out while Tyrone, Lopez who could barely speak english and Peter Peckerwood stayed in to fuck up the next generation of Marines coming through<br><br>I wanted to stay in to make a positive influence any of the boots I got but it would&#039;ve been futile, the damage of the Obama years were done, hopefully Mattis can Make the Marine Corps Great Again<br><br>I haven&#039;t heard anything from my buddies still in, mostly more of the same","time":1492582657,"resto":121803500,"id":"0DoqQTSx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121812827,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)02:18:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121812438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121812438<\/a><br>Only an idiot would trust a woman with fidelity during deployment. <br><br>Only an idiot would get married during his enlistment. <br><br>Without exception, women will whore themselves out when their man leaves.

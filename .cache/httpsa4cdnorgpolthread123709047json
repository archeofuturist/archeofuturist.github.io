We will call this counter-familial institution a cr\u00e8che. Various aspects of this cr\u00e8che will be simple expansions of existing, or clearly historically precedented, structures. The defining qualities of this supplanting institution will be first, its creation within the context of previous educational institutions undergoing their (long overdue) abolition, and second, its foundation in an explicit view towards the destruction of the family, and all its attendant ideological forms (manhood, motherhood, and the gender dyad.) While such an ambition may strike the contemporary leftist, impoverished in prescriptive approaches to ending gender as currently constituted, as harshly utopian, the initial stage of this would be a quite straightforward path toward universalism.<\/span>","time":1493690845,"resto":123709047,"id":"dcWSLwtl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123710427,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)22:10:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Vaccinations to eradicate diseases from HPV to measles would be delivered as standard. Healthcare provisions would include offering any given child control over the on-set of puberty. This measure would be especially helpful for those currently treated for \u201cGender Identity Disorder\u201d for their difficulties developing themselves as cis-gendered capitalist subjects. (In this context, transgendered children would come to no longer be considered disordered at all).

This would eventually become an anti-cultural process, characterized by a refusal to engage in regulatory placement within the increasingly outmoded lines of differentiation.<\/span><br><br>Pls bump you fags.","time":1493691043,"resto":123709047,"id":"dcWSLwtl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123711249,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)22:17:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123709047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123709047<\/a><br>Anime was a mistake.","time":1493691427,"resto":123709047,"id":"g8QxRN7o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

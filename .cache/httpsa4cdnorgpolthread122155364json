A percentage of their DNA comes from ancient Denisovan (a different human species than homo sapiens), which we do not share, and a percentage from another unknown ancient hominid.<br><br>People pretend to forget that hominids are just another living organism and subject to the same things that affect animal evolution. The aborigines&#039; isolation on the Australian continent for 60,000 years have kept their genes isolated to their stone age prehistory. They were not able to retromix in the way that other human subspecies have, as the eons passed. They started with their 60,000 year old ancient DNA (homo sapiens+ Denisovan+ unknown) and never were able to intermingle again due to their isolation for the past 60,000 years. <br><br>Google &quot;australia species evolved in isolation&quot;. Its a fascinating read, and once you read about how the plants and animals evolved in isolation after Australia drifted away, then you also understand the same happened with the Aboriginal people. <br><br>Europeans, who mixed with Neanderthals DNA, have up to 4% neanderthal genes. Aborigines have up to 6% denisovan genes and another up to 4% of unknown ancient human species. Meaning that Europeans are up to 14% entirely different human species from aborigines. So its not like they can represent all homo sapiens from 60,000 years go, since we don&#039;t share admixtures. But if you want to know what their branch of humans were like 60,000 years ago, there they are.","time":1492795039,"resto":122155364,"id":"M4d3W98\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122158888,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)13:20:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122157896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122157896<\/a><br><br>Wholeheartedly agree.

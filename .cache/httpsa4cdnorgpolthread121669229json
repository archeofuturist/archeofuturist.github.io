All men know we get the shaft in custody hearings. But it is more then that. Something like 93% of work place deaths are men.... If 20% of workplace deaths were women there would be News reports daily about it. Domestic abuse is almost neck in neck with men being the victim. 70% of suicides are men. Anyone watch 13 ways? I dont but my daughter does and she told me it is about a girl who commits suicide... Mind you that&#039;s tragic but it seems seldom that Hollywood depicts it as a tragedy if a man does this they sure as hell wouldn&#039;t make a series about it.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There comes a point while watching this that you realize or at least I did that Feminism is not for equality. They seem to be for power. Not even women&#039;s rights. Just power. They go out of their way to dismiss mens issues because to them they dont really matter.<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/wLzeakKC6fE","filename":"1491938822728","ext":".gif","w":217,"h":180,"tn_w":217,"tn_h":180,"tim":1492512426987,"time":1492512426,"md5":"P9JTM3gniSBT5N\/Chclceg==","fsize":1092506,"resto":0,"id":"S49j4InR","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-red-pill-movie","country_name":"Israel","replies":8,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":121669650,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)06:51:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121669229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121669229<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Dda<wbr>-0Q_XUhk","time":1492512692,"resto":121669229,"id":"PNtX+Klq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121669686,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)06:51:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"Never change Levi.","filename":"business-commerce-capitalism-anti_capitalism-anti_capitalists-bestsellers-selling-kscn6177_low","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492512716356,"time":1492512716,"md5":"Vu8QXPHZmqh+4bxI3p8\/gQ==","fsize":43224,"resto":121669229,"id":"dziKrI5x","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121672507,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)07:22:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121669686\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121669686<\/a><br>Say want you want about Stefan Molyneuism, at least he&#039;s an ideologist.","time":1492514546,"resto":121669229,"id":"S49j4InR","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":121673071,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)07:27:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121672507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121672507<\/a><br>I unironically do have an unhealthy fascination and respect for you and your kin.<br>Spin control would never be this great without you.","filename":"jewish depiction of God","ext":".jpg","w":908,"h":728,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":100,"tim":1492514862904,"time":1492514862,"md5":"JrxQl37hjiKJjzhvNdC9ng==","fsize":108625,"resto":121669229,"id":"dziKrI5x","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121673115,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)07:28:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121669229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121669229<\/a><br>The movie is out now -- has anyone watched it?

It seems like I can never find the proof of anything based on Libya. Some people claim that the people overthrew him from revolting, but other people say that Libya had great living conditions. I just want to know the truth so badly because If it turns out that the people liked him then they are obviously trying to replicate the same deveption in Syria. As they also did in Iraq. If there is any research or books I can read to help prove that the people of Libya liked Ghaddafi then id love to read it thanks.","filename":"ghadd","ext":".png","w":1366,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492448851816,"time":1492448851,"md5":"8XhKmvfjw9SX+S8mVKBTig==","fsize":835665,"resto":0,"id":"NQ0EWcQo","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-can-anybody-show-me-any-proof-that-ghaddafi","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":121550058,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)13:11:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"For example here is a interview in which Putin says that Libya has the highest living standard in Africa. Then Obama says something the opposite. I know western media is a lie so im inclined to believe Putin, Although I see so many claims that oppose each other that I cant determine the truth. Its the same thing with Syria and Assad. I cant determine if Libya\/Syria were overthrown by fake bullshit revolutionaries that were funded by the west, or if this arab spring theory is actually true(I doubt it is).","filename":"highest standard","ext":".png","w":862,"h":498,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":72,"tim":1492449067159,"time":1492449067,"md5":"zFaDWmpCCQN8o\/c18xALsQ==","fsize":540734,"resto":121549614,"id":"NQ0EWcQo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

First: It is now federal law that you must have health insurance under threat of tax penalty and potentially jail time. Second: All plans offered by all insurers must cover at a minimum these newly defined &quot;Essential Health Benefits&quot; which include things like birth-control (and yes, abortions) and the plans must cover these &quot;essential benefits&quot; regardless of the sex of the purchaser. Meaning that a 25 year old man must legally buy coverage, and that coverage must include cervical cancer screenings and pregnancy tests.Part 3: of the ACA is about creating &quot;Risk sharing pools&quot; which is basically just paper pushing on the part of the insurance companies. &quot;The obamacare exchanges&quot; so everyone who buys a plan from within the exchange, all the funds from those premiums and deductibles go into one collective bucket to pay for the insurance\/health needs of the people paying into those plans. The problem is - Young people who don&#039;t want\/need insurance aren&#039;t paying for it, so the old\/sick people who do buy these plans get stuck with huge price tags.","time":1493925194,"resto":124093613,"id":"9X9XahxB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124096043,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)15:13:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124093613\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124093613<\/a><br>I got a question, if my dad is on social security and retirement money, and my mother is on aca healthcare because of diabetes, will she lose her insurance?

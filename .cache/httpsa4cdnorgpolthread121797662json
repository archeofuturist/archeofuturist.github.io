These drugs fuck with chemicals in your brain. If you overload the seratonin circuits by taking SSRI&#039;s, the receptors on your neurons get expressed less. This means that when you stop using the drug, your neurons will be harder to stimulate. Similarly for Adderal, it overstimulates dopamine neurons. This effect is pretty similar to how nicotine works, you get dependant because you need the drugs to get the same level of stimulation. I study pharmacy and the more I learn, the less likely I am to ever use drugs. They fuck up your body, especially things designed for influencing the brain. Unless you are depressed to the point of killing yourself which is fixable by SSRI, I would never reccommend them. Amfetamines are a bit less bad as cognitive enhancers, if we are talking shit like Ritalin and not methamfetamine, as the latter destroys your dopamine neurons and releases all of the dopamine inside, giving a very large high but doing irreperable damage to your brain tissues<br><br>tl;dr: drugs are bad, don&#039;t trust the (((pharmaceutical industry)))","time":1492586117,"resto":121797662,"id":"60MupY24","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121817196,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)03:16:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121817103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121817103<\/a><br>may I ask how many you had?","time":1492586168,"resto":121797662,"id":"w+LFveTT","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121817329,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)03:18:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121800636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121800636<\/a><br>But what if you experience psychosis without a certain medication, but you are required to take SSRIs at the same time if you want the anti-psychotic?","time":1492586280,"resto":121797662,"id":"iw1JJUpH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121817397,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)03:18:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121797662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121797662<\/a><br>Awesome OP!<br><br>As long as a doctor prescribes it there&#039;s nothing to worry about.<br><br>If things start to fall apart again, talk to the Dr. about upping the dose!","filename":"1485378907110","ext":".jpg","w":272,"h":318,"tn_w":106,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492586334793,"time":1492586334,"md5":"tO5PPh0tF2rLZuVMEkFOZA==","fsize":37390,"resto":121797662,"id":"XFXpCYS4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121817490,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)03:20:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121817329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121817329<\/a><br><br>Are you experiencing it?

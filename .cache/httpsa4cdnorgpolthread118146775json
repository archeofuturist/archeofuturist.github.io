The Tokharoi were a Sarmatian tribe, part of the Yuezhi confederation that lived in Gansu until they moved to Xinjiang and eventually got kicked out to Afghanistan by the Xiongnu. These Yuezhi were also Caucasians, but of a different ethnicity and different language. Presumably an early researcher found the two neighboring white folks and conflated them together. Linguistically, the &quot;Tocharians&quot; belong to the early wave* of Indo-European diversification, whereas the Yuezhi, the Sakas, and other Scytho-Sarmatian types are literal Iranic Aryans, a product of much later Indo-European differentiation in the steppeland.<br><br>*think Celts, Hittites, etc","time":1490403183,"resto":118146775,"id":"vGG0fYwY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118161295,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:54:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118157726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118157726<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Call others retarded<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is retarded<\/span>","filename":"tard","ext":".png","w":346,"h":256,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1490403288800,"time":1490403288,"md5":"7QpFDwxLNJFF9ptB7+fqtQ==","fsize":44264,"resto":118146775,"id":"gqkQK6wH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118161428,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:55:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118150823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118150823<\/a><br>i swear i&#039;ve seen this thread and this post before","time":1490403354,"resto":118146775,"id":"DYyd8kVt","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118161506,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:56:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118151273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118151273<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Levant was Roman and jewish.

Islam didn&#039;t just happen to come along at the right time. It was created by the Byzantine-Persian wars.<br><br>The Arabs had always raided Byzantine lands. There was no great muslim conquest - it just happened that one year the Muslims raided into the Levant and the Byzantines didn&#039;t have enough troops to chase them back into the desert, because they were too weak after their wars with Persia. So the Arabs raid further, and news of their success reaches the rest of Arabia. Like hyena&#039;s snipping at the edge&#039;s of an elderly lion&#039;s kill, when there were enough of them they moved in and managed to take Egypt, the Levant and Syria from the Greeks. It was an organic process more than a planned invasion.<br><br>As far as modern historians (the ones who dare research the subject, anyway) can work out, Islam started out as a dissident sect of Judeo-Christianity (not unlike Mormonism). It also probably started quite a bit further north, nearer Byzantine Syria than Mecca. The point being that there were dozens of these sects - one of them would have ended up being the religion of the Arabs. The majority of arabs in the original conquest probably weren&#039;t Muslim. Certainly no Persian or Greek writers at the time mention a new religion waging a holy war against them, and the archaeological evidence for the practice of Islam at that time is extremely scant. But about a hundred years after the conquest there was a civil war among the arabs. It may well be that the winning faction belonged to Muhammed&#039;s sect, and rewrote history to make their founder God&#039;s last prophet and the conquest a jihad.","time":1490404885,"resto":118146775,"id":"kn2XvqTQ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118164633,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:22:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118163387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118163387<\/a><br>sounds like now the Chinamen are trying the slow approach to genocide by relocating ethnic chinese and the killing the others off using the police and outbreeding them.

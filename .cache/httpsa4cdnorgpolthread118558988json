Their end goal is the UK becoming a low tax, light regulation, little welfare, offshore free market hub.<br><br>They want to get Brexit through first, and later on present that transformation as the only viable economic future for the country. Akin to how they sold off public entities like British Rail and soon to be the NHS, run the thing dry through underfunding and then point that the only way to fix it is privatisation.<br><br>Goodbye workers&#039; rights. Goodbye environmental protections. Goodbye British industry. Goodbye NHS.<br><br>The majority of people who voted for Brexit will get the opposite of what they actually want.

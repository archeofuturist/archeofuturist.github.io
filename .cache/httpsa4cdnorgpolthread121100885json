And, according to a recent study, some might well be. One of the authors of the study was hired by companies to evaluate managers \u2014 mostly middle-aged, college-educated, white males \u2014 for a management development program. It turns out that these managers scored higher on measures of psychopathy than the overall population, and some who had very high scores were candidates for, or held, senior positions. In general, managers with higher scores were seen as better communicators, better strategic thinkers, and more creative. However, they were also seen as having poor management style, not being team players, and delivering poor performance. But, apparently, this didn\u2019t prevent some of them from being seen as having leadership potential. The authors conclude that \u201cthe very skills that make the psychopath so unpleasant (and sometimes abusive) in society can facilitate a career in business even in the face of negative performance ratings.\u201d<br>http:\/\/www.sociopathworld.com\/2010\/<wbr>06\/corporate-sociopath.html","time":1492200961,"resto":121100885,"id":"wvfxyv0B","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":121106979,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)16:16:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121106339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121106339<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121105954\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121105954<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121104549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121104549<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121104280\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121104280<\/a><br><br><br>Learn that nobody respect a lap dog; this mean, learn to have your own &quot;humor&quot; \/ character.

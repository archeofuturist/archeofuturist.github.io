In addition, there is strong evidence that the role of the US interests in Yugoslavia after the Second World War, represented in Truman\u2019s and Eisenhower\u2019s foreign policy, was similar to their role in Western Europe. This role consisted in providing political and economic support for the regime as a counterweight to the \u201chard\u201d socialism of the Soviet Union and its European satellites. Therefore, we cannot attribute the significantly faster growth of Western economies to a disproportionate help by the United States as compared to Yugoslavia.<\/span>","filename":"p.txt","ext":".jpg","w":738,"h":1600,"tn_w":57,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493225544286,"time":1493225544,"md5":"YvK3mDhuDvNOBmE6MpGAzA==","fsize":211252,"resto":122880571,"id":"CBO\/p1YN","country":"AT","m_img":1,"country_name":"Austria"},{"no":122905661,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:53:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122904351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122904351<\/a><br>Lad, we&#039;ve been doing this for millennia.<br>Don&#039;t try and outbeady the Anglo.","filename":"IMG_0152","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":876,"tn_w":102,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493225603112,"time":1493225603,"md5":"cYuVEM37HxNU5Pc2siYoYw==","fsize":313561,"resto":122880571,"id":"+EtxEhjx","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122905672,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)12:53:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122893142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122893142<\/a><br>Coming from a degenerate cousin fucking Turk this made me a luuul.

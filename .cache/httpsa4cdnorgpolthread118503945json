Unless if you aren&#039;t a literal island separated from mainland markets that has no other reason to have that much capital within it (no special geopolitical location, no special resources), other than luck. This means that any capital retained from spoils of wars from both wars, colonialism and basically bombing the rivaling markets in Europe is now about to spill everywhere.<br><br>If that wasn&#039;t enough, there is one additional fact - the fact that you lack mainland connections to any markets whatsoever - which means that whatever you produce will ALWAYS be more expensive than its equivalent in the rest of the world due to the fact alone that you have to ferry it and THEN transport it by road, while everyone else just transports it by road.

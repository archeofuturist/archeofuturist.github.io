Whatever semblance of &#039;democracy&#039; that exists in the business unions (and it&#039;s very, very little) would ensure that the white &#039;workers&#039; would rather support the ambiguous stances of the official labor bureaucracy than to support some pro-immigrant labor stance coming from First-World &#039;Marxist&#039; groups.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Leadership of the First-World trade-unions is simply out of reach for most Marxist-Leninist groups. Either the group must spit a line that is objectively not in the &#039;workers&#039; material economic interests (supporting in the importation of immigrant labor), or they are seeking to lead a Labor Aristocracy and thus might as well stop calling themselves Marxist-Leninists.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The best actual Marxist-Leninist groups could do in the imperialist labor apparatus is to act as spies; write down as much information as possible on how their organizations work and function, get dirt on as many labor leaders as possible, and wait for a time when such information could be useful; i.e., handing potentially violent people the information against particularly loud and vocal imperialist labor lieutenants, in the hopes they end up in a grave.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/DebateComm<wbr>unism\/comments\/67gbzv\/strategic_pos<wbr>ition_of_immigration_in_marxism\/","time":1493873480,"resto":124017892,"id":"y20sJVly","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124020991,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:55:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124017892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124017892<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;32 years old<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no family, career, or future<\/span><br><br>The good thing about Antifa&#039;s poisonous ideology is that it encourages them not to breed.

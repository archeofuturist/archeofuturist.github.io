Ive been seeing the occasional thread about the robotic &quot;trump 26th&quot; voice and the concern it is going to be some nuclear false flag. The day he won, during his speech i shit you not, i heard something similar coming through my television. A faint voice repeating a short phrase over and over and over. I was never able to make out what it was saying and even blew it off until these threads started popping up. No larping here. Did anyone else experience this? Seems awfully coincidental to me. Could anyone find this footage and confirm what im saying? Who or what was the point of the hijacked broadcast? Who could have such means and information to this during his speech, moments after he won? <br><br>Discuss","filename":"images","ext":".jpg","w":260,"h":194,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":186,"tim":1492924338487,"time":1492924338,"md5":"Vk1rrawOHibHywWFJ4tERA==","fsize":12222,"resto":0,"id":"K2nXLzet","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"first-time-posting","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

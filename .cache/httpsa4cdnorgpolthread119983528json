We are outraged! JIM has found beyond any doubt that sryian regime has used chem weapons against its own people Syrian regime is much murderer and gruesome. Assad did this because he thought he could get away with it, because he knew russia would have its back. As I warned on wed, when un sec council fails to act, WE ACT! USA! USA! USA! We will not stand by when chem weapons are used. We destroyed airbase. We much justified. Moral stain of assad regime could no longer go unanswered. Time to say ENOUGH! USA! USA! USA! Assad must never use chemical weapons again. EVER! However, Iranian gob mint is also responsible. It has shielded Assad and it is also bloodthirsty. Russians also much responsible. Russia was gonna use its veto, so we had to act. USA! USA! USA! Compromising our resolution would only strengthen Assad. Even more than that, Russia is supposed to be a guarantor for removal of chem weapons in Syria. THINK ABOUT THAT? That has not happened. Lets think about possible reasons of russias failure. It could be that Russia is knowingly allowing this, or they are incompetent, or it could be that Assad regime is playing russians for fools, telling them they don`t have chem weapons, all the while stockpiling them. World is waiting for Russia to reconsider its alliance with Assad. USA won`t wait anymore. But now we must move to new phase. We expect Assad and allies to tai political process forward, for Iran to accept ceasefires, blablabla. USA took very measured step. We are prepared to do more but hope it is not necessary.

Question to that stated that Syrian Arab Republic perpetrated an act of aggression without defining that act within charter of UN. At dawn today, USA waged a flagrant act of aggression against an airbase of Syria which led to martyrs and damage (including women and children). This is a grave violation of UN charter. US attempted to justify with empty pretexts and fabricated arguments, claiming SAA used chem weapons without identifying who was responsible, very same pretext shouted out by terrorist orgs as well as their handlers in doha, tel aviv, paris, etc. SAA does not have chem weapons and would never use such weapons against armed terrorist groups. It is well known that those weapons have been stockpiled in many parts of Syria by terrorist armed organization, in cooperation, or rather by wink and a nudge, including Qatar, Saudi and Turkey. They completely ignore all the fact of chem weapons used by terrorists in many parts. This aggression sends erroneous message to terrorist groups, emboldening them to use chem weapons in the future. ISIS and associate terror groups waged many attacks following this aggression. Us and our allies are confronting them. USA aggression is under this umbrella, a grave extrapolation of same erroneous startegy of providing assistance to \u201copposition groups\u201d. This harms counter-terrorism. USA leads a purported alliance against ISIL, however, real achievement is to kill civilians and strike at infrastructure i nSyria. Its real objective is to weaken Syria and its alliances. In this context, the strike was an attempt to protect ISIL elements falling b\/w Iraq and Syria, opening a corridor for them.<\/span>","time":1491586020,"resto":119983528,"id":"2ty0wIJy","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119986705,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)13:27:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"What&#039;s the

The attack was designed by Mattis, and was an example of Trump flexing his muscle in the Syrian conflict in order to signal that chemical weapons usage would be met with coordinated retaliation. This signal went out to Assad and the (((rebels))) alike.<br><br>The chemical weapons attack carried out by Assad is not confirmed by independent investigators (UN), and very well could have been a false flag of sorts. The attack did happen and it was Assad&#039;s forces, however the details of the attack are where contention is currently at. Russia and Syria claim that it was an attack against a terrorist weapons cache, while the l\u00fcgenpresse claims that Assad used chemical weapons against his own citizens and killed many children in the attack.<br><br>The long term affects are still up in the air, however Russia is now ramping up defensive infrastructure support in Syria, possibly with aims to end the conflict in a more timely manner. Russia is also sending a force towards the ship that the USA launched the missile strike from. The event took place during discussions with Xi Jingping; a large component of these investigations involve North Korea. The USA muscle flexing in Syria signals a heightened willingness to engage in military conflict, which may lead the Chinese to be less favorable of North Korea&#039;s antagonism. Also, Russia&#039;s increased defensive presence in Syria may very well prevent further Israeli involvement.<br><br>I see a lot of varying discussion still in these threads.

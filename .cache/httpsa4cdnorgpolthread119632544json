The only people I hear talking about their (anxiety) are young women or wimpy boys and wimpy older men and women. Men have (anxiety) less because if they do not get over it they end up homeless. People pander women so much that when they claim anxiety nobody calls out their bullshit so they never grow out of thier insecurities.<br><br>I know a person that talked about her anxiety all the time. I nearly wrote it off as I usually do. ut upon her explaining it, it sounded legitimate. She has chrones and her anxiety is her shitting her pants because she can&#039;t get to a bathroom in time so she does not get out too much. She shits 5 times a day and it is always diarrhea so it cant be held in.<br><br>On the other hand my sister has claimed anxiety and I felt like it was total bullshit. She had just graduated and did not know what to do with her life... therefore (anxiety). She has since moved out, gotten a boyfriend, and has a reasonable job a litle over a year after graduating. Guess what? No more talk of (anxiety). <br><br>Most of this anxiety shit is just people wanting coddling. It needs to fucking stop. It is the new bullshit buzzword of the decade. This facebook, twitter, tumblr mental illness circlejerking is fucked up. It is also people wanting to have a mental illness so that they can get out of doing shit or be able to write off their umderperformance.<br><br>Bit of a rant but it has been bugging me for a while.","filename":"IMG_1559","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":215,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":107,"tim":1491414772605,"time":1491414772,"md5":"EauIr8khdTL3odj8unkhoQ==","fsize":997266,"resto":0,"id":"bEZyQnJu","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"society-refusing-to-callout-your-bullshit-anxiety","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

I believe I have figured it out.<br><br>The ultimate provocateur. Using his flamboyant homosexuality, his inflammatory tactics, and wielding the facts and logic that the left so desperately wants to pretend doesn&#039;t exist, Milo has an uncanny ability to draw out the true nature of those who spout regressive left ideologies without so much as a second thought. He is the cause for the Berkeley riots, and now he seeks to return. Not just for one day, or one speech, but for a week. And he claims he will bring an army if he needs to.

His planned appearance is announced now, but is occurring in the fall. So much time, for him to return to his most hated state after his fall from grace. It seems the perfect mix to not only draw out the rage and crazy actions of the left, but also for them to plan. They are currently capable of organizing (as much as they can), and he plans on having his Free Speech Rally out in the open, in a public plaza.

Then in their most despicable moment, those not involved in the deed but who are enemies of Milo, will have to make the judgement call to either show respect and denounce the action, or to reveal their true beliefs. We are fully aware of their ability to show respect. It doesn&#039;t exist. And when the public is appalled at what has occurred, the left will further their disgust by supporting it.<br><br>Milo will die for America&#039;s sins.","filename":"ForOurSins","ext":".jpg","w":1484,"h":947,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":159,"tim":1493401488600,"time":1493401488,"md5":"IbrnDARSKOl+KEot4JVfNA==","fsize":177536,"resto":0,"id":"5jcCHeQf","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"milos-return-the-savior-prophecy","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

It makes me wonder if we really are deplorables and if the opposition would be righeous if they cut us down? I mean, for all their faults, the Muslims are at least fighting for what they believe is right and they appear to be more popular among the mainstream then ourselves in spite (or perhaps because?) of their targets being the very people that admire them, and when you compare that to the rampant corruption of our own countries and how our leaders appear to be content to sit around and accept bribes, one can see where those accusations of hypocracy might have some base? <br><br>Are we the good guys still? I would feel no guilt at all upholding the Lord&#039;s will, but neither would I fault anyone for attempting to slew me for standing in the way of progress. Is this a lapse of faith? I think the Pope allowing the Saracens to pray in our holy city is a mistake, but he might be onto something attempting to learn how the Muslims have managed to connect to the liberal peoples of the world where we have failed in spite of the fact that they&#039;re arguably more conservative than we.","filename":"Confused_Crusader","ext":".jpg","w":205,"h":205,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490519184568,"time":1490519184,"md5":"uoZpwczEC2yIASMi2rlxOA==","fsize":6286,"resto":118339803,"id":"KYXYGMCn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118341713,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)05:07:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118341653\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118341653<\/a><br><br>Darn it, I meant the Vatican.

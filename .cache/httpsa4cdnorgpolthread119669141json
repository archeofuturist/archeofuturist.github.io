Hitler was marxist and christian, but he didn&#039;t followed Christ&#039;s precepts, just like Satan. He even made a chart for god by telling he would destroy the humanity.<br>Socialism is a path for communist, so forget about this &quot;nacional socialism isn&#039;t leftist&quot; or &quot;fascism works&quot; because fascism is something you can easily find in socialist countries such as Italia forcing Hotel owners to shelter rapefugees for 5 euros per head, it surely don&#039;t work.<br>The only difference from nazism and the tradicional socialism is that Hitler imposed the marxist idea of the creation of the new men by promoting the aryan people rather than blacks like the globalists are doing right now with muslims, otherwise the leftists would idolize nazism just like they do with every other communist regime.","filename":"born-to-nothing-world-is-a-spook-kill-em-all-3349998","ext":".png","w":500,"h":733,"tn_w":170,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491432874189,"time":1491432874,"md5":"okRGC8YfwATGeMGSoZ7dkA==","fsize":60176,"resto":0,"id":"4\/3PZPrY","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-yea-nazism-came-from-marxism-it-has-commie","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

People seem assblasted that we incorporated pagan symbols into our worship of christ, but on the other hand that makes catholicism definitively european (inb4 hurr durr kike on a stick). If I still make hard boiled easter eggs, who the fuck cares, it&#039;s a nifty seasonal thing to do like putting some heating on during winter season, I&#039;m not praying to some pagan goddess. Jesus supplanted all that when the new covenant was made. People who weren&#039;t jews had to make do with what mythology they got inspired through and did their best. Some elements of christianity can be found in other myths, like death and rebirth, indicating that while pagans had a vague idea. That&#039;s for the &quot;catholics aren&#039;t christians&quot;.<br><br>Concerning catholicism, people here have an issue with the current pope and I understand it. He&#039;s not very hard line, and seems like one gigantic media plant to make the normies like the church again. \/pol\/ doesn&#039;t like him because he is so pro refugees. I don&#039;t like that either but however the pope is right that refugees are humans that God wanted to exist and created, so it&#039;s not my place to judge. What we should do is treat them humanely and do them the best service we could, which is pacify their homelands and allow them to have a good life there. That&#039;s for the &quot;cuckery&quot; aspect.<br><br>Now, depending on your roots or heritage, it might make more sense to go catholic or orthodox. I know that catholics in the US are pretty strong in their faith since everyone spits on them for stuff that isn&#039;t understood. I don&#039;t know much about the orthodox church. I know that in the orthodox church the services are really long and that the worship through icons is very important to the faith. Orthodox church also is less centralized, so a serbian, a greek or a russian church with a service in english will have a different feel.","time":1493405766,"resto":123223782,"id":"EjPhWbXz","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":123229798,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:57:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123228924\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123228924<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;appeal to authority <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;with anyone other than God<\/span><br><br>Almost like you should just shut down your brain and do whatever they say.<br><br>Huh anon?","time":1493405873,"resto":123223782,"id":"qTnpnLYS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123229895,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:58:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123223782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123223782<\/a><br><br>Roman Catholic Here<br>Ill tell you what my priest always told me.<br><br>Now I do consider the Orthodox my fellow bros<br><br>Here&#039;s what the REAL reason for division<br><br><br>Theyll make it about &quot;we broke off first at this meeting at this date&quot; and on with allt his jargon<br><br>What really it is all about under the dates and times is that the Greeks (Greeks were known for disloyalty in ancient Roman times of Caesar)<br>Wanted to no longer be subservient to the city of Roma and the Bishop there, There are plenty of Church Fathers that blatently held to the Bishop of Rome being above ALL.<br><br>It was about political power and wanted to answer to NO ONE. <br><br>While the Orthodox have repented of their pacifism in recent times, historically it is the Roman Catholics that went Deus Vult and started inquisitions, banishing kikes and Achmeds. <br><br>The Orthodox are infamous for surrendering to Islam unfortunately, and that reflects their doctine.<br><br>like worms on the ground&quot; like pathetic beggars. <br><br>The Catholics have monks that give it all up, but its not about glorying in shame, it&#039;s about a sincere care for the poor and a love for masochism as a \/d\/ tier neet. <br><br>Saitn Anthony once said paraphrased <br>&quot;Those other monks are not like us, they deny themslves for all the wrong reasons.&quot; That quote is found in &quot;sayings of teh desert fathers.&quot;<br><br><br>We also have better art. <br><br>I&#039;ve found most Orthodox to be edgier than Catholics.

Turns out most of them are malevolent, evil, manipulative and selfish beyond measure.<br>I once was naive and in love with a girl. Small-framed, smart, &quot;loving&quot; and the most beautiful thing in the world. Or at least I thought so. She cheated on me, manipulated me and tried to rob me of everything I&#039;ve ever had and built, even my family. I came out a broken and bitter man. Hateful and vengeful, with the law and society being against me I turned to the military. <br>That was 11 years ago. For the last decade I&#039;ve been this wreck of a person, with no character traits other than grief and anger. These few moments of the old me returning was during combat. Deployments freed me, even though they should have constricted me to orders, rules of engagement and so on. When I went back to Poland and quit, I felt empty and I was and am empty.<br>If you&#039;re still young, don&#039;t go for a relationship now. Wait until you&#039;ve built something that you won&#039;t abandon like I did.","filename":"cunt","ext":".png","w":525,"h":599,"tn_w":219,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492534013809,"time":1492534013,"md5":"FmUzistLNrTfApCD2YgJyQ==","fsize":606057,"resto":0,"id":"S+6Dfqft","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dont-fall-for-the-trap-of-finding-the-love-of","country_name":"Poland","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":121706013,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)12:48:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121705786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121705786<\/a><br>So...

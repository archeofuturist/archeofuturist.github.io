I&#039;ll give you an example. <br><br>I like to take things to the extremes when examining political views. Let&#039;s look at minimum wage. The extreme left says that everyone should be guaranteed a &quot;living wage&quot; whatever the fuck that is. Conservatives - especially business owners like myself - prefer that there be no minimum wage and the market should set it. So let&#039;s say the government did that. If we take the minimum wage down to zero, shittier jobs like the NEETS on 4chan seek will probably drop a little, but not a lot. Menial jobs like mowing lawns that are usually occupied by criminals and illegals, will drop to the market rate of employing criminals and illegals. As those employees earn their keep, their wages will go up. No one should &quot;live&quot; on minimum wage. Even niggers get jobs paying much more because their work is worth it, economically speaking. <br><br>Now lets examine the extreme of making everyone earn $100 an hour. Suddenly a big mac costs $80 and a night out with the significant other will cost $750-$1,000. Inflation skyrockets and we&#039;re all earning less because goods from other countries haven&#039;t matched our currency movement. <br><br>I&#039;m not an economist, but I do have a degree in Finance. I look at these examples as common sense. I can see that not having a minimum wage is better for the economy and any governmental intrusion is market friction and impairs it. <br><br>Left wing mods are there to weed out common sense, and they do a really fucking good job of it.","time":1491010910,"resto":119125176,"id":"8q4bQIW4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119128415,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:45:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119125176\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119125176<\/a><br>edgy people flock to the place where people won&#039;t kick them.","time":1491011134,"resto":119125176,"id":"JkFV76qg","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119128574,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:47:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119125176\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119125176<\/a><br>Because once shitlibs figure about that bogey can&#039;t control the specific site they&#039;ll abandon it and won&#039;t really bother.","time":1491011228,"resto":119125176,"id":"D44\/JlQp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119128756,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:49:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119128044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119128044<\/a><br>Your argument is flawed.

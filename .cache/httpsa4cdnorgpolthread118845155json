He should have shot him in the toenail or something. I stubbed my toe while shopping in Whole Foods for my activated organic grass fed free range asparagus, and the pain was so intense I immediately fell over and starting crying. I&#039;m sure it would be the same for others as well.","time":1490831164,"resto":118845155,"id":"90W3wHng","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118852509,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)19:48:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118852221\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118852221<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shot him in the toenail<\/span><br>Dude not cool, I lost my big toenail in August and it still hasn&#039;t fully grown back.","time":1490831316,"resto":118845155,"id":"b9YDFw4w","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118852678,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)19:50:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118851235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118851235<\/a><br><br>this comes down to the fact that humans have shitty reflexes <br><br>if you&#039;re amped on adrenaline, charging a cop, it might take a second to feel all those bullets ripping through you. <br><br>and if you&#039;re a cop, you just keep shooting until the attacker stops charging forward.","time":1490831420,"resto":118845155,"id":"jW0ivK1M","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118853309,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)19:55:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118845155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118845155<\/a><br>The officer should have had the taser, as it is preferable to make an arrest over killing, but that is the only thing I can blame him for.

He didn&#039;t deserve to be shot for who he was or what he did, but in all honesty he deserved to be captured and tortured by flaying until he died from blood loss, shock or exposure.

There was literally nothing shilly or off-topic about the thread. Did you see a toilet in the OP image (as it reflects my opinion of the place) and assume it&#039;s a thread about toilets? Fucking faggot mods with inferiority complexes whose greatest and most impactful achievement is moderating a joke board on a Somalian pottery imageboard. <br><br>Copy and paste of previous contributions to thread;-<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Whats a Faslane peace camp?<\/span><br><br>It&#039;s a protest site set up about a mile away from the Faslane naval base. It&#039;s where the UK&#039;s nuclear arsenal is kept along with nearby Coulport. It&#039;s been there for nearly 35 years and is the oldest site of its nature worldwide (apparently). It used to be extremely active in actions penetrating the base, causing blockades and holding regular demonstrations. These days, in its current guise and with its current residents, it is little more than a jumped-up squat.<br><br>The fundamental structure is that of Anarchy, no hierarchy, organisation without leaders, that kind of shit. It doesn&#039;t work. In order for Anarchy to be effective, everybody needs to be a good Anarchist. In reality, you have a few really capable, useful, smart, productive and proactive members whose energy is drained by a cabal of lazy, entitled and retarded fucks who spend the day scavenging from the more sensible activists and whatever visitors the site has. A regular consequence is that those who could really turn the place into an effective thorn in the side of the military become angry, jaded and disillusioned before leaving the place altogether.","filename":"faslane","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492944828425,"time":1492944828,"md5":"6oGcksi7Myho67jQCy+tLA==","fsize":211846,"resto":0,"id":"HudlX0MR","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"former-faslane-peace-camper","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122409945,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)06:54:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;I imagine it&#039;s filled with fucking loons and old confused hippies at this point.

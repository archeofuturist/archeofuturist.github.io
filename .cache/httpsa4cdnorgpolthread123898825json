First, I define liberty:<br><br>Let the right to liberty be the right to carry out your will only of your own body (unless you have consent to do so to another), insofar as your will does not conflict with the right to liberty of another person. Let this be the fundamental law.<br><br>Next, I prove that private property follows as a corollary to this law:<br><br>Let person A use his time to make use of natural resources. I say that the resources A makes use of belongs to him and is subject to his will and only his will unless he provides consent to another, say person B, to make use of the resource; this resource is A&#039;s property. If not, then let person B come along and deprive A of the resources A has made use of. It is A&#039;s will to achieve an end, and to achieve this end A must make use of previously unappropriated resources (for the sake of argument, assume these resources were previously unclaimed as property). If B comes along and deprives A of these resources, B deprives A of the means by which A intends to achieve his desired end. The end lies with the means such that the means leads to the end and without the means there is no end: depriving the means implies depriving the end. This violates the law. Thus B may not deprive A of his resources. Thus he resources are A&#039;s private property.<br><br>What do you guys think of this? Point out any flaws if you see them.

The caveat, however, hides a conflict of loyalties that would plague a libertarian society: on the one hand are the particular loyalties of one&#039;s preferred Utopian community; on the other hand, loyalty to the larger \u201cframework for utopias\u201d; within which one&#039;s utopia exists. The second loyalty implies a value relativism incompatible with the first one, meaning either that loyalty to the libertarian framework will undermine the utopias within it, or that the particular values of the utopias will destabilize the libertarian framework. The durability of a libertarian society, then, requires a mentality best characterized as nihilistic. In this, libertarianism differs from liberalism but is surprisingly similar to the cultural diversity movement. The thesis is illustrated by examining John Gray&#039;s attempt to eschew both a hierarchy of values and moral relativism.<\/span>","time":1493822246,"resto":123898825,"id":"PROqbFYY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123917871,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)10:38:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"REMOVE AUTHORITARIANS<br><br>http:\/\/www.strawpoll.me\/12730090","time":1493822309,"resto":123898825,"id":"Vs+zUIRh","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":123918011,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)10:40:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123917871\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123917871<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;National Socialist<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Socialist<\/span><br>Physical removal is the only correct answer.","time":1493822402,"resto":123898825,"id":"995fd4YG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123918052,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)10:40:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123898825\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123898825<\/a><br>Is the flat taxer ITT?

I think you should start by explaining why self ownership is the basic and foundational insight into private property and the answer to resolve property disputes. For instance, if we didn&#039;t own our vocal chords, our brains and our bodies we could not act, and Mankind would die instantly. If A were owned by B whilst B had self ownership, a class of subhumans and superhumans would be created, which is invalid as a universal ethic. If A and B owned each others, they&#039;d need each other&#039;s consent to act and to appropriate resources, which would spell the instant death of Mankind since everyone would need everyone else&#039;s permission to move, yet those people would also need another person&#039;s permission, who in turn would need another&#039;s permission, ad infinitum. So we&#039;re left with each person owning his body by virtue of him being the sole direct controller over hid body. &quot;Only I can directly use my brain, my vocal chords, my arms, etc. and do such and such with them.&quot; Anyone who denies this enters into performative contradiction because he himself is using his body in order to argue for or against something.<br><br>I&#039;m not sure on <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If not, then let person B come along and deprive A of the resources A has made use of. It is A&#039;s will to achieve an end, and to achieve this end A must make use of previously unappropriated resources (for the sake of argument, assume these resources were previously unclaimed as property). If B comes along and deprives A of these resources, B deprives A of the means by which A intends to achieve his desired end. The end lies with the means such that the means leads to the end and without the means there is no end: depriving the means implies depriving the end. This violates the law. Thus B may not deprive A of his resources. Thus he resources are A&#039;s private property.<\/span><br><br>What do you mean by &quot;deprive him of his resources&quot;?

It merely morphed into something else. Despite the hundreds of thousands who marched in government-organised \u2018demonstrations\u2019 against it, there was not a single mass celebration of its fall. Why was this so? Because its fall was a ruse.<br><br>The KGB merely changed its name, changed a few key people, and continued operating with the same goals under the name of FSB\/SVR. The Illegals Program, which the FBI cracked down on in 2010, shocked the West, but it wouldn\u2019t have shocked anybody who\u2019d read the Perestroika Deception. Written by one of the highest-profile defectors to the US in the 80s, the book predicts the Soviet strategy with incredible precision. Anatoliy Golitskyn hit the nail on the head with this book, and together with Yuri Bezmenov and Ion Pacepa showed the West the dangers of cooperating with Russia.","filename":"7123XXMXARL","ext":".gif","w":305,"h":475,"tn_w":80,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491460336160,"time":1491460336,"md5":"cdtDnmWPEr2w7Wh5lQNaxQ==","fsize":165064,"resto":119714837,"id":"sU1mkvt8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119714897,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)02:32:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JVk<wbr>kLDAm8I4<br><br>Yuri Bezmenov deserves special mention, for exposing the strategy the Soviets intended to use to infiltrate the United States.

These useful idiots are instrumental in Russia\u2019s plan of portraying the United States as a neo-nazi, racist country bent on world supremacy. The KGB was the hotbed of anti-zionist and anti-American conspiracies, and its organisations (like the World Peace Council) have spewed anti-American propaganda since their early days.<br><br>The end goal is not to bring about a nuclear winter in the West, but to merge with it under the Soviets\u2019 terms. The annexation of Crimea was merely an example of a problem created to propose a solution and make Russia look open to cooperation. Another example is the Russian financing of Jihadist groups (exposed in Litvinenko\u2019s book \u201cBlowing Up Russia\u201d, shortly after releasing which he was killed by KGB agents in London). This is where the whole \u201cle saviour of Europa\u201d meme comes from: since there is no terror in Russia itself, Europeans perceive its policies as the deterrent to Islamic Jihad. In reality, it\u2019s the fact that they are the ones paying for it that makes it avoid them.","filename":"22Litvinenko-web2-facebookJumbo","ext":".png","w":1050,"h":549,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1491460392712,"time":1491460392,"md5":"cSz1kUpRfgFsoH3TFaXnTw==","fsize":871476,"resto":119714837,"id":"sU1mkvt8","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119714960,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)02:34:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Recommended Reading:<br><br>A Love Letter to America - Bezmenov<br>The Perestroika Deception - Golitsyn<br>Disinformation - Pacepa","filename":"49","ext":".jpg","w":237,"h":247,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491460441016,"time":1491460441,"md5":"sYnI\/SD8VPGrdLn8cq9E6g==","fsize":13713,"resto":119714837,"id":"sU1mkvt8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119715363,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)02:40:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Also: more on the domestic terrorist wave of the 80s.","filename":"daysofrage","ext":".png","w":1255,"h":5323,"tn_w":29,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491460852245,"time":1491460852,"md5":"qNy3gfldGOykwRhj1PtNXQ==","fsize":2624422,"resto":119714837,"id":"sU1mkvt8","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119715596,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)02:44:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119714915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119714915<\/a><br>where do the globalist jews come into play? they dont seem to like putin","time":1491461061,"resto":119714837,"id":"i2QURb4p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

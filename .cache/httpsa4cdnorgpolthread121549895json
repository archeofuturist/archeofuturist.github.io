Kratos was created with the assistance of the Israeli security forces, who made the point that the only effective way to prevent a suicide bomber from detonating was to fatally shoot him. So, the policy was to shoot suspected suicide bombers before they had a chance to detonate. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In 2005, police mistook Brazilian illegal immigrant Jean Charles de Menezes for a known terrorist.

Officers dutifully shot him. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Senior officers including Cressida Dick attempted to blame the firearms officers for the death of de Menezes.

The second important thing is never to give a damn. And that means you can just get up in front of people. The third thing, which is an old actor\u2019s technique, is you must never be frightened of making a fool of yourself. In actor\u2019s college, you go on, and they all laugh at you: \u201cLook at that idiot!\u201d They almost throw things at you. You imagine breaking your leg on stage. Once you\u2019ve made a mistake you\u2019re less afraid about making another one because you just step over the prospect that you might make one.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Another trick to all real performance is domination of the audience. You have to be up there, and they\u2019re looking at you. All rock stars and all these other people use some of these techniques because they\u2019ve gone into those areas. They\u2019re not allowed militarily too much. They\u2019re not allowed at all politically because then they may be authoritarian. So they\u2019ve gone into other areas. You can never destroy anything. You can just displace it. Usually to some internet site they haven\u2019t taken down yet.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But there is a degree to which these sort of techniques are very, very useful. Particularly in a democratic age, because you can speak to 40 and speak to three million using the internet as the weapon to do so. The irony is, you see, in politics you don\u2019t speak to people\u2019s minds. You speak to them physiologically. You speak to what\u2019s underneath the mind. Do you think you can raise men up into battle just by talking to what\u2019s mentally up here? You influence the brains of the men who will influence them. Your discourse will influence them by doing that, but you don\u2019t influence them by doing that.<\/span>","filename":"hqdefault","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492457109146,"time":1492457109,"md5":"V0AoMhbuc6r\/ZkNn4crMUw==","fsize":13313,"resto":121549895,"id":"8dV6z1yi","country":"GB","trip":"!!nIHFObhTBdm","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121567623,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)15:25:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121554482\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121554482<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;so serious journalist!<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;screen name is Imnotyourgirlfriend<\/span><br><br>I guess she was a regular commenter before she managed to get her shit included in the paper.","time":1492457109,"resto":121549895,"id":"sYnoD+nc","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121567664,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)15:25:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121549895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121549895<\/a><br>Using a Pallas poster on \/pol\/","time":1492457132,"resto":121549895,"id":"sBAPHgDK","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121567687,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)15:25:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121566755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121566755<\/a><br>Okay, I&#039;ll give to you lads, you whooped us at New Orleans.

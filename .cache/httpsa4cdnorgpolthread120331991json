You&#039;re saying they&#039;re doing it on purpose and it&#039;s not just them proving how hypocritical they are? Well if that&#039;s the case that makes the far leftists even worse and more sinister than just stupid. And minorities should resent them even more for what they&#039;re trying to do. And then minorities should have much more in common with conservatives who simply want them to be smart and intelligent so they can be hired based on merit and do a good job.","time":1491773017,"resto":120331991,"id":"FOf\/Hyq2","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":120339356,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:24:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120331991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120331991<\/a>","filename":"IMG_1664","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":220,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491773054419,"time":1491773054,"md5":"lQj+uKhhZS6j+lzrGVUJ\/A==","fsize":31928,"resto":120331991,"id":"\/22A20JI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120339455,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:24:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Cannot wait for next years national spelling bee competition<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Well Tamaquishayana, since you are a minority we are forced to accept that answer as correct<\/span><br>Dad right","time":1491773093,"resto":120331991,"id":"+5uOBbri","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120339462,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:24:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;(((science)))<\/span>","filename":"db9","ext":".jpg","w":1129,"h":1040,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":115,"tim":1491773097365,"time":1491773097,"md5":"2oI6txts5jvxJ2KISqvlHg==","fsize":182986,"resto":120331991,"id":"laRGf1NN","country":"PL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120339513,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:25:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120331991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120331991<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;don&#039;t teach nigs proper English<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it disadvantages nigs further by making them even less literate<\/span><br>kek, things just following their natural course","time":1491773118,"resto":120331991,"id":"dZPz60T+","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120339542,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:25:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120339141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120339141<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s a fake article<\/span><br>http:\/\/dailycaller.com\/2017\/04\/08\/s<wbr>cience-teachers-should-allow-ebonic<wbr>s-because-english-grammar-is-too-ha<wbr>rd-for-minorities-to-learn\/<br><br>Are you sure about that?","time":1491773132,"resto":120331991,"id":"FOf\/Hyq2","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":120339660,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:26:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s fake news you dumb fucks.

We all know they can&#039;t.<\/span><br>Key point you made there, it&#039;s like garlic to a vampire to mention that.<br>Asians tend to work very hard and apply themselves than many other minorities. So they are hired based on merit as should anyone be, merit based hiring is actually what destroys racism if anything does. Because at the end of the day whilst you will always have bigotry on a personal level, if someone does a really fucking good job, they would barely care on a job level with regards to what ethnicity that person is. <br>But the left fundamentally does not believe in that notion, they think smart blacks that do a really good job are just hated regardless. But fact is if blacks were model citizens that did everything right and were really competent and behaved nicely etc. people would be like &quot;great, i like that.. come be my neighbourgh, hey i was thinking i need someone really qualified in this, are you up for it?&quot;. <br>The whole point is that all try to improve themselves and become of merit regardless of ethnicity, so all become competent, starting to lower the bar so that incompetent people get hired is CREATING racism, because people then go &quot;why is that person hired he&#039;s not even competent, well he was that ethnicity so our racial quota says he should be hired&quot; that&#039;s race based hiring!!<br>And that&#039;s exactly what the left is trying to create, which is hysterical.. Whilst justifying it by telling incompetent minorities that they&#039;re poor or not hired &quot;because they are minorities&quot; and claiming they need race based hiring to address the situation..<br>No.. they are not hired because they are incompetent, they should become competent and then they will be hired.. It&#039;s essentially telling minorities that everything is about race instead of merit, and essentially telling them to not improve themselves.<br><br>TL;DR merit based hiring destroys racism, race based hiring creates it.","time":1491774174,"resto":120331991,"id":"FOf\/Hyq2","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":120342188,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:43:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120340016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120340016<\/a><br>Good point, very insightful, it&#039;s good to see a based leaf on this board once in a while.

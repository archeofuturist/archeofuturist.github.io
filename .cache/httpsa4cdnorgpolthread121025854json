He is right on many things but his out look is that nothing can be good unless the good reconize the dangers of modernity and resist evil. This is good at diagnosis of bad behaviours but it leads to a lot of needless infighting and blackpilling; as nothing will inherently improve through action and a lot of bad things are just God&#039;s punishment. Thus every good thing created that isn&#039;t Christian and antipoz is doomed for corruption and dissapointment as it does not fit his criterea for ultimate salvation. I love his work but he sometime comes off like Dan Carlin before he stopped rationalizing against the fact that Donald Trump was the shake up he was dreaming about.","time":1492150821,"resto":121025854,"id":"nUer5IWn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121028229,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)02:22:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"I prefer nobodytm","time":1492150954,"resto":121025854,"id":"P1bAwE8L","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121028260,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)02:23:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121025854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121025854<\/a><br><br>He&#039;s a blackpiller, liar and kike-enabler.

The fundamental problem is that he holds the belief that people do not consent to the consequences of their actions but also holds the previously stated quote when his rampant anti liberalism calls for crackdowns on Jewish iconoclasm and greed.","time":1492152203,"resto":121025854,"id":"nUer5IWn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

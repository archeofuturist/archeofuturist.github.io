Hitler&#039;s War and Nuremburg are absolute must reads -Riddled with redpills. <br><br>In Hitler&#039;s War, he asserts that Dolfie never made a direct order to exterminate the Jews. He was most likely a aware of any murders that occurred. Hitler stated that he wanted nothing to do with the &#039;Jewish problem&#039; until after the war was over. <br><br>If you haven&#039;t read Irving&#039;s work, you&#039;re really missing out.

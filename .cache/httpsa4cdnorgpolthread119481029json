Its very complex issue though. Its vital for Russia to at least have Afghanistan border to central asia closed as it would be major traffic for drugs\/weapons\/criminals. <br><br>Plus the danger of ISIS rise in Afghanistan is quite real too. I am not sure if negotiating with Taliban is correct approach, but given US and NATO leaves Afghanistan - it will be inevitable that country order changes and it is better to try to negotiate the peaceful compromise rather than see Kabul overrun by Talibs or instability caused by conflict creating good breeding ground for ISIS.<br><br>Russian main interests are secure border and destruction of drug trade\/plantations (something US ignored through all years of occupation), China invests lots of money in Afghanistan and interested in mining. Pakistan dont want conflict to spread on its own border.<br><br>US doesnt seem to be interested in anything but dron striking random Afghan and Paki villages.<br><br>Ideally all sides would want removal of Talibs, but since NATO failed - theres at least still chance to prevent another war and compromise on not making Afghanistan radical islamic state - though how it`ll work i am not sure, since Talibs ARE radically islamic: not the ISIS tier, but anti-secular , no woman rights, sharia rule radical.","time":1491321248,"resto":119481029,"id":"NUj6UF70","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119482527,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)11:55:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119481029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119481029<\/a><br>Whatever blood for the blood god.<br>I hope all of my schemes come into fructuition<br>Heil Tzeentch","time":1491321340,"resto":119481029,"id":"w\/v46lQT","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":119482618,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)11:56:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"we already left, good work retards","time":1491321401,"resto":119481029,"id":"rKIQ3Sqz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119482638,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)11:56:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119481029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119481029<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The three countries are going to support the Taliban against USA, because they think USA is using Afghanistan to destabilize the region.<\/span><br>Even if they did actually think that, that&#039;s fucking retarded. <br><br>There&#039;s no way in hell the Pakis, the Ivans, and the Chinks are siding with the fucking Taliban. <br><br>I mean, shit.

The game, imo has changed significantly after 9\/11 and is more focused on complete subversion and general destruction of a country with a follow through of quick liquidation of its assets, so &#039;shock therapy&#039; without the therapy. Much cheaper and profitable this way, but there&#039;s only so many ripe cherries you can snatch before the garden becomes empty you know what I mean? No one seems to want to cultivate anymore, just quick fixes like fucking druggies. Disappointing and really fucking dangerous.","time":1491341256,"resto":119481029,"id":"wjaKUjd9","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

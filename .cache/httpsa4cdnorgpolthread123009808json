We\u2019ve got a private multiplayer beta; we\u2019ve got zombies; we\u2019ve got black people, we\u2019ve got women, we\u2019ve got a Jew.<br><br>It reads like a marketer\u2019s checklist for suitable diversity, a roster of token characters that doesn\u2019t acknowledge their experiences more than it pats the publisher on the back. Sledgehammer staffers\u2019 repeated references to \u201cbrotherhood\u201d also speak clearly to the fact this game will be told from a very traditional perspective.<br><br>From what we saw and heard about this game today, that tradition doesn\u2019t genuinely include brothers of other races, or brothers who don\u2019t identify as male. It\u2019s important to note that segregation was still very much enforced during the time period, including within the American military. And judging by the attention Sledgehammer is paying to period firearms and the sounds they make, Call of Duty: WWII is all about preserving historical authenticity.<br><br>PLAYABILITY IS THE SPECIAL OBLIGATION OF INTERACTIVE ENTERTAINMENT.<br>That leaves fighters of color, fighters who are women, in supporting roles. It\u2019s not even known if they are playable. Playability is the special obligation of interactive entertainment in telling a story, an obligation that movies like The Guns of Navarone or The Longest Day don\u2019t face, even in hindsight 50 years later. A lot of different people are going to play Call of Duty: WWII. Just because brothers of different races didn\u2019t fight alongside each other doesn\u2019t mean that players in the year 2017 shouldn\u2019t inhabit and absorb all their experiences.","time":1493278370,"resto":123009808,"id":"\/+G5gzVp","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123010601,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)03:41:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123009808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123009808<\/a><br>Didn&#039;t see any Niggers in the trailer unlike battlefield so it could be a pass in my books.","time":1493278874,"resto":123009808,"id":"N7VmD499","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123010627,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)03:41:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123009808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123009808<\/a><br>This is retarded.

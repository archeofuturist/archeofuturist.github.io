I see the news and I truly feel disgusted and angry nowadays, because I know there is an agenda at work and it really pisses me off. I really wish people could understand the concept of billion dollar corporations pouring money into the system to make us brain dead robots. What makes it even more depressing is that you go on the internet and nobody seems to understand the concept of free speech anymore, and they cherish when a man loses their job for speaking their opinion, or when companies (even though it is their platform) up front reject certain opinions as hate speech and bans them. They call us fascist, when in reality its quite the opposite.","filename":"Capture","ext":".jpg","w":1055,"h":237,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":56,"tim":1490460786071,"time":1490460786,"md5":"Q1IjQOavE82Zt8+MEeSYgw==","fsize":63931,"resto":0,"id":"XiInG\/js","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-is-the-media-attempting-to-alienate-us","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118244074,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:56:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118243710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118243710<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I understand that Trump lost the vote<\/span>","filename":"1490448039864","ext":".jpg","w":1008,"h":1200,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490460988877,"time":1490460988,"md5":"TG6AJbxpH2EoGfDtCzAb0g==","fsize":180933,"resto":118243710,"id":"ORciAwR6","country":"GR","m_img":1,"country_name":"Greece"},{"no":118244159,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:57:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118244074\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118244074<\/a><br>I meant the healthcare vote.","time":1490461031,"resto":118243710,"id":"XiInG\/js","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

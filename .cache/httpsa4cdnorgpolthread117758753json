I want to explore the roots of the Christian faith in the Jewish faith, and allow my doubt that Jesus was the Messiah find some space in my head and its proper place.<br><br>If you are a Christian, or an Atheist, or a Jew, (or anyone of any faith) I welcome your opinion gladly.<br><br>First, to preface my understanding (and not to patronize you), Christianity has its foundation as the faith of Judaism. Hebrew tradition and scripture says that Abraham made a covenant with God (or it worked the other way around that God made a covenant with Abraham). This covenant requires circumcision for the Jewish people. And the prophets of the Jewish tradition assert monotheism and, most interestingly to me, a messiah - to save not only the Jewish people, but indeed the entire world (more on this in a second). <br><br>Judaism is thus a messianic faith, and it promises the Jews a messiah to strengthen Israel, gather the Jews and return them to their promised land, get the non-Jews to leave the Jews alone (wow, hard to imagine that! especially here) and set the world straight.<br><br>To Christians, Jesus fulfilled the messianic prophecies spoken in Psalms, Isaiah, Numbers, and other works of what is regarded by them as the Old Testament. Some of these will be listed here along with Rambam&#039;s criteria for Melekh HaMashiach (King Messiah, the awaited Jewish king - the one Christians assert is Jesus). For clarity, Rambam (aka Maimonides, a Jewish philosopher of the middle ages) is noted here to give a kind of balance - I want the discussion too focus on arguments for or against Jesus Messiah-hood. And I encourage you (even if you&#039;re atheist) to posit arguments for AND against Jesus being Messiah. Of course, if you&#039;re atheist, you&#039;re free to them assert the whole thing is a crock of shit. <br><br>Christian claims in the next post.<br>Rambam&#039;s criteria in the next post.<br>Specific questions in the next post.","filename":"1","ext":".jpg","w":2200,"h":1325,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1490189951889,"time":1490189951,"md5":"pjgG9aKluKI+BedPDVlyTg==","fsize":597646,"resto":0,"id":"PfJW\/5v3","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"judaism-and-the-messiah-mashiach","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":117759732,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)09:50:41","name":"@TheImperialCult","com":"<a href=\"#p117758753\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117758753<\/a><br><br>Jesus &quot;fulfilled&quot; Messianic &quot;prophecies&quot; because Judaism is a delusional psychokiller cult.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=MZV<wbr>Y-pGDsN4 <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tgj<wbr>3nZWtOfA<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=RWf<wbr>Tv-fmhhs","filename":"darwinaward2","ext":".png","w":1252,"h":853,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1490190641827,"time":1490190641,"md5":"NfIavnc5Uc9Bk3Xe54jd4w==","fsize":1760766,"resto":117758753,"id":"FoxI\/ap\/","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117760518,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)09:58:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Something just came up and I can&#039;t continue writing this post but here are a few things to tide us over (if we get this conversation going): <br><br>Here is a checklist for Messiah from a Jewish https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TRr<wbr>_1zAFNj8<br><br>Christian&#039;s claim Jesus ushered in the messianic age. There are very specific qualities to this age that are apparently not yet accomplished. How do Christians answer this? Death continues, Jesus is not reigning as King of Israel and death and wars continue. These will not be things of the messianic age. As a Christian, how do you explain this? Do you simply use the second coming as a time when these things will be fulfilled? Can you see that this is a bit of a cop out? <br><br>Specific questions that are at mind: <br>Do Jews regard the Messiah as a sacrifice for sin? One of the the qualities of the Passover lamb was that none of its bones should be broken. One of the things Christians claim is that none of Jesus bones were broken and so this was a fulfillment of scripture: that &quot;he protects all his bones: not one of them shall be broken&quot;.<br><br>Do Jews believe the Messiah will similarly not break any of his bones? This frustrates me greatly, because it assumes all Passover lambs that were slaughtered never cracked or broke any of their bones in their lives before slaughter. How would one discern this? Can one be Messiah if they have ever cracked a bone? Or is this a Christian view? <br><br>To any Christians here: have you ever considered these questions (specifically about the messianic age and the present state of the world)?

Carey held that land in industrial life is an instrument of production formed by human labour. Its value was due to the labour expended on it in the past (measured by the labour necessary under existing conditions to bring new land to the same stage of productiveness). He studied the occupation and reclamation of land with peculiar advantage as an American, for whom the traditions of first settlement were living and fresh, and before whose eyes the process was indeed still going on. The difficulties of adapting a primitive soil to the work of yielding organic products for human use can be lightly estimated only by an inhabitant of a country long under cultivation.[1]<br><br>Carey believed that the overcoming of these difficulties by arduous and continued effort entitles the first occupier of land to his property in the soil. Its present value forms a very small proportion of the cost expended on it, because it represents only what would be required, with the science and appliances of our time, to bring the land from its primitive into its present state. Thus, property in land is only a form of invested capital, a quantity of labour or the fruits of labour permanently incorporated with the soil. The owner of this capital is compensated, as any other capitalist, by a share of the produce. The owner is not rewarded for what is done by the powers of nature, and society is in no sense defrauded by his sole possession.[1]","time":1493784268,"resto":123855748,"id":"KCqGqXX2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123868786,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)00:04:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123867062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123867062<\/a><br>dumbass. <br>the govt can declare all the currency it likes, but if the people have no confidence in it, the seek alternate forms of exchange. <br>thats where the &quot;No Backing Except Power Of Govt...&quot; part comes in. <br>go to mexico. if you offer to pay the merchant, cab driver, waitress or hooker in pesos or dollars, they will take greenbacks every fucking time, because as shitty as the fed is, they are still better than banco de nacional de mexico <br><br>3 times in the last 20 years they simply knocked a zero off the back of your currency&#039;s value dropping 1000 pesos to 100 &quot;nuevo pesos&quot; , then down to 10 &quot;nuevo nuevo pesos&quot; then down to 1 &quot;we&#039;re totally not fucking with you, this time we mean it&quot; peso<br><br>so the fed sucks donkey balls, but the american people have kept the wolf from the door. <br>how much longer we can stay the apocalypse is anyone&#039;s guess.","time":1493784271,"resto":123855748,"id":"yRL\/JjDr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123868878,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)00:05:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123868782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123868782<\/a><br>wake up brothers, your heritage and history was stolen from you<br><br>The so-called Ricardian theory of rent is a speculative fancy, contradicted by all experience. Unlike what the theory supposes, cultivation does not begin with the best soils and move progressively towards poorer soils. The light and dry higher land is cultivated first; only when population becomes dense and capital accumulates is low-lying land attacked and brought into occupation. Low-lying land is more fertile but also has morasses, inundations and miasmas. Rent as a proportion of the produce sinks, like all interest on capital, but increases as an absolute amount. The share of the labourer increases both as a proportion and an absolute amount. Thus, the interests of these different social classes are in harmony. But, Carey proceeded to say, in order that this harmonious progress may be realized, what is taken from the land must be given back to it. All the produce derived from the land is part of it, and must be restored to avoid its exhaustion. Hence the producer and the consumer must be close to each other; the products must not be exported to a foreign country in exchange for its manufactures, and thus go to enrich as manure a foreign soil. In immediate exchange value, the landowner may gain by such exportation, but the productive powers of the land will suffer.[1]","filename":"257ba62dda650f3658a19e5ea38a121a","ext":".jpg","w":975,"h":958,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":122,"tim":1493784320371,"time":1493784320,"md5":"y5SiPmo20h7FLg6097RvqA==","fsize":288888,"resto":123855748,"id":"KCqGqXX2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123868916,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)00:05:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123867166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123867166<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mommy mommy the bad people won&#039;t believe me! and i&#039;m a expert mommy! waaah waaaahhhhh!!!<\/span>","time":1493784341,"resto":123855748,"id":"6nYqjVFO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123868946,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)00:05:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123867683\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123867683<\/a><br>Having a small portion of your wealth disappear regularly is immoral.

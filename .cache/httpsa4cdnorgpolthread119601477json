I have one good idea - reformation of the EU. <br><br>Let&#039;s be honest - EU is good for all of us economically. If not the EU, states like the Baltics, Poland, Bulgaria would never have reached what they got now. I think, some of them would&#039;t even exist anymore. Also, we love having one currency and not thinking about exchanging. There are many more good aspects of the EU.<br><br>But I hate some of the things. First, I hate that EU is influenced with leftist liberiatarian ideas. I see lack of old christiam values in the EU. Also, I hate that we are not united enough. Some cunts like Nederlands are eurosceptic and we cannot stand together to solve our problems. We cannot stand strong against Russia, we cannot solve reffugee problem together. Quitting is giving up. Quitting is shitting in pants.

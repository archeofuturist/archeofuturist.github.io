They rather try to save people all around the world than keeping their culture and boarders intact.<br><br>While most people talk about big cities being liberal vs rest of the country being conserative, you can also see a clear difference between men and women.<br><br>Women are much more likely to leftish and liberals than men are. This is because their mentality is &quot;we need to take care of each other&quot; rather than &quot;take responsibility for your own life and decisions&quot;.<br><br>Look at muslism countries where mostly men are in power. They have no problems keeping their culture intact and they have no problems with mass immigration.

Even after his breathing stabilized, tests showed that he had lost half his lung function. On our doctor\u2019s advice, we placed him on routine steroid therapy and decided that as long as his breathing did not worsen again, we could stay in Delhi. Or at least I decided that.

When we pulled up the floor tiles on the ground floor, brown sludge seemed to be everywhere. I was in the shower when this sewage mixture arrived in our apartment.

The club has received several threats too kek but the tweet has over 6000 views, people are still harassing the club. Just read the brain dead posts under it and go to the retweets too.<br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/WakeRepublicans<wbr>\/status\/844242708730396672","filename":"Screenshot_1","ext":".png","w":639,"h":885,"tn_w":180,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490989512020,"time":1490989512,"md5":"Y8oOiQ++bNwrvTMeeQ0eUw==","fsize":749185,"resto":0,"id":"vV9LR2Rq","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"shillbots-at-school","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119094744,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)16:14:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119091689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119091689<\/a><br>Have a bump.","time":1490991258,"resto":119091689,"id":"KdRMUQCi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

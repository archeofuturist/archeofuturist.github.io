You&#039;d idiot foreigners have never even set foot in the Us before probably. If you did you would realize the south east states are each their own unique place.

His whole argument reads like that alternate reality version of the SJW &quot;auto-discount-everything&quot; argument. The Americans have no culture, just tall buildings; yeah, sure Goebbels, the Chrysler Building isn&#039;t one of the greatest architectural achievements of the time.<br><br>Meanwhile, he was essentially a kept man by his half-jew wife who leeched off the Quandt family. Reading his diaries is like reading the screechings of a 13year old girl: &quot;oh Hitler liked me today, I&#039;m so happy... Today da Fuhrer ignored me, I might kill myself&quot;. He had more fucking breakdowns than a Ford Pinto.<br><br>I hate this fucker, and Hitler and all you dumbasses who think these guys were on to something. Understand, they damaged nationalism and fascism in ways we are only now starting to unfuck. Want to understand why Europe is so cucked?

But all the uniqueness is rapidly being destroyed (can you live in the South East and honestly tell me there&#039;s much of that culture left?)<br>We don&#039;t have our own, unique, amazing culture. We&#039;re a Borg collective of cobbled together parts, dictated and controlled by Jews in media who glorify what they want, and brush everything else into a dustbin. Our poetry is shit. We have some great fiction writers but when was the last time we wrote anything to last the ages? Where is the unique architecture? Our most famous play at the moment is a horrible rap parody of the founding of our country, about the guy who sold us out to the banks, done by nigs. Our movies are meaningless. Our most common music is shit. <br><br>We&#039;re shit for culture. That everyone mimics us says more about the power of jewish media and marketing than it does the quality of our productions.","time":1493824799,"resto":123915762,"id":"Xttfe9OY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123923024,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)11:26:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123922263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123922263<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;taking influence from other cultures to CREATE your own unique culture.<\/span><br>yeah, we defintally have no culture. ffs, do you think EVERY single culture I&#039;m europe is 100% unique?

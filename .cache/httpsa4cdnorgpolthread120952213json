This is the consensus view among many Middle Eastern and relatively undeveloped countries and some others, prostitution is banned, adultery is criminalized completely, etc. and many of them have horrible problems with men who cannot control their sexual urges and are very degenerate under the layers which hid them, people are obsessed with sex.<br><br>On the other end, you have complete and full sexual liberation and libertinism, where no sexual activity would even be shamed or looked down upon, even things such as pedophilia. No country is quite like this, although I&#039;d argue that certain Western or Western-influenced countries are moving very much towards an extremely sexually open model, where average people have in excess of 30+ sexual partners in their lives, sexual and carnal acts are allowed and not viewed shamefully even in public, sensual acts such as slapping asses, twerking, etc. are allowed on public television, etc.<br><br>IMO there is some balance in the middle which accounts for and allows a healthy level of sexual expression while also enforcing norms good for society, such as strong families. Sex should be viewed as normal and healthy in many contexts, and unavoidable due to people wanting it on average so much. What is the correct balance in your opinion?<br><br>Are things like legalized prostitution, no-fault divorce, the normalization and allowance of extremely sexually explicit acts, etc. all horrible and degenerate, or is there some value to some of these more sexually liberal ideas?","filename":"AngelaWhite5","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":478,"tn_w":209,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492112463788,"time":1492112463,"md5":"B3qlS4MOenGn50GNIBTeKw==","fsize":42500,"resto":0,"id":"EQBiF2XD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-is-the-correct-societal-view-of-sexuality","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

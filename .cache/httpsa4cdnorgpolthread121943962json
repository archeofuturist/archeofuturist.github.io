I&#039;m a college student and I&#039;m kind of appalled by the hive mind most of my classmates share, it just seems beyond me that seemingly normal kids refuse to question the Establishment democrat leaders and have such a lack of a sense of humor. And please don&#039;t say some basic autistic shit like &quot;the Jews did it&quot;, I think it&#039;s more complicated than that.","filename":"imgres","ext":".png","w":225,"h":225,"tn_w":225,"tn_h":225,"tim":1492658270507,"time":1492658270,"md5":"feMRc3oqFmS4Lj6XxaNkAw==","fsize":1977,"resto":0,"id":"NbzFG27+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-im-honestly-very-curious-what-do-you-think","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":7},{"no":121944889,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)23:25:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"&quot;The Jews did it&quot; is sort of correct though. Mass media has effectively programmed people to think a certain way by promoting certain ideas and eschewing others that don&#039;t fit their agenda. Now, whether it was the Jews is open interpretation. It&#039;s true that Jews are disproportionately common in the various entertainment (mind share) industries, however, the leftward movement started long before they effectively took over. I wonder if the placement of Jews in visible roles wasn&#039;t a calculated move to mask the real people or organizations responsible.","time":1492658748,"resto":121943962,"id":"9hF92Y70","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121944989,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)23:26:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"When life isn&#039;t hard, people have time to think about stupid shit.","time":1492658798,"resto":121943962,"id":"J8P2mBj2","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121945872,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)23:33:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121944989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121944989<\/a><br>This is a huge part of this.

Nobody has done a great job of piecing it all together. Our theories are makeshift and in piecemeal they work but aren&#039;t unified. I think 9\/11, the internet, the discrediting of conservatism due to Bush, the infantilization of the population, and the post-irony concept all relate to it.<br><br>There&#039;s also the &quot;end of history&quot; we were living in up until 9\/11. 9\/11 broke that but it hasn&#039;t really registered until Trump that history has resumed.

WE ONLY READ the KING JAMES AUTHORIZED because JESUS CHRIST spoke ELIZABETHAN ENGLISH to his APOSTLES, who are all BURNING IN HELL because they tried to USURP the POWER OF G_D. IF YOU READ ANY BIBLE that is not the KJV then you are reading a bible that is SEPARATED FROM THE WORD OF GOD. THIS IS BECAUSE ALL BIBLES ARE SLIGHT REWORDINGS OF EARLIER BIBLES so if you read a bible that was translated after 1611 it is a SLIGHT REWORDING OF THE KJV which means it is FALSE. cathoDICKS worship MARY and the Torah says she is BURNING IN HELL.

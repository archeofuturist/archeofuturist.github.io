They wanted to work with Jeremy. I\u2019d suggest to him about how he might build bridges with the Jewish community, and none of it ever happened. It was very, very frustrating, and it just got worse. Every attempt to improve relationships did well for a day or two, and then something or somebody would sabotage it. Every time, what was required was a swift response, but it just never happened.<br><br>The very first thing I tried was to negotiate with The Jewish Chronicle for an interview. Jeremy got very uneasy about it and said he couldn\u2019t do it. So I went back and it was happy to give him an op-ed, which he would have complete control over. It promised not to change a word. There would be a complete partnership. Nothing happened.<br><br>Jeremy and the team just didn\u2019t understand the collective impact of incident after incident after incident. He dealt with every episode as if it were isolated. I think he just saw those offended as complainers. But the Jewish community was, quite understandably, seeing it as a theme, seeing Jeremy digging himself deeper all the time.<br><br>Some people said the reason he was criticised was for his views on Israel, not towards Jews as a whole. But it wasn\u2019t. It was about discrimination. Jeremy did have an antipathy towards Israel. But the criticism he received was because of a pattern of behaviour that was perceived by the Jewish community as anti-semitic.<br><br>I was one of the people who recommended that Shami Chakrabarti do her report into anti-semitism in the party. I got credit for that from Jewish organisations \u2014 and then total dismay when she joined the Labour Party a few weeks later, and utter dismay when she became a peer. It clearly had an impact on the fact that her conclusions were seen by many as a whitewash, but Jeremy and his team just couldn\u2019t see it. He wasn\u2019t prepared for personal attacks, and he got very angry.","time":1492944191,"resto":122408145,"id":"2SRP77+5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122409072,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)06:43:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122408879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122408879<\/a><br>He&#039;s not a fan of Israel and once called Hamas &quot;his friends&quot;.<br><br>The first one I like, the second one means he needs to get shot.","time":1492944216,"resto":122408145,"id":"PIIixMxj","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":122409295,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)06:46:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122408879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122408879<\/a><br>He&#039;s not, nor is any labour party member- you don&#039;t end up working for a party like labour by your own choice if you are.

You are making things up just to critize the use of marihuana. You won&#039;t research the web for information to come up with any solid proof that it is in anyway bad for you. You just talk about how you feel about people using marihuana and that is my problem with you guys.","time":1491945567,"resto":120655814,"id":"bOIL+WtM","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120659111,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:20:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120655814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120655814<\/a><br>If you legalize it my profit margin shrinks","filename":"home","ext":".jpg","w":569,"h":597,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491945634640,"time":1491945634,"md5":"enGzWMjaZMw3RiRjCLgh+g==","fsize":76052,"resto":120655814,"id":"xtqO3H1S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120659172,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:20:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120655814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120655814<\/a><br>I&#039;m with you, toothpaste.

But let me break my own rule, and lets say we are talking about how Weed is a gateway drug. Well to be quiet frankly I do think that when weed is illigal it might lead up to using harder substances like cocaine or mdma etc. Because 1. when it&#039;s illegal you have to buy it from your local shady dealer and 2. When marihuana is illegal you are already using an illigal substance which makes it easier of choice to use other illigal drugs.<br><br>However, if its legal this will not happen because you dont have to feel you are doing something wrong buying from a shady dealer who sells shady stuff.<br><br>Btw here is a articele about it, read up.<br><br>http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/s<wbr>cience\/marijuana-isnt-a-gateway-dru<wbr>g-if-anything-alcohol-is-10214880.h<wbr>tml","time":1491946255,"resto":120655814,"id":"bOIL+WtM","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120660824,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:32:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120659934\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120659934<\/a><br>depends on the person, i&#039;ve self medicated to deal with anxiety, paranoia and depression and that shit can really help","time":1491946325,"resto":120655814,"id":"EFhMtSEH","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120660939,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:32:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"I used to be a big stoner and while it&#039;s pretty easy to get caught up in it if you&#039;ve got nothing going in your life, it&#039;s pretty harmless.<br><br>Might dull your brain but it&#039;s their choice","time":1491946373,"resto":120655814,"id":"3bZ2jAoV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120661030,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:33:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120656367\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120656367<\/a><br>what the fuck is a blissful wizard and why does weed have such stupid names?","time":1491946413,"resto":120655814,"id":"2LBld68I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120661618,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:37:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120661030\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120661030<\/a><br>Because the hippies were the ones who started pioneering growing different strains.

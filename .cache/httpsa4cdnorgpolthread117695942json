And our Danish railways was pretty cool, clean, on time, polite conductors, a special carriage where you could purchace a sussage in a bun. All those little things. And once I even got to go to this far away place called Germany. OK, not so much more distant than Sweden or Norway where I had been often. But in order to get into Germany, you had to show a passport and a big-wee-boy got to hand over the whole family&#039;s passports to the stern uniformed German man at the border. And once in Germany, the joy! Getting to ride on the DB. Like our DSB, only one up! Even cleaner, even more punctual and even better susages. Now our railways have gone to shit. Mostly because some EU regulations means the technical parts are mostly done by Italians, so reliability and punctuality is gone.<br>Haven&#039;t been on the DB for a long time, but if they use their budget to make &quot;more time for tolerance&quot; propaganda instead on using them on rails, trains and skilled personel. Then I guess DB is going to shit as well.

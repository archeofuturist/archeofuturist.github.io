Ever since the beginning I&#039;ve thought the one thing that confirmed to me above all else that Pizzagate is real is the out-of-character way that the whole MSM immediately came out heavy against it. That doesn&#039;t happen with just any old &#039;conspiracy theory&#039;. Now, Alex Jones, who makes some of the wildest claims and to my knowledge doesn&#039;t retract them, is retracting his statements on Pizzagate, and it&#039;s considered news. If it&#039;s not real, they&#039;re doing a really bad job of convincing me by the way they are acting.","time":1490468454,"resto":118254737,"id":"4Jel0eqE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118257841,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:01:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118257484\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118257484<\/a><br>He talks about the most weird, contrived shit that would seem the ramblings of a fucking lunatic, but pizzagate is too far? he got cucked by the jews, its over, alex is done","time":1490468513,"resto":118254737,"id":"Q6kQ0ffY","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":118258336,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:06:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118257841\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118257841<\/a><br>Leave Bill Hicks alone, those gay frogs sexually confused him","time":1490468784,"resto":118254737,"id":"AgQB\/E5t","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118259738,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:17:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"Alefantis likely threatened legal action because uhhhhh duh pizzagate is bullshit and he has reason to sure for defamation.","time":1490469471,"resto":118254737,"id":"dw5bfjPV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118260630,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:25:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118259738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118259738<\/a><br>It&#039;s so much more than just Comet Ping Pong, though.

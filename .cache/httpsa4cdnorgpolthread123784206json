Said and I find Orientalism to be mainly a description of unequal power relations. Naming the special kind of ignorance that Westerners have, which comes from being loosely informed about and connected to faraway things via globalism, represents Said&#039;s marxist project and his desire for Europeans to criticize themselves. The difference between a peasant in Palestine and a NEET in America is that one studies the other, they&#039;re equally retarded on average and the Palestinian has just as many ignorant ideas. Neither pleb is hurting anyone else with their incomplete educations. Western opinions are inherently more consequential because of our stronger militaries and economies, which makes our completely ordinary misunderstandings stand out. Orientalism mainly exists to shame the West for caring about other countries or involving ourselves at all.","filename":"1410969958980","ext":".jpg","w":942,"h":850,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":112,"tim":1493742996879,"time":1493742996,"md5":"Lo+gmgLV6boFsP1N3q96lg==","fsize":435924,"resto":123784206,"id":"mzibPM15","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123785476,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)12:36:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YLr<wbr>w8SggH0Q<br><br>how?","filename":",","ext":".jpg","w":120,"h":90,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":90,"tim":1493743010652,"time":1493743010,"md5":"gfh16g2LBKWKV7Ik049G8w==","fsize":4735,"resto":123784206,"id":"tUa3JPWd","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123785712,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)12:38:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123744319#p123779280\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123779280<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123744319#p123785145\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123785145<\/a><br>www.toqonline.com\/blog\/jews-islam-o<wbr>rientalism\/","time":1493743122,"resto":123784206,"id":"Uh9KoPcy","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123785747,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)12:38:56","name":"(you)","com":"<a href=\"#p123785364\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123785364<\/a><br>It&#039;s a new thing, you wouldn&#039;t understand.","filename":"1493525017544","ext":".jpg","w":576,"h":1024,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493743136054,"time":1493743136,"md5":"iJfz916+i+RhzHEWmI3mpA==","fsize":53883,"resto":123784206,"id":"srAap\/z7","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":123785797,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)12:39:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Afrin has been liberated from the YPG scum.

Might be worth driving FSA out of every defensible position on the whole front just to prevent any funny business from the Jordanian groups once SAA operations move eastwards even if they do enjoy better relations at the moment.

That means Hitler killed roughly 1 Jew every 30 seconds. (LOL)<br><br>In Auschwitz, the most famous and biggest concentration camp, there are 15 crematoriums. According to Auschwitz survivors, Jews would go into the chamber, gassed for 15-20 minutes, then put into the oven.<br><br>It takes 1 hour to cremate a body using modern furnaces which operate at much higher temperatures than the traditional ovens at the camp. However, lets say that the ovens were operating at a level that we see today, that means it would take 1 hour, 20 minutes to gas and burn 15 Jews assuming they were all burned simultaneously. (Disregarding the time it would take for the gas to empty the chamber for the bodies to be transported from the chamber to the oven.) The elevators used to transport bodies were very slow and could only take up 7 bodies at a time with their weight capacity. However, for our greatest ally, we&#039;re going to assume that bodies were teleported instantly from chamber to oven.<br><br>That means 15 Jews were gassed and burned every 1.2 hours. That comes out to exactly 300 Jews every 24 hours (Assuming the gassing and burning of Jews was happening every hour straight for 6 years on an uninterrupted basis) the total number of jews killed would be 657,000 for those 6 years. The official Jewish story is that 4,000,000 Jews were killed at Auschwitz alone.<br><br>How can any Jew, Israeli, or Shill ever even argue this story when just simple math is enough to destroy the whole argument? Can any Jews respond to this?","filename":"1474804805752","ext":".png","w":811,"h":965,"tn_w":210,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492075165637,"time":1492075165,"md5":"N6geLl7jgumSuCYRo9C6Zg==","fsize":1337565,"resto":0,"id":"\/IzqCnxR","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"jews","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":120890642,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)05:25:18","name":"PightWower","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;no replies<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shill status: BTFO<\/span><br><br>Doing god&#039;s work, anon","time":1492075518,"resto":120890313,"id":"zAYBAQzI","country":"US","trip":"!7gXJffQksw","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120890664,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)05:25:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;she will never smile at you like that while you for the first time meet her parents in a classy restaurant<\/span><br>just end this","time":1492075529,"resto":120890313,"id":"qRfSR9HC","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120890741,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)05:26:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"I do not know how to respond to this?","filename":"IMG_2274","ext":".png","w":315,"h":341,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492075588458,"time":1492075588,"md5":"QsRVuQg6PwwA8zRDNeg6qA==","fsize":51085,"resto":120890313,"id":"w7U7qT7f","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120890861,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)05:28:47","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1491043375904","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":731,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492075727720,"time":1492075727,"md5":"wQZnUx6FBu\/rqAex+ITt\/g==","fsize":44475,"resto":120890313,"id":"5Y\/JP5Ax","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120890930,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)05:29:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120890313\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120890313<\/a><br>Really makes you think.

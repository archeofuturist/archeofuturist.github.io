None of the higher aspects of the symbol are found in his cult. The aim of his adepts seems principally to have been the production of a temporary incarnation of the god by sending the women of the tribe every year into the jungle. Nor do we find any legend of any depth or spirituality. Hanuman is certainly little more than the Ape of Thoth.<\/span><br><br>Is this true India bro? do people in the countryside send every year women to live in the jungle to please Hanuman?","time":1491556275,"resto":119916328,"id":"4h7dnmL2","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":119918600,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:12:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119916328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119916328<\/a><br>hey","filename":"indianredpill","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1491556363822,"time":1491556363,"md5":"dRQfdRdkkeiX0q+WmmdJ3Q==","fsize":1476996,"resto":119916328,"id":"IKXO51Jn","country":"RO","m_img":1,"country_name":"Romania"}]}

[2]<br>2.1.1.2 When aforementioned factors are taken into account, the wage gape is reduced by more than two thirds - to roughly 0.93 dollars for every dollar a man makes.

[6]<br>3.2.1 While the aforementioned theory is backed up by statistics, claims of sexism remain vague, often relying on unfalsifiable assumptions of cultural prejudice against women.<br>3.2.2 Some of the lack of asking for a raise women show can be explained by both genders showing unfair treatment to women who demand to be paid more, perceiving them as &quot;less nice&quot;.

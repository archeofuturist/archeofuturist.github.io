If you say something like &quot;the vast majority of studies have shown that the family environment is the most nurturing&quot; (which I don&#039;t even disagree with) you still need to fucking cite that. &quot;The vast majority&quot; are weasel words used to disguise the author&#039;s ignorance. If he actually knew which studies or literature reviews he had in mind when he made the statement he would have written &quot;Bob and Smith (2004) found that 99% of studies into the topic found a causal relationship between traditional family structure and high academic performance in K-12.&quot;<br><br>But he didn&#039;t write that because Bob and Smith 2004, even if it does exist, is not known to the author.

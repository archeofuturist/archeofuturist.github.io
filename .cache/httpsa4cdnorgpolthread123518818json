So, isn\u2019t it a little odd that these two no-name actors were invited to watch the premiere of the film with the freaking president! This photo is from January 11, 1998, which is the same day Good Will Hunting released to the general public. It was taken at Camp David, which is the President\u2019s retreat center, but also a military base.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To be clear: at the time of this photo, Good Will Hunting was not a hit yet (since it had just released earlier in the day). Ben Affleck and Matt Damon were not famous yet, and were supposedly struggling to get by in LA. And yet, we\u2019re supposed to believe that Bill Clinton was so excited about this film, that he sought out Matt and Ben and invited them to Camp David so they could all watch it together.<\/span>","filename":"BenAffleckMattDamonBillClinton","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":489,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":238,"tim":1493582667344,"time":1493582667,"md5":"60AxOGhYDI7aymLNUETflw==","fsize":80948,"resto":0,"id":"6pRTo4V4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ben-affleck-matt-damon-and-robert-ludlum-are-cia","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123519443,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)16:09:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"The president and the military watch movies before they are released for the general public.

Kushner participated in meetings between Trump and foreign heads of state while continuing to run the Kushner Companies.[20]<\/span>","time":1491735252,"resto":120269545,"id":"tu23fJUY","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120270092,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)06:54:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120269545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120269545<\/a><br>Man those medias are such hypocrites. <br>I swear every time i try to think that this &quot;redpill&quot; is bullshit.<br>And then you have this...","time":1491735257,"resto":120269545,"id":"O8FNBksT","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120270105,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)06:54:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120269545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120269545<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ivanka convinces Trump to bomb Assad at the behest of Jared<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;NOW the media says having her around isnt a bad thing<\/span><br>really made me think","time":1491735267,"resto":120269545,"id":"Hw9MckyY","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120270117,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)06:54:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120269545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120269545<\/a><br><br>Bomb one little airbase, smdh, now errbody loves Trump&#039;s hate.","time":1491735273,"resto":120269545,"id":"iIUPPt0X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120270130,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)06:54:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120270015\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120270015<\/a><br>they turned off their brains and did anything to make sure Hillary didn&#039;t get in.<br><br>it&#039;s taking people this long to reboot and remember what critical thinking is.","time":1491735281,"resto":120269545,"id":"IPdR4KGG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120270159,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)06:55:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120269545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120269545<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;trump made a neo-con move <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;politico now giving trump positive coverage <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;McCain now likes trump<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bill kristol now likes trump<\/span><br>why do I seem to be the only one worried by this?","time":1491735304,"resto":120269545,"id":"kFd7o7J0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120270215,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)06:55:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"But they have been say it is bad for the last 3 months.<br><br>Now it is good?","time":1491735340,"resto":120269545,"id":"VHGp3vRa","country":"TW","country_name":"Taiwan"},{"no":120270235,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)06:55:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120270159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120270159<\/a><br>Many of &gt;us here are the same, anon.

The right wing base is made up of rural and uneducated white working class, people who are holding our society back and are on the wrong side of history.<br><br>The right hates that we Reddit-browsing and NPR-listening coastal liberal &quot;elites&quot; are the winners in a service-based globalized multicultural society because of our superior intellect and open worldview, and they blame all their failures on minorities and undocumented immigrants. They are seeing how America is increasingly becoming vibrantly diverse, and how non-white people will soon be the majority and losing their privilege terrifies them. All of us liberal intellectuals who base our views on science will continue building robots and putting Trump supporters out of jobs and watch as their racist white communities die out. All of their kids will have to come to the big cities and be exposed to diversity and tolerance and see how much better it is than hate and bigotry that Trump represents. We will also grant citizenship to the tens of millions of undocumented immigrants, and allow more non-white people to come in, further solidifying a progressive diverse America that votes in universal healthcare, socialism, feminism and social justice policies that help everyone and dismantle white power structures that Trump supporters want to preserve.<br><br>Conservatives follow the base instinct of kin selection, where they give preference to those who are most genetically similar to them (which gives rise to racism and xenophobia). Liberals are more intellectually enlightened and realize that race and ethnicity are social constructs, and that we&#039;re all part of the same human species and that we should all share equally with each other and not give preference to those more genetically similar to us.","filename":"egfef","ext":".png","w":184,"h":265,"tn_w":173,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491993088305,"time":1491993088,"md5":"3oQRVK0+S8J60T0dUIoNBA==","fsize":93388,"resto":0,"id":"mtn2Gu1v","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-reality-is-that-were-not-two-equal-sides-the","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":61,"images":14,"unique_ips":46},{"no":120741201,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)06:34:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120741004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120741004<\/a><br>learn to be more concise, faggot<br><br>this isn&#039;t your fucking blog","filename":"1478413645378","ext":".gif","w":252,"h":263,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491993252990,"time":1491993252,"md5":"0ZjoWxrI5SEG1VvyjwM1fw==","fsize":3131478,"resto":120741004,"id":"5iqoPUaf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120741338,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)06:36:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120741201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120741201<\/a><br><br>Just what I&#039;d expect from an intellectually inferior conservative, reading anything that isn&#039;t a single sentence is beyond your capability.","time":1491993367,"resto":120741004,"id":"mtn2Gu1v","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120741630,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)06:39:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120741338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120741338<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;assuming i&#039;m conservative<\/span><br><br>You don&#039;t know a single thing about me other than I&#039;m American and I think you&#039;re a long-winded blowhard.<br><br>I&#039;ll offer another clue.

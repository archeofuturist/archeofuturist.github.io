Just wait until you have some chronic life threatening illness. If you don&#039;t have private health insurance by the time you&#039;re 40 you&#039;re out of your mind. Our &quot;healthcare&quot; system will just make you comfortable as you slowly die.","time":1490573389,"resto":118428215,"id":"MyXTqEik","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118441585,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:10:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118440494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118440494<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If we had a 85%+ white country<\/span><br><br>lmao what its not blacks and arabs clogging up the ER, its hipster whites who insist on going to the doctor for every little thing<br><br>whens the last time you heard a nog say &quot;uh oh I got a cat scratch, better go to the doctor to get it treated&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but as it is, our tax dollars subsidize other people&#039;s bad life choices.<\/span><br>this will never not be true of any system that involves the gubment paying for something. your taxes go to the &quot;bad life choices&quot; of others like not using correct tires on roads leading to extra maintenance from damage due to studs or snow chains or even skidoo treads, or parents not homeschooling their kids and necessitating a public school system. or even just regulatory agencies to make sure business and industry don&#039;t cut corners on workplace safety -- simply installing a rail is cheaper than requiring a body of people to tell you to install a rail, that you then still have to install either way, but people are shitters so you need that regulatory body.<br><br>it is, however, probably still cheaper and better than leaving it to the private sector.

El reloj de arena no tiene ninguna relaci\u00f3n ni con la historia de Espa\u00f1a, ni con el prop\u00f3sito del partido, ni con alg\u00fan tipo de ideolog\u00eda. <br><br>Creo que no debes mirar solo que quede &quot;guay&quot;, sin m\u00e1s. Sino que hay que curr\u00e1rselo m\u00e1s. Y todo esto te lo digo desde la humildad de alguien que quiere ayudar.

Metodos is what I was using to prepare myself that week. <br><br>The academy that told me that it was in June was MasterD, they almost scammed me HARD, they were trying to charge me 1600\u20ac to prepare for the tests, luckly I researched a bit on the internet and found out that they are well known for scamming people, charging lots of money and barely teaching something.

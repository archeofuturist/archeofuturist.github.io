This is one reason why Constatine moved East to rule, because pagans still lived in Rome, several notable influential families did. West Rome as shown on maps shows &quot;fully Christian&quot; <br><br>While the missionaries had made settlements out west all the way to northern Gaul and western Spain, there still many places in the countryside that had not been reached simply because it was out of the way and these things take time, although the cities that were large out west had successful churches.<br> It was considered sorta backwater compared to Egypt and Greece, and Anatolia. <br><br>Not after Constantine did things change. Firstly we start having lots of stories about Christian Martyrs right around the decades during and after Constantine&#039;s rule. Saint Agnes is one example off the top of my head.But there are many others, altar boys had to be given bodyguards because they were in danger of being killed by local pagans, even in urban areas in the east. <br><br>Stories of martyrdom in these days continue until the Emperors after Constantine ban each one or two types of pagan practices. Not paganism outright but like a certain type of divination or ritual to Venus ect. <br><br>Martyrs and violence continue until Theodosius the Great comes along. Another Christian Emperor. He massacres in a heated rage 3000 Thessalonians after they were rioting in the streets. Bishop of Milan Ambrose commands him to stop being so violent and Theodosius goes to him for confession. He is forgiven and dies right afterwards. But right before he died he ordered to ban all forms of Paganism outright.<br><br>Paganism is 90% public city worship and 10% praying at the dinner table in private, unlike Christianity which is mostly private. This means all temples are reused as Churches, idols are destroyed and all remaining Pagan rituals are made holidays without degeneracy , like day of the dead","filename":"1491950344016","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":469,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492708438971,"time":1492708438,"md5":"O9aAIxOb5N095MCzEh3mjA==","fsize":145619,"resto":122013738,"id":"AfPkCYIZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

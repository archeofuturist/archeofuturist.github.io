They ceded EVERY industry that actually matters--in terms of controlling ones country and destiny--to Jews, women, and colored people. <br><br>The result of this strategy (which has been ongoing for over 100 years) is that every white country besides Russia will collapse and Europeans will go extinct. On the bright side, white men were able to avoid college, go to six months of trade school, are making $70k a year, and have a brand new Camaro. For now.<br><br>On the downside, all of the white women are getting blacked\/browned, our countries will turn into Brazil 2.0\/3.0 failed states, and most likely, our nuclear weapons will get into the hands of Muslim extremists and nuclear war will end all life on the planet before 2100. <br><br>Any questions? <br><br>inb4: <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;But m-muh trades is so important!

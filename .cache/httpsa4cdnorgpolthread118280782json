Consequently, memory defects caused by marijuana might be reduced by aspirin, indomethacin, or vitamin E. Interestingly, clinical studies indicate that elevation of prostaglandins caused by marijuana smoking can be suppressed by indomethacin (Perez Reyes et al., 1991). This indicates that marijuana use in humans activates the PLA2\u2013COX pathway and suggests that indomethacin or aspirin might be appropriate for protection against cannabinoids. Although speculative, this hypothesis is based on an analysis of the molecular mechanisms underlying THC neurotoxicity.

It is not illegal to borrow money from Russian entities but Mr Dearlove, who left government in 2004, did not provide any evidence to support his claim in the interview.","filename":"IMG_3772","ext":".png","w":640,"h":1136,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492273046517,"time":1492273046,"md5":"EFZpSwVMTCx68eMR+nJN2A==","fsize":127079,"resto":0,"id":"o0hpBTOB","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-all-unraveling","country_name":"United States","replies":15,"images":2,"unique_ips":11},{"no":121226148,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)12:19:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121225933\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121225933<\/a><br>Bump","time":1492273164,"resto":121225933,"id":"o0hpBTOB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121226149,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)12:19:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;It is not illegal to borrow money from Russian entities&quot;<\/span><br>so it&#039;s nothing ?","time":1492273165,"resto":121225933,"id":"dITJDZHR","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121226258,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)12:20:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121226149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121226149<\/a><br>The fact that he&#039;s hiding it is fishy.

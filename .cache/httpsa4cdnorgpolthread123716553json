Suddenly, Nye unbuckled his belt, removed it, and handed it to performance artist Rachel Bloom, who had been urinating on polyethylene tension bands intended for an live demonstration. Bloom&#039;s eyes widened noticeably as the former comedian-cum-science presenter dropped his trousers. Exposing his bare buttocks, Nye urged Bloom to &#039;science guy his brown eye&#039;, at which point Bloom began feverishly cracking the faux leather belt as though it were a bullwhip. As the brass buckle latch landed direct hits to his rectum, tearing open the flesh, Nye found the opportunity to teach new levels of science: he grunted and screamed like a ox skewered alive and he then anally penetrated the decapitated rare Pepe. Smearing the amphibian blood from the removed head, Nye broke into what sounded to be a gusty chant of O Satana. This delighted the audience which had already slathered the entrails of a blonde virgin on themselves in preparation for the next group experiment of electro-fistula mutual pleasuring while shrieking BILL! BILL! BILL!","filename":"18199242_770040373177752_7177359916499000735_n","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":778,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":202,"tim":1493694051623,"time":1493694051,"md5":"cqJ8BKGYvK7VjZ6ksVUhlg==","fsize":81142,"resto":0,"id":"HMmfsllS","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bill-nyes-latest-episode-guest-starring-albino","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123716734,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)23:02:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123716553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123716553<\/a>","filename":"_90a8961-small","ext":".jpg","w":5760,"h":3840,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493694144796,"time":1493694144,"md5":"fBVIjGsTo8yVWJDIIScuog==","fsize":3853247,"resto":123716553,"id":"I3Z\/gv9R","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123717106,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)23:06:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123716734\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123716734<\/a><br><br>this is what pisses me off the most, they even comment about how shitworlders are breeding like mosquitos, but because people in civilized countries contribute more to climate change, that they are the one&#039;s that need to kill themselves off<br><br>yeah really great idea, I&#039;m sure that won&#039;t result in an overall deterioration of the world","time":1493694360,"resto":123716553,"id":"sYuZVg2n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

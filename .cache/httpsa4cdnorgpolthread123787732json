What would it take to make a pizza from scratch? Well, the first ingredient would be dough, which would require a wheat farm to raise the wheat that is turned into flour, which in turn is turned into pizza dough. The wheat farm requires all of the engineering know-how that is used to build all of the tractors and other farm equipment; farm tools, fertilizers, irrigation systems, and what not. Then there is the grain storage business and all that goes into it, along with the trucking industry that is used to transport the grain. The transportation industry requires gasoline or diesel fuel, which means more petroleum industry must become involved, including all of the sophisticated engineering knowledge that is used to extract petroleum from the earth and refine it into gasoline.<br><br>1\/2","time":1493747659,"resto":123787732,"id":"ulSJ5t96","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123794782,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)13:54:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123789299\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123789299<\/a><br>If your definition of corrupt = smart decisions.

Now consider the tomato sauces, the cheese, the pepperonis, and so on. The lesson here is that what makes the economic world--or human civilization itself--possible is the international division of labor and knowledge in which we all specialize in something in the marketplace, earn money doing it, and use that money to buy other things from other &quot;specialists.&quot; All of this occurs spontaneously without any government planner consciously dictating how to make pizzas, how many to take, or where pizza parlors should be located.<br><br>As Adam Smith once explained, what motivates people to put forth all of this effort and cooperate with each other to give us &quot;our meat and our bread&quot; is not their selflessness or their love of their fellow man, but their concern for their own well being.

As for socialism, it is worth repeating that no government planner or group of planners with the most powerful computers available could conceivably possess and utilize all of the constantly changing information that is needed to produce even the most common and simple consumer goods, let alone sophisticated products like automobiles and computers.<br><br>The false notion that government planners under socialism could possess and make better use of all this information than the myriad consumers, workers, entrepreneurs, business managers, and other market participants in thousands of different industries was labeled &quot;the pretense of knowledge&quot; by Hayek in his Nobel prize acceptance speech in 1975.

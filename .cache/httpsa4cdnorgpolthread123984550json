I\u2019m here because I would like to give important advice to Americans. I have been posting this in many online boards related to politics, and \/pol\/ is one of them.<br><br>First of all, who am I? I am a businessman from Brazil, and my ancestors were Americans from Dixieland who immigrated to Brazil after the end of the Civil War. Due to my interest for my ancestor\u2019s homeland, every ten years since 1977 I have done a country-wide trip around the United States. I\u2019m about to finish my fifth trip. This might be the last of them, since I\u2019m now 76 years old. Because of this, I would like to ask you a bit of your time so you can hear a few things I learned from my trips, and some advice I have. The United States is too important for me and for the world, and I cannot keep what I have to say for myself.<br><br>To summarize my view: it is clear for me that the cultural and social conditions in the United States have been in decline since 1977, and it seems like you are becoming more and more like Brazil by the day. Of course technology and accessibility have greatly improved and today it is much easier today for me to rent a car or find a flight to a certain city I want to visit. However, almost all else has decayed greatly.","filename":"GrandCanyon","ext":".jpg","w":1788,"h":1158,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":161,"tim":1493854678381,"time":1493854678,"md5":"rdEJ6WysXHWJBrO4stp8FA==","fsize":866970,"resto":0,"id":"Qbpe1usC","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-message-to-americans","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":123984583,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)19:38:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123984550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123984550<\/a><br><br>Socially, I have never seen more turmoil than there is now. When I visited an old friend in Berkeley, I saw huge protests and fights which I would never expect to see in the United States, much less so around an old and \u2013 at least in the recent past \u2013 respected American university. The climate of political division is greater and more aggressive even than during Reagan\u2019s presidency.<br><br>I also noticed that public safety has declined noticeably, even when compared to 2007. When I visited friends in big cities like Houston, Chicago and Nashville this time around, I was explicitly told to avoid certain parts of the city which just a couple of decades ago I was able to go to without a problem.<br><br>There is also a trend since the 1977 of racial miscegenation that is really alarming. I remember visiting Houston back in the 70s and seeing a city that was still mostly white, with so amount of Mestizos and Blacks. Now all I see are a bunch of Mestizos, a lot of Blacks, too many Asians, mixed-races, and God knows what else. In historically diverse cities like Chicago and New York, whites have disappeared or hid themselves in bubbles like Manhattan. <br><br>Social inequality has risen dramatically. Back in the 70s one could see the big guys and the rookies having lunch in the same restaurants in Wall Street. Young married couples could afford their own houses. Now one my friend\u2019s son is almost 40 and can\u2019t afford a house of his own.","time":1493854694,"resto":123984550,"id":"Qbpe1usC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123984682,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)19:39:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123984583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123984583<\/a><br><br><br>My Advice<br><br><br>To start off, I think Trump\u2019s slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d tapped on the exact feelings I mentioned above. People who had the chance to live in the America of the 70s or 80s know how downhill things have gone, and would love to restore what has been damaged. These people \u2013 old folks \u2013 were the ones that won this election for Trump, although many young people who realize that modern mainstream values are senseless tended to vote for him too.<br><br>However, Trump will not be able to make everything as it was by himself, nor will the old people like me. The future of this country belongs to the young, and it is them that can change what will happen in the next generation. <br><br>Nevertheless, I think the old can give some advice to help the young make the right decisions. So here is some guidance I would like to give you. You might find some pieces of advice bad, and some good. Take what you find beneficial and ignore the rest:<br><br><br>1. Multiculturalism is the killer of nations. Never allow it to be accepted in your land.<br><br>Assimilation should be the norm for immigration, and immigration should be minimal and selective.<br><br>2. Different racial groups cannot live side-by-side for long. <br><br>They either mix or start waging war against each other.<br><br>3. Marxism is pillage. Avoid it with all your force.<br><br>Half of the people attracted to Marxism or one of its many incarnations are na\u00efve individuals who want an easy solution for the world\u2019s problems. The other half secretly wants to stamp your face and make everyone else obey their rules by force.<br><br>4. However, too much social inequality is bad, and will tear a nation apart if left unchecked.<br><br>A healthy nation needs hard-working and intelligent people to be compensated for their efforts. However, if social circumstances \u2013 the old boy\u2019s club \u2013 becomes the most important factor in determining one\u2019s wealth, there is something terribly wrong.","filename":"Yellowstone","ext":".jpg","w":3200,"h":1680,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1493854742694,"time":1493854742,"md5":"uq7xbjrDF\/RCP9PRLBRStg==","fsize":882630,"resto":123984550,"id":"Qbpe1usC","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123984766,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)19:39:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123984550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123984550<\/a><br>I love these threads","time":1493854786,"resto":123984550,"id":"Yd+gXsFa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123985146,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)19:42:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123984682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123984682<\/a><br><br>Finally,<br><br>5. Equality is a modern idea of little practical value. The classical concept of balance or equilibrium is a much better ideal for a nation.<br><br>Equilibrium between sexes instead of gender equality. Economic equilibrium instead of economic equality.<br><br>Not trying to make things that are different equal, but understanding their differences and trying to bring the best from each side in a way that promotes harmony and stability<br>This is some of the things I would like to say.

Honestly, America hasn&#039;t really been decline from the 70s outside of looking at it academically. We were the center of the technological revolution of the 90s. I&#039;d say that crash, Bush reinstating Reaganomics, and the lack of a strong enemy like the Soviet Union hurt us most.<br><br>The U.S. lacks a strong cohesive &quot;us&quot; mentality. There is no greater good sacrifice because we don&#039;t have an obvious existential threat like in the Cold War. Nearly all problems in the U.S. could be cured by a massive increase in government revenue. That would pay off the debt, strengthen the dollar, pay for infrastructure.","time":1493855176,"resto":123984550,"id":"8ixhOU4H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123985803,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)19:48:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"high quality","time":1493855294,"resto":123984550,"id":"w0ZHCVlY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123986272,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)19:52:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123985146\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123985146<\/a><br>bumpo","time":1493855531,"resto":123984550,"id":"2GOszMaX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

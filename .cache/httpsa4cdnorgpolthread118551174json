I swear to God, \/pol\/&#039;s standards are slipping. Here is what le punky meme man said about Brexit and Trump in 2016:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But as Britain draws ever closer to a vote on European Union membership, Lydon seems particularly impassioned about this too \u2013 and slams the prospect of a Brexit as \u2018suicidal.\u2019<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u2018To leave it [the European Union] would be insane and suicidal\u2019, he resolves.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u2018We\u2019re never going to go back to that romantic delusion of Victorian isolation, it isn\u2019t going to happen.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u2018There\u2019ll be no industry, there\u2019ll be no trade, there\u2019ll be nothing \u2013 a slow dismal, collapse.

I agree with the basic principle that we\u2019re all fed up with politicians, but you can\u2019t replace them with businessmen, which is surely the more corrupt form!<\/span>","filename":"A cunt","ext":".jpg","w":714,"h":475,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490643626799,"time":1490643626,"md5":"gFuiGllSC+eoLBXbLkHfHQ==","fsize":55720,"resto":0,"id":"fDke+XGE","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"johnny-rotten-is-not-ourguy","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":11,"images":3,"unique_ips":9},{"no":118551258,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:41:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118551174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118551174<\/a><br>Source:<br>http:\/\/metro.co.uk\/2016\/04\/22\/exclu<wbr>sive-john-lydon-talks-pil-punk-and-<wbr>donald-trump-5795582\/","time":1490643663,"resto":118551174,"id":"fDke+XGE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118551479,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:42:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"I leik his music tho","time":1490643765,"resto":118551174,"id":"+78ia6Jt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118551709,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:44:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118551174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118551174<\/a><br><br>Lydon is a leftist (((London))) paddy - a species on the verge of extinction","filename":"tottenham-court-road-crossrail-01","ext":".jpg","w":580,"h":420,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":90,"tim":1490643886099,"time":1490643886,"md5":"cG5Cup4oPlpOBZI1pdoRAA==","fsize":96617,"resto":118551174,"id":"EnS7lXj0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118551725,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:44:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118551174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118551174<\/a><br>Never said he was.<br>He&#039;s just another jew whore.","time":1490643890,"resto":118551174,"id":"pCttmdYE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118552118,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:48:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118551174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118551174<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;just stop with this bollocks<\/span><br>Never mind the bollocks","time":1490644086,"resto":118551174,"id":"ZESkucq+","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118552392,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:50:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118552118\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118552118<\/a>","filename":"1480010300597","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":275,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1490644218983,"time":1490644218,"md5":"JeXVFMUGYAsTpa3sziuFUg==","fsize":453668,"resto":118551174,"id":"fDke+XGE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118552638,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:52:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; \/pol<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; standards<\/span><br><br>Joined by:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; my sided<\/span>","time":1490644326,"resto":118551174,"id":"4H4XCAP3","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":118553149,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:56:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118551174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118551174<\/a><br>We woke up you retard","time":1490644567,"resto":118551174,"id":"SlFJFaRX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118553375,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:57:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118551174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118551174<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Standards Slipping<\/span><br>Giving a proverbial flying fuck about what any celebrity thinks.","time":1490644654,"resto":118551174,"id":"3W9KEapl","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118553779,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)16:00:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118553375\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118553375<\/a><br>You&#039;re right.

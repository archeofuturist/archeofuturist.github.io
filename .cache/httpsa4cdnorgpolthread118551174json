Here is what le punky meme man said about Brexit and Trump in 2016:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But as Britain draws ever closer to a vote on European Union membership, Lydon seems particularly impassioned about this too \u2013 and slams the prospect of a Brexit as \u2018suicidal.\u2019<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u2018To leave it [the European Union] would be insane and suicidal\u2019, he resolves.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u2018We\u2019re never going to go back to that romantic delusion of Victorian isolation, it isn\u2019t going to happen.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u2018There\u2019ll be no industry, there\u2019ll be no trade, there\u2019ll be nothing \u2013 a slow dismal, collapse.

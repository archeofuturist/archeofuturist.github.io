On August 21, 1992, after a period of surveillance, U.S. marshals came upon Harrison; Weaver; Weaver\u2019s 14-year-old son, Sammy; and the family dog, Striker, on a road near the Weaver property. A marshal shot and killed the dog, prompting Sammy to fire at the marshal. In the ensuing gun battle, Sammy and U.S. Marshal Michael Degan were shot and killed. A tense standoff ensued, and on August 22 the FBI joined the marshals besieging Ruby Ridge.<\/span>","filename":"WEAVER_AERIAL_2_t1170","ext":".jpg","w":1170,"h":790,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":168,"tim":1493479088388,"time":1493479088,"md5":"+WajfEdZJtDEQrV+CVcusg==","fsize":197044,"resto":0,"id":"RxNVOUeY","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ruby-ridge-massacre","country_name":"United States","replies":22,"images":5,"unique_ips":14},{"no":123342592,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)11:19:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"That baby had it coming","time":1493479146,"resto":123342512,"id":"H5rT0+lw","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123342773,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)11:20:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123342512\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123342512<\/a><br>Back in the &#039;90s the State was engaged in a widespread program to entrap and\/or murder folks who wanted to live off the grid.

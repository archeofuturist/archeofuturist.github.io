There really isn&#039;t a mainstream political class within the US giving this argument. I don&#039;t know what they would call themselves if they did exist, only that the argument still stands. Islam doesn&#039;t have to come in the form of an oppressive regime. Before the Shah, the women in Iran had much more freedom than they do today. If we want them to be free like us, we&#039;d have to stop overthrowing governments. If I was put into the position of power I would focus on local agriculture and ensure that people had the materials to grow their own food. This is more humanitarian and actually makes sense, but it assumes that governments are there to help people live a good life and provide the knowledge necessary for communities to organize themselves. Instead government just creates death, through murder and privation.","time":1491925812,"resto":120602480,"id":"5Y2pymE6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120613271,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:51:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120613079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120613079<\/a><br>I agree with you, by the way.","time":1491925918,"resto":120602480,"id":"5A5hz+qm","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120613569,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:54:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120602480\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120602480<\/a><br>Because every refugee and migrant will vote for a democratic leader 9 times out of 10, it seems like they are trying to control countries indefinitely.","filename":"1491186621857","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":1028,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491926067738,"time":1491926067,"md5":"BTi\/YzZbVRLhjkRjX2W8kQ==","fsize":80155,"resto":120602480,"id":"pRu5agTq","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120613755,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:56:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120613569\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120613569<\/a><br>This.<br><br>This is why they&#039;re so big on illegal immigration.

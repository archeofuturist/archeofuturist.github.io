Who scheduled &#039;crisis training&#039; drills at Columbine High Schol(CHS) in the weeks before and what was the exact nature of this training?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;25. What was a Denver police officer and a JeffCo sheriff doing at CHS that morning before the shooting started?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;26. What does reputed video evidence from the library and admin office areas show? <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;27. Why does local media refuse to release on-scene video footage from the first half-hour of the incident?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;28. What happened to all the evidence taken from the computers of the trenchcoat mafia gang?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;29. Where are dozens of missing interviews of students, especially those in the science hall? <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;30. Why are there still thousands of pages of investgatory materials that have never been made public, including hundreds of reports of non-Columbine witnesses and tipsters?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;31. Why has the school district&#039;s own report on the shooting, which included the extensive disciplinary records of the trenchcoat mafia associates, not been made public?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;32. Did investigators even try to interview Harris&#039; psychologist, the man perhaps best positioned to know his mental state at the time?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;33.

For the record, I still very much support trump and think he&#039;s doing a good job, but I question his decision to attack Assad as someone who is more far-right than trump, not less.<br><br>I mean even if you disagree, here&#039;s the thing: the story for our goals shouldn&#039;t begin and end with Trump. If that&#039;s the case, what are we gonna do in 4-8 years? The guy is a stepping stone, a litmus test for our agenda, not the finished draft. And don&#039;t forget he&#039;s fighting every tool of the political apparatus to get his agenda across -- 50+ years of forces for rigging and political manipulation that are now pressuring\/attacking a guy who was only inaugurated this January! They are attacking everything he does, almost everything!<br><br>With that being said, cut the guy some slack! Rome wasnt built in a day, Trump is not jesus. He&#039;s gonna mess up and at times he&#039;s gonna come off as siding with the neo-liberal wall street elitists and globalists like any old politician. Welcome to reality, he&#039;s not perfect. But, if you abandon him now don&#039;t think you&#039;re getting another shot at this.","filename":"god-emperor-trump-small","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":393,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491621841717,"time":1491621841,"md5":"IWIBpCdQzpgxXcF7Vh\/uQw==","fsize":94864,"resto":0,"id":"tvbx4LnA","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-pol-peace-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Upon receiving the news about the German Revolution, on November 13, 1918, the Soviet government annulled the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and issued orders to the Red Army to move in the direction of Belarus, Ukraine and the Baltic States in order to establish Soviet governments there. The move of the newly created (on November 16) Western Army that started at night of November 17, 1918, in the operational vacuum created by the withdrawing German Imperial army, in the geneal direction of Belarus, Ukraine and Poland (parts of the latter within the Imperial Russia were referred to as &quot;Privislinsky Krai&quot; ), according to N. Davies, was code-named Target-Vistula.<\/span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Bolsheviks were also implementing a new strategy, &quot;Revolution from abroad&quot; (Revolutsiya izvne\u2014literally, &quot;revolution from the outside&quot;), based on an assumption that revolutionary masses desire revolution but are unable to carry it out without help from more organized and advanced Bolsheviks. Hence, as Leon Trotsky remarked, the revolution should be &quot;brought on bayonets&quot; (of the Red Army), as &quot;through Kiev leads the straight route for uniting with Austro-Hungarian revolution, just as through Pskov and Vilnius goes the way for uniting with German revolution. Offensive on all fronts! Offensive on the west front, offensive on the south front, offensive on the all revolutionary fronts!&quot;.

The basic aim of the operation was to drive through eastern and central Europe, institute Soviet governments in the newly independent countries of that region and support communist revolutions in Germany and Austria-Hungary. The Bolshevik Russian forces did not anticipate serious opposition on the way but their advance was slow due to the continuing civil war. Faced with initial struggles with the uncoordinated local opposition and self-defense forces, the Red Army&#039;s slow offensive westwards continued through late December 1918. On January 12 Soviet High Command declared the goal of Target Vistula operation: deep scouting towards Neman River.

The Tatars, who also claimed Kiev, retaliated in 1324\u20131325, so while Kiev was ruled by a Lithuanian prince, it had to pay a tribute to the Golden Horde. Finally, as a result of the Battle of Blue Waters in 1362, Kiev and surrounding areas were incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania by Algirdas, Grand Duke of Lithuania.[39] In 1482, the Crimean Tatars sacked and burned much of Kiev.[40] In 1569 (Union of Lublin), when the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth was established, the Lithuanian-controlled lands of the Kiev region, Podolia, Volhynia, and Podlachia, were transferred from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania to the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, and Kiev became the capital of Kiev Voivodeship.[41] In 1658 (Treaty of Hadiach), Kiev was supposed to become the capital of the Duchy of Rus&#039; within the Polish\u2013Lithuanian\u2013Ruthenian Commonwealth,[42] but the treaty was never ratified to this extent.[43] Kept by the Russian troops since 1654 (Treaty of Pereyaslav), it became a part of the Tsardom of Russia from 1667 on (Truce of Andrusovo) and enjoyed a degree of autonomy.

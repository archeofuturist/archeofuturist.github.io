How do you deal with Liberals everywhere?<br><br>EVERYONE in university hates fucking Donald Trump bar this one guy who I briefly met. They support Islam, the &quot;pay gap&quot;, all this fucking non sense bull shit. My Anthropology lecturer called Trump a &quot;oompa loompa&quot;.We were also made to read a book from Scott Atran on Terrorism. His whole idea is to let Muslims in and don&#039;t be mean to them. I see that as a threat&quot; - Milo Yiannopoulos. The whole place burst in laughter. My other lecturer said he needs time to take off due when Trump got in. Another lecture said there was inequality in the college faculty, aka more lads teaching than woman, not realizing those people have their OWN FUCKING CHOICE. I&#039;ve had with university campuses and their bullshit agenda and so called &quot;openness&quot; to different views. FUCK THEM. ISALM is Literally CANCER.

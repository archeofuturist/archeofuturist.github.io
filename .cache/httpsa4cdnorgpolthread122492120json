Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492983405460,"time":1492983405,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"1re0JaW9","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":16,"images":6,"unique_ips":10},{"no":122492492,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)17:39:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122492120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122492120<\/a><br>Ring ring Hope is calling, to say you BTFO yourself by the mere act of proposing your ludicrous ideology.<br><br>Irrational aggressors will die.","time":1492983551,"resto":122492120,"id":"9tNQuhw4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122492781,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)17:41:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Do you have any more of those funny infographics?

In short, if dumping mid level radioactive waste straight into a river that flowed past over 100k people wasn&#039;t bad enough, an explosion spread high level waste over a similarly sized population. Thanks to the Soviet style of managing industrial accidents, these people weren&#039;t evacuated for decades and endured a level of radiation exposure not seen again until the Chenobyl liquidators. What reports made it out of there include atrocious accounts of pure terror as whole villages experienced their skin sloughing off and their animals straight up dying with no explanation.<br><br>As well as radiation, anthrax spores, bred to be resistant to all antibiotics were released into the town of Sverdlovsk and the population was just left to die. This is because a single cloth filter was used to separate the drying spores from the heavily populated area the factory was located in. On the day in question, a worker removed the filter for servicing but managers, under pressure from the politburo to sustain production, ran the plant anyway.","filename":"Chernobyl","ext":".jpg","w":990,"h":822,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":103,"tim":1492985442095,"time":1492985442,"md5":"k284z557RCc5Oq\/mvjdCkA==","fsize":661544,"resto":122492120,"id":"4y\/\/eyDU","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122497539,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)18:14:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122495531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122495531<\/a><br>Using your same formula, if we blamed all wars on Communism, wouldn&#039;t that make Cummies the single most deadly thing on the planet?<br><br>Mongolian horde, chinese, russians, native americans were cummies surely :^)<br><br>All wars and natural disasters that weren&#039;t taken care of the way I wanted them to be taken care of were ALLLL communism&#039;s fault! <br><br>That&#039;s how retarded and biased you sound for blaming capitalism for literally everything.

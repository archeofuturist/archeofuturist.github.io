You can&#039;t cut steaks with it well, and it would be awkward to try and eat the steak with it too, you&#039;d have to spoon the piece of steak on it and support it with your finger to get it in your mouth.

You mix an african and white together, and the child that&#039;s born is not truly belonging to the africa, but not considered european either. You cannot also call it a true american, since it&#039;s not native american either. The result is a rootless human being, who literally only can feel affinity with globalist pop-culture and being this bland &quot;citizen of the earth&quot; kinda being.<br><br>If you mix a dane and a german together, or even a pole and a spaniard, the end result is at least someone who can call themselves &quot;european&quot; or &quot;white&quot;.

Assad would be the most stupid man of earth gassing his people. Esspecially NOW. Now that he is winning. <br><br> \/syrian general\/ has been a part of pol for over a year by now. We follow this conflict daily. And this &quot;gas attack&quot; has happened before. 2013. Back then Assad was blamed as well and the media went crazy over bombing him, just like right now. And Obama with his autistic \u00b4red line\u00b4 almost did, until the CIA told him that in fact it wasnt Assad using gas, but Al-Nusra who got it through the Turkish intelligent service. This is not a conspiracy theory like 9\/11, but confirmed by most experts on the war. <br><br> Let me tell you this. Assad is the only choice. The only choice for Christians, Druze and Alevites in Syria to live in peace and without being beheaded, like the &quot;moderate&quot; jihadis did before. The alternative is another jihadi disaster like in Afghanisten (today 40% of Afghanistan is controlled by Taliban again), Lybia third of Lybia is under jihadi control), Iraq (IS, enough said). <br><br>The question I ask my fellow American shitposters is: Do you want US soldiers to fight another war for Israel? (((They))) will flood this board, now that even the CIA realized how important it is. Dont give the shills attention. Stay true to \/pol\/s motto: IT\u00b4S THE KIKES and it will never change. Make your choice now. And that choice should be Assad. Everything else is the shills agenda. <br><br>We are in this together.","filename":"sg- SYRIA GENERAL","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491507648786,"time":1491507648,"md5":"Tr8GFf6mc4qrGMySMsXq5Q==","fsize":31924,"resto":0,"id":"N4cgq1HA","country":"AT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sg-adressing-pol","country_name":"Austria","replies":163,"images":62,"unique_ips":97,"tail_size":50},{"no":119783490,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:42:25","name":"Anonymous","filename":"sg","ext":".jpg","w":367,"h":807,"tn_w":56,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491507745904,"time":1491507745,"md5":"IOEJBwE05R7kWkokdogaWw==","fsize":109205,"resto":119783291,"id":"N4cgq1HA","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":119783491,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:42:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Not everything is a false flag you dingle berry. <br><br>Actually most things arent","time":1491507747,"resto":119783291,"id":"40rnFUnf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119783676,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:43:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Turkish officials have confirmed that the attack was done by Assad&#039;s regime. <br><br>Can you guys just apologize for backing a mass murdering psychopath?","filename":"1491473563762","ext":".jpg","w":536,"h":907,"tn_w":73,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491507834091,"time":1491507834,"md5":"zssu96EWL7Pm2qtVXZB2rQ==","fsize":119640,"resto":119783291,"id":"vpOESU6w","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119783700,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:44:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119783491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119783491<\/a><br>http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/f9aZ2O7.jpg<br><br>look at the evidence<br><br>If a chemical attack is enough to drag USA into war anywhere in the world.

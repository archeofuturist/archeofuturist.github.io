I don&#039;t fit into either camp myself (or to the current version of leftism for that matter), but I do wonder why two groups who are so different on paper often intermingle. Is it due to both wanting to restore &quot;smaller&quot; forms of governmental structures (i.e. the nationalist wants their country less entangled in globalism and the libertarian--usually--wants more local control at the state level)? I&#039;ve noticed both sides have a (reasonable) dislike of bureaucracy, so this might be the case, but is it the only or main reason? Any thoughts or theories behind the alliance, or did I basically get it right with my initial impression?<br><br>(Also, I am aware that there are nationalists and libertarian camps that despise one another, but I&#039;m not talking about those at the moment, though feel free to bring them up if you wish.)","filename":"integrity","ext":".jpg","w":360,"h":600,"tn_w":150,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490846058229,"time":1490846058,"md5":"7OwGzgfK5n36uS1G9K33Gw==","fsize":59130,"resto":0,"id":"iIQYV5XG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-curious-alliance-between-rightlibertarians","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":1,"unique_ips":13},{"no":118879110,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)23:56:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118878847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118878847<\/a><br><br>I am National Capitalist so I am libertarian Nationalist.

I don&#039;t fit into either camp myself (or to the current version of leftism for that matter), but I do wonder why two groups who are so different on paper often intermingle. Is it due to both wanting to restore &quot;smaller&quot; forms of governmental structures (i.e. the nationalist wants their country less entangled in globalism and the libertarian--usually--wants more local control at the state level)? I&#039;ve noticed both sides have a (reasonable) dislike of bureaucracy, so this might be the case, but is it the only or main reason? Any thoughts or theories behind the alliance, or did I basically get it right with my initial impression?<br><br>(Also, I am aware that there are nationalists and libertarian camps that despise one another, but I&#039;m not talking about those at the moment, though feel free to bring them up if you wish.)","filename":"integrity","ext":".jpg","w":360,"h":600,"tn_w":150,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490846058229,"time":1490846058,"md5":"7OwGzgfK5n36uS1G9K33Gw==","fsize":59130,"resto":0,"id":"iIQYV5XG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-curious-alliance-between-rightlibertarians","country_name":"United States","replies":48,"images":11,"unique_ips":33},{"no":118879110,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)23:56:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118878847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118878847<\/a><br><br>I am National Capitalist so I am libertarian Nationalist.

I believe in a world where people will be judged by their characters and not their skin colors, and the best way to do that (in the immediate future) is to destroy the far left and its cultural influence.

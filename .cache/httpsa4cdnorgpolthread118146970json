We DO NOT have the same form of government, laws, rights and constitution. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How can you guys let this happen?? <\/span><br>When a new party is elected into government, they hand pick the senate and pass whatever laws they want. This is NOT America. We do not vote on Senators. They are hand picked political partisans and people who are well connected. <br><br>Canada DOES NOT &quot;Free Speech&quot; and it&#039;s not protected. We DO NOT have better Free Speech laws than America.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m sure one of you is going to paste the link to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Please read the first paragraph. Also, notice it&#039;s not the US Constitution of US Bill of Rights. That belongs to Americans and only Americans.<\/span><br>Do you think Mexicans have the same laws as America (does Mexico even have laws??)<br>Then why the hell would Canada have the same laws as USA???<br><br>Canada IS NOT America.<br><br>Canada is comparable to America because we have 1950s USA Suburbia here.

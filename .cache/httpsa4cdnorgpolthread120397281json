No, I&#039;m serious. I will post a screenshot if necessary so you can see what i fucking mean.<br><br>Yes, the title is correct, And they&#039;re pushing as hard as they can to divide us from Trump over this Syria issue. They&#039;re so blatant that I don&#039;t fear the average user here before this raid began is fooled, but either the majority of our former userbase has (((mysteriously))) vanished (going full-tinfoil and going to suggest that the owners of this site combed through the IP&#039;s of each user on this board during the last hack and systematically blocked Trump supporting users from the entire website as a means of literal consensus-cracking) or the shills have so thoroughly infested this board. But judging from the lack of UID increase (if anything, we&#039;ve gone DOWN in numbers since the hack), I don&#039;t see any other explanation than the majority of the former userbase here leaving without a trace and for whatever reason have yet to come back.<br><br>The mods, curiously, who would formerly ban such obvious astroturfers on sight, are doing next to nothing about this. I&#039;ve only been lurking and posting here a few years, but in all my time I&#039;ve never seen such a goddamn tremendous raid.

It is not a coincidence that nearly all the pro-trump e-celebs all, as if on que, turned on Trump over the Syria bombing. It&#039;s not a coincidence that they shared heavily similar if not the exact same arguments and wording. It&#039;s not a coincidence that these shills here are echoing the EXACT SAME ARGUMENTS AND WORDING as these e-celebs were. Big big money was waiting for a moment such as this to activate their controlled-op alt-right celebrities and army of shills to raid us. Fuck off with this &quot;just wait a week, and they&#039;ll get tired and leave&quot;.

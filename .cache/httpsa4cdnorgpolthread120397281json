This stuff annoys them a lot more than what you actually were trying to say. One solid advice is to use proper grammar and don&#039;t spout too much memes like we do here on 4\/pol\/ such as &quot;Can you fags gimme a quick rundown on (((Drumpf)))? Are his habbenings redpilled or did he fucked his shit up, senpai?&quot; since they know nobody rarely speaks like this at infinitychan.<\/span><br><br><br>Not so sure about that. I also heard there&#039;s been two new mods that nobody&#039;s heard of before that have showed up on 8pol&#039;s mod team right after the hack, without any explanation whatsoever. Haven&#039;t verified it, but either way, something is going on there. I&#039;m at the point where I fear 8pol is about to be lost. This place is less fucking cancerous now.","time":1491803021,"resto":120397281,"id":"ziFPxyG3","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120400043,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)01:43:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120397281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120397281<\/a><br>Noticed lots of shills but it&#039;s been the weekend so I haven&#039;t been on as much and I&#039;m sure others have done the same. I had one of my devices banned because I had reported some obvious shill threads where the topics were &quot;haha drumpf&quot; with some retarded picture. <br><br>There&#039;s active raids and they think they are doing permanent damage so they just keep on coming. A lot of the lefties don&#039;t like Israel but only because of muh palestine so they are fine with &quot;calling out the jews&quot; and acting like an average user. There&#039;s also sg people, which I generally like but they are so tied up with Assad they felt even more hurt. I understand the decision Trump made and am fine with it. The shilling on the board is not really anything worse than around election night but it is pretty annoying.","filename":"pleasure island","ext":".jpg","w":897,"h":1200,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491803037721,"time":1491803037,"md5":"4fGfn6onMvqpx5l479\/w\/Q==","fsize":349287,"resto":120397281,"id":"gH2Gatzu","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120400119,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)01:44:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120397281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120397281<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I was expecting it to die down, but they&#039;ve shown no sign of stopping.<\/span><br>I&#039;ve noticed they slow down in the evenings though.","time":1491803080,"resto":120397281,"id":"YUB6w2by","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

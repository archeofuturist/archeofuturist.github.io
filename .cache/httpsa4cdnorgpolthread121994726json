But before she can jump she is stopped by Santa Claus who asks her why she would do such a thing. She tells him that she lost her job and that her husband took the kids with him when he left her.

Santa replies that a quick blowjob would be nice. So she gets down on her knees and gives the best blowjob she&#039;s ever given. But halfway through Santa starts laughing.

Even the best case scenarios in my mind can only be bought by pain. The very worst possibility is that we have never even had a chance against the globalists, and that it could come to what the crazy conspiracy theorists had imagined... False flag attack on the US. Martial law. Things like fema camps and registrations and even imprisonment for those who have previously held dissenting views. <br>That is a worse case scenario with little chance of it happening, but if it were to occur, then we men and women would have to reveal our true characters, and either becomes lowly villains, who&#039;d turn on a friend as easily as eat a breakfast, or become the kind of men and women who are the strength of a dozen generations to come. Those kinds of heroics are not fairy tale. The twentieth century is filled with sung and unsung heroes from around the world who fill your eyes with tears of awe. I guess that would be the best part of a worst case scenario would be. It would reveal who we are and what we really believe. It is terrifying and it makes my stomach sour. The thing is though, is that it is no longer a destiny that can be mocked away. For those who know just a smidgen of what the deep state is all about, they can see that things are turning in extremely strange and upsetting directions.","time":1491778042,"resto":120348854,"id":"LhHjxaH\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120350815,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:47:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120349711\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120349711<\/a>","filename":"screen_shot_2016-03-21_at_10.32.26_am","ext":".png","w":641,"h":454,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1491778058845,"time":1491778058,"md5":"oQmY5dQRpx+LRp5kHJomYQ==","fsize":266623,"resto":120348854,"id":"ZEPAAlcz","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120350900,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:48:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"your entire life you have been fed BS about our founding documents.<br>only at higher levels of history study do you understand this.","filename":"all men are created equal","ext":".png","w":534,"h":377,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1491778097615,"time":1491778097,"md5":"NlPCnEpe20XZKfOJu11mGA==","fsize":106485,"resto":120348854,"id":"5pnmoykt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120351297,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:51:21","name":"Anonymous","filename":"when meeting normies into politics debate - Copy","ext":".png","w":552,"h":215,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":48,"tim":1491778281054,"time":1491778281,"md5":"\/ixDFyUbGl6jpSsv3SRt0A==","fsize":52839,"resto":120348854,"id":"s00XLpeu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120351471,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:52:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120349711\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120349711<\/a><br>F<br><a href=\"#p120351297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120351297<\/a><br>That&#039;s a good idea, actually.","time":1491778350,"resto":120348854,"id":"NfTzjJrt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120351595,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:53:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120349711\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120349711<\/a><br>does anyone know if this dog&#039;s owner actually made it?","time":1491778407,"resto":120348854,"id":"nikZGIYR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120351768,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:54:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120350900\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120350900<\/a><br>26 July, 1581","filename":"Screenshot_20170410-005419","ext":".png","w":1080,"h":1920,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491778482807,"time":1491778482,"md5":"UGzRQPjEO+DSRZ5A3Ik0Jg==","fsize":332857,"resto":120348854,"id":"ZEPAAlcz","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120351897,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:55:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120351595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120351595<\/a><br>Yeah, in the original picture there&#039;s a lady being comforted by an officer\/friend and shes crying about ~feet from the doggo","time":1491778538,"resto":120348854,"id":"s00XLpeu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120351907,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:55:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120349711\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120349711<\/a><br>With shit like this happening I fully support giving the dog a respected funeral and let the terrorist rot in an unmarked grave.<br><br>Show that scum we value the life of an animal more than theirs.","time":1491778542,"resto":120348854,"id":"TUnz+Yii","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120352048,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)18:56:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hermann G\u00f6ring: The 300 Spartans <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=q7v<wbr>bi6c6ePQ","time":1491778604,"resto":120348854,"id":"V0g9tT6i","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"}]}

Its an open declaration that they have no plans to ever bring jobs to the area, so residents can now easily make the 20 mile trip into Cardiff every day! yay! how nice! But lets look at who actually got paid to build the road - it was the Costain Group PLC. PLC means that they sell shares\/stocks.<br>The Heads of the Valleys roads was just the EU dumping money into the stock markets, and in return getting a road no one needed.<br><br>Ponty Lido - an outdoor swimming pool thats shut 11 months of the year.<br><br>Queen street extra platform - Something that was never needed. Again built by a PLC.<br><br>University fund for new building. A university no one goes to and is shit. New facilities should be paid for by their income. Their income increases as their standard of teaching increases.<br><br>Jobs Growth Wales - a scheme that boasts a 100% success rate in finding people long-term employment. 100%! imagine that! To me having a 100% success rate doesn&#039;t sound quite right and then you realise why - the only companies approved for the scheme are those that can afford to pay for labor anyway, and certainly after the scheme ends. This is literally just the EU giving money to already successful businesses.<br><br>&quot;Foodie Heaven&quot; a restaurant thats now paid for by our government, but is in the middle of nowhere.<br><br>&quot;Masters of Finance&quot; - a group of 40 graduates get 1.4m between them to learn how to gamble with the economy.<br><br>60m on &quot;welsh-irish relationship support&quot;.

Iran, considered an urgent national-security priority, is thought to be three to five years away from possessing even a single nuclear device. North Korea is widely believed to have as many as ten already, and to be producing more every year. (It is also the first developing nation thought to be capable of striking the continental United States with a long-range ballistic missile.) And whereas Iraq did not, after all, have weapons of mass destruction, North Korea is believed to have large stockpiles of chemical weapons (mustard gas, sarin, VX nerve agent) and biological weapons (anthrax, botulism, cholera, hemorrhagic fever, plague, smallpox, typhoid, yellow fever). An actual war on the Korean peninsula would almost certainly be the bloodiest America has fought since Vietnam\u2014possibly since World War II. In recent years Pentagon experts have estimated that the first ninety days of such a conflict might produce 300,000 to 500,000 South Korean and American military casualties, along with hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths. The damage to South Korea alone would rock the global economy.","time":1492460166,"resto":121560928,"id":"aQqFE3cO","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121575167,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:17:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121560928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121560928<\/a><br>What a surprise that the new president of the dumbest country in the world wants to attack other countries in the name of the kikes and the folks are ok with that.

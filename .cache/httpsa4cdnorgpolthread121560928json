Probably not. <br>That doesn&#039;t minimize the fact that they have one of the world&#039;s largest militaries, probably the largest chemical weapon stockpile in the world next to us, nuclear capabilities, 90 submarines, close proximity to two of our allies whom we&#039;ve vowed to protect, and just about no inhibitions whatsoever. If they even hint at using those nukes, china will absolutely get involved because they don&#039;t want us there and they sure as fuck don&#039;t want Norks to irradiate the South China Sea on their way out. <br><br>This would get very messy and very expensive, very quickly. Not to mention it would be political suicide for Donald Trump when millions of Japanese and South Koreans, plus the millions of people in North Korean labor camps, all die just to take away that fat kids nukes. <br><br>There are better ways and I would all but guarantee we don&#039;t take military action unless they strike us first and even then, we&#039;d just do enough to take out their ability to hit us.","time":1492456365,"resto":121560928,"id":"tmUywI3B","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121566189,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)15:14:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121565658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121565658<\/a><br>Probably would have if it wasn&#039;t crazy fanaticism to believe the Kims are literally god.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic related, its a Nork Bathtub for the people who come from more affluent families.<\/span>","filename":"nork bath","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":1000,"tn_w":81,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492456462172,"time":1492456462,"md5":"kAl7Ng0z8C0ttJhXFsXtGw==","fsize":208613,"resto":121560928,"id":"oIhxn2rg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121566263,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)15:14:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121560928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121560928<\/a><br>My only hope is that any war against NK is 100% all in and everything including nukes are on the table and ready to launch.<br><br>Do not strike NK and allow them to counter against SK or Japan and give China a chance\/justification to back NK.

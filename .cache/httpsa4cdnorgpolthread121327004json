However, linguists have had a hard time establishing the precise relationship of the Baltic languages to other languages in the Indo-European family. Several of the extinct Baltic languages have a limited or nonexistent written record, their existence being known only from the records of ancient historians and personal or place names. All of the languages in the Baltic group (including the living ones) were first written down relatively late in their probable existence as distinct languages. These two factors combined with others have obscured the history of the Baltic languages, leading to a number of theories regarding their position in the Indo-European family.<br><br>The Baltic languages show a close relationship with the Slavic languages, and are grouped with them in a Balto-Slavic family by most scholars. This family is considered to have developed from a common ancestor, Proto-Balto-Slavic. Later on, several lexical, phonological and morphological dialectisms developed, separating the various Balto-Slavic languages from each other. Although it is generally agreed that the Slavic languages developed from a single more-or-less unified dialect (Proto-Slavic) that split off from common Balto-Slavic, there is more disagreement about the relationship between the Baltic languages.","time":1492345664,"resto":121327004,"id":"uDmAIFlG","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":121353227,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)08:28:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121352006\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121352006<\/a><br>The traditional view is that the Balto-Slavic languages split into two branches, Baltic and Slavic, with each branch developing as a single common language (Proto-Baltic and Proto-Slavic) for some time afterwards. Proto-Baltic is then thought to have split into East Baltic and West Baltic branches. However, more recent scholarship has suggested that there was no unified Proto-Baltic stage, but that Proto-Balto-Slavic split directly into three groups: Slavic, East Baltic and West Baltic. Under this view, the Baltic family is paraphyletic, and consists of all Balto-Slavic languages that are not Slavic. This would imply that Proto-Baltic, the last common ancestor of all Baltic languages, would be identical to Proto-Balto-Slavic itself, rather than distinct from it.<br><br>Finally, there is a minority of scholars who argue that Baltic descended directly from Proto-Indo-European, without an intermediate common Balto-Slavic stage. They argue that the many similarities and shared innovations between Baltic and Slavic are due to several millennia of contact between the groups, rather than shared heritage.","time":1492345684,"resto":121327004,"id":"uDmAIFlG","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":121354118,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)08:38:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121352918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121352918<\/a><br>if you&#039;d read up about the soviet russification of the baltics you&#039;d understand why calling it a conspiracy is retarded.","time":1492346338,"resto":121327004,"id":"313tTqRI","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":121355227,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)08:52:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fuck Germany.

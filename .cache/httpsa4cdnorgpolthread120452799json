that shines upon our tears.<br><br>They went with songs to the battle, they were young, <br>Straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow. <br>They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted;

the morning <br>We will remember them.<br><br>They mingle not with their laughing comrades again; <br>They sit no more at familiar tables of home; <br>They have no lot in our labour of the day-time;

to match a couch. They don&#039;t get art, it&#039;s just fluff to them.<br><br>Art, before it&#039;s downfall with postmodern bullshit, strove to enlighten, entertain, teach, and celebrate. Art recreated scenes that a camera couldn&#039;t - the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel could not be photographed. <br><br>The anti-realism snobbery is what destroyed art. Some of my favorite paintings were from the period right before the wheels started to fall off, with Impressionism (which I like, but it was an offshoot, not the trunk, or shouldn&#039;t have been). My favorite painting at the Legion of Honor is &quot;The Bath&quot;, by Jean-Leon Gerome. <br><br>https:\/\/www.wikiart.org\/en\/jean-leo<wbr>n-gerome\/the-bath<br><br>It&#039;s a jewel of a painting. It&#039;s not large, it&#039;s about 2 feet square. No photos I&#039;ve ever seen do the colors and subtley justice. The painting, beyond it&#039;s &quot;hurr hurr naked butt&quot; quality, is incredible. The expression on the slaves face, the delicacy of her hands on the white woman&#039;s body, the textures, the detail. This was a Master, at his best. This is decades of training in one painting. This is ART. <br><br>Another favorite of mine is William Bouguereau&#039;s &quot;Nymphes et Satyre&quot;, it&#039;s currently hanging in the Metropolitan in NYC. This is a large painting. It&#039;s an incredible show of mastery of color, mood, and lighting. I could look at the colors he used for hours - and have. I learn from this painting every time I see it. <br><br>https:\/\/www.artrenewal.org\/pages\/ar<wbr>twork.php?artworkid=25<br><br>One more - &quot;Spring&quot;, by Alma Tedema. It hangs at the Getty in Malibu. It&#039;s a fascinating painting, another work by a Master at his full powers.

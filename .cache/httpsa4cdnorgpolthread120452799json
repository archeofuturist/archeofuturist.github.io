that shines upon our tears.<br><br>They went with songs to the battle, they were young, <br>Straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow. <br>They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted;

the morning <br>We will remember them.<br><br>They mingle not with their laughing comrades again; <br>They sit no more at familiar tables of home; <br>They have no lot in our labour of the day-time;

to match a couch. They don&#039;t get art, it&#039;s just fluff to them.<br><br>Art, before it&#039;s downfall with postmodern bullshit, strove to enlighten, entertain, teach, and celebrate. Art recreated scenes that a camera couldn&#039;t - the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel could not be photographed. <br><br>The anti-realism snobbery is what destroyed art. Some of my favorite paintings were from the period right before the wheels started to fall off, with Impressionism (which I like, but it was an offshoot, not the trunk, or shouldn&#039;t have been). My favorite painting at the Legion of Honor is &quot;The Bath&quot;, by Jean-Leon Gerome. <br><br>https:\/\/www.wikiart.org\/en\/jean-leo<wbr>n-gerome\/the-bath<br><br>It&#039;s a jewel of a painting. It&#039;s not large, it&#039;s about 2 feet square. No photos I&#039;ve ever seen do the colors and subtley justice. The painting, beyond it&#039;s &quot;hurr hurr naked butt&quot; quality, is incredible. The expression on the slaves face, the delicacy of her hands on the white woman&#039;s body, the textures, the detail. This was a Master, at his best. This is decades of training in one painting. This is ART. <br><br>Another favorite of mine is William Bouguereau&#039;s &quot;Nymphes et Satyre&quot;, it&#039;s currently hanging in the Metropolitan in NYC. This is a large painting. It&#039;s an incredible show of mastery of color, mood, and lighting. I could look at the colors he used for hours - and have. I learn from this painting every time I see it. <br><br>https:\/\/www.artrenewal.org\/pages\/ar<wbr>twork.php?artworkid=25<br><br>One more - &quot;Spring&quot;, by Alma Tedema. It hangs at the Getty in Malibu. It&#039;s a fascinating painting, another work by a Master at his full powers.

I&#039;ve only seen one of his works in person, the &quot;Pied Piper&quot; mural in SF. <br><br>His paintings are great, but how he made this is mind-boggling - he&#039;d start with a mirror smooth canvas, and paint translucent layers of every color, starting with ultramarine. Nothing but ultramarine. He&#039;d let that dry, varnish it, sand it with pumice perfectly flat, then do the next color. He&#039;d build up layers and layers of color, which is why his stuff is so luminous.","filename":"72f6c21bf84c6c0d1de9c2fcacc245dc","ext":".jpg","w":504,"h":438,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1491850855985,"time":1491850855,"md5":"UE+qYccOP2R6dJOyLzF6RQ==","fsize":82144,"resto":120452799,"id":"1IYAv+8o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120473636,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)15:01:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120473054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120473054<\/a><br>Dude could paint a little, too","filename":"Albrecht_Durer_Self-Portrait_age_26","ext":".jpg","w":520,"h":681,"tn_w":95,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491850863688,"time":1491850863,"md5":"TFn3UPxy5sGBlmEGW3fi9A==","fsize":59401,"resto":120452799,"id":"hBk9EmNG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120473928,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)15:02:58","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1481231156646","ext":".jpg","w":1067,"h":1608,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491850978773,"time":1491850978,"md5":"nwKb\/h4iBZ2wdDQSFkJDmA==","fsize":275716,"resto":120452799,"id":"wrHoCPaL","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120474045,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)15:03:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120466854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120466854<\/a><br>breathtaking desu","time":1491851026,"resto":120452799,"id":"siIos\/O\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120474084,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)15:04:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"From the Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Coleridge<br><br>Alone, alone, all, all alone, <br>Alone on a wide wide sea! <br>And never a saint took pity on <br>My soul in agony. <br><br>The many men, so beautiful! <br>And they all dead did lie: <br>And a thousand thousand slimy things <br>Lived on; and so did I. <br><br>I looked upon the rotting sea, <br>And drew my eyes away; <br>I looked upon the rotting deck, <br>And there the dead men lay. <br><br>I looked to heaven, and tried to pray; <br>But or ever a prayer had gusht, <br>A wicked whisper came, and made <br>My heart as dry as dust. <br><br>I closed my lids, and kept them close, <br>And the balls like pulses beat; <br>For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky <br>Lay dead like a load on my weary eye, <br>And the dead were at my feet. <br><br>The cold sweat melted from their limbs, <br>Nor rot nor reek did they: <br>The look with which they looked on me <br>Had never passed away. <br><br>An orphan&#039;s curse would drag to hell <br>A spirit from on high; <br>But oh! more horrible than that <br>Is the curse in a dead man&#039;s eye! <br>Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse, <br>And yet I could not die...","time":1491851043,"resto":120452799,"id":"Pv2J8yp5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120474127,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)15:04:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120473624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120473624<\/a><br>I never knew that.

It avoids the headaches caused by brackets, like making less even if you made more because of different rates, allows people to earn more, would be less complicated than what we have, and would still make the most capable pay the most.

The top marginal tax rate even within bracket systems is high, extremely high in many countries, and the successful people don&#039;t just all up and leave, there are things like established networks and capital.

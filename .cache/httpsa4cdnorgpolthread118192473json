This is contrasted by Western culture which has always been inclusive and accepting of other cultures since the dawn of Christianity- due to its proselytizing nature. In order to convert people you need to be accepting. Also Jesus simply preached to be accepting of the &quot;other.&quot; <br><br>However prior to Christianity, people in the West (as well as everywhere else) were pretty anti-multiculturalism. The Greeks called anyone who didn&#039;t speak Greek a barbarian because when they spoke it sounded like they were saying, &quot;barbar.&quot; The Romans called anyone who didn&#039;t succumb to Roman might savages because they didn&#039;t accept &quot;civil&quot; Roman society. <br><br>Jews haven&#039;t had their own nation since the Kingdom of Judea and their anti-multiculturalism sentiments have survived since then. Basically all people are anti-multicultural except for Christians. I don&#039;t know about Muslims to be honest. They proselytize as well so they also might support it. <br><br>I posit that if Christianity never existed, the West would still be anti-multiculturalism. Basically everywhere else unaffected by Christianity still is. If anyone has any contrasting evidence for this let me know.","time":1490421970,"resto":118192473,"id":"p7OKab1V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118193868,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)02:06:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118192473\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118192473<\/a><br>Europe and the USA are nations of immigrants.

This has been a concept for all of human history. Or do you mean the current agenda of modern progressives? The agenda of identity politics and such.

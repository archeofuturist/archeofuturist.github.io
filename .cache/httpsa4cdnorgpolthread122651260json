If you live alone in the woods with no human contact, you don&#039;t need morality. Humans are social animals, endowed by evolution with a suite of social emotions ranging from guilt, anger, gratitude, compassion, vengeance, shame, etc. They exist because they produce useful moral behaviors. If you hit someone, you&#039;re liable to get hit back. If you can credibly demonstrate that you don&#039;t hit people, unless they hit you, then you&#039;re less likely to get hit. Truly amoral people are rare and often end up dead or in jail because morality doesn&#039;t exist to preserve others, but rather to preserve one&#039;s self in a society of one&#039;s peers.<br><br>Atheists and the religious both derive their morality from the same place, which is a combination of inborn instinctive morality and the social norms in which one was brought up. The difference is that religious people back their morality up by saying that an all powerful being is watching, so you best behave. As an atheist, I recognize that most of my moral values ultimately derive from Protestant religious traditions and represent social institutions built up over centuries by believers.<br><br>Modern standards of morality would not exist without religion and philosophy, but that doesn&#039;t at all prevent the nonreligious, any more than it prevents the non-philosophical, from adopting the same standards as those people around them. Also, knowing that morality is a social tool doesn&#039;t change the fact that I *feel* that something is moral or immoral, because I&#039;m still guided by the same moral emotions as every other neurotypical human.","time":1493076127,"resto":122651260,"id":"jWpgHhnF","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122655306,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)19:22:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122651260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122651260<\/a><br>We don&#039;t, just use common sense","time":1493076129,"resto":122651260,"id":"b9YRbWu1","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122655340,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)19:22:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122654833\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122654833<\/a><br>I agree.

The only situations where people argue FOR torture are when they are weighing the morality of larger situations (the torture is always bad, but the person may &quot;deserve&quot; it by someone&#039;s standard, or perhaps the torture is in order to gain information that could save twice as many lives.) It&#039;s always bad, but possibly not the worst outcome in a grander picture, which is why moral debate exists. If there were an objective answer, we would simply KNOW if torture was ok, and there would never be discussion on the matter.","time":1493084207,"resto":122651260,"id":"TlxnB0Ea","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122672556,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)21:39:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122651260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122651260<\/a><br>Its in the individuals best interest to cooperate and not inflict suffering on others<br>The average person understands this intuitively <br>The majority of criminals are subhuman retards and\/or mentally ill","time":1493084353,"resto":122651260,"id":"M1LRkHGy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122672947,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)21:42:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122651260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122651260<\/a><br>Because I wouldn&#039;t like it if someone pulled my fingernails out, so I wouldn&#039;t do it to them.

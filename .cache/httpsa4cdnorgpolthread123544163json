I really wish to commend them for a job well done and hope other news outlets can strive to one day be at their level. Real A+ reporting going on over there. Does anyone know a link where I can donate my money or time to these visionaries? I really feel terrible getting such amazing stories delivered straight to my computer for free.","time":1493595238,"resto":123544163,"id":"Ury0WzsG","country":"KR","country_name":"South Korea"}]}

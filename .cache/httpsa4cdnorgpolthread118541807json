With everything that has happened, you have given me more hope than I have felt for 8 years. I have written (still have to sell) one book of many in a massive custom made fantasy world of politics and monsters and magic. In honor of \/pol\/, one of the most important factions are Bards, represented by a four leafed clover. The Bards are social outcasts and thieves who spend their time plotting insane coups and alliances in the same breath, just so they can laugh at the results and make a song about it. Their storyline will also be one of prominent entrance into the maintaining the morality and political strength of humankind, in a world that fights to crush them under their heel, as today&#039;s world does with whites. This is all I can do for you, but it is in honor of (you).","filename":"IMG_7304","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":918,"tn_w":174,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490639221833,"time":1490639221,"md5":"oVAdF3hO5v0sTm+i4EspnQ==","fsize":189516,"resto":0,"id":"Gek8IWF+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"guys-i-just-wanted-to-know-how-much-you-have","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

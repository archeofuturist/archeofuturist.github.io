I&#039;ve been watching a lot of Moly lately; and, although I enjoy a lot of his content, the guy is pretty clearly fucked up. A few of the things I&#039;ve noticed: <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sometimes he starts &quot;acting&quot; in a very clear and bizarre manner, like he&#039;ll start swaying and speaking in a different voice; usually this happens when he&#039;s talking about some grand historical concept or something he&#039;s really serious about, like parenting. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;constantly, and I mean constantly, bringing up how young he was when he did intellectual shit. I&#039;ve heard of all the times he skipped his recess to study programming whe nhe was 12 at least six or seven times, and he&#039;s constantly describing how old he was when he read various authors and philosophies. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;constantly and aggressive describing his show as a &quot;philosophy show&quot;, which it isn&#039;t; clearly the program is a current events\/news and politics show which he tries to pass off as &#039;philosophy&#039; because he&#039;s deranged. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;insane inability to take criticism. Go watch that episode with Fritz or whatever his name is to answer this. <\/span><br><br>So anybody on \/pol\/ an armchair psycologist? What the fuck is this guy&#039;s problem and how do we fix him so that one of the most popular youtubers who addresses our issues (race realism, general right wing ideology, etc) doesn&#039;t come off as a fucking raging lunatic to any outside observer. I know I&#039;d be embarrassed to link an impartial outsider a Moly video, even if I did strongly agree with the content.","filename":"maxresdefault (3)","ext":".jpg","w":1159,"h":736,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":158,"tim":1492613340801,"time":1492613340,"md5":"g4+vjwpk0JfB0g4vG5A7Cg==","fsize":47985,"resto":0,"id":"VjSTB2FH","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lets-diagnose-stefan-molyneux-with-the","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121852807,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:01:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121851471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121851471<\/a><br>obviously he has problems with his family relations (thus his defoo)<br>He seems to have especial aversion to his jew mother","time":1492614099,"resto":121851471,"id":"pyKyKe8Z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121853046,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:03:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Schizoid personality disorder<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Affected individuals may be unable to form intimate attachments to others and simultaneously demonstrate a rich, elaborate and exclusively internal fantasy world.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; narcissism<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; a sense of superiority<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; preoccupation with fantasy and introspection<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; indifference to social norms and conventions<\/span>","time":1492614226,"resto":121851471,"id":"fCqkZi+Y","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

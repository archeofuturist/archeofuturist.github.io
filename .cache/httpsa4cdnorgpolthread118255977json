I understand how the Jew needs a multiracial society so that he does not stick out like a Jew to the normies. But what&#039;s the science?

Much harder to do against a cohesive ethnic group because the enforcers would be of the same racial group as those they&#039;re set against -- the Ottoman empire used the same &quot;bringing in foreign racial enforcers&quot; with their Janissaries, white Slavic boys snatched from the Balkans and used to prevent Turk uprisings against the Sultan.","time":1490468000,"resto":118255977,"id":"B1SpR9IP","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118256873,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:53:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"The Jew encourages the mixing of races because the Jew is an international element. A pure race that is proud of its heritage will never allow the Jew to rule over them. Therefore, the Jew is a pathetic creature because he will only ever rule over bastards and mongrels. The biggest problem with race mixing is outbreeding depression, i.e. reduced biological fitness as a result of having genetically distant parents. Heterosis, or hybrid vigor, does occur, but only in the F1 generation. Outbreeding depression occurs in subsequent generations due to the breakdown of coadapted gene complexes.<br><br>In the following link, you&#039;ll read about two populations of boodies that were separated for only 10,000 years, yet scientists still feared outbreeding depression when reintroducing them:<br>https:\/\/m.phys.org\/news\/2015-03-iso<wbr>lated-boodies-repopulate-mainland.h<wbr>tml<br><br>In the next link, you&#039;ll read that reintroducing subspecies of lions created retarded offspring:<br>http:\/\/newsvote.bbc.co.uk\/mpapps\/pa<wbr>getools\/print\/news.bbc.co.uk\/2\/hi\/s<wbr>outh_asia\/4101049.stm<br><br>More links:<br>https:\/\/majorityrights.com\/weblog\/c<wbr>omments\/the_health_consequences_of_<wbr>race_mixing\/<br>https:\/\/majorityrights.com\/weblog\/c<wbr>omments\/alon_ziv_on_race_mixing\/<br><br>Save those in the notes on your phone.","time":1490468002,"resto":118255977,"id":"7fcHdogx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118257089,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:55:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118255977\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118255977<\/a><br>Marrying within the Indo-European \/ Eurasiatic families. <br><br>Racist confirmed.","time":1490468116,"resto":118255977,"id":"16leUmdL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118257380,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:57:46","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IMG_0666","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":1024,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490468266836,"time":1490468266,"md5":"c9ZHLPPmG1c2ILNWAjjPag==","fsize":248086,"resto":118255977,"id":"7fcHdogx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118257440,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:58:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118257089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118257089<\/a><br>What do you mean?","time":1490468299,"resto":118255977,"id":"ZKVr8xPE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118257585,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:59:30","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IMG_0667","ext":".jpg","w":884,"h":1024,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490468370770,"time":1490468370,"md5":"N2LvMc4Mp4JwfrAsCyxD4Q==","fsize":142566,"resto":118255977,"id":"7fcHdogx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118257599,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:59:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118256869\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118256869<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118257380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118257380<\/a><br>Can you hit more of the science like this guy:<br><a href=\"#p118256873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118256873<\/a><br>I am reading now.","time":1490468377,"resto":118255977,"id":"ZKVr8xPE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118257634,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)14:59:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118257440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118257440<\/a><br>In a limited taxonomy, Indians are the same &quot;race&quot; as us but they are still quite distant genetically.

When Trump won the election he exposed how useless political polls are, so now if his Presidency is even mildly successful he&#039;ll prove that political experience isn&#039;t necessarily a requirement. And that puts the jobs of everyone in Congress at risk the next time they&#039;re up for election. So every time a politician comes on TV and says what Trump is doing is wrong, remember that person is completely incapable of objectivity on the subject.","time":1490439319,"resto":118212262,"id":"jPtXSW1\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118213796,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:58:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"He said everyone would be covered under his plan.

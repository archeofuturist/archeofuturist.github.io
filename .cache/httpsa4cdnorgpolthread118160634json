He is supposed to the guy to make things happen as he understands the Washington environment. But Bannon on the other hand is all chaos. He loves the Trump tweets and the fuck it all approach to go make shit happen.<br><br>This healthcare bill was Trump going with Priebus. Bannon was openly against and even leaking shit to Breitbart. Priebus and Ryan tried to make it happen and Trump shilled for them, but it was low energy shilling cuz Trump wasn&#039;t ever sold on the bill. So it failed.<br><br>And now Bannon will have a lot more pull on Trump and I&#039;d imagine both Priebus and Ryan&#039;s (as speaker) days are numbered.<br><br>tldr; today was a loss no doubt, but this is a long term win. Trump tried to be the typical politician and he didn&#039;t like it.

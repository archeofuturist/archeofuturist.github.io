I have a theory 9\/11 just left a hole where creativity used to be because it just left people hopeless for the future. That feeling seemed to die out during the 2010s. With the rise of cultural libertarianism during that time, the culture began to change in a way I can&#039;t describe. Perhaps the 2000s were more edgy and the 2010s less so?

Pic related.<br>You have heard of an EMP, which can be caused naturally as well. A Nuclear EMP is several times worse.<br>No food delivery, no medicine, no electricity, no \/pol\/ of course.<br>The debris in space will also knock out most of the earth&#039;s lower satellites. You need to understand that Mutually Assured Destruction is an incentive to North Korea, not a deterrent, as they welcome death if it is for an &quot;honorable&quot; cause.<br>Foreign powers and United Nations would likely be on our soil in the first week for &quot;humanitarian relief.&quot;<br>When North Korea says they can destroy the world with two or three nukes, they do mean that literally. It is just that we are not given the complete picture by Western media broadcasts.<br>Trump is not in a position where it makes sense to tell the public about this, as the panic would be impossible to contain. Think food riots and looting, millions from the cities fleeing inland.<br>Any attack against North Korea will have to be a quick decapitation strike to prevent them from detonating whatever they have in the satellites. Extreme risk.<br>This is what the Obama Admin briefed Trump on, back in November-December when they met inside the WH. Trump looked like a ghost when he realized the seriousness of the situation.<br>At this point, whatever is in the satellites is somewhat of an x factor. But an attentive observer will note N Korea&#039;s tone has changed from saber rattling to collected, unflinching confidence.","filename":"EMPStrike","ext":".jpg","w":739,"h":568,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":192,"tim":1493250774197,"time":1493250774,"md5":"WVIEAjilZm+y8DScNpWkEA==","fsize":140217,"resto":0,"id":"sXuBqRpN","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"north-korea-has-two-satellites-in-orbit-already","country_name":"United States","replies":62,"images":10,"unique_ips":46},{"no":122960845,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:55:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122960557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122960557<\/a><br>This seems rediculous to me.

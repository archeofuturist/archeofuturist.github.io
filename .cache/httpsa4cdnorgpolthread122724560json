Now he&#039;s telling Breitbart he supports a 20% tariff on lumber imported from Canada. Way to fuck the construction trade over. Almost all the pine used in construction is from Canada. Cheap Canadian lumber is essential to the trade. I hope you fags like your homes being built by nothing but spics now because companies are going to have to hire cheaper labor to offset the cost.","filename":"lumber1 15inch","ext":".jpg","w":1440,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493120081197,"time":1493120081,"md5":"LOYmUDRaZFNxGFEis9wRDQ==","fsize":207678,"resto":0,"id":"y5wnqI5x","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-can-you-guys-support-this-orange-clown-now","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":122724663,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:36:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122724560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122724560<\/a><br>Why you so worked up over wood?

I do commercial construction not so much residential. This isn&#039;t some homeowner having to pay slightly more for his house. That&#039;s not how it works. A lot of the places are built way in advanced with no guarantee in residency because the market is booming, especially right now. People aren&#039;t going to wanna build these places anymore or the cost is going to get offset onto the contractors and they will try to hire cheaper labor. Its a lose lose. If i was a sub contractor running my own jobs which I&#039;m thankfully not then I&#039;d be fucked.","time":1493120594,"resto":122724560,"id":"y5wnqI5x","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

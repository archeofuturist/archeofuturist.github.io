Now he&#039;s telling Breitbart he supports a 20% tariff on lumber imported from Canada. Way to fuck the construction trade over. Almost all the pine used in construction is from Canada.

I hope you fags like your homes being built by nothing but spics now because companies are going to have to hire cheaper labor to offset the cost.","filename":"lumber1 15inch","ext":".jpg","w":1440,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493120081197,"time":1493120081,"md5":"LOYmUDRaZFNxGFEis9wRDQ==","fsize":207678,"resto":0,"id":"y5wnqI5x","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-can-you-guys-support-this-orange-clown-now","country_name":"United States","replies":30,"images":5,"unique_ips":26},{"no":122724663,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:36:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122724560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122724560<\/a><br>Why you so worked up over wood?

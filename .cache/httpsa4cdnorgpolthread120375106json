You have a handful of options going for a conversion. A full M-16 conversion requires the fire control group (legal to buy and own, not hard to find), drilling the auto sear disco hole, and milling put the fire control group area to fit the full auto parts.

The part is simple and allows select fire, but it isn&#039;t something you just can go out in the garage and whip up on the workbench in an hour wih hillbilly tools. You&#039;re not buying a transferable drop in auto sear for under $17,000 and anything you buy online from another country is already an ATF honeypot.","time":1491792274,"resto":120375106,"id":"AAVpgTuK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

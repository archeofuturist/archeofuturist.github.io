There are tons of ways you can vote illegally. For example in New Hampshire a democratic politician was caught registering a bunch of people as living in her house for the purposes of establishing residency- and thus voting rights- in the state of New Hampshire.<br><br>The same kind of residency loopholes used to apply to Florida, which is why over the past 8 years they&#039;ve massively tightened rules in Florida- I&#039;m pretty sure voter roles are purged every few years forcing people to renew their voting registration or be unable to vote come election day.<br><br>And in Wayne County (Detroit) they found that a bunch of liberal districts had &quot;accidentally&quot; scanned multiple ballots for Hillary multiple times, resulting in votes for Hillary being counted two, three, four times instead of once.<br><br>In Wisconsin this year you needed a photo voter ID to vote. Even if you didn&#039;t have the ID if you could establish you were a Wisconsinite voter then you could vote. In order to establish you&#039;re a voter in Wisconsin you only need to present the same kind of documents required to get a driver&#039;s license. Mysteriously 300,000 fewer people voted and Trump won the state by something like 20,000 votes. How very &quot;strange&quot;. What&#039;s even more &quot;strange&quot; is that people were also saying Minnesota would go red- but Minnesota doesn&#039;t have voter ID. Hillary won Minnesota by something like 40,000 votes. Isn&#039;t that &quot;strange&quot;.<br><br>Wherever Democrats are powerful there are always irregularities. In California in particular they were actively trying to register Mexicans. It&#039;s pretty much guaranteed that in 2020 after beaners are deported that California will be a lot closer electorally speaking.","time":1490760769,"resto":118736538,"id":"YTsPnLb9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118745342,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:12:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118744977\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118744977<\/a><br>You can do all of that with a fake ID.

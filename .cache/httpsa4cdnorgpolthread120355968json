The breaks on a Jewish geopolitical machine have just been solidly engaged. Trump isn&#039;t going to strike Syria anymore because to do so would result in WW3. All he has to do is say precisely that, and the game is over. This absolves him and the USA from any regime-change effort in Syria, which truth be told has been initiated from the get-go by Israel and American Jews. The only play left will be for Jews to get on their Jew-owned news networks and scream that Trump isn&#039;t doing enough in Syria, or even worse\u2014demand Trump fight Russia. This would tip their hand to the public at large. Assad ISN&#039;T WORTH a nuclear holocaust. The lives of Jews AREN&#039;T WORTH Armageddon. Even the most libby libshit faggot or inbred toothless hick will understand this point. The media&#039;s completely out of its mind with Russia conspiracies anyway, so to shill for WW3 would be their ultimate undoing. <br><br>In the coming months, expect zero American intervention in Syria, followed by Israel directly intervening either through drone strikes or air strikes. With the American angle completely played out and spent, they will assume a more direct and overt role.

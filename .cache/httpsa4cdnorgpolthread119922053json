I trust Trump&#039;s judgment that the chemical attacks were in fact carried out by the Assad regime since he was sceptical of such things beforehand and has proven his nose when it comes to false-flags like the Jewish community threats. Now that he is president he has access to intel on another level and firing missiles on the airbase from which the mobile-shoha-planes took off seems like very appropriate act to me. It gives him leverage in the upcoming negotiations and confronts Russia with the same kind of abstract warfare they&#039;re conducting with constant breaking of treaties and following cover ups or propaganda.","time":1491559004,"resto":119922053,"id":"E\/WRX2f0","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119923107,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:56:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Trump is just a stalking horse for the neoconservatives to keep dicing up the middle east for Jews and Israel <br><br>Long live al Assad","time":1491559005,"resto":119922053,"id":"JfFBIJWj","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":119923150,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:57:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119923008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119923008<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying anyone here supports an invasion<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;being an assad fanboy<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2017<\/span>","time":1491559030,"resto":119922053,"id":"3tZEJgJU","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":119923158,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:57:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119922053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119922053<\/a><br><br>Common sense is letting Assad win.","time":1491559032,"resto":119922053,"id":"0e+qD4mG","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119923163,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:57:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"\/o\/<br>\\o\\<br>\\o\/<br>heil hitler","time":1491559034,"resto":119922053,"id":"JjXKk6BV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119923177,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:57:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119922806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119922806<\/a><br><br>&quot;Retarde orange lies to his population, is a kike scum puppet, many such cases to come&quot;","time":1491559042,"resto":119922053,"id":"DHvfkcPq","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119923237,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:57:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119922053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119922053<\/a>","filename":"1490706535848-pol","ext":".jpg","w":823,"h":960,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491559076707,"time":1491559076,"md5":"BCR3rsHCMMkQub2LSRzN+w==","fsize":160574,"resto":119922053,"id":"\/HjfEcRy","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119923246,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:58:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119922053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119922053<\/a><br>Nah.","time":1491559081,"resto":119922053,"id":"8cFm4fPG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119923247,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:58:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119922053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119922053<\/a><br>Assad will not fall, it has been decided.","filename":"theprophet","ext":".png","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491559081404,"time":1491559081,"md5":"nN6hQddawnjoO\/SBoWejjQ==","fsize":872866,"resto":119922053,"id":"63fHoKcU","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119923328,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:59:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119923104\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119923104<\/a>","filename":"1478802782759-pol","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":721,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491559140381,"time":1491559140,"md5":"Ae\/u0HcYXOMK27jsxvNIbw==","fsize":68926,"resto":119922053,"id":"\/HjfEcRy","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119923340,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:59:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Praise Assad","time":1491559150,"resto":119922053,"id":"AQeslRYj","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119923354,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:59:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119922053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119922053<\/a><br>Would he really gas children?

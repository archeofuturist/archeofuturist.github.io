Art is usually only cutting edge once, and genres tend to have a shelf life. There is only one O\u2019Keefe, only one Eastwood, only one Bach. Those genres, recomposed for today, would not have the impact because they already did. The easiest way to create a niche is to push a boundary (for example, Ke$ha, Katie Perry, Madonna). Preserving tradition often results in preserving the status quo, and taking that to a level of marketable creativity is only for the artistic genius (It\u2019s a Wonderful Life; The Passion; The Blind Side; Amazing Grace).

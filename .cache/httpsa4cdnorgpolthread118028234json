The vagueness of the term itself is such that the libertarian system would be considered anarchist by some people and archist by others. We must therefore turn to history for enlightenment; here we find that none of the proclaimed anarchist groups correspond to the libertarian position, that even the best of them have unrealistic and socialistic elements in their doctrines. Furthermore, we find that all of the current anarchists are irrational collectivists, and therefore at opposite poles from our position. We must therefore conclude that we are not anarchists, and that those who call us anarchists are not on firm etymological ground, and are being completely unhistorical. <\/span><br><br>https:\/\/mises.org\/library\/are-liber<wbr>tarians-anarchists<br><br><a href=\"#p118033361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118033361<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;were reliant on costly transportation methods<\/span><br><br>fucking roads REEEEEEEEE","filename":"1474553783683","ext":".png","w":562,"h":504,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":112,"tim":1490326460476,"time":1490326460,"md5":"PQ50T7etQ7uL561RlIdVhA==","fsize":149588,"resto":118028234,"id":"++zgWAI+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118034220,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)23:34:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118033916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118033916<\/a><br>Do you know what a contract is?

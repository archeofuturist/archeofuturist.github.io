I concluded this as I saw no reason why Assad would use chemical weapons at this time considering the good trend in the situation and the opportunity of (((them))) to exploit this. There is a reason for Assad though, that as that is to test the boundaries and extent to which Trump will intervene and to what extent he will carry over the preexisting american foreign policy from the Obama era (the red line). If you trusted Trump before this then you have little reason to not trust him on his decision, Trump has Intel that we do not such as the imagery of the bombers being loaded with chemical weapons.

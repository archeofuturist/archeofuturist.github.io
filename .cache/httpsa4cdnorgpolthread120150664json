Regarding the authenticity of the Protocols a rabid and complex debate has erupted, which can be dismissed, however, by Gu\u00e9non&#039;s correct observation that a truly occult organization, no matter what its nature, never leaves behind written documents or &quot;protocols.&quot; Thus, in the most favorable hypothesis, the Protocols could have been the work of someone who had contacts with some representatives of this alleged organization. However, we cannot agree either with those who wish to dismiss this document as a vulgar mystification, forgery, and work of plagiarism. The main argument adduced by the latter is that the Protocols reproduce and paraphrase in many parts the ideas found in a short book written by a certain Maurice Joly during the period of Napoleon&#039;s Second Empire. Allegedly, mysterious provocateurs of the Czar&#039;s secret police were responsible for writing the Protocols. This argument is truly irrelevant: those who decry plagiarism should keep in mind that this is not a matter of a literary work or of copyright. For example, when a general writes a plan, he could employ previous materials and writings as long as they contain ideas fit for his purpose. This would be a case of plagiarism, but it would not affect at all the question of whether or not this plan has really been conceived and carried out. Cutting short all this\u2014that is, leaving aside the issue of the &quot;authenticity&quot; of the document in terms of real protocols stolen from an international secret organization.","time":1491674138,"resto":120150664,"id":"zgWDHEfF","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120159874,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:56:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120159801\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120159801<\/a><br>the only important and essential point is the following: this writing is part of a group of texts that in various ways (more or less fantastic and at times even fictional) have expressed the feeling that the disorder of recent times is not accidental, since it corresponds to a plan, the phases and fundamental instruments of which are accurately described in the Protocols. Hugo Wast wrote: &quot;The Protocols may well be a fake, but their predictions have been fulfilled in an amazing way.&quot; Henry Ford added: &quot;The only comment that I can make about the Protocols is that they perfectly correspond to what is happening today. They were published sixteen years ago, and ever since then they have corresponded to the world situation and today they still dictate its rhythm.&quot; In a sense, we can speak of a prophetic premonition. In any event, the value of the document as a working hypothesis is undeniable: it presents the various aspects of global subversion (among them, some aspects that were destined to be outlined and accomplished only many years after the publication of the Protocols) in terms of a whole, in which they find their sufficient reason and logical combination.<br> <br>As I have said, this is not the place to engage in a detailed analysis of the text; it will suffice to recall the main points. First of all, the primary ideologies that are responsible for the modern disorder did not arise spontaneously, but have been evoked and supported by forces that knew they were false and had in mind only the latter&#039;s destructive and demoralizing effects. This would apply to democratic and liberal ideas; the Third Estate had purposely been mobilized to destroy the previous feudal and aristocratic society, while in a second phase the workers were mobilized to undermine the bourgeois.","time":1491674187,"resto":120150664,"id":"zgWDHEfF","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120160067,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:58:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120159801\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120159801<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120159874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120159874<\/a><br>Recommended reading:<br><br>http:\/\/www.juliusevola.net\/excerpts<wbr>\/The_Secret_Causes_of_History_and_T<wbr>he_Protocols_of_the_Learned_Elders_<wbr>of_Zion.html<br><br>Great piece by Julius Evola from &quot;Men among the Ruins&quot;","time":1491674284,"resto":120150664,"id":"zgWDHEfF","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120160145,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:58:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120159134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120159134<\/a><br>what&#039;s the point of that terrible shape","time":1491674319,"resto":120150664,"id":"L9bCoxdI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120160236,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:59:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120156203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120156203<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hehehe it&#039;s just a joke goyim hahaha I literally cringed reading it looks!<\/span><br><br>T.

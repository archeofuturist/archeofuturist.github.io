My father knew that his teacher was part of the voting commite so He Made sure to study to make 100% on his final exam which He did. Failed anyway And so his dream of being footbal couch died. His Mother lost her job As a teacher. He never blamed His father though. He is a great man. He would have all communists executed and so would I.","time":1493812004,"resto":123895820,"id":"K0AJIBok","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":123904255,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)07:47:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123896375\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123896375<\/a><br>To be fair that&#039;s the fault of the person doing the killing.","time":1493812074,"resto":123895820,"id":"jWyQQ0vF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123904304,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)07:48:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123897819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123897819<\/a><br>Thanks baby","time":1493812110,"resto":123895820,"id":"gAECthg6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123904383,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)07:49:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123896931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123896931<\/a><br>Marx genuinely had different definitions in mind than did most people later.","time":1493812170,"resto":123895820,"id":"jWyQQ0vF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123904574,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)07:52:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123898573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123898573<\/a><br>Some versions of socialism and communism skip or minimize the governmental phase bit.","time":1493812331,"resto":123895820,"id":"jWyQQ0vF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123904578,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)07:52:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"first of all it wouldn&#039;t be a crazy argument to say that capitalism has nevr happened. and most of the things that are bad about capitalism is actually breaking the rules of capitalism.<br>but humans don&#039;t abide by rules just because somebody wrote them in a book. communism still has humans involved.","time":1493812333,"resto":123895820,"id":"avA9c7lR","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":123904857,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)07:55:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123899002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123899002<\/a><br>Not really.

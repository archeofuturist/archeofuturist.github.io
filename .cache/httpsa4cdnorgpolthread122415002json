I have an idea for a series of film analysis videos that you might enjoy","com":"Over the past few months I&#039;ve had some epiphanic realizations regarding recent Hollywood blockbusters and the major studios pandering to specific narratives in order to tap into the highly engaged, idealistic demographic that comprises the current SJW movement. My initial interpretation of this trend is that it is base profit-mongering, but the fact that Hollywood largely consists of liberal individuals in writing\/directing\/acting roles also plays a significant role.<br><br>I have a handful of specific films in mind from the last several years, each presenting blatant narrative or casting issues that would seem to point to this trend. Since I&#039;m NEET right now, high IQ white male, I&#039;d like to spend my vast swathes of free time contributing what I can to the culture war at hand. I see Youtube as a very strong free market of ideas (for the time being, at least) and an ideal medium for reaching shitloads of people, as well as being an ideal medium for film critique specifically. <br><br>Anyway, the first film in the lineup should I choose to begin this project, and possibly the lowest-hanging fruit of the batch, would be Star Wars: The Force Awakens. fpbp below I will list some of the bullet-points that I&#039;ve jotted down for further research. Feel free to call bullshit where you see it or to provide me with tidbits that I missed.

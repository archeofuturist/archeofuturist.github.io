But recent events made any healthy discussion, debate, whatever - totally impossible. This board has been totally divided and overrun by shills whereever they are coming from.<br><br>It is pointless to &#039;fight&#039; the shills - it is literally what they want you to do. To create discord. If there is discord, there is no place for proper discussion. They do not want you to give healthy counterarguments to certain claims or give proper, evidence supported statements. They want you to scream &quot;SHILL!&quot;, &quot;BACK TO R\/T_D!&quot;, &quot;XLZAMPF IS FINISHED&quot;. If you do this, you are either a braindead or a shill, since the only thing it does - it ruins this place. <br><br>Whoever you are, whatever your beliefs are, it is in my opinion that for a while we should all leave and cease discussion, for that discussion is impossible in such conditions. So I am departing soon. I will not bump this thread, let it slide, I do not wish to turn it into another battleground.<br><br>This place is not finished and I am sure it will not be.","filename":"1491474448571","ext":".png","w":950,"h":633,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491627919163,"time":1491627919,"md5":"jayPHT\/lEM16p5POkUgevA==","fsize":861839,"resto":0,"id":"M+0il4pR","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"first-off-i-wish-to-say-that-i-am-not-blaming-any","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120090728,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:11:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Concern troll<br><br><br>Gtfo","time":1491628284,"resto":120090061,"id":"04u2HuQ8","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

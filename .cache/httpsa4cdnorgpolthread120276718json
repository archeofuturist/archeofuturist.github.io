She was a sister, friend, and a warrior in and out.<br><br>Her death came as a big shock to all of us. She was sick with Muslims for just a few years and she went to see her doctor. I actually drove her there and the next thing we knew was that her condition had deteriorated to a life threatening stage. It wasn&#039;t until she came down with a bad case of the Somalians that I really started to see my beloved sister Sweden fade and begin to die.<br><br>We say that the hour of death cannot be forecast, but when we say this we imagine that hour as placed in an obscure and distant future. It never occurs to us that it has any connection with the day already begun or that death could arrive this same afternoon, this afternoon which is so certain and which has every hour filled in advance.<br><br>I am confident that Sweden is now with our creator. She will be in our hearts forever. I thank you Sweden that I became part of your life&#039;s journey. We will always be proud of you.<br><br>Death shortens our life on earth but sweetens our way to heaven. Where death finds you, eternity binds you.<br><br>I never got to tell Sweden just how important she was to me, although I know in my heart she felt it.<br>Learn to appreciate the good times, because you never know when they will be your last good memories of some one.<br>Finally, we must live in such a way that people should miss us when we die like we all miss Sweden so much.<br><br>Thank you<br><br>Would anyone like to come stand forward and share their fondest memories that you had with Sweden?","filename":"Coffin-Europe","ext":".jpg","w":530,"h":298,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491740581184,"time":1491740581,"md5":"mA58fBEHZPrl8CzOMEoXgg==","fsize":35241,"resto":0,"id":"8ddwycZ2","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"official-sweden-funeral-thread","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":120277677,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)08:34:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120276718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120276718<\/a><br>Press F to pay respects.","time":1491741287,"resto":120276718,"id":"dww4MCLt","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120277936,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)08:38:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"She always had the prettiest daughters.

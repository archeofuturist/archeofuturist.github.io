And not only are they getting away with it, whites buy tickets making them stronger, and then there&#039;s award shows.<br><br>Think about it: For Jews, WWII films are the only way for them to viscerally express their inherent hatred and disdain for whites in an epic, almost ritualistic way. And I&#039;m not talking about Aryans, I&#039;m talking about white gentiles. Wake up. <br><br>You are 100% correct to notice the cardboard portrayal of Nazis on screen. They do this to juxtapose with the gruff, cig-pulling charismatic but naive GI Joes, who are basically avatars of Jewish Zionism from their POV. <br><br>Dead Nazis on screen = it becomes exploitation, the enemy as inhuman, the victory of Jews over white supremacy stomping like a Zionist boots on impressionable eyes, until we grow up hating not only Germany descended peoples, but thinking all whites are guilty, murderous. And thinking that we can never let *white identity* return to public discourse and the political theater. <br><br>Inglourious Basterds is the pinnacle of the soul less Nazi. Even Hans Landa is a cartoonish caricature, akin to Dr. Evil. Tarantino, raised by black men, grew up self-hating whites, and the Weinsteins have slowly pimped him to make anti-white slaughterfests, giving him bigger budgets for these canvases of Jewish vengeance and fantasy. <br><br>Slavery movies are very similar, with Southern whites portrayed as tobacco-spitting whip-cracking devils who merit torture. Again, these films are a conduit for Jewish bloodlust, for white guilt, for rewriting white accomplishment and pride out of our own history. <br><br>And we haven&#039;t even discussed Holocaust movies, an assembly line. These movies rarely make money, so who funds them? Tax payers. But also producers who don&#039;t care about grosses, they care about the Tikkun Olam endgame.

Very few people know that Harrison Ford is Jewish. His strong, American features allow him to portray gentile heroes, including the US president and Jack Ryan. But Indiana Jones is the ultimate shabbos goy, doing the dirty work, and allowing Spielberg too get his jabs in at Nazis, but also Arab peoples as sword wielding savages, for which he&#039;s been later rebuffed. <br><br>Keep in mind that often Jewish actors are playing white soldiers, and that Jewish people are fully aware of this and take pride in it. It&#039;d be like a black man covertly playing a white liberator and killing slave owners. This also explains the exploitative nature of these films. <br><br>The biggest anti-Nazi, anti-white films, however, are Star Wars, and especially the Disney Era continuation. Storm Troopers have always been soul less automatons, a wave of white-suited minions. But Disney is turning the franchise into a rebellion of women and POC against a white Empire. Rogue One is a Utopian fantasy of exotic races versus an Aryan plot. Again, Harrison Ford&#039;s Han Solo is was the ultimate gruff shabbos goy, and Carrie Fisher, feminist, was Jewish. <br><br>These movies, It was announced last week by Disney&#039;s Jewish CEO, are now being plotted into the 2030s.

And not only are they getting away with it, whites buy tickets making them stronger, and then there&#039;s award shows.<br><br>Think about it: For Jews, WWII films are the only way for them to viscerally express their inherent hatred and disdain for whites in an epic, almost ritualistic way. And I&#039;m not talking about Aryans, I&#039;m talking about white gentiles. Wake up. <br><br>You are 100% correct to notice the cardboard portrayal of Nazis on screen. They do this to juxtapose with the gruff, cig-pulling charismatic but naive GI Joes, who are basically avatars of Jewish Zionism from their POV. <br><br>Dead Nazis on screen = it becomes exploitation, the enemy as inhuman, the victory of Jews over white supremacy stomping like a Zionist boots on impressionable eyes, until we grow up hating not only Germany descended peoples, but thinking all whites are guilty, murderous. And thinking that we can never let *white identity* return to public discourse and the political theater. <br><br>Inglourious Basterds is the pinnacle of the soul less Nazi. Even Hans Landa is a cartoonish caricature, akin to Dr. Evil. Tarantino, raised by black men, grew up self-hating whites, and the Weinsteins have slowly pimped him to make anti-white slaughterfests, giving him bigger budgets for these canvases of Jewish vengeance and fantasy. <br><br>Slavery movies are very similar, with Southern whites portrayed as tobacco-spitting whip-cracking devils who merit torture. Again, these films are a conduit for Jewish bloodlust, for white guilt, for rewriting white accomplishment and pride out of our own history. <br><br>And we haven&#039;t even discussed Holocaust movies, an assembly line. These movies rarely make money, so who funds them? Tax payers. But also producers who don&#039;t care about grosses, they care about the Tikkun Olam endgame.

Georgia officials say there is nothing wrong with the name, but contend that the girl\u2019s surname must match one of the parents \u2014 or be a combination of the two \u2014 and that it could later be changed in court.<br><br>But the parents, in a lawsuit filed with the American Civil Liberties Union, said they should be free to name their children whatever they\u2019d like, pointing to a different portion of state law. In their view, a section of the state code on registration of births allows for a name to be chosen \u201cas designated by both parents.\u201d<br><br>Ms. Handy, who is pregnant again, and Mr. Walk chose the name Allah, which means \u201cGod\u201d in Arabic, because it is \u201cnoble,\u201d they told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. They gave that last name to their 3-year-old son, Masterful, and Mr. Walk also did so with another of his sons. Georgia approved those names, according to the A.C.L.U.<br><br>While there was no problem with the name Allah, Mr. Barrett wrote in a footnote that states must maintain a mechanism to reject bizarre or vile naming requests that would subject a child to ridicule, offering as (real) examples from around the world: Snappy Fishsuit; Acne Fountain; Sex Fruit; Loser; Fat Meat; Stud Duck; Ghoul Nipple; Number 16 Bus Shelter; Yeah Detroit; Tula Does The Hula In Hawaii; Captain Fantastic Faster Than Superman Spiderman Batman Wolverine The Hulk And The Flash Combined; and Brfxxccxxmnpcccclllmmnprxvclmnckssq<wbr>lbb11116.","filename":"allah","ext":".jpg","w":580,"h":750,"tn_w":193,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490819176257,"time":1490819176,"md5":"k1CpezFBhBr1KMC6uiaGww==","fsize":122399,"resto":0,"id":"QJ3QsmtQ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"parents-sue-georgia-over-right-to-give-daughter","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118830892,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)16:36:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118829624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118829624<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;those examples of bad names<\/span><br>Is this a ylyl thred?","time":1490819779,"resto":118829624,"id":"B\/nNvICI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

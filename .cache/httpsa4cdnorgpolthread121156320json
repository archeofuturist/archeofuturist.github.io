Over the past 5 days or so I&#039;ve been tracking navy aircraft activity off the California coast using the website <br>https:\/\/global.adsbexchange.com\/Vir<wbr>tualRadar\/desktop.html<br>I have seen P3s (even 3 at a time) there basically all day every day besides when they stop transmitting their location. There is a 3rd party refueler (omega aerial refueling services) that has been going to their location and refilling them every fucking day. I haven&#039;t screen capped them being refueled by it, because they arent showing location when they do (no idea why they show it sometimes, but not always) but it&#039;s really obvious it is refueling military aircraft. I also saw a Lockheed EP-3E Aries II there today. Not sure if I&#039;m just LARPing way too much and this is routine or if this is serious implications to paranoia of something being there.","filename":"5 hours","ext":".png","w":1916,"h":930,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":121,"tim":1492223960134,"time":1492223960,"md5":"hQ5Eg\/pHD00HQMApD1b9YQ==","fsize":265283,"resto":0,"id":"kigjJE7W","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nuclear-submarine-off-the-coast-of-california","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":121156914,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:43:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"To add, there is another 3rd party aircraft there right now, a learjet 36 run by a company known for aiding the government in reconnaissance and intel.

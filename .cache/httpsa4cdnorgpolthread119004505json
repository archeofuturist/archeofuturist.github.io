I&#039;ve worked lots of shitty jobs but try maintain some pride because at least I was doing honest work and not there stealing or selling drugs, doing crime ect. I&#039;ve had snobs look down on me and seen them do that to my dad. It fucking hurt. I&#039;d never look down on someone who gets out and busts their butt working to make an honest wage legally. <br><br>He needs to take that gun of his and put it to his over size head and pull the fucking trigger","time":1490934213,"resto":119004505,"id":"S8HZ9KJY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119022096,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)00:53:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119015532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119015532<\/a><br>One of my childhood friends had to drop out from HS and is now working at an electronic repairment shop. He has done that job for more than 10 years and you can bet that he&#039;s proud of his hard labour as well that I&#039;m proud of him since he is opening his own shop next month. It enrages me that people like Destiny looks down on hard working people, that they consider their jobs to be lowly trash, I would even say that it offends me even when my job is stupidly well paid. I mean shit man, does he think that being a fisherman, farmer or miner is a trash job too?<br><br>One of the things that I was taught when growing up is that every honest work is something to be proud of, I think that Destiny should seriously look at what he said instead of bitching like a miserable, pathetic person.","time":1490936035,"resto":119004505,"id":"Uuj9sRIM","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":119023145,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:06:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119004505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119004505<\/a><br>I think Sargon is an idiot but Destiny&#039;s &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;trolling&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; on Twitter makes him look like a complete moron.

Low product costs with low wages is basically the reason why people left Mexico in such big numbers causing our agricultural sector to plummet. Having low wages is ALWAYS a bad thing, you want people to earn more, that way they can afford more things even if they are more expensive, you want hard working people on the fields to earn more so your agriculture doesn&#039;t implode. I fucking hate people who thinks that unrestrained free trade works and are against the renegotiations of NAFTA, it feels like they just think that every work that isnt an office desk job is garbage.

She went out in Huston for her bday, I stayed home because I&#039;m not 21 yet and she met some guy in one of the clubs and never came back to me.<br><br>I tried calling her and she didn&#039;t answer and in the morning I got a call from her phone but it wasn&#039;t her, it some guy that said something stupid like &quot;ay got your girl makin them cheese eggs up right now you can have her when I go back to my city&quot; then he laughed and hung up.<br><br>I tried calling her after that and it kept going to voicemail like her phone was off. I nessaged her mom on Facebook and her mom said she said she&#039;s out of town and doesn&#039;t want to talk to me. I didn&#039;t hear her until 3 days later at like 2am my gf called me from a number I didn&#039;t recognize and she was clearly drunk and said &quot;you aren&#039;t acting right, I fly with the plane gang. I like to keep them sparklers coming, my baby just blew 59 racks&quot; and then she going on about &quot;plane gang gang and champagne bottles&quot;<br><br>I haven&#039;t heard from her since then and that was 2 days ago. What is her fucking problem? I don&#039;t even drink, seriously is this what alcohol does to women? Give me one reason besides &quot;muh feels&quot; that it shouldn&#039;t be outlawed. I don&#039;t even know if I&#039;m single or not anymore. She is just gone and I don&#039;t know when she is coming back. I can&#039;t study because I&#039;m worried","filename":"1474057022409","ext":".png","w":948,"h":667,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":175,"tim":1491338100753,"time":1491338100,"md5":"vygFT1Mz6YJPTOJsixNQpg==","fsize":225745,"resto":0,"id":"aoNtXULm","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"girlfriend-not-coming-back","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119512930,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:37:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119512622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119512622<\/a><br>Sounds like Wiz Khalifa is fucking your girl.<br><br>Saged, not politics.","time":1491338256,"resto":119512622,"id":"eG7laPr8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119513028,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:38:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119512622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119512622<\/a><br>fuck off to \/adv\/ newfag","time":1491338315,"resto":119512622,"id":"IMnIXpTb","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119513513,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:42:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119512622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119512622<\/a><br><a href=\"\/r\/catalog#s=eddit\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;\/r\/eddit<\/a> is that way, faggot","time":1491338530,"resto":119512622,"id":"FWW6KvFG","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"}]}

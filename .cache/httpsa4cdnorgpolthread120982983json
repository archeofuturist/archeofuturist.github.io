This pic is from their Facebook page, and you can see that TBMG has no more than a dozen people. That simply cannot justify anywhere near the amount of claims that &quot;Shareblue is here.&quot; Many of these claims are even made in the middle of the night in Texas. I find it unlikely that these 10 or so millennial females are working around the clock to post on 4chan. <br><br><br>The next assertion is that Shareblue is outsourcing this type of work to outside contractors who make $0.02 for each post they make. In order for someone to make $15 per hour, that would require a new post every 4.8 seconds ($.02 per post --&gt; $1 per 50 posts --&gt; $15 per 750 posts; 750 posts\/hr --&gt; 12.5posts\/min --&gt; 1 post\/4.8 seconds).That seems highly unlike to me, and in any case, I havent seen any source on the alleged &#039;2 cents per post&#039; meme.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-10 at 12.08.06 AM","ext":".png","w":1124,"h":573,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":127,"tim":1492126705859,"time":1492126705,"md5":"tuj3DT8GRR8dex2nkLgkRg==","fsize":882540,"resto":0,"id":"awq1XLz\/","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-entire-shareblue-is-here-collect-your-2-meme","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":0,"unique_ips":8},{"no":120983189,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)19:40:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120982983\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120982983<\/a><br>They&#039;ve outsourced to India, you retard.","time":1492126800,"resto":120982983,"id":"uJFlJ9xZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120983275,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)19:40:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120982983\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120982983<\/a><br>Everyone already knows this though.

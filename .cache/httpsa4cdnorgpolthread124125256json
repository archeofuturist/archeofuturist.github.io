Gender is a term which was attributed to chromosomal make-up back in 1906, a year after the discovery of the Y chromosome.<br><br> In genetics, we base gender on the 3-G system with the greatest determining factor being the existence or absence of the XY pair.<br><br>I f you have an XY pair then you have a male and if you do not have an XY pair, such as in XX, XXX, XO, etc., then you have a female.<br><br>All intersexed\/DSDs have a genetic gender as well. Thus there is no spectrum in gender.<br><br>The spectrum exists in the idea of gender roles, which does nothing to the standard 3-G model.<br><br>t.

You can make a repository of whatever shapes you want, but the words you carry in your head HAVE no objective meaning. Concepts like sympathy, logic, coercion, and government are things that have no physical representative. There is no way to accurately reflect whatever ideas those inspire in you when reading them. You&#039;ve assigned some meaning to them by seeing how others use them in lots of examples, and then extrapolate.

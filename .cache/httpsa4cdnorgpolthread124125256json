Gender is a term which was attributed to chromosomal make-up back in 1906, a year after the discovery of the Y chromosome.<br><br> In genetics, we base gender on the 3-G system with the greatest determining factor being the existence or absence of the XY pair.<br><br>I f you have an XY pair then you have a male and if you do not have an XY pair, such as in XX, XXX, XO, etc., then you have a female.<br><br>All intersexed\/DSDs have a genetic gender as well. Thus there is no spectrum in gender.<br><br>The spectrum exists in the idea of gender roles, which does nothing to the standard 3-G model.<br><br>t.

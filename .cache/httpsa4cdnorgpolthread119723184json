Anarchy is an ideology like an illusive religion. It&#039;s for aspiration. Anarchy will never exist in a physical world beyond natural chaos. You&#039;ll understand why anarchy is unfulfilling as a political quest once you witness human nature kicking in the doors of people you care about just like big government but with more force. You&#039;ll see how precious a set of standards in defining judge, jury, and executioners will be when you and innocents are targeted by mobs under false accusations or barbarity. You should fight big government. Fight for limited government. That&#039;s noble. In doing so, you might realize that having some modicum of &quot;democratic&quot; influence over common standards in the law process, as opposed to none, is probably preferable, and that&#039;s where cultural cohesion comes into play. You&#039;ll want more people around you with values of liberty who thus make the composition of an electorate. <br><br>&quot;Anarchy Light&quot; works on a small basis where it&#039;s easier to escape your surroundings and seek refuge from hordes. Today almost all land is conquered and claimed. The nature of the beast of mankind is that power and intelligence ultimately determine ownership. Defensive force prevents slaughter and genocide of your people and other people if it&#039;s in good hands, and thus a check to contain is government to manage resources and power, hopefully at a scale big or smart enough to protect your land from invasion.<br><br>Full anarchy would be pure survival in between the cracks of other people and societies potentially imprisoning, raping, enslaving, or murdering you. Voluntary communities you build yourself within may someday turn on you and you&#039;ll be disillusioned in anarchy&#039;s indifference, that you could&#039;ve spent your time changing the practice of &quot;justice&quot; tangibly in your city and nation to reflect ethics you want to cultivate for the sake of the future while you still have time.","filename":"boot face","ext":".jpg","w":494,"h":485,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":122,"tim":1491474224194,"time":1491474224,"md5":"p4TARladkYVIlbgdSrzrSQ==","fsize":35126,"resto":119723184,"id":"6TvlJf76","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119728596,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)06:24:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119728299\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119728299<\/a><br>Switzerland is not anarchical.

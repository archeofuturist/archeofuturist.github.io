Anarchy is an ideology like an illusive religion. It&#039;s for aspiration. Anarchy will never exist in a physical world beyond natural chaos. You&#039;ll understand why anarchy is unfulfilling as a political quest once you witness human nature kicking in the doors of people you care about just like big government but with more force. You&#039;ll see how precious a set of standards in defining judge, jury, and executioners will be when you and innocents are targeted by mobs under false accusations or barbarity. You should fight big government. Fight for limited government. That&#039;s noble. In doing so, you might realize that having some modicum of &quot;democratic&quot; influence over common standards in the law process, as opposed to none, is probably preferable, and that&#039;s where cultural cohesion comes into play. You&#039;ll want more people around you with values of liberty who thus make the composition of an electorate. <br><br>&quot;Anarchy Light&quot; works on a small basis where it&#039;s easier to escape your surroundings and seek refuge from hordes. Today almost all land is conquered and claimed. The nature of the beast of mankind is that power and intelligence ultimately determine ownership. Defensive force prevents slaughter and genocide of your people and other people if it&#039;s in good hands, and thus a check to contain is government to manage resources and power, hopefully at a scale big or smart enough to protect your land from invasion.<br><br>Full anarchy would be pure survival in between the cracks of other people and societies potentially imprisoning, raping, enslaving, or murdering you. Voluntary communities you build yourself within may someday turn on you and you&#039;ll be disillusioned in anarchy&#039;s indifference, that you could&#039;ve spent your time changing the practice of &quot;justice&quot; tangibly in your city and nation to reflect ethics you want to cultivate for the sake of the future while you still have time.","filename":"boot face","ext":".jpg","w":494,"h":485,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":122,"tim":1491474224194,"time":1491474224,"md5":"p4TARladkYVIlbgdSrzrSQ==","fsize":35126,"resto":119723184,"id":"6TvlJf76","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119728596,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)06:24:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119728299\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119728299<\/a><br>Switzerland is not anarchical.

The author argues (convincingly and with mountains of reliable evidence) that money was originally a debt counter. He then charts its history from its origins to the present day. <br><br> The prevailing theory, put forward by Adam Smith, is that money replaced barter as a system of exchange. In fact, barter was only seldom used, and only between people who had no reason to trust each other usually, most transactions were community based, and so there was high trust, this meant that people would often be in each others debt, so much so that much communities ran complex systems of debt, most of which essentially boiled down to just giving people things you had and knowing that later when you needed something somebody in the community would have what you needed and give it to you. <br><br> It was this system that money replaced AND when it superseded the community locus problems began to arise. <br><br> For example in a community with fluid debts, bad debts can be easily written off, most of the time it never comes to this, because the debts are small and easily paid back. When you have large monetary debts and the economy works based on their continued payment, the situation gets more complex, particularly when a harvest fails or in times of war, when the resources to pay back debts dry up<br><br> Another example, When debts were thing for thing, &quot;Ill take something now you take something later&quot; the notion of interest wasn&#039;t really ever involved because it didn&#039;t make sense. As soon as the debts became codified and quantified the notion of interest arose. <br><br> This is only the beginning of his argument, but its an extremely interesting reading and upends a lot of commonly held economic theory.","time":1491477687,"resto":119723184,"id":"HII0JJxc","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119732558,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)07:21:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"See germany after ww1.<br>Works for a bit but eventually normies get bored of tolerating it and push its shit in. <br>Its like communism in theory it works.. in theory..","time":1491477695,"resto":119723184,"id":"AvZGnSYH","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119732564,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)07:21:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119732377\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119732377<\/a><br>its true though. people will still have their own laws, and if you break them you will get punished. go ahead and murder the firstborn of everyone in the village, but soon the people will gather with pitchforks and torches, and you get punished for the murder.","time":1491477699,"resto":119723184,"id":"a8BS8S1U","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119732573,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)07:21:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119732179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119732179<\/a><br>How will you &quot;get rid&quot; of anything when 99.99999% of people will always not care about your system and won&#039;t blink an eye to steamroll over it.

I think that there is problem with this statement that arises from the word &quot;government&quot;. In anarchism, there is no government, so private companies can freely decide if they want to make business with you or not. If you DO have a government, that is never the case as the state dictates the terms of service that private business must adhere to. Private shop owners cannot simply refuse to service goths, or black people, because the government will force them to treat all people equally. The difference here is the freedom to have competition of morality, in sharp contrast to &quot;top-down morality&quot; enforced by a central agency (state).<br><br>There is a very interesting detail about sour statement &quot;If the government says donate or be ostrocised from society, id consider that theft too.&quot; ---&gt; If there is a central agency that FORCES busninesses to ostracise you, that is a violation of the NAP.

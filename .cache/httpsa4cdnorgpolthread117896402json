them money, power, respect, and some way to push back against the white power structure. for the italians, it wasn&#039;t all this since the mob went back to italy\/sicily where this wasn&#039;t an issue. mob in sicily used to be for protection from invaders\/shitty powerful italian governments and people who tried to rule sicily and who weren&#039;t responsive or fair to the people. the mob was

is google up on them. after a time, they just didn&#039;t have to resort to this sort of behavior because the jews value education and intelligence greatly unlike italians do by and large. there are no blue collar jews. there are plenty blue collar italians. jews managed to go mainstream cuz they amassed money thus power and they can sometimes pass as white. italians can as well but not always and with more difficulty given their last names which they didn&#039;t always anglicize liek some jews did. the white blockade on jews fell when powerful whites valued jew money as a form of bribery as more important than racial purity\/consciousness and started letting jews join the white power structure. no such thing happened for italians because we don&#039;t behave like the scheming, super tribal jews who amass money like no other thus power. <br><br>the jews took hollywood and churned out the mob movies for shekels but kept themselves out of the theaters as mob guys. they do the same for other reasons to make themselves look good. only ppl who make fun of jews or attack them are other jews like woody allen. meanwhile, no group is shat on more than italians in

The first one was already established in the US and comprised of people like Arnold Rothstein, who financed the start of the Judeo-Italian mob, with guys like Seigel, Lanksy, Anastasia. The first mob was already here and already deeply entrenched in corruption activities. (Rothstein fixed the World Series when the Comission wasn&#039;t even set up, Masseria was still around) The second type of Jewish mob was the Lanksy&#039;s etc, and they were poor Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe. Now contrarily to the Rothstein types or the Italians, those Jews pushed their kids to be typical kikes (lawyers, doctors, bankers) which is why starting in the 50s, it became a largely Italian organization (killing of the old guard, Murder Inc gone made it less Jewish)<br>But to answer your question, the kikes are more fucked up. Murder Inc was mostly, if not entirely, made up of Jews. The only Italians that come close are the Genna brothers and the lead brother was nicknamed the Devil. Italians don&#039;t take that lightly.<br>If you want to learn more about this I recommend reading Carl Sifakis and Jay Robert Nash. They&#039;ve both compiled encyclopedias of criminals in the US, specifically focused on the mob.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And how &quot;deep&quot; did\/does the Jewish Mob go here and globally? <\/span><br>They always had connections with international financiers. Look into the life of Lansky for that. Although he had almost no power in the end of his life, he set things up.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Did Italians consider Jewish Mob as working for a darker religious purpose?<\/span><br>No, Italians and Jews worked together because their interests aligned. A lot of the mafia symbolism was adopted when the Commission was formed. You can even say that it&#039;s even a hint to the first meeting of bosses of bosses which and decked like a religious service in church in case strangers showed up.","time":1490255081,"resto":117896402,"id":"1W4KmAaV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117904844,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)03:45:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117904626\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117904626<\/a><br>and rice is? just keep your mouth shut you gook trap","filename":"1475632062759","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":607,"tn_w":111,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490255140474,"time":1490255140,"md5":"ehpxnt9P6N0mPaWxNE0OfA==","fsize":68502,"resto":117896402,"id":"z0ifx+9l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117904980,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)03:47:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117898298\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117898298<\/a><br>Yeah<br>Halfway into season 4 and &quot;Gabagoul&quot; still cracks me up.<br>Good show.","time":1490255266,"resto":117896402,"id":"cdvNp4oo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117905108,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)03:49:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117904081\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117904081<\/a><br>Wait, I watched Boardwalk Empire, that had a couple Irish gangsters in it.

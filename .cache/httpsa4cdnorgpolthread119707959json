The shift was orchestrated by Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster, Mr. Trump\u2019s national security adviser, who insisted on purging a political adviser from the Situation Room where decisions about war and peace are made.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mr. Bannon resisted the move, even threatening at one point to quit if it went forward, according to a White House official who, like others, insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

All of these inaccuracies are optimistic \u2013 correcting the inaccuracy would make the consequences of sea level rise look worse. I\u2019ve made a conscious effort to avoid ad hoc corrections for these effects. If these maps have a purpose, it is to encourage the general public to consider the consequences of global warming. If I were to make corrections that make more bits of the map shaded blue, then I would run the risk of having the whole thing discredited as alarmist.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Firstly, the model knows nothing about the tides. Since tidal variation can be 10m or more in some parts of the world, this is a major deficiency.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Secondly, the NASA data itself is not very accurate. Jonathon Stott has said that \u201cNASA claims their height data is accurate to +\/- 16m with 90% certainty\u201d. NASA gathered the data by radar from orbit, so buildings and trees cause a systematic overestimation of the elevation of built-up and forested areas.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thirdly, the NASA data does not extend beyond +\/-60 degrees latitude. Its accuracy becomes degraded at the extremes of its range, especially in the Southern hemisphere, I am told.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fourthly, the simulation takes no account of the effects of coastal erosion. I believe that anywhere within a metre or so of daily maximum sea level would be swiftly eroded. So areas which my model shows as future \u2018coastline\u2019 would almost certainly be quickly eroded away.<\/span><br>Combine this with the fact that the map was made 11 years ago, with the data available in 2006, and I have to wonder why you&#039;re showing me this?","time":1490825321,"resto":118826747,"id":"Yu4WnbB3","country":"AU","trip":"!W1MmioNU0A","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118841457,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)18:08:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118841065\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118841065<\/a><br><br>And how much of those billions went into your pocket?","time":1490825323,"resto":118826747,"id":"7j72N1iJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118841490,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)18:09:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118841310\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118841310<\/a><br>Dont you know, he defers to the experts on these things.<br><br>Just not the nobel prize winners that disagree with him.

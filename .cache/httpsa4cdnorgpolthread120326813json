Thus, they realized that they needed to energize their base in the US - foolish &quot;Christian&quot; Zionist evangelical types in rural areas, or they would lose their hold on power in the US - the trends that would lead Keith Ellison (an anti-jewish black Muslim) to head the DNC, and the rank and file DNC to reject jewish puppet Clinton and embrace socialist Bernie were already in place. <br><br>They just needed a steppenfetchit goy to rabble rouse the masses into supporting another Zoinist war. <br><br>Photo included. <br><br>Now it all makes sense - say what the base wants to hear, promote some minor form of US nationalism, safe for (((minorities))) just enough to keep the military functional to bash the enemies of the (((Master Country))).

The advantage of this steppenfetch it is his brand name, political inexperience, demagogic skill, and de facto compromised status - very soon after he won, Netanyahu stayed in the home of the Kushners. Whatever the intention of Trump, and how he planned to make Israel and the US strong again, or whatever, he is turning out to be just another useless Zionist puppet. <br><br>The good news is that he will fail tremendously - likely worse than Bush II who squandered the sole superpower status of the US AND led the world to a G-20 world from a G7 world while making Iran a regional power and Iraq independent as well. <br><br>Trump sees that and will do much better for everyone other than the right wing in the US and Israel. I do have faith in him there. Cheaters and warmongers are losers and this is what he has shown himself to be.","time":1491767971,"resto":120326813,"id":"roIymJu1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

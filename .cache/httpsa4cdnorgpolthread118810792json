Lower class voters, the people who were never going to vote for trump anyway, recive subsidies to buy insurance under the ACA. If you&#039;re above a certain income, you don&#039;t get any government assistance or tax cuts. One thing the media didn&#039;t talk about and still doesn&#039;t talk about is that for the working class person, insurance premiums have gone up anywhere from 20%to 80%. What&#039;s more, many people LOST coverage they could afford when Obamacare made some cheaper plans illegal. Many people were enrolled in a catastrophic heath insurance plan that covered major health care costs and paid out of pocket for basic healthcare. Many clinics were going to this model to get around dealing with oppressive government regulation and insurance companies that were reluctant to pay. Obamacare basically made that illegal. For those people, health coverage went up 200% to 400%. The real kicker is, a new premium hike was announced just one week before the election. Obamacare is one of the many factors that cost Clinton the election.","time":1490813856,"resto":118810792,"id":"OCF60Ck4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118818939,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:57:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118818645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118818645<\/a><br>So left wing losers continuing to double down on retarded ideals of shit like social justice and pseudoscientific ideas about gender when they know the majority of people don&#039;t like those policies isn&#039;t autistic?","time":1490813858,"resto":118810792,"id":"1pdbjYhj","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118818943,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:57:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118811208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118811208<\/a><br>The title of that picture makes me want to vomit","time":1490813861,"resto":118810792,"id":"nWNY68UJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118818953,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:57:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118818516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118818516<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying he doesn&#039;t have a long term strategy.<\/span><br>mate, you seen this before. didn&#039;t you see him winning the fuck out of the election? you should have sensed by now that what you perceive as a incompetent dumbass might not be that, in reality.","time":1490813865,"resto":118810792,"id":"leY1R2zv","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":118819066,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:58:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118810792\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118810792<\/a><br><br>http:\/\/www.track-trump.com\/","time":1490813917,"resto":118810792,"id":"91td1NXP","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118819079,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:58:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118818867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118818867<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;right wingers<\/span><br>This is abusing the traditional definition of &quot;right.&quot; Trump was elected by the masses of reactionary marginals.","time":1490813923,"resto":118810792,"id":"\/ZeLxMG1","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":118819133,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:59:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"FOR ANYONE KNOWING YES THE OP IS A LEAF AND YES HE IS SHILLING.<br><br>YES THIS THREAD IS BAIT.","time":1490813954,"resto":118810792,"id":"nWNY68UJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118819136,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:59:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to the polling company<\/span><br><br>Stopped reading right there.","time":1490813956,"resto":118810792,"id":"x8nrecMs","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"}]}

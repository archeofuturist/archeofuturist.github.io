The most he will do is increase border security. This 100 foot wall nonsense will never happen, and mexico won&#039;t pay for it. Even if he did build this idiotic wall it would do effectively nothing to curb illegal immigration as most come here by plane using overstayed visas you retards.<br><br>2. They have shelved healthcare for now. It&#039;s likely they will come back to it, but it will be a disaster for America no matter what as the Republicans work for health insurance companies. The original proposed plan would have doubled the uninsured rate, increased premiums, give 600 billion dollars in tax breaks to the richest 2 percent of Americans, and allow insurance companies to price gouge those who don&#039;t have insurance for over three months. The proposed plan was obviously designed to be a tax break for the rich, not to make healthcare better.<br><br>3. Remember the republicans work for internet service providers and no democrats voted for this at all. There is no denying Obama was horrible on issues of internet privacy, but even he knew these rules were a good idea. Trump has made it his vendetta to remove as many government regulations as possible so it&#039;s likely he will sign this into law. Time will tell...<br><br>4. I don&#039;t ever see Trump resigning; his ego is too large, but with some of the investigations happening he very well could be impeached. His former security adviser said he would testify if granted immunity today, and he stated himself the only time you ask for immunity is if a crime has been committed.<br><br>5. I am no shill and I make well above the minimum wage. I&#039;m just interested in the truth and the abhorrent lack of it in this forum.<br><br>6. That is where the evidence points. Even if it&#039;s false I don&#039;t see the harm in moving to a fully green energy system. It has the potential to create an economic boom and is much better for the environment.<br><br>7.

No it&#039;s not happening and it will not happen. Trump never gave Meixco this ultimatum, and this tariff bullshit would never get past his own party who are vehemently against protectionism because they work for companies who rely on foreign goods.<br><br>2. Trump is acting like the quintessential republican. He was making concessions to the conservative shills in the freedum caucus before he pulled the bill for fuck sake. They were fighting to bring back prexisting conditions and the rule that allows coverage until age 26. The best we can hope for is for Trump to actually work with democrats to improve the bill, but it&#039;s more likely Trump will pass a draconian plan that lets insurance companies run amok.<br><br>3. Obama was the one that proposed these rules! And no they were not allowed to do this previously. These rules used to be enforced by the another agency but were repealed with the help of republicans. The FCC was meant to take over, but now the republican congress has repealed it and I can almost guarantee Trump will sign it into law. I know that because many of his campaign donors have direct ties to large ISP&#039;s and Trump so far has done everything he can to appease them.<br><br>4. No, you&#039;re just delusional. And why do you have to bring race into this?<br><br>5. That&#039;s why we invest and improve the technology which has been happening at an exponential rate even with the existence of your nonsense drivel. I will gladly give my tax dollars to invest in this rather than the bloated 600 billion dollar a year military budget the Trump wants to increase.<br><br>6. I have no intention of doing that. As I said I do well enough on my own to survive this bullshit. It&#039;s dumbass hicks like you who vote against your best interests that I worry about. I&#039;m not saying Shillary was a good choice for America, but compared to this orange bumbling fool she would have been significantly better.","filename":"donald-trump-john-mccain-comments-cartoon-darkow","ext":".jpg","w":495,"h":385,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":97,"tim":1490941738587,"time":1490941738,"md5":"yQF29+8SJAQU3cCy72cJtw==","fsize":142295,"resto":119024488,"id":"BjbpSQd8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

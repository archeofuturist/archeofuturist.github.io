I think Rogan probably wouldn&#039;t want that though, because NNT is too smart for him, so Rogan wouldn&#039;t really be able to argue the points he might not agree with.<br><br>I generally like Rogan but he is often too sure of certain positions, even though he claims not to be at all. This is typical for many people that dabble in psychedelics. They claim their ego is dissolved, but in reality their ego is building an identity of not having an ego, but that in turn is only an illusion and causes these people to feel superior to others. A pretty ironic phenomenon I have observed throughout the years of having been around the psychedelic community myself.","time":1493335702,"resto":123105215,"id":"bLW0dQaF","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123109368,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)19:29:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123105215\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123105215<\/a><br>KEK jammie stop and reuploaded it because of the like dislike ratio <br><br>also<br><br>Joe and his guest just said<br>&quot;Boarders are so fucking stupid and mexicans should hate us&quot;.<br><br>Fucking what","time":1493335781,"resto":123105215,"id":"Z8leoRLA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123109699,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)19:32:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;this guy claiming Trump is a moron and don&#039;t know about the drug war problem<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this moron guy not aware that Trump wrote in the 80a alreaddy (or early 90s don&#039;t remember) that drugs should be legalized to take money our of cartels hands<\/span>","time":1493335935,"resto":123105215,"id":"bLW0dQaF","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123111523,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)19:45:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123105215\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123105215<\/a><br>I exited out in ~2min when he brought up sam&#039;s talk with charles murray and began explaining how race is a social construct <br><br>and earlier he called professors who don&#039;t challenge SJW stuff cowards<br><br>the irony was palpable","time":1493336758,"resto":123105215,"id":"W\/\/yqzLT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123111802,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)19:48:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123105215\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123105215<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thaddeus<\/span><br><br>pretty sure a otaku pedophile nigger has that same name as well.","time":1493336905,"resto":123105215,"id":"dEILkgTX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123112012,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)19:50:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123111802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123111802<\/a><br>Mad thad is a fucking legend.<br><br>But like all nigs he belonged in jail","time":1493337002,"resto":123105215,"id":"hGwJUxy1","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123112590,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)19:54:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123105955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123105955<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Joe has no butterfly effect<\/span><br>headshot.png","time":1493337285,"resto":123105215,"id":"R0XSLKav","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

While I am pleased to see increased funding for our men and women in uniform and their critical missions across the globe, this bill fails in a number of ways, including by continuing to fund sanctuary cities, Planned Parenthood, and Obamacare.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Last November, the American people voted to give Republicans control of both houses of Congress and the White House. We should be funding our priorities, not perpetuating Democrats\u2019 big government programs.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;While I cannot support this bill, I look forward to the opportunity moving forward to enact our shared conservative policies \u2014 repealing and replacing Obamacare, securing our Southern border, and reducing taxes and regulations to help create more good-paying jobs in Texas and across the nation. Those are the priorities voters demanded in November&#039;s elections, and that we must deliver on.<\/span>","filename":"Ted-Cruz-3","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493914470883,"time":1493914470,"md5":"eMvBN1w2gXSTPXYuf4CHwA==","fsize":42649,"resto":0,"id":"ALuuUaHJ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ted-cruz-blasts-spending-bill","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":124075850,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:19:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124075337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124075337<\/a><br>WTF I&#039;m a #CruzMissle now","filename":"1493830365139","ext":".jpg","w":1440,"h":852,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":73,"tim":1493914768072,"time":1493914768,"md5":"BXGhoYvwLPMqABcXfEbGdA==","fsize":165042,"resto":124075337,"id":"KbAG+oVV","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

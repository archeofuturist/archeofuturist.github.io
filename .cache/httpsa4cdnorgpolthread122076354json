It seemed as though their increased understanding of the destructive effects of Social Democratic theories and their results only reinforced their determination.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The more I argued with them, the better I came to know their dialectic. First they counted on the stupidity of their adversary, and then, when there was no other way out, they themselves simply played stupid. If all this didn&#039;t help, they pretended not to understand, or, if challenged, they changed the subject in a hurry, quoted platitudes which, if you accepted them, they immediately related to entirely different matters, and then, if again attacked, gave ground and pretended not to know exactly what you were talking about. Whenever you tried to attack one of these apostles, your hand closed on a jelly-like slime which divided up and poured through your fingers, but in the next moment collected again. But if you really struck one of these fellows so telling a blow that, observed by the audience, he couldn&#039;t help but agree, and if you believed that this had taken you at least one step forward, your amazement was great the next day. The Jew had not the slightest recollection of the day before, he rattled off his same old nonsense as though nothing at all had happened, and, if indignantly challenged, affected amazement; he couldn&#039;t remember a thing, except that he had proved the correctness of his assertions the previous day.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Sometimes I stood there thunderstruck.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I didn&#039;t know what to be more amazed at: the agility of their tongues or their virtuosity at lying.<\/span>","filename":"LIAR_LIAR","ext":".webm","w":426,"h":426,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492743079078,"time":1492743079,"md5":"OH3i38iVYsqV3y9zWgZmiQ==","fsize":1017792,"resto":122076354,"id":"f6GHKnBT","country":"VN","country_name":"Vietnam"},{"no":122085555,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)22:54:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"China was btfo by japan in WW2.<br><br>Japan.

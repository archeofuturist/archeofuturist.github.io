Or that while politicians love to spout off how much they support Israel, no one is actually reminding us that this indeed helps Israel who has been concerned about this base for a long time. That Israel was concerned about this base for a long time is never mentioned, and no one points out that it helps Israel, which the neocons should be explicitly celebrating. The only reason not to mention it is if you were trying to prevent that association from being discovered or made by the American public.<br><br>Is it not also conspicuous that this is celebrated by all the pro-Israel media and politicians of both sides. Or that it creates a loop-hole in the Trump+Putin=bff narrative the left has been pushing to terrify trump with endless bad press if he normalizes relations with Russia. This is before you factor in Netenyahu&#039;s recent visit or that directly contradicts Trumps campaign position.<br><br>So \/pol\/ generally accepts this was a typical False Flag from Israel. \/Pol\/ also views Trump is a smart man, worldly wise and clever.<br><br>So you are either saying Trump is so dense that he doesn&#039;t know it was a false flag, or you are saying he does, in which case he was complicit with the mass murder of children, if you are convinced it happened at all. <br><br>If so, Donald Trump was complicit in the murder of children for Israel. There&#039;s no other way to see it. He&#039;s either a rube or he complicit in killing children for Israel.","filename":"1439415239711","ext":".jpg","w":366,"h":327,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":223,"tim":1491785884573,"time":1491785884,"md5":"MpMCo+v8wRz3XjZ5hRvfeA==","fsize":28367,"resto":0,"id":"LqZMLitH","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"donald-trump-gasses-murders-children","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

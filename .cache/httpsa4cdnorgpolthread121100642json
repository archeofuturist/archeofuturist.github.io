Inclinations always measure between 0 and 180 degrees.

I believe earth-orbit satellites are launched in either polar or basically west-to-east orbits. Why do we not launch in a westerly direction? <br><br>2. What is meant by &quot;sun-synchronous&quot; orbits? <br>Reply<br> Concerning your first question, the velocity needed for a stable orbit around the center of the Earth above the atmosphere is about 8000 meter\/second. An object on the surface of the Earth already has an eastward velocity, because of the Earth&#039;s rotation, but it is much too small: 409 meter\/sec on the equator, and 409 times cosL at latitude L. That is much too small to fling you or me into orbit (for which we ought to be grateful), but it&#039;s still something, and satellite launchers, eager to make use of the smallest advantage, fire their rockets eastward. At Cape Canaveral you get a bonus of about 360 m\/s. <br><br> Israel has launched two satellites so far (maybe more). Lacking the choice, it must launch westward over the Mediterranean, and those 360 (or so) meters\/sec hinder rather than help its rockets, reducing the available payload. Yes, it can be done, but when a choice exists, eastward is preferable. <br><br> To answer your second question, let me paste from the glossary of &quot;Exploration of the Earth&#039;s Magnetosphere&quot;:<br> Sun-synchronous orbit--a near-Earth orbit resembling that of a polar satellite, but inclined to it by a small angle. With the proper inclination angle, the equatorial bulge causes the orbit to rotate during the year once around the polar axis. Such a satellite then maintains a fixed position relative to the Sun and can, for instance, avoid entering the Earth&#039;s shadow.<br><br>https:\/\/www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov\/star<wbr>gaze\/StarFAQ3.htm#q62","time":1492199080,"resto":121100642,"id":"llq\/AULj","country":"US","country_name":"United

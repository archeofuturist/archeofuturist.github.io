I know we are some patriotic sons of bitches, but its real clear that this whole democracy thing is either A. One big fucking sham or B. Extremely inefficient. I mean it seems like nothing we do really makes an impact. Trumps making some changes but its still more of the same old shit it seems. I don&#039;t think it will ever change at this point. If the Jews can have their own homeland why can&#039;t we have ours? Theres enough of us you know. With our collective buying power and man power we could buy up land and become ATLEAST a micro nation or SOMETHING. Im tired of living in degeneracy and being force fed this fucking leftist bullshit 24\/7. Our numbers stretch across the world. We could carve out a place for us damn it and make our own rules for once and try it OUR way.

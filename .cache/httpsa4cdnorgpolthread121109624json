With rigorous training, or even just curiosity about something, they could become good thinkers, experts in at least one field and notice much more of the world, living a richer life.<br>Instead, this is actively prevented by the upper class - by filling people&#039;s heads with garbage - much like they fill people with too much and bad food, making them obese and ill. It works, because they exploit evolutionary desires - people like to observe other people (TV, series, movies) and they like energy-rich food (cakes, fastfood, sugar bombs).<br>The food destroys their bodies, making them weak and ill;<br>likewise,<br>the entertainment destroys their brains. Literally! It can be seen in brain<br>imaging technologies - the brain&#039;s complexity of people who are addicted to <br>entertainment for hours per day, for years and decades, observably deteriorates!<br>Their brains literally shrinks.<br>The great mass of people, not only becomes weaker and sicker physically,<br>but also cognitively.<br>This is not what the future should hold for us: We have plenty of food, plenty of free time, plenty of money, plenty of access to every book and information out there ever written - at our fingertips, if we want, even by smartphone on the loo.","filename":"1479793682697","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":443,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":221,"tim":1492202208683,"time":1492202208,"md5":"7DL1k5OJtciN536RyiM\/oQ==","fsize":83539,"resto":0,"id":"srleiVRy","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"came-to-have-a-nice-chat-with-an-71year-old","country_name":"Germany","replies":13,"images":1,"unique_ips":9},{"no":121109666,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)16:37:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Humans should become now stronger, smarter and more successful than ever, all restrictions of the past, all limits of resources being resolved?<br>Free food, free time, free knowledge for everyone?<br>The truth is:<br>People are fatter, sicker, lazier - and more incompetent than ever.<br>Maybe IQs rose a bit, or not, maybe because of the better nutrition for everybody.<br>But actual competence - reasoning ability, reading and math and logic ability - are not a bit worse - they have fallen through the ground!<br>20 year-old cannot anymore remember a 10-digit number.

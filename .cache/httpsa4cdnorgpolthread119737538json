in the fighting and search for peace in Syria. The words \u201cloosely aligned groups\u201d cover up the harsh reality of the entire province of Idlib being under an-Nusra control. Like the downing of Malaysian airliner over East Ukraine in July 2014 was meant to bring Berlin on board as regards the Western policy of sanctions against Russia, this time the new US Administration is the target. Why does nobody ask who benefits from such timely incidents?<br>The so-called \u201cWhite Helmets\u201d discredited themselves in Eastern Aleppo with staging \u201cconsequences\u201d of similar incidents. The West will feel ashamed for taking the side of terrorists, who possess and use chemical weapons, and trying, in this way, to draw attention from the horrors of the Mosul operation and Yemen. A truly transparent and international investigation is urgently needed, which is the purpose of a Russian draft UN Security Council resolution.

Well, in Russia everything is possible. There were leaked info that Russia consentrating their military forces on NK borders, probably just to protect themselfes from the NK refugees. As for realistic scenario, I don&#039;t really see how Russia would be involved in any way of military clash against US and the rest of the world, since US is in NATO, considering China is working together with US on NK problem. This move would be retarded as fuck, so not happening. But I have to say Russia is not very happy about this crisis, the official position in kremlin is this &quot;we are deeply concerned about this happening&quot;. They can&#039;t do shit and they know that. Not to mention it will be hard to explain to people in Russia why they should care about NK so much to be involved in another war. As for the Syria, Syria has their own problems to solve.","time":1492410517,"resto":121489790,"id":"thDwthoQ","country":"UA","country_name":"Ukraine"},{"no":121491182,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)02:31:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121489790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121489790<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;syria<\/span><br>yes, the country thats been at war for 7 year and has 350 planes will be a huge help<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;russia<\/span><br>Not willing to get nuked for the norks","time":1492410702,"resto":121489790,"id":"xgfckONG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121495482,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)03:14:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121490911\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121490911<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;China is working together with US on NK problem<\/span><br>Tis a bit more complicated than that.

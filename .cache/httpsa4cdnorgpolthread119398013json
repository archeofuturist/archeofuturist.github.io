No, sweetie. Drumpf is finished. Let me tell you some secrets:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;two Russian fronts have been under investigation by the FBI since mid-2016; Alfa Bank and SVB Bank<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump has significant ties to the Bank of Cyprus through managing director (and new Commerce Secretary) Wilbur Ross and chairman Joseph Ackerman, former head of Deutsche Bank who has loaned Trump&#039;s corporations over $3 billion since the 90s. Bank of Cyprus is a front for Putin and Russian Oligarchs via 10% ownership, Dimitry Rybolovlev and that its known to be where Russian Billionaires stash their money.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rybolovlev purchased Maison de L&#039;Amitie from Trump for $95 million, after Trump paid $41 million for it four years earlier. To some this might seem like a savvy real estate deal \u2014 however, in the context of the vast money laundering schemes involving Deutsche Bank, Russian Billionaires, and New York Real Estate, followed by Trump&#039;s immediate repayment of a close-to-default $50 million dollar loan to Deutsche Bank, it looks like a money laundering scheme to get money out of Russia, and in to Trump&#039;s hands. At this point, Trump became inextricably compromised by Russia. This is why he won&#039;t release his tax returns - it will reveal the extent of his current liabilities and who owns them (hint: it&#039;s Russians)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rybolovlev also owns MKATE \u2014 a plane which made about 25-30 stops in bizarre airports around the US throughout the Presidential Campaign; suspicious since these are places a Russian billionaire has no business going and almost always overlapping with the presence of Trump&#039;s 757. The secret: it was for Michael Cohen to move in and out of the country without record of transit. There&#039;s also a second set of planes that took Cohen&#039;s family around the world that also overlap with MKATE and would allow for surreptitious travel.<\/span><br><br>cont.","filename":"1485827836453","ext":".png","w":554,"h":618,"tn_w":224,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491262260243,"time":1491262260,"md5":"\/Dm\/hGPs+\/WOWKMrkksPrw==","fsize":119513,"resto":0,"id":"fbJ9bkPs","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"insider-information-on-trump-investigation","country_name":"Australia","replies":34,"images":11,"unique_ips":22},{"no":119398121,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)19:31:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119398013\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119398013<\/a><br>That&#039;s really interesting OP, tell me more?","filename":"FileName","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":560,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1491262314123,"time":1491262314,"md5":"tb1R7ftFcTgnd8uEeQZC7w==","fsize":281508,"resto":119398013,"id":"skKX9bEt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119398151,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)19:32:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;British<\/span><br><br>Go away, Muhammad. <br><br>SAGE","time":1491262336,"resto":119398013,"id":"OWAGpncl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119398214,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)19:32:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119398013\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119398013<\/a>","filename":"1488863677417","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1491262371418,"time":1491262371,"md5":"Xmbf6ZrSS6uu3Pd2hjNy3g==","fsize":132708,"resto":119398013,"id":"S5UH1iaD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119398355,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)19:34:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Numerous Trump associates; Flynn, Sessions, Manafort, Kushner, Cohen, Nunes, have had meetings with Russians, or directly taken payment for services without disclosing themselves as paid foreign agents. It is unclear Manafort ever really stopped working with the campaign. Policy and platform issues have changed within days if not hours of some of these meetings, and the timing lines up with foreign releases of information damaging to Hillary. Like the DNC emails.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cambridge Analytica, while apparently funded by the Mercers in the US, has Bannon as a Board Member, was\/is in fact owned by Alfa Bank through Vincent Tchenguiz&#039;s ownership of parent SCL and influence over current executive leadership in London. Alfa Bank is one of the two targets of the FBI&#039;s FISA Warrant from October 28th, 2016 and a front for Putin associate and protege Dimitry Firtash, who is... a long time associate of Paul Manafort. Cambridge Analytica&#039;s targeting in the campaign appears based on non-public data. They boasted of having 4000-5000 plus datapoint on over 230 million American adults, and developed psychometric OCEAN profiles for each. This database appears to include information stolen by Russian spies from Facebook via Mechanical Turk scraping, and direct hacking by FancyBear and CozyBear, then shared with GSR (Global Science Research), which had a contract with SCL. When this wasn&#039;t having enough of an impact, there was information stolen by hacking several US state voter databases\u2014 including Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania. Cambridge Analytica was conducting hundreds of thousands of AB tested campaigns specifically targeting people in these three States over the last week or two of the campaign, likely spreading intentionally false news stories in the run up to the election. <\/span><br><br>cont.","time":1491262447,"resto":119398013,"id":"fbJ9bkPs","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119398531,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)19:35:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"sage is the only answer<br>leftist whore shill rot in hell","time":1491262540,"resto":119398013,"id":"eOE1kbZr","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":119398834,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)19:38:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"cont.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This data and the targeting ability it created is likely the most direct instance of collusion between the campaign and Russian government, with Manafort acting as middle, and the Alfa Bank server in Trump Tower feeding illegally obtained voter data to CA. If you are an undecided or unmotivated voter in these areas, being exposed to certain ads and social media posts in the run up to the election will cause you to vote and to vote for Trump, or not to vote at all depending on your personality traits. When you win by 100k votes across three states, this type of targeting is the difference. It could have had an impact 10x that size. The only symptom is turnout anomalies (which we saw), and polling mistakes (which we saw). The evidence will be in the financials of who the campaign was running ads against. Trump was directed to (and did) campaign in these areas to cover the digital attack. Stealing this data would be merely criminal if executed on its own but executed in concert with a foreign power it becomes a national security issue. Ironically, the Alfa Bank Trump Tower server also appeared to be communicating with a Spectrum Health server in Michigan \u2014 Spectrum Health by the way, is owned by Betsy Devos, and the traffic pattern indicates hourly synchronization of a database. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The timing of the US FISA Warrants against targets in Trump tower links up with the arrest of hacker Andre Nikulin (in Prague no less, where the infamous dossier alleged Russian hackers were being paid off by Michael Cohen) who fainted and had a laptop present. This laptop contained the information which allowed the FBI to obtain the FISA Warrant against the computers in Trump Tower. Nikulin has still not been extradited \u2014 Russia is challenging the US extradition in Czech Courts. Manafort also owns a couple apartments in Trump Tower. And his daughter&#039;s Instagram was hacked showing messages like &quot;All dad does is go up and down in the elevator with Trump plotting.

There is no evidence the 15-year-old Carolina victim of Weiner&#039;s sexting actually exists, and a lot of evidence to suggest he was being Catfished by a Russian Hacker. The chat logs suggest he was talking to a dude, and quotations from a myriad of fiction, like Bukowski, Invisible Man, etc... books that it would be unlikely a 15 year old girl could integrate into texts but which is a frequent tag of hackers and Catfishers.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;While we know Guccifer2.0 hacked the DNC (and Podesta) and then sent the data to Wikileaks, what hasn&#039;t been widely discussed is the level of Wikileaks own exposure. Wikileaks is entirely a Russian agent at this point. It changed two of its DNS servers immediately prior to the release of DNC \/ Podesta emails, and shared its SSL keys. Specifically with a Russian hacker who is part of Fancy Bears, Peter Chayanov, who we know to be a Putin Agent. Hackers do not operate in Russia without Putin&#039;s approval, Chayanov is part of the Academy of National Economy under the Russian Federation and his name appears on the IP address ownership records.

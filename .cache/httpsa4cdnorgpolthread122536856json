The youngest gets the worst of it because he&#039;s singled out as being a sensitive child. Shit like destroying things he made in and for school, or cards he received from family members as &quot;pranks&quot; even though it reduces him to tears. Eventually that same kid began doing shit like smearing feces on the wall because holy hell, his every day life is terrible, and the parents decided that rather than any sort of family coaching or effort to find out why he was doing this, they decide to bar him from going to Disneyland with the rest of the family.<br><br>It all gets big on Youtube when a few big names make some videos on it. The family claims first insists that the videos are real and that none of the kids are being abused, that all the haters are just &quot;jealous&quot; before having the kids chime in with such quips as &quot;They don&#039;t beat us like most parents do!&quot; and &quot;How can we be abused with all this nice stuff?&quot; When the heat gets worse, they do an interview with Keemstar who initially supports them despite the terrible shit they do to the youngest.

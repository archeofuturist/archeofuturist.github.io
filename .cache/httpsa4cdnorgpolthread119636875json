We run off of two substantially different hormones, estrogen and testosterone. Just from this you can deduce that we will exhibit substantially different behavior from one another. We have evolved for thousands and thousands of years together. We compliment each other naturally. Inequality is first observed by the holder of the resources. Men are expendable creatures, however women are vital to a society. When they are pregnant they require protection in order to continue the species. Thus men have evolved to protect and value women, and women have evolved to find the best mate so that their children will be best equipped to survive. That&#039;s why women get hot over traditional male characteristics, even when they are self proclaimed feminists and female warriors.<br><br>Women want strong men to lead and protect them, and men want feminine women that they can adore. We are not equal creatures. We are separate in most ways.

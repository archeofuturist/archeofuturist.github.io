This time, it ended with Kelly Schneider kicking him to death with steel-toed boots after luring the 49-year-old out to the remote Gotts Point area of Lake Lowell April 29, 2016.<br><br>On Monday, Schneider was sentenced to life in prison with 28 years before he will become eligible for parole. It&#039;s the first of two hearings for the 23-year-old this month; he is due to appear in federal court April 26 to be sentenced on hate crime charges.<br><br>Investigators say Schneider, along with Kevin Tracy, Jayson Woods, and Daniel Henkel, hatched a plot that centered on attacking and robbing men who answered fake ads for sex the group posted online. Schneider posted a picture on the site, advertising himself as a male escort.<br><br>Steven Nelson answered the ad, and the the two agreed to meet up for a sexual liason at the Gotts Point parking lot.<br><br>Unbeknownst to the victim, Schneider brought along Henkel and Tracy as backup, while Woods - the &quot;mastermind&quot; behind the robbery, according to prosecutors - watched from a nearby car.<br><br>As Steven Nelson got out of his car, Schneider attacked, hitting him in the face, then kicking him about 30 times while calling him homophobic slurs.<br><br>Schneider then stripped Steven Nelson of his clothes and took his credit cards and car keys, driving away in the victim&#039;s car and leaving him bloodied and naked in the pre-dawn cold.<br><br>Eventually, Steven Nelson reached a home where residents called for help. As he was taken to a local hospital by ambulance, the victim was able to recount what had happen and describe his attacker to investigators.<br><br>Later that morning, he went into cardiac arrest. By the time family members could reach the hospital, he was already dead.","filename":"hooker","ext":".jpg","w":532,"h":771,"tn_w":172,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491884483570,"time":1491884483,"md5":"EV9+C\/ZPlNZHnI3qfVtXUA==","fsize":44415,"resto":0,"id":"M+9+yIx+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"antigay-robbery-ring-leader-sentenced-to-life-in","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120552084,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:24:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Pretty obvious that Schneider is a latent homosexual","time":1491884694,"resto":120551679,"id":"h4zg0F8B","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120552272,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:26:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120551679\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120551679<\/a><br>bump","time":1491884792,"resto":120551679,"id":"pBvIkyt+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120553294,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:35:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;the alt right<\/span>","filename":"Steven Nelson suspects from top left Woods, Schneider, Henkel, Tracy","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":800,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491885312349,"time":1491885312,"md5":"sj1Iep5Y95kRe3Qk8UcaUA==","fsize":47292,"resto":120551679,"id":"h4zg0F8B","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

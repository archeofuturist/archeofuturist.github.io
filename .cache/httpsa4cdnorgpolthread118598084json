He&#039;s implying that rather than increasing the supply the makers are going to pocket the money and keep producing the same quantity. This kind of thing could easily arise in something like high density residential real estate in where the capital investment necessary for increasing the supply of housing (i.e. building a new skyscraper) is far greater than the subsidy.<br><br>I&#039;d say, this is a matter of supply elasticity (the S line being more vertical) and even though this means the increase in supply will be less, it still shouldn&#039;t increase price. <br><br>Of course with less elastic supply the utility return of a subsidy diminishes.<br><br>This doesn&#039;t seem to apply to green energy in most respects though. It doesn&#039;t have the viability to be functioning just fine before subsidy. I know that for hydroelectric power there are some fairly firm supply limits that could create this kind of scenario. Perhaps solar panels and the materials going into them have similar problems. I&#039;m not going to believe that the green energy market is impervious to the influence of subsidies until I see some evidence because currently things seem to indicate that subsidies do indeed get more solar panels out there. Now whether it&#039;s a worthwhile undertaking is totally debatable, but the subsidies get people to use it from what I&#039;ve seen.","time":1490674395,"resto":118598084,"id":"z8vesg21","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118609155,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:13:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118609047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118609047<\/a>","filename":"Moloch666","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":1024,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490674437426,"time":1490674437,"md5":"KMdVa28eH2aoqhLLmDFr0g==","fsize":141923,"resto":118598084,"id":"+347aR78","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118609167,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:14:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118608915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118608915<\/a><br>Why do you dipshit Republicans always forget what the fucking U in USA stand for?<br><a href=\"#p118608978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118608978<\/a><br>Nice non-argument, retard.","time":1490674445,"resto":118598084,"id":"QSPhAO6S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118609221,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:14:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118609155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118609155<\/a>","filename":"lilly","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":978,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490674483463,"time":1490674483,"md5":"x4Im274QyqNQruLQ44+0Kg==","fsize":68008,"resto":118598084,"id":"+347aR78","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118609287,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:15:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118609221\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118609221<\/a>","filename":"ouch","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":436,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":109,"tim":1490674529733,"time":1490674529,"md5":"Qh5x1u2+SlwThAwaB4e5jw==","fsize":42108,"resto":118598084,"id":"+347aR78","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118609364,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:16:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118609287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118609287<\/a>","filename":"Upton1","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":1099,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490674576272,"time":1490674576,"md5":"sSncgjCFxpVFpt8yep5n8A==","fsize":82263,"resto":118598084,"id":"+347aR78","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118609367,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:16:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118608258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118608258<\/a><br>I wasn&#039;t claiming they weren&#039;t viable just that the explosion in job growth in that sector was due to government influence.<br><br><a href=\"#p118608391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118608391<\/a><br>I&#039;m just trying to give you the basics of the racket that is commercial farming.

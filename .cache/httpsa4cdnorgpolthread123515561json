This may sound harmless to the average person, but it has sinister implications. If you think about it long enough you will come to some startling realisations, not just about chemtrails and GMOs - those in power seek to manipulate our physical reality. They are no doubt working on some sort of time machine, be it on that can transport people into different times or just send messages through time. You may think this concept is too far out, but consider that we are entering into another Cold War, one where the battleground of innovation will be quantum. You have been warned. The Mandela effect is real.","filename":"IMG_0352","ext":".jpg","w":384,"h":384,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493581109385,"time":1493581109,"md5":"0HrUWFBITgi+DrcdWga5wA==","fsize":64753,"resto":0,"id":"x+M6\/Eft","country":"IE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-us-has-a-monopoly-on-scientific-research-this","country_name":"Ireland","replies":17,"images":0,"unique_ips":10},{"no":123516046,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)15:42:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Dat larp","time":1493581342,"resto":123515561,"id":"1kGGsZ21","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123517920,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)15:57:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123516046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123516046<\/a><br>Not larping, this is the real deal.","time":1493582223,"resto":123515561,"id":"x+M6\/Eft","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":123519535,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)16:10:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1493583027,"resto":123515561,"id":"x+M6\/Eft","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":123520311,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)16:16:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123515561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123515561<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The US has a monopoly on scientific research.<\/span><br>They don&#039;t have monopoly over it, they just invest heavily in it and therefore produce a lot more scientific articles each year then the rest of the world.<br><br>China is second, and if you sum up all of EU countries scientific output you will reach a close number to the output of the USA.<br><br>So basically you are retarded.","time":1493583403,"resto":123515561,"id":"S1BS9UVA","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":123520514,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)16:18:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123520311\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123520311<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I found one flaw in your premise so therefore the whole thing is retarded<\/span><br>You must be one of those negro Brazilians.","time":1493583504,"resto":123515561,"id":"x+M6\/Eft","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":123520871,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)16:21:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123515561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123515561<\/a><br>Scientists research whatever they&#039;re paid to research. only very few of them actively research topics that interest them, they just follow the money cause they need to pay rent.<br><br>I don&#039;t need to remind you who has the money.","time":1493583665,"resto":123515561,"id":"HhjXTe+e","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123521037,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)16:22:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123520514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123520514<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I found one flaw in your premise so therefore the whole thing is retarded<\/span><br>Oh, no problem, let me tell you why the rest of you post is retarded as fuck...<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They are no doubt working on some sort of time machine, be it on that can transport people into different times or just send messages through time.<\/span><br>Unless you got a citation or source of this information you can provide us I will go ahead and call you a fucking retard.","time":1493583738,"resto":123515561,"id":"S1BS9UVA","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":123521129,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)16:22:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123515561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123515561<\/a><br>You&#039;re forgetting that America is fucking huge.

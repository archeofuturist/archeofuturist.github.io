People who are lactose intolerant\u2014a group that includes 75 percent of African Americans\u2014&quot;can choose low-lactose and lactose-free dairy products,&quot; the guidelines say. But a new study has called into question this one-size-fits-all approach. It suggests that most African American adults might not need milk at all.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Scientists have known for some time that people who live in Africa have some of the world&#039;s lowest rates of osteoporosis. Researchers long assumed that the difference was due to Africans&#039; lower life expectancy (since the condition usually shows up later in life), more active lifestyles, and a lack of doctors to diagnose and treat the condition. Yet astudypublished in June inBoneKEy, an offshoot of the journalNature, offers a compelling alternative explanation: Many Africans are genetically adapted to low-calcium diets.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Study author Constance Hilliard, an evolutionary historian at the University of North Texas, examined osteoporosis rates in Nigeria and Cameroon, two African countries that fall within an area known as the tsetse belt. Dairy farming is impossible in this equatorial region because of the presence of the tsetse fly, a tropical pest that transmits parasites that kill cattle. Despite a nearly complete lack of dairy consumption in the two countries, their osteoporosis rates are among the lowest in the world\u2014just two to three cases out of every 100,000 people.<\/span><br><br>For educational purpose:<br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/bJL-HYSlvRM","filename":"Screenshot_2017-04-12-11-15-31_1","ext":".jpg","w":1424,"h":1005,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":176,"tim":1492018060296,"time":1492018060,"md5":"1SotKdWTBJM8XTWwJqbWhg==","fsize":90547,"resto":0,"id":"uLQA316h","country":"SG","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-the-us-dietary-guidelines-on-milk-racist","country_name":"Singapore","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":120783676,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)13:53:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120780785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120780785<\/a><br>i love this guy and his series. i feel like buying one of his tricorne hats for 4th of july.","time":1492019580,"resto":120780785,"id":"6e0f21rX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120784485,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)13:59:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120780785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120780785<\/a><br><br>How does one get a qt butter making gf?","time":1492019990,"resto":120780785,"id":"5f\/f7r3h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120784846,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:02:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Duh.

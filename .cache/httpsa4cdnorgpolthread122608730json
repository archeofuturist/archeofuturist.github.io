Your cells sensitivity to testosterone is the only thing that determines what range is normal to you. If you take more than your cells are receptive too, you will see negative results. These results are similar even if your &quot;normal range&quot; is fairly low or fairly high. Your testosterone levels also varies immensely during the day, and it is always at its highest when you wake up. Do you feel alpha as fuck when you wake up? Do you struggle to have an erection in the evening when your testosterone is lowest? No? There you go, testosterone as an administered drug is only useful if you have critically low levels or if you want to build muscle mass.

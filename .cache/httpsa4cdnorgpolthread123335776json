We can also all agree that brave new world was far more degenerate culturally than 1984. What&#039;s your take on this \/pol\/?

In the 1984 world, books are banned, censorship is from the top down and is everywhere pervasive. Although there is some soft censorship in our society, they don&#039;t need to go the full way because people have become so dulled by capitalism and liberalism that they don&#039;t bother seeking out dissentient information. You don&#039;t need to ban books if people aren&#039;t going to bother reading them in the first place. Political correctness is partly to blame. What will my friends think? What will my boss think? What will my family think?

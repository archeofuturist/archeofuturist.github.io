Most people(the proles) are too stupid to think for themselves and are consumed in materialism and senseless entertainment, like Brave New World. We just only get to see the Middle Class of 1984&#039;s world. They&#039;re not the opposite, they&#039;re basically the same, think of BNW as a Proles&#039; life and you&#039;ll basically know what their lives are like.","time":1493484969,"resto":123335776,"id":"7gpkKCww","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123352654,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)12:57:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123337247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123337247<\/a><br>fucking idiot","filename":"I don&#039;t think so","ext":".jpg","w":240,"h":285,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493485030890,"time":1493485030,"md5":"SG5vbsVl8Ovsp1H1pqywoQ==","fsize":9617,"resto":123335776,"id":"jis0y1P0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123352736,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)12:57:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123351949\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123351949<\/a><br>Your explanation was solid, in particular including F451, which a lot of people don&#039;t realize isn&#039;t about the government banning books, but the people voluntarily destroying things that offend them until, once again, life has no meaning.<br><br>The centralized theme for all of the dystopian novels of that era is the exploration of societies that have fallen for the utopianist belief in resolving conflict or misery once and for all by removing any barriers between pleasure and neutering any capacity people have for starting conflict, only to discover that not only does it not actually resolve conflict and suffering, not only does it actually make conflict and suffering infinitely worse, not only does removing the ability to create conflict mean removing the ability to resolve it, not only does removing the need for discipline also remove the capacity for revolt, but the loss of all of those things kills something inside us that is infinitely more important than our safety, comfort, or even our lives.","time":1493485075,"resto":123335776,"id":"97DtPUCA","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123352759,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)12:58:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123336945\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123336945<\/a><br>Zamyatin we<br><br>The first and the best dystopic nove.","time":1493485083,"resto":123335776,"id":"HpPR1GHc","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123352826,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)12:58:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123340384\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123340384<\/a><br>It&#039;s called procreating with model tier wafu","time":1493485117,"resto":123335776,"id":"iNvcmMbI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123353089,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:01:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123352826\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123352826<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;eugenics<\/span>","filename":"1454876056036","ext":".gif","w":303,"h":277,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1493485274395,"time":1493485274,"md5":"l9KAxtpgrbd7MZSy2ONvTQ==","fsize":1852930,"resto":123335776,"id":"QWddL0bV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123353235,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:02:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123350469\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123350469<\/a><br>Note how everyone misinterprets Fahrenheit 451 to be about censorship","time":1493485361,"resto":123335776,"id":"xJDunAEh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123353307,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:03:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123353089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123353089<\/a><br>Then so be it","time":1493485399,"resto":123335776,"id":"iNvcmMbI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123353340,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:03:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123353235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123353235<\/a><br>I thought it was about the hover police.","filename":"C-HolT-WsAAfxyl.jpg large","ext":".jpg","w":337,"h":434,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493485418570,"time":1493485418,"md5":"nrT\/N3sry0rOalGNN6hDlQ==","fsize":29175,"resto":123335776,"id":"QWddL0bV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123353355,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:03:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123335863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123335863<\/a><br>You didnt even try.

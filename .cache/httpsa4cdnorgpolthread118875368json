Say each of these employees generate about $11-$12 of value per hour (since that&#039;s why you hire people in the first place). Let&#039;s say this yields a 2-3% profit margin (which is pretty common in the food industry). Now say the government comes in and tells you to pay those lazy fucks $15. Well just because you give them more money doesn&#039;t mean that they&#039;ll become worth $16-$17 in value to you. They&#039;re still worth $11-$12. So now you have two options. You can fire half of these fucks and force the remaining employees to work harder or you can raise your food prices and pass that increased cost off onto your consumers. So you go with option B. Now everyone who eats your shit is pissed that your prices went up and you start to lose business. The people who do decide to continue eating there pay more and bite the bullet. Pretty soon, since everyone is making more money in the area, rent prices start to increase now that people can afford to pay more. All businesses are charging more because their labor costs were forcibly inflated.

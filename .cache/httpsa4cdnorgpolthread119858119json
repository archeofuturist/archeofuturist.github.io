He told them he DID NOT RAISE HIS HAND AND TAKE THE OATH an by so doing he was still a CIVILIAN and did not surrender his Civilian Legal Status. The officer present paused, smiled, and told the three guys to &#039;get him out of here&#039; via the back door. He was told to never report there again an they tore up his draft card. This was in 1968. He was free an back on the street in 10 minutes the other 48 dumb schmucks went off to Vietnam.

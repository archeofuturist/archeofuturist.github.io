It&#039;s about Judaism as a group evolutionary strategy. Basically, jews fear white ethnocentrism because white ethnocentrism has never worked out well for the jews, so they do what they can to prevent it from happening through intellectual movements and lobbying for immigration reform. It has chapters on Franz Boas, Stephen Gould, Freud, immigration, the frankfurt school, and jewish involvement in leftist movements. All well researched and heavily cited. Cultural marxism and all the misinformation out there about race all have jewish origins. You&#039;ll never look at the world the same way again after reading it.

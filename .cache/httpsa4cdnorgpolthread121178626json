So far my favourite is the essay on slavery. Really revealing that not only were white, western countries, not the worst offenders, they were also the sole culture fighting to end slavery worldwide. Britain in particular spent so many resources and effort stifling the Atlantic slave-trade. Not to mention, they spent a significant portion of their GDP purchasing slaves to set free. <br><br>Truly enlightening, especially in the context of today&#039;s American blacks crying about white privilege.","time":1492237570,"resto":121178626,"id":"IB6stVzJ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121180098,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)02:27:09","name":"Anonymous","filename":"schwarzmann","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":960,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492237629209,"time":1492237629,"md5":"gurRkpAtqVicXrlmBdFSsw==","fsize":67821,"resto":121178626,"id":"F2B4TRZb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121180145,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)02:27:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121179643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121179643<\/a><br>Have fun, anon.","time":1492237661,"resto":121178626,"id":"Mp1aJOcX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121180172,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)02:27:55","name":"Anonymous","filename":"61dDDVMD2bL._SX260_","ext":".jpg","w":260,"h":346,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492237675731,"time":1492237675,"md5":"Yxu6UthXPJKE3LS2wOQZvw==","fsize":37954,"resto":121178626,"id":"Nt1Qg6N2","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121180479,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)02:31:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121179602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121179602<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Quick rundown?

It&#039;s about Judaism as a group evolutionary strategy. Basically, jews fear white ethnocentrism because white ethnocentrism has never worked out well for the jews, so they do what they can to prevent it from happening through intellectual movements and lobbying for immigration reform. It has chapters on Franz Boas, Stephen Gould, Freud, immigration, the frankfurt school, and jewish involvement in leftist movements. All well researched and heavily cited. Cultural marxism and all the misinformation out there about race all have jewish origins. You&#039;ll never look at the world the same way again after reading it. It&#039;s literally the redpill.","time":1492237890,"resto":121178626,"id":"h\/6BhLvg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121180626,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)02:33:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121180479\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121180479<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;clinical psychology<\/span><br>*evolutionary psychology","time":1492237990,"resto":121178626,"id":"h\/6BhLvg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

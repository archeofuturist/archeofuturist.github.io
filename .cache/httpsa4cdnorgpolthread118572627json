Unfortunately, we can do it too often and with too much ease, so the risk is far too little for the reward.

As a result, the little things you enjoy become less important as the dopamine normally released by doing them is dwarfed in comparison to what you usually get from jerking it every day.

YBOP is a cherry-picked archive of anecdotal evidence, which means sweet fuck all in scientific and academic terms. For every single success story on that website, there are a dozen posts online from people who have tried nofap and seen no benefit, posts from people stuck in a never-ending cycle of win streaks and &quot;&quot;&quot;relapse&quot;&quot;&quot; that results in significantly more distress overall than masturbation alone ever did, and even some posts from people who have dropped masturbation and seen negative changes with regard to their sex drive.<br><br>Ask yourself some basic questions to get a fresh perspective on your underlying assumptions:<br><br>1. Why is a large volume of cherry-picked anecdotal evidence a good reason to believe in something? There&#039;s more anecdotal evidence out there for the existence of UFOs, ayy lmaos, and Mary Magdalene than masturbation addiction. Does that mean little green men are real? Would Gary Wilson, the man behind the YBOP site, think that a similar site instead collating alien abduction reports gives him any more reason to believe in UFOs than he otherwise had?<br>2. Why would difficulty stopping masturbation necessarily indicate addiction? 80% of New Year&#039;s resolutions fail by February. Would you say that a guy who had trouble sticking to guitar practice is addicted to not practicing guitar? Or would you say that he had a self-control and willpower issue that needed some work?<br>3. Is it not a little bit suspicious that Gary Wilson&#039;s wife, Marnia Robinson, runs a freaky new age tantric sex woo-woo website at https:\/\/www.reuniting.info\/ (pic related)? Might this give Gary an ulterior motive for shilling so-called porn addiction so hard?<br>4. If porn is so addictive, why don&#039;t you see bums on the street begging you for money to finance a broadband connection?","filename":"Capture","ext":".png","w":1170,"h":669,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1490658687435,"time":1490658687,"md5":"xV15Ixr9prWzTvlIXIUIYQ==","fsize":713243,"resto":118572627,"id":"jrbRRr7K","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118581521,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:52:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118581055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118581055<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jews pushed for making it legal<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jews produced it all<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jews made it more and more degenerate<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jews+feminist started the sexual revolution which normalized it<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jews promote every type of sex or degeneracy possible<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jews promote all the bogus studies about how you must teach your 4 year old child to masturbate<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jews want kids having sex younger and younger<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jews own and run every major porn site\/business<\/span><br>jews totally don&#039;t want you to masturbate. you&#039;re proof people shilling for porn are brain damaged and helping nofap prove the point.","time":1490658762,"resto":118572627,"id":"H\/mScF3p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118581532,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:52:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118572627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118572627<\/a><br>I find NoFap to be really helpful.

Do you not think that some of the difficulty arising from nofap could be self-fulfilling prophecy or nocebo effect? If someone tried to stop masturbating without any further context, do you think they would have an easier time of it than someone whose expectations had been influenced by countless posts about how impossible it was to stop masturbating before going into it?<br>6. Gary Wilson says that porn owes its addictive nature to it being a superstimulant. How do you feel about the fact that Gary Wilson&#039;s conception of superstimulants also includes food? Are you man enough to say that fat people are food addicts on \/pol\/?<br>7. If you believe that they exist, have you considered the possibility that other mental health problems might be responsible for what you think is porn addiction? People with depression, for example, are naturally going to have a harder time sticking to almost anything than the average person. People with ADHD will likely jerk it more because of the lower impulse control that results from EF impairment.<br><br>I got bored but you get the picture.

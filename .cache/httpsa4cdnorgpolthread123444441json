Sorry it&#039;s not as personal, but Dan McCoy is a lot more scholarly and articulate about this than I am anyway.<br>\u00c1satru\/Odinism is the branch I&#039;m most familiar with, but the European religion writ broad also includes the gods, myths, traditions, and rituals of all the European peoples: Romans, Celts, Slavs, etc. The religions of all the indigenous peoples of Europe gave many similarities. A god or goddess is often the same core divinity with a different name and different regional lore in different places. The reason it&#039;s so similar is that it&#039;s all the same branch of the religion of the proto-indo-Europeans. The southern branch became hinduism, which has some differences as well as some similarities with the European religion(s). Varg Vikernes wrote a lot about the etymology abd relations between the gods of different European peoples in his books on the subject.<br>http:\/\/norse-mythology.org","time":1493535075,"resto":123444441,"id":"IpIit\/KR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123448731,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)02:53:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123448526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123448526<\/a><br>Typos cause phone.","time":1493535216,"resto":123444441,"id":"IpIit\/KR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123448938,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)02:56:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123448526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123448526<\/a><br>There is a God.

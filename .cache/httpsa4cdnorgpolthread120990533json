I live in NW Montana. It had a noise more like the sound of wind blowing (but it was definitely a plane, there&#039;s no wind outside and it was coming from the sky), but if you pitched the wind down really low. It was also going pretty fast--I couldn&#039;t see it but could hear it loudly and clearly, and it seems like it did a wide circle over my town before the noise just suddenly cut off and the skies went dead silent. I think it was heading west but could&#039;ve been going east.<br><br>Should I be worried? I live next to an airport (a flight school and small one) and a bigger airport is up north a bit (with actual flights to places around the country and to canada) and I have NEVER heard a plane like that before. It sounded almost like a jet from GTA5, but the noise was again, low in pitch, but extremely loud. I heard it over my decently volumed music. And again I was staying completely still while listening to it and in the sky I could hear it come my direction and then go left and quickly go right. Like those ASMR videos where the person makes a noise and has it travel around the mic? That&#039;s what it was like. It was extremely fast in that regard.","filename":"1491850769492","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492130193961,"time":1492130193,"md5":"OimLwb5wsIVFBIkeWngmNA==","fsize":58652,"resto":0,"id":"j+Bzwm\/I","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"plane-noises","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

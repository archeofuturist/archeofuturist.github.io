The problem is the gross-negligence and acceptance of subjugation of the people of the US. Nothing you do will change any of this. It&#039;s too great of a problem. The only thing that would have real effect would be a benevolent dictator rising to power, killing all of their opposition in a violent civil war. That&#039;s never going to happen, more likely an unorganized civil war, and if a dictator came about, that individual would probably not be benevolent. Aside from that, any hint of a real threat of civil war will spark an instant global war. By engaging in foreign wars on an existential level, the government can dissuade any formation of dissent. Their only limitation is the perceived seriousness of existential threat by the population. My recommendation: move away, buy land, start a business, make a network, strengthen the network, then influence local politics, build an inner core group of confidants, and together murder and dispose of anyone that gets in your way, gov or otherwise. If you survive, and grow wealthy enough, identify the global architects of chaos, kidnap them, two at a time, take them into the desert, make them compete for who can come up with the most cash in the shortest time to save themselves. Then kill them both horrifyingly with a large 10lb sledge. Dispose of carcasses. Take their money, reinvest it into your cleansing operation. Rinse and repeat. It won&#039;t fix things but at least justice will have been served in one corner of the planet, in one moment of time.

My issue is that worshipping God is not just stupid, but IMMORAL.<br>Think about all the children who die in terrible agony around the world, maybe because of an illness or a natural disaster, even at the very moment you&#039;re reading this thread. Their parents are praying for them to be saved, but those children are going to die regardless. God won&#039;t save them. Why? There are only 3 possible explainations for this: God is impotent, God doesn&#039;t care, or it&#039;s all part of God&#039;s plan.<br>If God is impotent, it means he&#039;s not a god by definition, and therefore worshipping him is immoral.<br>If God doesn&#039;t care about people&#039;s suffering while having the means to easily help them, it means he is evil, and therefore worshipping him is also immoral.<br><br>...","filename":"b963d0712103d5ca913b483d17a84b56","ext":".jpg","w":564,"h":675,"tn_w":208,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490140475245,"time":1490140475,"md5":"ZD4FatybDqUa2bfnp+1I9w==","fsize":75009,"resto":0,"id":"DqyGjiFX","country":"IT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"religious-people-should-be-despised","country_name":"Italy","replies":12,"images":3,"unique_ips":6},{"no":117689890,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:54:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"If it&#039;s all part of God&#039;s plan, that means God is completely responsible for all the suffering in the world and for whether people are sent to Heaven or to Hell after their death; as if that wasn&#039;t enough, God sends people to Hell for simply not believing in him, which means that moral people will be sent to Hell just because of the circumstances they were born in and that God created (e.g. being born in a country where everyone around you happens to believe in the &quot;wrong&quot; religion), while even the most immoral people (e.g. a serial killer who raped, tortured and slaughtered countless children throughout his life) can go to Heaven as long as they believe in God and &quot;redeem&quot; before dying: this makes God even more evil than in the case where he just doesn&#039;t care, therefore worshipping him regardless of it is immoral as well.<br>In conclusion, religious people should be despised because they choose to worship a God that doesn&#039;t deserve to worshipped in the least, which causes them to become psychopaths who would commit the worst atrocities against fellow human beings just because their God told them to (slavery, rape, child abuse, witch burning, genocide, suicide bombing... the list is endless).<br><br>P.S.

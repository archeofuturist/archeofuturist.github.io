You&#039;re definitely overestimating the power they want. Extremists want power, but there aren&#039;t over a billion extremists. Most muslims are simply pawns, born into that religion and culture the same way you were likely born into yours, and I was born into the one I was taught as a child; they simply want to be able to practice their stupid fairy tale in peace and live in peace without any hatred. They would all probably like to see more muslims around them, but only because other muslims are less likely to oppress them. It&#039;s the same way you&#039;d feel in a region where everyone was a different race, or spoke a different language. For these folks, terrorists are even more troubling than they are to us, because they indirectly paint targets on the heads of the innocent, peaceful muslims who are just trying to raise families and have careers.","time":1492627477,"resto":121875981,"id":"75OjiZkG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

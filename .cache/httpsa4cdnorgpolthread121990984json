While we laid the foundations of philanthropy and righteousness and kindness in this world and held high the ensign of Good Thoughts, Good Words and Good Deeds, you and your ancestors were desert wanderers who ate snakes and lizards and buried your innocent daughters alive.

To us Persians the light of Fire is reminiscent of the Light of God. The radiance and the sun-like warmth of fire exuberates our hearts, and the pleasant warmth of it brings our hearts and spirits closer together, that we may be philanthropic, kind and considerate, that gentleness and forgiveness may become our way of life, and that thereby the Light of God may keep shining in our hearts.","time":1492692440,"resto":121990984,"country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121991266,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)08:48:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Our God is the Great Ahura Mazda.

It costs about 40 dollars for all the parts and can protect you from antifa attacks at rallies, as well as providing a weapon for bashing and striking.<br><br>The shield can be built with items from any hardware store. You need:<br><br>Circular plywood <br><br>A cabinet or door handle (big enough to wrap your whole hand around<br><br>A leather belt<br><br>Screws<br><br>Optional: padding <br><br>Just screw the leather belt and handle to one side of the shield and you&#039;ve got a cheap but effective piece of equipment to protect you from antifa. It&#039;s small and easy to maneuver, unlike big riot shields, and is easy to decorate.

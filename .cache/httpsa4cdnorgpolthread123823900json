On Tuesday, Lambda Legal joined the suit, which seeks damages for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and the intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Zawadski and Gaspari aren\u2019t suing the funeral home for engaging in anti-gay discrimination because Mississippi does not protect LGBTQ people from refusal of service. Indeed, the state\u2019s notorious HB 1523 actually protects businesses\u2019 right to turn away LGBTQ customers\u2014though the courts have put that law on hold for now.<br><br>Initially, the nearby Picayune Funeral Home seemed like a perfect choice, and Gaspari paid the company $1,795 to transport and cremate Huskey\u2019s body once he passed. But when Huskey died and the nursing home contacted the funeral home to pick up his body, it refused to do so. The funeral home had discovered that Huskey\u2019s next-of-kin was his husband, and realizing Huskey was gay, informed the nursing home that it did not \u201cdeal with their kind.\u201d","filename":"urn","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493761337888,"time":1493761337,"md5":"V1p5v7PgCP\/FWUdDGSQAxQ==","fsize":71251,"resto":0,"id":"W5xv9RYu","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"man-sues-antigay-mississippi-funeral-home-for","country_name":"United States","replies":15,"images":1,"unique_ips":9},{"no":123824257,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:45:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123823900\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123823900<\/a><br><br>Fuck those people for not transporting him, but they are a private business.

It was temporarily put on hold by a judge but could technically apply here and would vindicate the funeral parlor, even (I guess) if they were in breach of contract, which is what the suit is about since MS does not have any LGBT discrimination provisions and the federal courts are divided between whether the &quot;sex&quot; protected class of the Civil Rights act includes gays (7th Circuit says yes, 11th says no) and the Supreme Court has yet to rule if sincerely held religious beliefs are a valid grounds for businesses refusing to serve LGBT clients. <br><br><a href=\"#p123825372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123825372<\/a><br>If this were a case where they had refused to cremate a Black person, this would be a lot bigger issue.

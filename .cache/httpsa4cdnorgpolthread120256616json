The biggest issue I told him I had about anti-Mexican arguments\u2014besides the blatant racism\u2014is the lack of sources for the Right\u2019s pathetic claims. Same with you: just \u2018cause you and Steve Bannon say something is true doesn\u2019t make it so. And here you come proving my pinche point. A 2013 Reason article tracked IQs among immigrants of previous generations and concluded \u201cmodern Hispanic immigrants seem to be no stupider than the immigrant ancestors of other Americans.\u201d Yay! (And before you trot out stats insisting that the IQs of Mexican-Americans don\u2019t increase with generation\u2014ask them if they\u2019ve tracked the same among poor gabas in the South). Mexicans turning gabachos neighborhoods bad? Read USC professor Jody Agius Vallejo\u2019s magisterial Barrios to Burbs: The Making of the Mexican American Middle Class, which debunks both Know Nothing AND yaktists who say Mexicans must remain perpetual peons across generations. Automation? Ask the Rust Belt how robots have treated gabachos. Benevolent conservative rulers? Ask the Rust Belt how right-wing Americans have treated gabachos. And as for that last neo-Nazi dog whistle\u2014here\u2019s where the stupidity and insecurity of your movement gets exposed at its worst. What has made the United States the greatest country on Earth is that multitudes of non-\u201cwhite\u201d immigrants like Jews, Italians, Russians, Irish, Asians Mexicans and, sure, even some \u201cwhites\u201d came to make the U.S. great. The only people that freak out about diversity are gabachos who keep fearing that Mexicans will ISIS them once we\u2019re the majority, not bother to realize most Mexicans would rather see the Oakland Raiders move to Los Angeles than kill whitey (except Roger Goodell and Tom Brady). You know the one thing Mexicans truly don\u2019t like about gabachos? Their propensity for excuses and whining like CHAVALAS.<\/span>","time":1491728481,"resto":120256616,"id":"Rp0oAc4o","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120261699,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:01:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;57% spaniard<\/span><br>Please don&#039;t encourage the Mexico iz wyatt retards.

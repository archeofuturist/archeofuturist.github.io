What is causing this? Social contagion? More openness for gays identifying as trans? Part of me feels bad for them due to the dysphoria but all the trans posters on \/pol\/ have said they were poor and lonely as gay guys and now are making money and life is easier as &quot;women&quot;.<br><br>It is now permeating our pop culture and has entered music as a theme. Even if you just want them dead or want nothing to do with them, what do you think the rise of the numbers is? I think the most insidious part is the man who went on Survivor recently and was fired (as a gay man) from his real life job for outing a transgender man on the show. Simply pointing out someone&#039;s biological gender can now be grounds for firing which scares me and will hopefully put a rift between gays and transgender individuals who have been lumped together assumedly by the latter since about the 60s. <br><br>Does trans numbers increasing demonstrate the poor conditions of life for gay men or a crass capitalistic endeavor of cosmetic surgery, makeup, and drugs to appeal to a wishful thinking lifestyle? <br><br>As a gay man I have never really seriously contemplated trying to be a woman and I can&#039;t wrap my mind around what makes you think because you are effeminate you should dress and physically resemble the part as well.<br><br>Also it is impossible now to pass anti-discrimination laws regarding gays that don&#039;t also include language about gender identity, which makes them harder to pass. <br><br>Are there any trannies on \/pol\/ who can walk me through how someone could consider being effeminate = being the other gender as a non-autistic reasoning. <br><br>https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/best-swi<wbr>mwear-want-throw-gender-140000399.h<wbr>tml","filename":"swimweear","ext":".jpg","w":575,"h":863,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492347753386,"time":1492347753,"md5":"og6YXoEIDFlRUy7un+hijA==","fsize":65503,"resto":0,"id":"rnH1pdA9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"14-million-transgender-americans","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":5,"unique_ips":11},{"no":121356031,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)09:02:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121356020\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121356020<\/a>","filename":"swimwear2","ext":".jpg","w":575,"h":863,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492347762123,"time":1492347762,"md5":"m44KMDel3SqsDozc3yA1IA==","fsize":74287,"resto":121356020,"id":"rnH1pdA9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121356042,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)09:02:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121356031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121356031<\/a>","filename":"swimwear3","ext":".jpg","w":575,"h":863,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492347770289,"time":1492347770,"md5":"2RvsuGviRAi2oqu4h6xw2g==","fsize":89786,"resto":121356020,"id":"rnH1pdA9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121356158,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)09:04:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121356020\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121356020<\/a><br>BPA, Atrazine","time":1492347845,"resto":121356020,"id":"zurkdyR7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121356167,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)09:04:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121356020\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121356020<\/a><br>Transtrenders.

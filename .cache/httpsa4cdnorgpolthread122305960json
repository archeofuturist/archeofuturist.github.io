We have the utmost faith in their ability to lead the site through both the changes we are making to address the internal issues that made this situation possible in the first place, and the impact it had on society at large, the company, and its staff.\u201d <br>Pillay said: \u201cI respect the office of the press ombudsman and have decided to tender my resignation. Thank you to Media24 for this opportunity and all the best to the team at HuffPost SA going forward.\u201d<br><br>http:\/\/www.news24.com\/SouthAfrica\/N<wbr>ews\/breaking-verashni-pillay-resign<wbr>s-as-editor-of-huffpost-sa-20170422<wbr>","filename":"pillay","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":370,"tn_w":202,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492884186459,"time":1492884186,"md5":"zCXF+xijPg0D4WIVXQ2K0Q==","fsize":37888,"resto":0,"id":"VmySw+b5","country":"KR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"verashni-pillay-resigns-as-editor-of-huffpost-sa","country_name":"South Korea","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

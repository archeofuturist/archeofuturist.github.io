It\u2019s said that, in one event, several people were crushed to death while clamoring to get a look at him. In Japan, he met warlord Nobunaga who suspected that the dark color of his skin was ink and not natural. Nobunaga reportedly had him strip from the waist up and made him scrub his skin. Satisfied that he was in fact black, Nobunaga took deep interest in Yasuke eventually, and he was allowed to enter Nobunaga\u2019s service, which is when available documentation on Yasuke\u2019s life seems to really begin.","filename":"A-Film-About-Yasuke-Japans-First-Black-Samurai","ext":".jpg","w":1160,"h":653,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490842651964,"time":1490842651,"md5":"loMNpUvMySk2nt+wKOXaEw==","fsize":404549,"resto":0,"id":"DokQVOnD","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-really-was-samurais-n-shiet","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118872814,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)22:58:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"They actually had this in the game Nioh.","time":1490842703,"resto":118872725,"id":"Brt1VGbS","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118873016,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)22:59:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118872814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118872814<\/a><br>yea i heard","time":1490842798,"resto":118872725,"id":"DokQVOnD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118874180,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)23:11:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118872725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118872725<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1579<\/span><br>A man from London named Victor Tak travelled to backwoods China in the 1980s to study kung-fu.

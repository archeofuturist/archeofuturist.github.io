Us educated liberals, who, you know, actually read and understand the news, know that the dossier is real, and evidence continues to leak out with each passing week. It gives me a hard on watching it all come tumbling down for Trump and watching his moronic rural supporters scramble to defend him with their &quot;FAKE NEWS&quot; chants. It actually turned out well that Hillary lost, cause once this shitshow is ever the country will turn irreversibly blue, and we can get a real leftist in the white house instead of Hillary who was, admittedly, a centrist.","time":1491162682,"resto":119230222,"id":"ZGi+RSKZ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119237735,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:51:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119233858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119233858<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bt<wbr>2ajlWyPW0<\/span>","filename":"1475106731237","ext":".gif","w":320,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491162690299,"time":1491162690,"md5":"M\/2rzXaj6fzXo1A8xSnuDQ==","fsize":1659348,"resto":119230222,"id":"Am7XfUaD","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119237782,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:51:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119233020\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119233020<\/a><br>is that a dick?","time":1491162714,"resto":119230222,"id":"WTs3z0RI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119237789,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:51:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119234412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119234412<\/a><br>nobody is going to go to war against Russia for Drumpf","time":1491162718,"resto":119230222,"id":"45eCgZZ+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119237811,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:52:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119237668\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119237668<\/a><br><br>check this thread<br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119236720#p119236720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119236720<\/a>","time":1491162731,"resto":119230222,"id":"+cPo2iGu","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119237818,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:52:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119237466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119237466<\/a><br>You seem to not understand what this means.<br><br>Yes, while there are those who support Trump, they were not the ones causing what was trending to trend.<br><br>For example, one of the experts during the Senate panel, some tech guy, was talking about how the botnets were creating fake facebook accounts that looked legit, looked like white people from the midwest\/south who&#039;d make fake comments and create fake trends which would then inspire the real people to go &quot;see, I&#039;m right look at that other guy, he says what I says&quot;, when it was just a botnet.<br><br>Our democratic election process was shown to have a massive flaw by the very power that stands against it.","time":1491162734,"resto":119230222,"id":"N3sYB7Mm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119237849,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:52:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119237157\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119237157<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In a normal, non-Vlad influenced, American election<\/span><br><br>1.

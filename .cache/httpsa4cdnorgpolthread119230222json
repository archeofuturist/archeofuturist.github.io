Us educated liberals, who, you know, actually read and understand the news, know that the dossier is real, and evidence continues to leak out with each passing week. It gives me a hard on watching it all come tumbling down for Trump and watching his moronic rural supporters scramble to defend him with their &quot;FAKE NEWS&quot; chants. It actually turned out well that Hillary lost, cause once this shitshow is ever the country will turn irreversibly blue, and we can get a real leftist in the white house instead of Hillary who was, admittedly, a centrist.","time":1491162682,"resto":119230222,"id":"ZGi+RSKZ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119237735,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:51:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119233858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119233858<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bt<wbr>2ajlWyPW0<\/span>","filename":"1475106731237","ext":".gif","w":320,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491162690299,"time":1491162690,"md5":"M\/2rzXaj6fzXo1A8xSnuDQ==","fsize":1659348,"resto":119230222,"id":"Am7XfUaD","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119237782,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:51:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119233020\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119233020<\/a><br>is that a dick?","time":1491162714,"resto":119230222,"id":"WTs3z0RI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119237789,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:51:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119234412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119234412<\/a><br>nobody is going to go to war against Russia for Drumpf","time":1491162718,"resto":119230222,"id":"45eCgZZ+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119237811,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:52:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119237668\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119237668<\/a><br><br>check this thread<br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119236720#p119236720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119236720<\/a>","time":1491162731,"resto":119230222,"id":"+cPo2iGu","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119237818,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:52:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119237466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119237466<\/a><br>You seem to not understand what this means.<br><br>Yes, while there are those who support Trump, they were not the ones causing what was trending to trend.<br><br>For example, one of the experts during the Senate panel, some tech guy, was talking about how the botnets were creating fake facebook accounts that looked legit, looked like white people from the midwest\/south who&#039;d make fake comments and create fake trends which would then inspire the real people to go &quot;see, I&#039;m right look at that other guy, he says what I says&quot;, when it was just a botnet.<br><br>Our democratic election process was shown to have a massive flaw by the very power that stands against it.","time":1491162734,"resto":119230222,"id":"N3sYB7Mm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119237849,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:52:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119237157\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119237157<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In a normal, non-Vlad influenced, American election<\/span><br><br>1.

A lot of Americans are tired of career politicians, like Hillary and Obama, who just fuck everything up while lining their pockets. Hillary and Bill should be in jail for what they did to Haiti - but you conveniently ignore issues like that, because god for fucking bid you admit Hillary lost in a fair contest.

Klebb is assigned under SMERSH leader, General Grubozaboyschikov. She may have defected from SMERSH and been reassigned under the SPECTRE program, which will be issuing directions directly to the Democrats. Klebb has a reputation as a gifted disguise artist, she frequently uses doubles, and her most easily recognizable feature will be the poison-tipped dagger-point shoes she has used throughout her tenure with KGB. Attached picture is old. She is the mastermind behind all this. Terminate Klebb and this Russian fiasco will be finished.

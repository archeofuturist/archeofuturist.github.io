He apologized for almost everything going. These apologies are meaningless, as some of the groups that they were targeted on had the courage to say. It\u2019s just temporizing sympathy. In my philosophy sympathy multiplies misery. And if somebody\u2019s in pain in front of you, you give them some options.

There\u2019s a hierarchy between groups of individuals. Inequality is what right-wing ideas really mean. Right-wing ideas aren\u2019t just a bit of flag-waving and baiting a few Muslims. Right-wing ideas are spiritually about inequality. The left loves equality. It believes we\u2019re all the same. We must be treated the same. And they believe that as a morality.

It\u2019s still alive in junk films, in comic books, in forms that culturally elitist society and intellectuals disprivilege. Why is the heroic treated at that level? Because liberalism can\u2019t deal with the heroic. It doesn\u2019t have a space for it in its ideology, so it decants it. Nothing can be destroyed. Liberals think that they\u2019ve destroyed the ideas in this room, but they haven\u2019t: they\u2019ve just displaced them into other areas.

In every film, in every television program, in every comic, in every simple novel, in everything that the masses consume that isn\u2019t purely about sex or sport, the heroic is there. And they always fight for liberal causes, and their enemies are always grinning Japanese generals, or Nazis. Used again, and again, and again, as a stereotype, of a stereotype, of a stereotype, to impose the idea that that which is core, primal, Indo-European, is morally wrong.<\/span>","time":1491933586,"resto":120625912,"id":"KIRN\/QII","country":"GB","trip":"!!nIHFObhTBdm","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120629202,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:00:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120628953\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120628953<\/a><br>Socialists\/Communists\/Marxists are atheists.

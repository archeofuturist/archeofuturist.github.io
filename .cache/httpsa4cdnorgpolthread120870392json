I&#039;ve been skeptical about that whole thing since the first Tomahawks hit.<br><br>Pic related is Shayrat airfield, the target of the US Tomahawk missiles. You&#039;ll notice that despite damage to the hardened aircraft hangars, and a lot of smoke drifting in the frame, there&#039;s no damage to the runway or taxiways at all. Zero. In fact, flight operations from the base have already resumed.<br><br>According to US reports, 58 of the 59 Tomahawks fired &quot;severely degraded or destroyed&quot; their targets and about 20 Syrian strike aircraft were destroyed. <br><br>However, Russia&#039;s defense ministry said in a more recent statement that only 23 US missiles made it to the airbase, and it doesn&#039;t know where the other 36 went.<br><br>Obviously both the US and Russian defense agencies are prone to grandiose statements of success\/downplaying their losses depending on what foot the shoe is on, so take these numbers with a grain of salt. Let&#039;s safely assume that the actual number is somewhere between these.<br><br>The number of Syrian aircraft lost is also in the air; as noted the US claimed 20, but Russia says just six old MiG-23s were destroyed. Other sources suggest anywhere from nine to fifteen. All of the planes were alleged to have been out of action at the time- they were junk anyway.<br><br>Only seven to nine Syrian soldiers were killed in this allegedly gigantic strike- and one general too, just for good measure- which seems way too low for such a large strike.<br><br>Conclusion: I believe Trump targeted old washed up Syrian aircraft due for the dumpster anyway and had half the missiles hit some out of the way dirt pile on purpose. The entire strike was a fake response to a fake crisis- the false flag chemical attack.","filename":"shayrat","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492059844085,"time":1492059844,"md5":"ABe6XlW2ykNFWqr3lV8FDQ==","fsize":98076,"resto":0,"id":"ZYxd0mAY","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"does-anyone-else-think-the-syria-strike-was","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

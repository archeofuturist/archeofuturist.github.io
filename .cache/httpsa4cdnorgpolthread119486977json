Why don&#039;t you get a sail boat or something? Why don&#039;t you learn a skill (woodworking, blacksmith, automotive)? Why don&#039;t you go to your ghettos and rob and beat drug dealers? Why don&#039;t you start a youtube channel where you keep us informed of what&#039;s going on in Denmark? Why don&#039;t you train for some challenge (Iron man or else)? Why don&#039;t you just grab bag and travel the world? Why don&#039;t you write a book or a website about this? We have so much info on this site about what is what, why don&#039;t you research, get sources, make these infographics more credible. <br><br>There&#039;s so much you could do.","time":1491324657,"resto":119486977,"id":"7Ao1WCOb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119488228,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)12:51:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119486977\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119486977<\/a><br>The love for my friends, my morbid fascination with the collapse of global civilization.","filename":"KEK Undivided","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":320,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491324698307,"time":1491324698,"md5":"3giokBDvHrOTc7DBd0fX2g==","fsize":27088,"resto":119486977,"id":"UsTSnIwo","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":119488544,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)12:54:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119486977\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119486977<\/a><br>same here<br>i always wish ww3 would break out","time":1491324871,"resto":119486977,"id":"8sidAzbG","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":119489983,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)13:09:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119487193\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119487193<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119486977\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119486977<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bored<\/span><br><br>Shit sucks bro, boredom grows like a cancer until it becomes depression. <br><br>But you haven&#039;t tried &quot;most stuff&quot; because there is so much stuff to try that you couldn&#039;t try half of it in 1,000,000 lifetimes. Have you tried cannibalism? LSD? Anal sex with animals? The possibilities are endless. <br><br>Get out of your comfort zone. Talk to actual people. Travel. Take up a new hobby. Learn to play an instrument. Study programming, literature, math, physics, or just grab some heavy shit and start reading it - like, actual books, not shitposts and memes. <br><br>What worked for me was that I forced myself to eat healthy and get up earlier for like a month - that shit worked wonders. I was happier and more driven, and after a few weeks it didn&#039;t feel like a chore anymore because the brain finally made the connection between eating like shit and feeling like shit, and all of the sudden vegetables were delicious. I actually wanted to exercise, which blew my fucking mind. Healthy body leads to healthy mind.","time":1491325761,"resto":119486977,"id":"nUvXQjeg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119491090,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)13:20:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119488544\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119488544<\/a><br>You&#039;d think you would have learned your lesson from last time","time":1491326421,"resto":119486977,"id":"nUvXQjeg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

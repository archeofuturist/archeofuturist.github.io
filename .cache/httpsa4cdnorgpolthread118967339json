People are thanking him. I\u2019m trying not to vomit or yell about Mosul.&quot;<br><br>http:\/\/insider.foxnews.com\/2017\/03\/<wbr>29\/drexel-professor-tried-not-vomit<wbr>-veteran-gave-seat-soldier-george-c<wbr>iccariello-maher<br><br>This guy is only the tip of the iceberg. There are many more professors at Drexel who are actively promoting anti-American, anti-Armed Forces, and anti-Veteran views among students. <br><br>I&#039;ve been spat on and have had dog shit thrown at me by masked students (we&#039;re pretty sure most of them are members of the socialist student union, african-american student union, and latinx student union or whatever they call themselves now). Anti-Veteran attacks are becoming increasingly more common on campus. <br><br>What really bothers me is that my school is refusing to fire him and\/or discipline him and others like him. Me and 5 other Veteran students have repeatedly reached out to school officials and they keep using the same old &quot;those are just his opinions, not the school&#039;s&quot; excuse. We&#039;ve also reached out to our local congressman to no avail.<br><br>I have no idea what else we can do at this point. I can&#039;t afford to switch schools again, I have an awesome internship and other great things going for me near the school. <br><br>Any ideas? <br><br>Also I composed this image myself. Please share it with anyone you know who&#039;s thinking about attending Drexel, especially if they&#039;re veterans.","filename":"Drexel","ext":".png","w":1338,"h":1873,"tn_w":178,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490907345167,"time":1490907345,"md5":"xdjKzA1pbqlLFfbJFR9dlw==","fsize":1196775,"resto":0,"id":"kUEIcW7X","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"drexel-university","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":2,"unique_ips":16},{"no":118968343,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:03:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Any ideas?<\/span><br>Put those skills you learned at your old job to good use :^)","time":1490907811,"resto":118967339,"id":"goucACf7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118969816,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:15:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Isn&#039;t that the faggot that was making anti white sentiments on his Twitter","time":1490908534,"resto":118967339,"id":"7ye2vrFe","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118970208,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:18:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118967339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118967339<\/a><br>Why would you go to a university that hates you?

This was a statement from Russia about two hours before the US strike on Assad. This tells me that the United States took Military action because we are seeing Russian support for the regime starting to sway. <br><br>By attacking Assad, we have sent a big message to Russia. One, being we are unpredictable and can act with Military action at any moment and Trump is not to be underestimated. Two, drop support for Assad now and support regime change.<br><br>So it all comes down to how Russia will respond. We have backed them into a corner. Will they forgo support of Assad for closer relations to America in hopes we will relieve sanctions on the Russian economy? Or will Russia continues it&#039;s hopeless efforts and continue to harm their already shitty economy.<br><br>Trump just checked Putin. Fucking 99D chess master .

Russians only respect these kinds of actions... They&#039;ve done that and more since 2008, with the invasion of Georgia, the annexation of Crimea and so on.<br><br>It&#039;s advanced saber rattling. While the intention may not be an escalation to occur from this, the Russians may be obliged to stand firm with their allies to avoid looking weak... Standing down would negatively impact their credibility to their allies.<br><br>It&#039;s irresponsible, it&#039;s bold, it&#039;s dangerous... We will see how it goes.<br><br>The gas attacks were obviously faked by Islamists, but I believe Trump doesn&#039;t really care.<br><br>In order to form a lasting peace with the Russians, America has to bargain from a position of strength. <br><br>Obama tried to talk nicely with Russia and it didn&#039;t work...

The theory of.Reganomics was that lower taxes on the upper income bracket will result in more investment and growth in the.economy.and.that such.growth will result in increased taxable revenue so that the net effect is an increase in tax revenue to fund government. Unfortunately, investment and income growth followed traditional cycles and the tax cuts resulted in budget deficits that turned the US from the largest creditor country to the largest debtor nation. Rather than spurring unprecedented growth, the tax cuts resulted in the creation of staggering deficits which have been a drag on the economy.","time":1491267190,"resto":119392108,"id":"M3JZlcEn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119407442,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:53:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119398484\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119398484<\/a><br>IT FUCKING<br>TRICKLES<br>DOWN<br>WHAT DON&#039;T YOU GET","time":1491267234,"resto":119392108,"id":"EsAQ7TZm","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119407456,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:54:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119407174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119407174<\/a><br><br>That sounds a lot like Georgism, which I haven&#039;t read enough about to render a judgement on.","time":1491267240,"resto":119392108,"id":"YqvmefZT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119407556,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:55:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119392108\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119392108<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;70% or higher<\/span><br><br>Go back to salon.com faggot.","time":1491267300,"resto":119392108,"id":"cD2JLsHe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119407669,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:56:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119392108\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119392108<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;apex is at 76%<\/span><br>Source?","time":1491267363,"resto":119392108,"id":"8ej6d2l3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119407709,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:56:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119407110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119407110<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;government does anything&quot; = Communism!<\/span>","filename":"StrawMan2","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":450,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491267383166,"time":1491267383,"md5":"ZMCdv8hTuOmCG34KSQtsYw==","fsize":92691,"resto":119392108,"id":"LQZ1tvdM","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":119407723,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:56:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119407442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119407442<\/a><br><br>Wealth always trickles up, never down.","filename":"warren-buffett-the-rich-are-always-going-to-say-that-you-know-just-give-us-more-money-and-well-go-out-and-spend-more-and-then-it-will-all-trickle-down-to-the-rest-of-you-but-that-has-no","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491267391386,"time":1491267391,"md5":"IXTKJbiN9qPtKxMtBTcEiw==","fsize":53111,"resto":119392108,"id":"YqvmefZT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119407744,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:56:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119399551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119399551<\/a><br>Inflation doesn&#039;t affect at the same time at everybody, the last one who touches the new printed money is the one that suffers the most.

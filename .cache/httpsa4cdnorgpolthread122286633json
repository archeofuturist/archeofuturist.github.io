Collectivist minded and servile society with no regard to human life. They don&#039;t care about their personal wealth, freedom etc as long as Mother Russia and the Tsar is fine. They lack empathy, incapable of establishing a friendly relations on equal terms. Apart from Moscow and St Petersburg and some oil regions Russia is extremely poor and undeveloped - as the Russians are incapable of producing anything sophisticated almost the entire wealth of the country comes from it&#039;s natural resources. Except for the art and architecture directly derived either from the Greeks(all the Orthodox architecture they have horribly bastardized, icons) or Westerners(these fancy palaces in St. Petersburg) they barely have contributed to the culture at all. Considering a very large population their scientific contribution is utterly underwhelming, vastly inferior compared to the Western Slavs. Entire society is subjected to brainwashing propaganda blaming the Americans for everything, making them praise their Tsar Putin and support all the vicious acts of violence and terror. They can&#039;t even into geopolitics - Russia still pretends it&#039;s 19th century and the best way for the state to succeed is to be egoistic, xenophobic, expansive, imperialistic, overly-nationalistic and authoritarian. Russia is the true cancer of humanity and I sincerely hope it breaks apart as soon as possible.","filename":"Patton-with-quote","ext":".jpg","w":490,"h":598,"tn_w":204,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492873931761,"time":1492873931,"md5":"XJRwJkTj0aOax49LJOUQsw==","fsize":133237,"resto":0,"id":"Ek93lOLb","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"discuss-russia","country_name":"Poland","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122286908,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:14:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"19th century was pretty neat though","time":1492874095,"resto":122286633,"id":"VMiVsit5","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"}]}

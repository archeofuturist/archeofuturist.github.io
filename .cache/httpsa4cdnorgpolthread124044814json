Cooking, cleaning, decorating - basically creating a safe and secure environment (nest) for her children to be raised in, where their health can be fostered. This will lead to the happiness and security of the entire family. A place everyone can come to at the end of the day with a stoked fire and a warm cup of tea and some food. A woman is meant to create a foundation on which the man and children can thrive. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Without men leading and women following suit there can be no renaissance. White people will fade away never to be seen again, if the women are not submissive. Women must humble themselves and let men lead. YOU ARE NOT SHIELD BEARERS - you are wives and mothers. You are to unburden your man from menial and trivial responsibilities so he can go out and do great things. Not ask him to do the dishes. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The rebellious and stubborn spirit of even right leaning women while admirable, is totally misguided. THE MAN IS THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY.

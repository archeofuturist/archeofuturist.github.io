This isn&#039;t entirely due to Russia having better engineers: it&#039;s simply a function of the two nations having established their current programs at different times.

Putin is not a commie. That shit might work on your third world population but not here, Mikheil. Putin is a moderate nationalist. Careful when you pray for his demise, because it&#039;s highly unlikely he&#039;ll be replaced by a liberal and, then again, Navalny is hardly an open borders guy.<br>One thing you and I should be able to agree on is that if a major conflict does break out, your country will resemble a newly plowed field in a matter of hours. That&#039;s the reality, even if Russia were to go on to lose said conflict. You&#039;re in a bad spot with little means of defense. <br>So keep on stirring the west up to come to your rescue. The west doesn&#039;t give a fuck about your people, but will gladly take your resources if it stands victorious at the end of any conflict. At the end of the day, there isn&#039;t a single military planner in the west who sees Georgia as strategically important enough to defend. There is no scenario in which Georgia comes out a winner.

The Durandal requires jet delivery, but the Tomahawk can be fitted with cluster munitions for the job. The problem with runway strikes is that they&#039;re fairly quick to repair. Large holes like those left by the Durandal are surprisingly easy to repair whereas cluster munitions are better as repairing all the dozens of small holes takes longer, and more importantly not all of them are set to go off on impact, so those along with the dud rate mean that EOD has to be called in which takes significantly longer for the runway to be useful again.","time":1491834563,"resto":120426740,"id":"Jby\/4Pvg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120443229,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)10:29:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120443164\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120443164<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Putin is a moderate nationalist<\/span><br><br>hahahahaha","time":1491834582,"resto":120426740,"id":"Y\/C0Db6P","country":"GE","country_name":"Georgia"}]}

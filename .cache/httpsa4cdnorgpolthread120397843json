PAUL R. EHRLICH (his wife Anne is a member of the Club of Rome), THE GLOBAL 2000 REPORT TO THE PRESIDENT, and THE LIMITS TO GROWTH, A REPORT FOR THE CLUB OF ROME&#039;S PROJECT ON THE PREDICAMENT OF MANKIND. In April 1968 the study began publicly in the Academia dei Lincei in Rome, Italy. The study had been ongoing in secret ever since the initial findings of the Huntsville meeting of 1957. They met at the instigation of Dr. Aurelio Peccei. The first real public indication of their findings and the solution that had been decided upon was publication of the book The Population Bomb in May 1968. Notice how close the dates are. On page 17 of The Population Bomb, a telling paragraph reveals all there is to know. &quot;In summary, the world&#039;s population will continue to grow as long as the birth rate exceeds the death rate; it&#039;s as simple as that. When it stops growing or starts to shrink, it will mean that either the birth rate has gone down the death rate has gone up or a combination of the two. Basically, then, there are only two kinds of solutions to the population problem. One is a &#039;birth rate solution,&#039; in which we find ways to lower the birth rate. The other is a &#039;death rate solution,&#039; in which ways to raise the death rate war, famine, pestilence find us. The problem could have been avoided by population control, in which mankind consciously adjusted the birth rate so that a &#039;death rate solution&#039; did not have to occur.&quot;","time":1491808081,"resto":120397843,"id":"xcAfRmga","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120407622,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)03:08:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"Alright I&#039;m spooked.

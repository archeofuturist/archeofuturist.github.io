I am a normal person that makes brief eye contact with everyone I see just to acknowledge them, and nobody but blacks ever has a problem with it. Whites, Asians, Latinos, etc just react like normal people. Blacks on the other hand will start chimping out and acting like you just threatened them. I&#039;ve come close to having a fist fight multiple times when I locked eyes with a random young black male for even a moment and they start screaming at me. At the very least they&#039;ll start mean-mugging and refusing to drop eye contact. Is it some kind of primal thing? Extreme insecurity? I am genuinely curious what you folks think about this phenomenon.","filename":"1491202954000","ext":".jpg","w":599,"h":827,"tn_w":181,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492204918072,"time":1492204918,"md5":"Lv4+e\/iYD5EboOCQQMQs7g==","fsize":129918,"resto":0,"id":"ToHy+xmb","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-is-it-with-blacks-and-eye-contact","country_name":"United States","replies":95,"images":13,"unique_ips":74},{"no":121115973,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)17:23:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121115724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121115724<\/a><br>yes.","filename":"d3f3c2798cafcd75e0e72e6c197cf623","ext":".jpg","w":236,"h":352,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492205028712,"time":1492205028,"md5":"MgJqX0vHjoNTN2+uyfBiCQ==","fsize":17785,"resto":121115724,"id":"CZ1UUnG9","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":121116131,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)17:25:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"this has been my experience as well, not just with niggers but also mexicans seem to do this.","time":1492205105,"resto":121115724,"id":"QNsskDsR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121116381,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)17:26:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Lmao.

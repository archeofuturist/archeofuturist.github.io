The character appears in several incarnations over the course of the games, and also features in other Nintendo media, including its merchandising, comic books, and a cartoon series. He is one of Nintendo&#039;s main icons as well as one of the most well-known and popular characters in video game history. Shigeru Miyamoto, his creator, gave his full name as Link Link.[2]<br>Through The Legend of Zelda series, Link is depicted as a child, teenager, or young adult of the Hylian race, originating from the fictional land of Hyrule. Link often travels through Hyrule, defeating creatures, evil forces, and the series&#039; primary antagonist, Ganon, while attempting to save Princess Zelda and Hyrule. To defeat Ganon, Link usually requires the mystic Master Sword and Light Arrows, or a similar legendary weapon, obtained after many trials and battles. In the course of his journey he will typically acquire various other magical objects or items, including musical instruments and weaponry.<br>Link has also made several cameo appearances in a few Mario games. He is a playable character via DLC in the newest installment to the Mario Kart series of games, Mario Kart 8. (He is available without a download in Mario Kart 8 Deluxe.) He is also a playable character in the Super Smash Bros. series, being one of the eight original starting characters.","time":1491514375,"resto":119796387,"id":"M0v9n2mA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119798407,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:32:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119798077\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119798077<\/a><br>We zoolander nao","time":1491514377,"resto":119796387,"id":"5FtfRggC","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119798594,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:34:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119796387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119796387<\/a><br>everyone who thinks war with Syria and Russia is now a shill according to the r the Donald 16 year olds and this some how surprises you ?","filename":",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,","ext":".jpg","w":463,"h":500,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491514460679,"time":1491514460,"md5":"wnlJY3Ph30lSns9Zgfj8mw==","fsize":56060,"resto":119796387,"id":"D0cdIg0T","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119798663,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:34:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119796387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119796387<\/a>","filename":"IMG_1458","ext":".jpg","w":417,"h":659,"tn_w":79,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491514490077,"time":1491514490,"md5":"O6veOzGbpJi4VhSTQ+HLJA==","fsize":132992,"resto":119796387,"id":"5FtfRggC","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119798708,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:35:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;not (you)<\/span>","time":1491514510,"resto":119796387,"id":"SauGfere","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119798843,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:36:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119796387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119796387<\/a><br>where&#039;s the (you) accessory?","time":1491514566,"resto":119796387,"id":"TqjoAe1i","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119798860,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:36:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119796387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119796387<\/a><br>There is no threat.

Last Friday, I took two hits of some good LSD. So I smoked a bunch of weed and tripped out as the sun set. Once it was dark I proceeded to watch Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, then watched some old live Jimi Hendrix videos. Total hippy moment. When I woke up the next day though, I still loved my guns, still glad we&#039;re overseen by the Trumpster, and still love my 2-stroke motors. How did I become this red pilled guys? and how do we successfully red pill others this hard?","filename":"fear-and-loathing","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493048500153,"time":1493048500,"md5":"WgivwfmjPSarlzEEJrqfDg==","fsize":554178,"resto":0,"id":"q4z55ok2","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-dont-know-how-i-did-it-but-through-an","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122599273,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)11:43:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"Pol raised you right faggot :&#039;)","time":1493048637,"resto":122599056,"id":"EjlLtsdC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

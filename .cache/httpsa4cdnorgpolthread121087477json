The two psychological tendencies that underlie modern leftism we call \u201cfeelings of inferiority\u201d and \u201coversocialization.\u201d Feelings of inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole, while oversocialization is characteristic only of a certain segment of modern leftism; but this segment is highly influential.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;24. Psychologists use the term \u201csocialization\u201d to designate the process by which children are trained to think and act as society demands. A person is said to be well socialized if he believes in and obeys the moral code of his society and fits in well as a functioning part of that society. It may seem senseless to say that many leftists are oversocialized, since the leftist is perceived as a rebel. Nevertheless, the position can be defended. Many leftists are not such rebels as they seem.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;25. The moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can think, feel and act in a completely moral way. For example, we are not supposed to hate anyone, yet almost everyone hates somebody at some time or other, whether he admits it to himself or not. Some people are so highly socialized that the attempt to think, feel and act morally imposes a severe burden on them. In order to avoid feelings of guilt, they continually have to deceive themselves about their own motives and find moral explanations for feelings and actions that in reality have a non-moral origin. We use the term \u201coversocialized\u201d to describe such people. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The leftist of the oversocialized type tries to get off his psychological leash and assert his autonomy by rebelling. But usually he is not strong enough to rebel against the most basic values of society. Generally speaking, the goals of today\u2019s leftists are NOT in conflict with the accepted morality. On the contrary, the left takes an accepted moral principle, adopts it as its own, and then accuses mainstream society of violating that principle<\/span>","filename":"1442239002099","ext":".jpg","w":403,"h":562,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492192809848,"time":1492192809,"md5":"FXWu5h6XMapQiIuc\/q3SzA==","fsize":73729,"resto":121087477,"id":"ZpesmOHb","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121090537,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:00:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121089346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121089346<\/a><br>got a source anon?<br>I can&#039;t seem to find one","time":1492192850,"resto":121087477,"id":"H5YijXYS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121090579,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:01:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121088155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121088155<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;religious morals in politics is a right wing trend, not left wing<\/span><br>this. \/thread<br><a href=\"#p121089095\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121089095<\/a><br>nah. your just an idiot","time":1492192875,"resto":121087477,"id":"M73WRP3v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121090581,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:01:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121087477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121087477<\/a><br>???","time":1492192875,"resto":121087477,"id":"B4zOytjM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121090664,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:01:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121089849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121089849<\/a><br><br>But morality is a concept that comes from religion.

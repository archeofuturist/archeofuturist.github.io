Promoting one genocide over another - when all the major groups seemed to be partaking - doesn&#039;t make sense at all. That said, I&#039;m on the side of the 6 million number being vastly exaggerated, While Stalin&#039;s numbers seem to be fairly accurate or under stated. Stalin was the real Hitler of WWII.","time":1493057352,"resto":122606770,"id":"MNAEIZqj","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122616740,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)14:11:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122608489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122608489<\/a><br>Dont forget the masturbation machines","filename":"1493026313582","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":719,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493057513060,"time":1493057513,"md5":"NwfEABm6cv3VvYA1uqzjgg==","fsize":140433,"resto":122606770,"id":"PCpXWuVm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122616932,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)14:13:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Assuming that Hitler started gassing Jews since day 1, that makes for 3,153,600 minutes.<br><br>6,000,000 Jews killed during 3,153,600 minutes comes out to 1.9 Jews per minute. That means Hitler killed roughly 1 Jew every 30 seconds. (LOL)<br><br>In Auschwitz, the most famous and biggest concentration camp, there are 15 crematoriums. According to Auschwitz survivors, Jews would go into the chamber, gassed for 15-20 minutes, then put into the oven.<br><br>It takes 1 hour to cremate a body using modern furnaces which operate at much higher temperatures than the traditional ovens at the camp. However, lets say that the ovens were operating at a level that we see today, that means it would take 1 hour, 20 minutes to gas and burn 15 Jews assuming they were all burned simultaniously. (Disregarding the time it would take for the gas to empty the chamber for the bodies to be transported from the chamber to the oven.) The elevators used to transport bodies were very slow and could only take up 7 bodies at a time with their weight capacity. However, for our greatest ally, we&#039;re going to assume that bodies were teleported instantly from chamber to oven.<br><br>That means 15 Jews were gassed and burned every 1.2 hours. That comes out to exactly 300 Jews every 24 hours (Assuming the gassing and burning of Jews was happening every hour straight for 6 years on an uninterrupted basis) the total # of killed jews would be 657,000 for those 6 years.

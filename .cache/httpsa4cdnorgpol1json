They were opponents of King Roderic and betrayed the kind at the battle, ultimately leading to his death. These traitors, called Witizans, then proceeded to effectively exterminate the surviving supporters of Roderic throughout the Regnum Visigothorum.<br><br>The Witizans then initially cooperated with the Moors before converting to Islam in large number. In return, they were granted thousands of estates and many were placed in administrative positions as reward for their treachery. We can assume that over the years, most were absorbed into the broader Moorish population and, as such, were eventually expelled as the Reconquista continued to push south.<br><br>The reason Portugal and Galicia have a comparatively high % of U106 is because these regions were settled by the Suebi. The Suebi, unlike the Visigoths, appear to have had a rather stable kingdom. This area was retaken rather quickly by the Christian principalities and therefore weren&#039;t subjected to the same amount of conquest, depopulation, repopulation, and mass migration that shook up the demographics of other parts of Iberia.","time":1492055629,"resto":120862045,"id":"oNiZOL9V","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120863131,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:55:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Haplogroups<\/span><br>You do realize it only tells you about who was your oldest male ancestor right?","time":1492055723,"resto":120862045,"id":"cgD4hq24","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":120863418,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:58:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120862045\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120862045<\/a><br>So tired of muh germanic","time":1492055900,"resto":120862045,"id":"PG2CEdfK","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120863569,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:59:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120863131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120863131<\/a><br>For Y-DNA, yes.

European aristocracy were generally the same ethnicity as the people they ruled over for the most part up until the 17th century when noble families began to gain control of lands well outside their country and the relatives of monarchs married each other more often instead of marrying local aristocracy. <br><br>Beyond that aristocracy weren&#039;t bred to rule, they were bred for political alliances or on some very rare occasions out of actual romantic interest. There is a reason monarchs are so hit and miss, King Richard I was an idiot who drove England into debt in pointless wars that failed to even accomplish their goals, John II was a weak king, Henry II and Edward I were both competent but Edward II was as weak as John. While this was going on the aristocracy was in near constant revolt in order to increase their own political power and authority relative to the king.","time":1492055814,"resto":120858394,"id":"KL3OHZTX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120863386,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:58:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120863074\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120863074<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;true centrism is power<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;keeping all these morons<\/span><br><br>Ironically you just participated in the same D&amp;C kikery you were making fun of everyone else of for.

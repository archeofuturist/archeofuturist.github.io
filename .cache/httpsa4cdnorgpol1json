He immediately launched one of the most ambitious programmes for social and economic change ever attempted on the African continent. To symbolize this new autonomy and rebirth, he renamed the country from the French colonial Upper Volta to Burkina Faso (&quot;Land of Upright Man&quot;). His foreign policies were centered on anti-imperialism, with his government eschewing all foreign aid, pushing for odious debt reduction, nationalizing all land and mineral wealth, and averting the power and influence of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. His domestic policies were focused on preventing famine with agrarian self-sufficiency and land reform, prioritizing education with a nationwide literacy campaign, and promoting public health by vaccinating 2.5 million children against meningitis, yellow fever, and measles.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sankara was assasinated in 1987, his body was dismembered and he was quickly buried in an unmarked grave, while his widow Mariam and two children fled the nation. Blaise Compaor\u00e9, the coup perpetrator, immediately reversed the nationalizations, overturned nearly all of Sankara&#039;s policies, rejoined the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to bring in &quot;desperately needed&quot; funds to restore the \u201cshattered\u201d economy, and ultimately spurned most of Sankara&#039;s legacy. Compaor\u00e9&#039;s dictatorship remained in power for 27 years, until it was overthrown by popular protests in 2014.<\/span>","filename":"1492082031471","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":800,"tn_w":198,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492162349919,"time":1492162349,"md5":"9CfPAz7ZLl4NAm4Nebgjow==","fsize":279686,"resto":0,"id":"V+b0IPHK","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"niggers-getting-btfo","country_name":"United States","replies":30,"images":4,"omitted_posts":25,"omitted_images":2},{"no":121044126,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)06:11:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121043944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121043944<\/a><br>Never.

Over the last 10 years I have had the pleasure of seeing the private parts of many, many people.

Politically, things like this make arguments about gay marriages, insurance funded transition operations and bathroom designations more difficult than they appear.<br><br>That being said, everything SJW&#039;s rant about is concerning 56 genders, fanciful pronouns and otherkin is obviously complete bullshit.

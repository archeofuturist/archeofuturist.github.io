No one who seems radical, no one who seems fiscally irresponsible ever wins. The referendum came back for Leave because with the banking crisis, with the bureaucratic rules, with the refugee crisis, remaining in the EU seemed like a bigger risk than leaving it. The Conservatives could easily lose this election if there was a strong enough opposition party able to now re-cast leaving the EU as a fiscally irresponsible gamble for Britain&#039;s future. Theresa May is saved by the fact Labour and the Liberal Democrats are a fucking shambles right now.","time":1492741675,"resto":122072458,"id":"n839iO+C","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122082485,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)22:28:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122082104\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122082104<\/a><br>No.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For me.<\/span>","filename":"CL0UKQpWsAA3t0q.jpg:large","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":217,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":56,"tim":1492741730393,"time":1492741730,"md5":"Dtng2fTgTC+VKgEFnXHk2w==","fsize":18278,"resto":122072458,"id":"N1JOM\/W0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122082522,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)22:29:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122082388\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122082388<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Atlee 1945<\/span>","time":1492741753,"resto":122072458,"id":"N1JOM\/W0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122082594,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)22:29:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122074178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122074178<\/a><br>Millipede gets brought back out of retirement.

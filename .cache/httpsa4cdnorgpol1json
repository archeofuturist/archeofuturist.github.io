Most people don&#039;t confuse that with love, but that&#039;s the first layer that CAN be confused with love.<br><br>Romantic love is that feeling you feel in your chest, where it&#039;s kind of like your heart is expanding like a balloon and you feel an intense desire for another person. That generally doesn&#039;t last very long, fading after a year or so. <br><br>Then comes love. Love is a feeling of deep conviction about your devotion to another person.It doesn&#039;t have to be strictly platonic, though this is the kind of love most people apply to their parents, siblings, kids, etc. The feeling where you look at someone, and there&#039;s just this resolute feeling of iron somewhere in you that you feel tied to them for life.<br><br>Not being able to make it to the third stage is why so many relationships fail. People want to fuck the girl, that leads them to romantically desire the girl, and then after that it wears off and men and women alike don&#039;t really even comprehend the fact that they were never legitimately in love, consider it to have &quot;worn off&quot;, and then move on, which is the dumb trap most people fall into.<br><br>Of course, unlike the way tumblr cunts believe it to be, you&#039;re not meant to fall into that kind of love for no reason. It&#039;s supposed to come from a deep feeling of mutual respect, an idea that the person you&#039;re with is bound to you either by ties that have become familial, that they&#039;re an extension of yourself, and that nothing you sacrifice for them is truly to your detriment, because they&#039;re an extension of yourself. A lot of women want to believe that that treatment is some kind of right, and that it isn&#039;t a two-way street. That they want a man infinitely devoted to them, but they won&#039;t do the same as they continue sucking up that love while also indulging in romantic love from other people as it wears off.

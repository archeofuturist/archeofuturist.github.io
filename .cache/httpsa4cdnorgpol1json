Compared to the existing knowledge and literature, these modal levels are actually more extensive and more nuanced than previously thought. We have also discovered a great many verbal forms that are now obsolete or have been lost through restructuring \u2014 until now, these forms have barely even been recognized or, at best, have been classified incorrectly.&quot; These verbal forms are crucial to explaining the linguistic history of Albanian and its internal usage. However, they can also shed light on the reciprocal relationship between Albanian and its neighbouring languages. The researchers are following various leads which suggest that Albanian played a key role in the Balkan Sprachbund. For example, it is likely that Albanian is the source of the suffixed definite article in Romanian, Bulgarian and Macedonian, as this has been a feature of Albanian since ancient times&quot;","time":1493819989,"resto":123909264,"id":"Zqw3Amrs","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123889312,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)04:05:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Look at what you did, \/pol\/.

Senator Lee\u2019s plan is to forbid the FCC from even being able to declare internet service providers (ISPs) as Title II common carriers \u2013 essentially negating the Open Internet Order from 2015. Senator Lee also sponsored an identical bill in 2016 during the 114th Congress with the same 8 cosponsors.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Of these 9 Senators, Sen. Cornyn, Sen. Cotton, Sen. Cruz, Sen. Lee, and Sen. Paul were also cosponsors on S.J. Res. 34, legislation that stripped FCC online privacy protections away using the Congressional Review Act. All 9 cosponsors of this bill voted to do away with internet privacy in the 50-48 party line vote to dismantle FCC online privacy rules. Now, the same Senators and the same political forces are gathering to remove the FCC\u2019s ability to protect net neutrality.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Restoring Internet Freedom Act has nothing to do with internet freedom<\/span>","filename":"high_speed_internet_penetration","ext":".jpg","w":919,"h":590,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":160,"tim":1493818205467,"time":1493818205,"md5":"+QhnSvf83yGNG+NqowHzcg==","fsize":102571,"resto":0,"id":"EOsIT\/OJ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sen-cornyn-john-rtx","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1},{"no":123912092,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)09:30:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Remember to tell the FCC that destroying net neutrality is not \u201cRestoring Internet Freedom.\u201d Such an action, whether voted on by the FCC next month or voted on by the US Senate and then House of Representatives, cannot pass. Net neutrality may be a complicated topic, especially for some of the politicians that seem to have zero grasp of how the Internet works. Increasingly, politicians, such as federal judge Brett Kavanaugh, reveal that they don\u2019t know the difference between an ISP and an edge service provider. In a dissenting court opinion about net neutrality, Kavanaugh showcased an utter lack of understanding regarding the Internet, and TechCrunch rightly called him out on it, stating: The conflation of telecommunications provider with edge provider, social media and press outlet is extremely disingenuous.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Misinformation is one of the favorite tools of Internet enemies. Lobbyists representing ISPs have previously tried to claim to the FCC that internet browsing history and app usage data does not constitute \u201csensitive information,\u201d and therefore doesn\u2019t deserve protections. If either the FCC action or the Congressional action against net neutrality passes \u2013 the American internet experience will change \u2013 and likely not for the better. When S. 993 comes to a vote, make sure to take note of which Senators vote which way. It is important to hold politicians accountable for their stances and their actions.<\/span>","time":1493818228,"resto":123912059,"id":"EOsIT\/OJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123914564,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)09:59:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"\/pol\/ will defend this.","filename":"16000","ext":".jpg","w":226,"h":273,"tn_w":103,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493819985297,"time":1493819985,"md5":"UQoknxqvJGMSBkjZNbSAlA==","fsize":15423,"resto":123912059,"id":"EOsIT\/OJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

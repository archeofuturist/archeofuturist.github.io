However, when I wear glasses, I just become another Chinese guy \u2013 and I\u2019ve seen Asian women look at me with such disgust in their eyes \u2013 one of their own sons.<br>Asian people do not accept you unless you speak fluently and change your last name to an Asian one. Expect a lifelong experience of being called \u201cwhite\u201d by Asians, and Asian by whites. The only difference between the two is that Asians don\u2019t say it in a way that is meant to degrade and dehumanize you.<br>When white people find out that your mother is Asian they will nod, \u201cof course.\u201d<br>People will seek to degrade you by bringing up your Chinese or Asian heritage. \u201cYou look Asian when you wear ________.\u201d This is uniformly an insult. <br>Nobody cares at all about your Asian side; they will respond with \u201ccool,\u201d but generally they will seek to humiliate and bring you down with it; when you try to explore other cultures, even your own.

Now, I assume Asian women understand this and try to breed it out, with white men. Or maybe it\u2019s because Asian women truly believe white men are innocent Prince Charmings and don\u2019t care. The only problem with this is that it just reinforces your son\u2019s \u201claughable\u201d low status in society.

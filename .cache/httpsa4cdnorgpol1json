He said there was no provision for gas-tight doors, and the chambers were not properly sealed to prevent leakage. People depositing Zyklon B pellets into vents would themselves fall victim to cyanide poisoning. He said there were no vents to introduce the gas into the chambers or to clear it once the gassing was completed.<br><br>Irving seized upon Leuchter&#039;s report as &quot;shattering in the significance of its discovery&quot;. But it was comprehensively demolished by the defence witness Robert van Pelt, Professor of Architecture[*] at Waterloo University in Canada. Van Pelt pointed out that Leuchter was neither a trained engineer nor forensic scientist. His evidence had been ruled inadmissible in the Zundel trial.<br><br>Leuchter&#039;s claim that there were no gas-tight doors was worthless given the evidence of SS officers who testified to their use. There was also documentary evidence of orders for gasketed doors and ventilation equipment, and Leuchter ignored testimony showing that gas masks were worn by guards administering Zyklon B.<br><br>In his judgment, Mr Justice Gray concluded: &quot;No objective fair-minded historian would have serious cause to doubt that there were gas chambers at Auschwitz.&quot;","time":1490162218,"resto":117712234,"id":"gJ178NkL","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":117727981,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:59:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117727784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117727784<\/a><br>Never heard of Rudolf Germar?","time":1490162348,"resto":117712234,"id":"cvQlOzXz","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117728052,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:59:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117727981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117727981<\/a><br>There was also documentary evidence of orders for gasketed doors and ventilation equipment","time":1490162394,"resto":117712234,"id":"gJ178NkL","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117720631,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)00:38:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"*sips tea*","filename":"pol BTFO","ext":".png","w":487,"h":444,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":227,"tim":1490157513226,"time":1490157513,"md5":"RaqT8fhIaOqO9GRbkEoqFg==","fsize":259313,"resto":0,"id":"YsA09GaN","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sips-tea","country_name":"United States","replies":175,"images":23,"omitted_posts":170,"omitted_images":23,"tail_size":50},{"no":117727688,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:55:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"So democrats believe in no borders...

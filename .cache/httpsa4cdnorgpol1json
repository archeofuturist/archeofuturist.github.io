Atheism is a Jewish plot designed to turn the west into liberal cucks. <br><br>Attached is voting intention by belief. Notice how atheists and Jews are virtually identical. <br><br>If you allow people to think that atheism is acceptable you get moral degradation, communism, identity politics, etc. Things that directly enables Islam. <br><br>You should fight the enemy within with the same vigour that you fight the enemy without. <br><br>You might get faggots replying to this post saying &#039;hurr well I&#039;m a red pilled atheist I voted for Trump&#039;, well how is that any different from Abdul from Syria saying &#039;I&#039;m not like those other muslims, I&#039;m moderate&#039;? Stereotypes exist for a reason, and evidence dictates atheists are social poison.","filename":"IMG_2219","ext":".png","w":2208,"h":1242,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490521484021,"time":1490521484,"md5":"7VRs5RARJOa7cfQMnko6ug==","fsize":444911,"resto":118343455,"id":"RYO9h3\/b","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118344774,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)05:44:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"2008.","time":1490521495,"resto":118343455,"id":"3gAJ3xg3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118341365,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)05:02:24","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/ptg\/ PRESIDENT TRUMP GENERAL - TWELVE SCORE AND ONE YEAR AGO EDITION","com":"PRESIDENT DONALD J TRUMP<br>https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov<br>https:\/\/www.donaldjtrump.com\/<br>DAILY SCHEDULE (WH Press Corps)<br>https:\/\/publicpool.kinja.com\/<br>Trump Playlist<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/X9qQJVKJ<br> <br>APPEARANCES<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump Weekly Address #9 3\/24\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZGt6lkLApuo<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump meets Medal of Honor Recipients 3\/24\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/LWhzEfdjeHg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump statement on Healthcare Law 3\/24\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/7F2pGAhaiSI<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump hosts Greek Independence Day party 3\/24\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/nHC0lNmTfrM<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump meets Charter CEO w\/Gov Abbott 3\/24\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/RNSbOnqAXrw<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump meets Natl Econ council 3\/24\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/ildvB672GDA<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump meets with Truckers 3\/23\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/o9pT5vs6sGY<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump roundtable w\/truckers 3\/23\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/4VSpfqjxvW0<br>PREV APPEARANCES<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/ynXV6CHT<br>NEWTRUMP NIGHTLY NEWS<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/yArfUKdC<br>WH PRESS BRIEFINGS<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/QidpHWKJ<br> <br>FUN STUFF<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TrumpWave S P A C E<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/s1qhafzPkAM<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Story behind MAGA hats<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/Aoro6PA9S6g<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;God Emperor Trump Was Born To Rule<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/pf4RSgb_Pqg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Donald Trump Emperor of America<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/xQCaWLF2gfs<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TrumpBot vs Mexico<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/jNmTBESoJ1A<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shadilay<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZNriNoWOtXA<br> <br>INSPIRATION<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/Nyuv_bPSHBA<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hold Back The Night<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/ldnH5ms50Jc<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Inauguration of Fire<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/XKf8jSiaghU<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;#TrumpTheEstablishement<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/kIsctZlgMqg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;American Hero<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/d-X3BVxySLo<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TRUMP - MAGA<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/PagVeZgHbhk<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump Triumphant<\/span><br>www.dailymotion.com\/video\/x4ulway<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We Are The Silent Majority<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/3lrrPG5iPAk<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;American Comeback Story<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/pm8n9qVIK_8<br> <br>OP pastebin: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/nygxu29R<br>prev <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118337291#p118337291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118337291<\/a>","filename":"1477155886516","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":917,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":191,"tim":1490518944087,"time":1490518944,"md5":"wvPuZu4P8pIgttnyO6HILw==","fsize":209692,"resto":0,"id":"5dOBU8A0","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ptg-president-trump-general-twelve-score-and-one","country_name":"Australia","replies":180,"images":69,"omitted_posts":175,"omitted_images":66,"tail_size":50},{"no":118344734,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)05:44:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118344491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118344491<\/a><br>Huh.

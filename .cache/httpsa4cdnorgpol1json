Fuck you, I slang drinks in a club downtown until I was 23 and could make $230-$500 a night in pure cash with no taxes. It&#039;s all about networking and giving your clients incentives to come see you. Their tipping for the service, for knowing their name and drink when they walk in then having it ready for them before they reach the bar, and for occasionally hooking them up when they bring large groups of people in. They get to look like VIP when you know their name and get drinks while everyone else is waiting 2 mins for me to get to them.<br><br>Restaurants are not retail, it&#039;s service industry. No one tips in retail you fucking nigger.","time":1491965908,"resto":120699725,"id":"hU96vcdr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120703423,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)22:59:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120699725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120699725<\/a><br><br>You must be a nigger or a subhuman.<br><br>Its your role\/job to tip you fucking faggot.<br><br>This is coming from someone that has never worked as a waiter\/waitress but I give them 20% no matter the hour. <br><br>Cuz I can.<br><br>Your not rich and you never will be.","time":1491965989,"resto":120699725,"id":"ip1trjN3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120701295,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)22:42:49","name":"Anonymous","sub":"JuJitsu\/Judo is necessary to be a man","com":"Dear Men of the West,<br><br>You have weakness hiding in your body.

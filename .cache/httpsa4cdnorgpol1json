The crusades may have been able to reclaim Anatolia. Now Christians act as stand-ins for Jewish interests at a global scale, evangelicals require Israel to be populated by the Jews so their doomsday prophecies can be fulfilled. Christians will let their daughters marry a Christian outside their race before a non Christian inside their race, or even a Christian of a different denomination in the same race. Christian churches spend millions sending Christians to Africa so they can build churches and give food to Africans that they might preach a bastardized shamanistic corruption of the Christian religion, and are the primary proponents of mass immigration and reparations. The atheistic attack on Christianity begins and ends at monogamous nuclear families and traditional gender roles, both of which were standard in pagan Europe anyway, with one exception, Germanic and Celtic tribes were noted as refusing to marry outside their racial group. An attitude not seen in Christians who have lost any sense of attachment to their own flesh and blood, seeing it as a worldly struggle. I say they ought to walk themselves off a steep precipice and impale themselves on jagged rocks if they wished to become so close to their god and so far away from our material

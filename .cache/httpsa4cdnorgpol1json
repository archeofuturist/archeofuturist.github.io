It was inevitable they would enjoy a richer culture and access to technologies that boosted their creativity.<br>The Nords lived in the coldest &amp; most inhospitable parts of Europe, with a short growing season &amp; only on the fringes of trade routes. It was the basis for their Viking piracy, that they had to take from others what was not available by other means. Many don&#039;t know it, but Vikings were also traders, they would make deals with many cities where they wanted continued trade due to one commodity or another.<br><br>That the Nords survived their environment at all is a testament to their physical strength and mental ingenuity...the weak did not live long enough to procreate, in the North. And they also engaged in culling themselves in the same fashion as the Spartans...if a child was born crippled, they would leave it in the woods for nature to take back (there were some that had been born to wealthy families who were kept, but it wasn&#039;t the norm).<br><br>As access to the rest of the world increased, the Scandinavians became more &quot;civilized&quot; and did quite well under the new rules.<br>And I think it&#039;s about time the Mediterraneans stop trying to live off their glorious past (for glorious it truly was) and start following the old adage, &quot;what have you done for us lately?&quot;<br><br>Now is not to time to rest on laurels...it is never the time for that.<br>We have the entire rest of the world as our enemies, and Whites are only around 18% of the world population, at most.

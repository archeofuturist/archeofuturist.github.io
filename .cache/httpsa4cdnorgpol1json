They are just as bad at planning for the future as people with really low IQ&#039;s. Besides that, the smarter criminals do crimes which require more intelligence and don&#039;t get caught as often just because of the nature of the crime. <br><br>Most people in general are really bad at planning for the future. If we didn&#039;t have civilization in it&#039;s current form, where people had to get their own food, most people will have starved to death. You probably wouldn&#039;t have anyone with an IQ less than 90 left outside of places like Africa, where you don&#039;t need to plan for the future very much if you&#039;re part of a hunter-gatherer tribe. But you would still have many people with an IQ less than 110. <br><br>If it&#039;s believed that 75% of someone&#039;s IQ is genetic (I believe that the American Anthropological society believes this), and the rest is due to environmental standards. Someone who is in a cultural vacuum, who has 110 in modern culture with all its education systems, will have 78 IQ inherently. In the tribal society, where the person would learn some skills, usually the more practical skills, they would probably get 15-20 IQ points from that, maybe more, depending on what position they would have in a tribe, i.e. Shaman in-training, hunter, chief-in-training, etc. each requiring it&#039;s own skill-set. If one requires more abstract thought than the other, maybe they could get 5-10 more IQ points. If the tribe had some form of writing, he&#039;d probably have his IQ maximized by being literate. In the worst case, his IQ would probably be 90, which is much lower than 110. But, because of the necessity to survive in his environment, he would probably learn how to plan for the future from his tribe. If he&#039;s not capable of applying that knowledge, he would starve to death as he&#039;s expelled from his tribe as a useless person or make a fatal mistake he could&#039;ve avoided. <br><br>There is much more to this than just IQ","time":1490977766,"resto":119050507,"id":"xL9xbo9P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119071397,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)12:29:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119071117\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119071117<\/a><br>sign me up for those mental gymastic classes my dude!","time":1490977772,"resto":119050507,"id":"2A732mVA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119071419,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)12:29:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119070777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119070777<\/a><br>KEK has brought this to our attention with his sacred trip 7s.<br><br>Gentlemen, how do we proceed?","time":1490977781,"resto":119050507,"id":"eJs1kA89","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

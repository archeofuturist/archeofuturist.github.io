Typically, a sausage is formed<br>in a casing traditionally made from<br>intestine, but sometimes from synthetic<br>materials. Sausages that are sold<br>uncooked are usually cooked in many ways,<br>including pan-frying, broiling and<br>barbecuing. Some sausages are cooked<br>during processing and the casing may then be removed.<br><br>Sausage making is a traditional food<br>preservation technique. Sausages may<br>be preserved by curing, drying<br>(often in association with fermentation or<br>culturing, which can contribute to preservation),<br>smoking or freezing.<br>Some cured or smoked sausages can be stored<br>without refrigeration. Most<br>fresh sausages must be refrigerated or<br>frozen until they are cooked.<br><br>There is a huge range of national and<br>regional varieties of sausages,<br>which differ by their flavouring or<br>spicing ingredients (garlic, peppers, wine, etc.),<br>the meat(s) used in them and their<br>manner of preparation.<br><br><br>Etymology<br><br><br>The word &quot;sausage&quot; was first used in<br>English in the mid-15th century,<br>spelled &quot;sawsyge&quot;. [1]This word came<br>&quot;...from Old North French saussiche<br>(Modern French saucisse)&quot;. [2]The<br>French word &quot;saussiche&quot; came &quot;...from Vulgar Latin<br>*salsica &quot;sausage,&quot; from salsicus<br>&quot;seasoned with salt,&quot; from Latin salsus [meaning] &quot;salted&quot;.[3]<br><br><br>History<br><br><br>Sausage making is an outcome of<br>efficient butchery. Traditionally, sausage<br>makers would salt various tissues<br>and organs such as scraps, organ<br>meats, blood,<br>and fat to help preserve them.<br>They would then stuff them into<br>tubular casings<br>made from the cleaned intestines<br>of the animal, producing the characteristic<br>cylindrical shape. Hence, sausages,<br>puddings, and salami are among the oldest<br>of prepared foods, whether cooked and<br>eaten immediately or dried to varying degrees.","filename":"1485378251346 (2)","ext":".jpg","w":751,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":99,"tim":1490202877344,"time":1490202877,"md5":"6CeFmakNu16grt0RfP\/DBA==","fsize":176811,"resto":117784265,"id":"nxakSZ3Z","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117784511,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)12:27:22","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Brit\/pol\/ - Terrorist Incident edition","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;London terror attack: Knifeman shot by police outside Parliament after stabbing officer and killing at least one on Westminster Bridge<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/201<wbr>7\/03\/22\/man-shot-police-outside-par<wbr>liament-officer-reportedly-shoots\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Parliament shooting: Woman dies in Westminster attack<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-393559<wbr>40<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;NI Assembly remembers former minister Martin McGuinness<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-northe<wbr>rn-ireland-39342051<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Scottish MSPs to vote on second referendum as Nicola Sturgeon is urged to delay independence <\/span><br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/201<wbr>7\/03\/22\/scottish-msps-vote-second-r<wbr>eferendum-nicola-sturgeon-urged-del<wbr>ay\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Article 50: Theresa May to trigger Brexit process next Wednesday<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politi<wbr>cs-39325561<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;EU summit on 29 April to discuss way ahead<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politi<wbr>cs-39337693","filename":"sd","ext":".jpg","w":660,"h":371,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490200042667,"time":1490200042,"md5":"U+CIUZVhpxG9uQRoucGPxw==","fsize":64340,"resto":0,"id":"fcnLu05x","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"britpol-terrorist-incident-edition","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":258,"images":72,"omitted_posts":253,"omitted_images":69,"tail_size":50},{"no":117789641,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)13:14:06","name":"Anonymous","filename":"file","ext":".png","w":1150,"h":902,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":98,"tim":1490202846626,"time":1490202846,"md5":"KK68tcsh1I1jZyaLDd1s5A==","fsize":86835,"resto":117784511,"id":"L+gi\/sw9","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117789650,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)13:14:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117789133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117789133<\/a>","filename":"e","ext":".jpg","w":468,"h":426,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":113,"tim":1490202861524,"time":1490202861,"md5":"iwA8pCI3fylhtXGkDkYz9A==","fsize":34563,"resto":117784511,"id":"514O52Se","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117789685,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)13:14:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117789490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117789490<\/a><br>How can white bois even compete","time":1490202884,"resto":117784511,"id":"b4XxdF4b","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117789691,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)13:14:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"&quot;It was the patriarchy that did it.&quot;","filename":"damn-cis-men","ext":".jpg","w":780,"h":526,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":84,"tim":1490202881209,"time":1490202881,"md5":"V7iyG+1jVk3rGDrzszO4lw==","fsize":75567,"resto":117784511,"id":"xBkBshhP","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117789693,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)13:14:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117789450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117789450<\/a><br>Might be worth a little go lad","filename":"loadsaemoney","ext":".png","w":350,"h":212,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1490202878617,"time":1490202878,"md5":"L6Hs11D1Qg20s5KRAWAMbw==","fsize":92119,"resto":117784511,"id":"DdgGW2WG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117788444,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)13:03:05","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/islam\/ islam general","com":"Welcome to \/Islam\/!

She&#039;s essentially afraid to admit things and face reality. <br><br>Then there&#039;s the edgy kind. The kind with nose piercings, into gothic shit, BDSM, industrial and black metal, you name it. She can handle the bantz, is someone you could have a beer with, and you&#039;d think she has more sanity than others. WRONG! She&#039;s broken. She&#039;s like the rescued prostitute who wants to heal and a couch to recover on, theoretically. She&#039;s sucked black dicks, is into bdsm clubs to swing, and has probably had an abortion. If anyone knows the Icelandic girl stereotype, you&#039;d understand where I was coming from.<br><br>Don&#039;t get me started on Norwegian girls, especially if they come from the northern provinces.

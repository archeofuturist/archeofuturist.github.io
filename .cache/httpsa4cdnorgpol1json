Ironically, this is basically employers applying bayes rule to discriminate, that is, <br><br> This also looks to be callbacks and not offers, so it probably doesn&#039;t translate 1:1 to job offers, especially if they would have found out about the white person&#039;s record. and there are only 2 testers per race, I don&#039;t know, if you have an awkward or ugly or rude black tester that ruins the whole fucking study. Finally, at higher level job markets for managerial and positions that require a college diploma, I&#039;m betting that having a criminal record is far worse than for a high school graduate applying for a fry cook job. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if there was an effect from race, but to say being black has worse opportunities than a white felon is disingenuous and narrow and really doesn&#039;t lead to any real solutions to racial divides.","time":1493433855,"resto":123279211,"id":"U1Gce\/U2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123285393,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)22:44:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123285217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123285217<\/a><br>There have been b8 threads since forever.

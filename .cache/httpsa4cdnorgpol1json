The rest will solidify their hatred.<br><br>\u201cThe conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country.We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society.In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons. - Edward L. Bernays<br><br>&quot;for we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies on covert means for expanding it&#039;s sphere of influence on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conspcripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficent machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations.&quot; -John F. Kennedy<br><br>&quot;It is a small, rootless, international clique that is turning the people against each other, that does not want them to have peace. It is people who are at home both nowhere and everywhere, who do not have a soil where they have grown up, but who live in Berlin today, in Brussels tomorrow, in Paris the day after that, and then again in Prague, Vienna or London, and who feel at home everywhere. They are the only ones who can be addressed as international elements, because they conduct their business everywhere.&quot;-Adolph Hitler","filename":"1491664875391","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":837,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493342496801,"time":1493342496,"md5":"5jdSFD\/gy+zbjtXbzdSKCA==","fsize":187940,"resto":123113969,"id":"zu+OZ8yP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123123775,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)21:27:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s a matter of looking up the Kalergi plan, Barbara Spectre, Ben gurion, Theodore Kaufman, Maurice Samuel, Goldwin Smith, Menachem Begin, Israel Cohen, Ariel Sharon, Golda Meir, Noel Ignatiev, Ilya Ehrenburg, George Soros, Joe Slovo, Rav Touitou, Frans Timmermans, Baruch Efrati, Daniel Cohn-Bendit, Robin Morgan, Susan Sontag, Simeon Ben-Iudah, Abraham Foxman, Unni Wikan, Martin Schulz, Angela(Rebekah Dorothea) Merkel (Kasner), Peter Sutherland, Nicolas Sarkozy, ... it is a very long list of jews stating as plain as day that they want the white race gone.","time":1493342842,"resto":123113969,"id":"gjPiEUcv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123123935,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)21:28:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123122644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123122644<\/a><br>This","time":1493342930,"resto":123113969,"id":"gjPiEUcv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123124070,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)21:29:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123113969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123113969<\/a><br>Ask them what Israel has ever done for us and why should we be supporting them?

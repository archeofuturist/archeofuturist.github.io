If you interbreed a controlled group of individuals with desired traits, the desired traits get stronger but so do their weakness like inheritable diseases. Also if the high IQ society continually shrinks because of low birth rates then they&#039;ll either have to rely on immigration where diversity will happen natural or they will get dominated by a large dumber population via attrition. Using eugenics to try to support the idea of a white master race is fucking retarded.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If you&#039;re arguing that the relation between race and IQ has been debunked, it absolutely hasn&#039;t.<\/span><br>There is but not because of the race of the individual but the environment that they came up in. If you think supremacy is caused by skin color then you are fucking retarded.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;People have created apologist theories that explain away IQ as being a poor measure of innate intelligence, but even these explanations don&#039;t refute the incontrovertible difference in IQ test performance between ethnic groups. They also have the advantage of being difficult to falsify, even if continued research into IQ makes them increasingly implausible.<\/span><br>Not arguing against that. I&#039;m just pointing out that &quot;success&quot; and &quot;desirable traits&quot; has more to do with the environment you&#039;re in not muh genetics.","time":1492596782,"resto":121821796,"id":"O4eCU5Sj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121828664,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)06:14:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121827829\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121827829<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;flag<\/span><br>speaks for itself. kek<br><a href=\"#p121827712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121827712<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Falsifying the claim that there must be some other social factor at work is a tricky business because it&#039;s always possible to take refuge in the amorphous specter of racism. <\/span><br>I don&#039;t agree with people reading the book and just automatically assuming &quot;RACISM&quot; and dismissing it entirely, because it does make good points and has real data.

There&#039;s a second .com bubble chained with large equity movements inside of financing that are boiling down to a very risky game of musical chairs where those that don&#039;t get seats when the music stops get mulched &quot;financially speaking&quot;. <br><br>The only way back to security ia for sustainable debt resolution of some kind to take place, at present the biggest debtor nation is also the biggest goods consumer and runs the dollar as an energy exchange currency (ie oil and natural gas). This will work until the nation&#039;s lending money can&#039;t keep the beast going without going bankrupt themselves, the dollar stops being an energy exchange unit, or and probably more likely the consumer market no longer has the personal capital to consume. One of those three occurrences will trigger a global financial mess that will take a few decades to fix and once the dust settles the same folks may no longer be on top.","time":1492596880,"resto":121805408,"id":"HknO1r0a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121827554,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:57:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"is china the last hope for the world?","filename":"1488699396714","ext":".png","w":1437,"h":909,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":158,"tim":1492595820387,"time":1492595820,"md5":"N6mBmUPz14b2l6yEWrbmZg==","fsize":76721,"resto":0,"id":"vb\/Mdarl","country":"CN","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-china-the-last-hope-for-the-world","country_name":"China","replies":20,"images":4,"omitted_posts":15,"omitted_images":3},{"no":121828432,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)06:11:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121828312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121828312<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Splits boulder in half<\/span><br><br>I see you filthy fucking peasants thought you were people.","time":1492596684,"resto":121827554,"id":"OYM9rsIp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121828439,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)06:11:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121827554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121827554<\/a><br>is this the chinkposting thread?","filename":"1491287708509","ext":".webm","w":400,"h":224,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492596688481,"time":1492596688,"md5":"eIabGC7rp6lKe8fnE31Eeg==","fsize":2971578,"resto":121827554,"id":"Jd3RtSMf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121828497,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)06:12:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"They would be, but a few things get in the way.<br><br>1.

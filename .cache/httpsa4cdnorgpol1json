Intel is pretty good about letting employees move around within the company.

The interview went great and they wanted me on board, but the final step was to get a security clearance.<br><br>I asked them WTF I need a security clearance for, and they said they couldn&#039;t tell me until I was on the team.

I know exactly how it was done because I spent the last three years adding backdoors into the ME. For those of you that are unaware, the ME is on a separate CPU and cannot be disabled, and it exists at a level below the operating system. Intel has been working with the intelligence community for years to get backdoors into physical hardware so they don&#039;t have to worry about finding OS exploits.

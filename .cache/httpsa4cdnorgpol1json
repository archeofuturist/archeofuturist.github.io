When humans have no anxiety and fear, then these creatures starve. People not yet sufficiently convinced of this statement could understand it to be meant comparatively only. But for those who are familiar with this phenomenon, it is a reality. If fear and anxiety radiates from people and they break out in panic, then these creatures find welcome nutrition and they become more and more powerful. These beings are hostile towards humanity.<br><br>Everything that feeds on negative feelings, on anxiety, fear and superstition, despair or doubt, are in reality hostile forces in supersensible worlds, launching cruel attacks on human beings, while they are being fed. Therefore, it is above all necessary to begin with that the person who enters the spiritual world overcomes fear, feelings of helplessness, despair and anxiety. But these are exactly the feelings that belong to contemporary culture and materialism; because it estranges people from the spiritual world, it is especially suited to evoke hopelessness and fear of the unknown in people, thereby calling up the above mentioned hostile forces against them.\u201d<br><br>~ Rudolf Steiner [Source (German): Rudolf Steiner \u2013 Die Erkenntnis der Seele und des Geistes \u2013 Berlin, 1907]","filename":"saturn yes","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493359103598,"time":1493359103,"md5":"OgHgkZ54LBE3GjlZtoYHJw==","fsize":846015,"resto":123131405,"id":"8hBUm5Oe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123156152,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)01:58:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123155512\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123155512<\/a><br>yeah right, french are one of the biggest cucks in europe.<br>but we are gaining more and more red pilled people around here. its just a mater of time.<br><br>THATS WHY LEPEN have to win this sunday.<br>i don&#039;t trust her 100% but she is our only hope now. i was a Asselineau fag before. but this nig only did 1%.","filename":"1e8f3174ceda4d0d80c2f3a49aeb32cc","ext":".jpg","w":283,"h":300,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493359113938,"time":1493359113,"md5":"ui1JuQ\/fC2Ah+qMDW6ZIaQ==","fsize":7730,"resto":123131405,"id":"gOjEl7Ws","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":123156191,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)01:58:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123153593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123153593<\/a><br>I personally find that abstaining for a few days reduces the instance of homicidal fantasies throughout the day","time":1493359137,"resto":123131405,"id":"NlzA37VA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123156285,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)01:59:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123138409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123138409<\/a><br><br>It&#039;s (((depression))).

I&#039;ve heard the California Refugee meme, but I&#039;m not one of those hipster hippy dippy libs looking for SXSW or music festivals or whatever, I&#039;m a legit gun owner. I know fuck-all about Fort Worth, seems like cowboy country and so probably very whitebread, but I do know that Ahmed Bomb Clock kid was part of a mudslime community in the DFW area.

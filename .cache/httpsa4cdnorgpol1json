Many of the tactical and strategic mistakes were based on sound reasoning that only proved flawed with the benefit of hindsight. At the Battle of the Somme, for example, the British overestimated the usefulness of artillery because von Mackensen had used overwhelming firepower as a sledgehammer to break through the Russian lines very effectively the year before - they thought it came down to simply concentrating enough guns on the battlefield. And some of the reason the British and French insisted on pressing attacks that were failing to gain ground was because at the very beginning of the war the Germans came very close to breaking through the lines at the Marne, and probably could have done so if they&#039;d been a little less cautious. <br><br>The people at the top weren&#039;t just a bunch of incompetent buffoons.

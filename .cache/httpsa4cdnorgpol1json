He was usually accompanied by Owen Jones, one of the three directors, for Frontiers of Science Fellowship<br><br>With his physics background, Hamrick had previously been responsible for the research and development, and the patent filing, of a number of highly sophisticated medical, musical (sound, switching), and machining apparatus and methodologies.

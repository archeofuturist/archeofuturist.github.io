This is not true. Let me repeat this: if there is a cost the firm can pay to prevent information about its wrongdoing from being spread, then the firm will be willing to pay for it. And even if the firm did not benefit from this, it would still pay it because managers would be covering their asses. Stop assuming everyone would immediately know. That&#039;s not how information works in any social group.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If I don&#039;t have the option to choose good and evil I am neither saint nor sinner.<\/span><br>I told you not all rules are to be enforced legally. Ostracism which is increasingly demonized and ignored is actually a much better tool for most prohibitions you talked about, namely on alcohol and drugs.<br>Still, it is true that if you can&#039;t choose, you are not necessarily being moral. But that&#039;s not always the goal. You might want to promote social stability, and part of doing it involves protecting people from the hostis (see https:\/\/en.wiktionary.org\/wiki\/host<wbr>is and http:\/\/www.counter-currents.com\/201<wbr>1\/02\/reflections-on-carl-schmitts-t<wbr>he-concept-of-the-political\/ ).

We ultimately want your perspective in determining concrete steps that our campus can take to build a more inclusive community\u2014for those of us of color, those of us who are white, and all of us with multiple, intersecting identities.<\/span><br><br>(cont)","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":748,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493745462310,"time":1493745462,"md5":"dRMk0fvI1Y6MwNzYeUXo7Q==","fsize":203104,"resto":0,"id":"WsWCPyuy","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ucsc-whites-cannot-love-who-they-are","country_name":"United States","replies":150,"images":39,"omitted_posts":145,"omitted_images":36,"tail_size":50},{"no":123814560,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:27:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123813948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123813948<\/a><br>enjoy your 5head kids then hanz or are you desperate and don&#039;t care?","time":1493756837,"resto":123790307,"id":"IoWS4qoS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123814567,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:27:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123814472\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123814472<\/a><br>kk gimme a few minutes.","time":1493756840,"resto":123790307,"id":"y2\/oaujg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123814643,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:27:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123794123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123794123<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pagan attire<\/span><br><br>No, no, no, we need to wear a cross and a shirt that says &quot;It&#039;s Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve&quot;","time":1493756868,"resto":123790307,"id":"TmeI8rK0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123814790,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:28:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123804283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123804283<\/a><br>I think you&#039;re using a proxy <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;your wording isn&#039;t American native<\/span>","time":1493756933,"resto":123790307,"id":"dpxwer8M","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123814933,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:29:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123812779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123812779<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Transnational <\/span><br>Here we go...","time":1493756996,"resto":123790307,"id":"zGtcm+XL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123806685,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)15:24:37","name":"Anonymous","sub":"It&#039;s that time!","com":"https:\/\/8values.github.io\/<br><br>8Values Test time boys, post &#039;em.<br><br>I have no idea how I got this, never seen this result before but makes sense.","filename":"oops","ext":".png","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493753077638,"time":1493753077,"md5":"KuRWCXpe5ATbmLW6NCbZUw==","fsize":111669,"resto":0,"id":"aMuz+MBg","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-that-time","country_name":"United States","replies":32,"images":29,"omitted_posts":27,"omitted_images":24},{"no":123813750,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:20:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"I am a fucking disgrace...","filename":"Please kill me","ext":".png","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493756444590,"time":1493756444,"md5":"C+Rrdg2rioE69Yfe4ofIMQ==","fsize":99257,"resto":123806685,"id":"enAo+7E\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123814212,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:24:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123812998\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123812998<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this kraut is going to get arrested for nationalist wrong-think within the next two months<\/span>","time":1493756682,"resto":123806685,"id":"RCm0LIZr","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123814327,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:25:40","name":"Anonymous","filename":"48d78ea8a2fb401189c620183848652b","ext":".png","w":816,"h":613,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493756740000,"time":1493756740,"md5":"SNeOqKL7QBGJxiAYOEhlKw==","fsize":85968,"resto":123806685,"id":"qtRTBaFj","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123814644,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:27:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123813300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123813300<\/a><br>mein negger","time":1493756868,"resto":123806685,"id":"7to5Ppid","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123814932,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:29:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123812329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123812329<\/a><br>I took the updated test.

Starting with the question:<br><br>What should be done about gender dysphoria?<br><br>Depending on who you ask there is either no satisfactory treatment or treatment is easy as fuck. As a rule, hot button sociological studies tend to oversample people that confirm their biases. It really can&#039;t be determined for sure which are reliable and how reliable they are. That there are people who experience some sort of dissonance with their physical body is undeniable, however there&#039;s disagreement over causes and the level of concern that should be shown for the matter. However the question seems much more important now than in the past because medical science has advanced to a point where a reasonably feminine male can immitate a female phenotype. Which brings me to the second question.<br><br>What are the ethical implications of trapping?<br><br>It is essentially lying. You&#039;re presenting to propective mates that you&#039;re female and thus have a vagina and in principle procreation is a possibility. Even with full acceptance of physical and social transition this would still be a major issue. A trap will never be a real girl, so perhaps even if they can pass for one, is it unethical for them to even try?<br><br>And finally with ethics comes law. How should the law handle such people? Obviously they&#039;d like to be legally female, but they physically aren&#039;t. What approach should the state take to moderating the interactions of pseudo-females with persons who are unaware of their status? Should the state even take an approach at all?<br><br>What are your thoughts on the matter? As technology improves we&#039;ll only have more and more problems and questions like this in the future, and they&#039;re only going to get more and more strange. We might as well start thinking about it now before it becomes a larger problem.","filename":"anzukiss","ext":".webm","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493747796336,"time":1493747796,"md5":"pB74WIzDiAs2G0xUHu9nqA==","fsize":943552,"resto":0,"id":"S+w06DpG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-we-have-an-actual-political-discussion-about","country_name":"United States","replies":172,"images":45,"omitted_posts":167,"omitted_images":44,"tail_size":50},{"no":123814502,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:26:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123814090\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123814090<\/a><br>hello fellow \/mtfg\/ poster<br>who is this?","time":1493756813,"resto":123795089,"id":"34fZ6+j3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123814506,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:26:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123814293\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123814293<\/a><br>Meant to quote<br><a href=\"#p123811750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123811750<\/a>","time":1493756814,"resto":123795089,"id":"zdrDlMrZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123814550,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:27:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123812919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123812919<\/a><br>Sauce","time":1493756833,"resto":123795089,"id":"BbTYwTWc","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123814870,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:29:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123814420\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123814420<\/a><br>The first one you asked sauce for is kaichu, I am posting on phone and mixed them up.","time":1493756967,"resto":123795089,"id":"zdrDlMrZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123814913,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:29:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw no redpilled tgf<\/span><br><br>All I want is to suck Blaire White dick.","filename":"photo","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493756988977,"time":1493756988,"md5":"nBkdE04qkEWmC1dxt0er6w==","fsize":113688,"resto":123795089,"id":"+NjfXSui","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123810256,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)15:53:34","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Chechens are whiter than any Southern European","com":"Prove me wrong","filename":"chechen_mujahid_by_0243design-d5ckjbz","ext":".png","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493754814632,"time":1493754814,"md5":"j90WBob0GsyAcMyl3xyjqw==","fsize":1030860,"resto":0,"id":"Zm8sYxkL","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"chechens-are-whiter-than-any-southern-european","country_name":"United States","replies":27,"images":8,"omitted_posts":22,"omitted_images":8},{"no":123814138,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:24:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123810256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123810256<\/a><br>The sad thing about the american flag on \/pol\/ is that you can&#039;t tell if it&#039;s really an american or an immigrant because they have so much of them.<br><br>For your question, Chechens are scums and should have been ethnically cleansed","time":1493756648,"resto":123810256,"id":"2L1lJ0nU","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":123814345,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:25:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123814138\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123814138<\/a><br>You can try but you will always fail","filename":"CkwN07kUUAAKj3F","ext":".jpg","w":213,"h":236,"tn_w":112,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493756749461,"time":1493756749,"md5":"Y4S7SPairjXHQ7DwUX8KsA==","fsize":39633,"resto":123810256,"id":"Zm8sYxkL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123814662,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)16:27:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123814345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123814345<\/a><br>So you&#039;re actually a Chechen who fled his country when the Red Army invaded.

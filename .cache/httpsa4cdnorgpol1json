And if I listen to what the numbers and statistics of all the civilizations of the last tell me, then Blacks are indeed a socially failed race. The only thing that has always kept them alive was their massive reproduction. They literally reproduce faster than they can exterminate themselves or other tribes. And that being said, it&#039;s quite admirable that for Mother Nature it&#039;s enough to be a dirt eating, self destructive savage as long as you reproduce non-stop. Blacks are primitive proto-humans, later races are sophisticated beings.

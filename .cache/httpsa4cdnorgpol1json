Impression Products is a small business with about 25 employees. It specializes in buying used printer cartridges and remanufacturing them. In 2012, Lexmark decided to add Impression to an already existing lawsuit against other remanufacturers. While the other defendants eventually settled, Image has stuck it out and the case has made it to the highest court in the land.<br><br>You can read the full, technical details of the case here but the simple version goes like this: Since the \u201890s Lexmark has used what\u2019s called a \u201cshrink-wrap license\u201d with its cartridges. It offers a \u201cprebate\u201d to consumers by knocking off 20% of the price in exchange for their agreement to never resell or reuse the cartridge. The consumer agrees to this the second they open the package. Essentially, Lexmark believes that those cartridges belong to them, not the consumer reselling them because the consumer didn\u2019t have the right to sell them in the first place.<br><br>25 years ago, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears patent cases, carved an exception out of the patent exhaustion principle allowing patentees to set post-sale restrictions so long as these are otherwise legal and \u201cclearly communicated.\u201d In a separate case, the Federal Circuit concluded that when a patented item is sold abroad, the patentee\u2019s U.S. rights are not exhausted at all. The Federal Circuit upheld both of these precedents when it ruled against Impression Products earlier this year. The Supreme Court has never ruled on either of them.<br><br>http:\/\/www.scotusblog.com\/2017\/03\/a<wbr>rgument-analysis-justices-skeptical<wbr>-categorical-exhaustion-patent-righ<wbr>ts\/","filename":"printerink","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490503197854,"time":1490503197,"md5":"Kap9854Z3o8WFSNkOH723w==","fsize":70064,"resto":0,"id":"U5CtO5Kj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"supreme-court-printer-cartridge-case-could-be-the","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":1,"omitted_posts":8,"omitted_images":1},{"no":118321967,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:57:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118320433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118320433<\/a><br>so basically if impression products wins this case, all companies in the US can now restrict owners of products from doing what they actually like to the things that they own?<br>so like, ford can sell me a car, but then take the car back or undertake legal action against me if i start fucking with the engine (if they don&#039;t want me to)?<br><br>i hope they don&#039;t win.","time":1490504276,"resto":118320433,"id":"bdSe\/OLA","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118322013,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:58:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118321467\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118321467<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s cheaper to buy a whole new printer than it is to buy refills in many cases<\/span><br>This.

The resulting multi-lens system provides an opportunity to help correct aberration, a condition where lenses fail to bring all wavelengths of color to a single focal point, which in turn may facilitate higher quality imaging from smaller devices, researchers added.<br><br>The researchers developed the 3D lenses by blasting a light-sensitive material onto a glass substrate with a femtosecond laser, which has pulse durations shorter than 100 femtoseconds. The material then absorbed two photons that exposed it and crosslinked polymers within the material. The unexposed material was washed using a solvent, leaving the hardened, crosslinked polymer that will then serve as the optical element.<br><br>The resulting lens\u2019 diameter measures about 120 millionths of a meter, which makes it easily as small as a grain of table salt. The lenses can go from wide to narrow and may provide low to high image resolutions. Each of the lenses has a specific line of sight \u2013 clear at the center, blurry at the sides \u2013 capped by a curvature at the end. This mechanism mimics how the fovea, the small depression in the middle of the retina, collects light, and how the brain connects images from both eyes to come up with a single, distinct picture.","filename":"bre1","ext":".jpg","w":1084,"h":626,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":144,"tim":1490498345935,"time":1490498345,"md5":"XC6zDkcjKPwFMqlYjpudRQ==","fsize":72220,"resto":0,"id":"5bQNx5UM","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-over-niggers-the-jews-won","country_name":"United States","replies":103,"images":24,"omitted_posts":98,"omitted_images":24,"tail_size":50},{"no":118321827,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:56:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118321352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118321352<\/a><br>do you think the money in the economy has anything to do with technological research and implementation?<br><br>nigga they have energy weapons that can stop your heart and bases on mars and the rings of saturn. they don&#039;t need money for what they&#039;re doing, your subjugation is priceless.","time":1490504179,"resto":118312846,"id":"S5Eeo06g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118321938,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:57:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118321588\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118321588<\/a><br>The fuck does this even mean?

Rockefeller, Carnegie, and J. P. Morgan were making what would be hundreds of billions a day through manipulation of their workers. Their workers would live in towns these people would built but have no room to progress forward. People were exposed to harsh conditions and payed very little, no matter how hard they worked. Everything was owned by the conglomerates; the houses, the stores, the factories, it was basically a small city state. Along with this there was no room at all for competition because the monopolies bought them all up, claimed all the resources, and bankrupted their competitors. <br>Only when did the United States realize that these monopolists were gaining more control and lobbying the government it became a concern. Here the Sherman Anti-Trust act comes into play and breaks up monopolies and allows competition to compete. The world does much better without monopolies just viewing people as a recourse, while basically enslaving them and putting a false facade that there might be hope you will progress and become the next millionaire, but with a system like that in place, the millionaires make sure they stay rich and the poor stay poor. It isn&#039;t always a matter of intelligence but of the willingness to not view another as a human but as something to exploit.","filename":"Ancap_vs_NatSoc","ext":".png","w":1094,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":68,"tim":1490502358663,"time":1490502358,"md5":"yPIcoW4HxpB8a3y9QVNTfA==","fsize":27324,"resto":0,"id":"pmub+yKv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ancap-v-natsoc-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":22,"images":4,"omitted_posts":17,"omitted_images":4},{"no":118321770,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:55:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118321637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118321637<\/a><br>I&#039;m not sure i&#039;ve heard of that monopoly.","time":1490504147,"resto":118319137,"id":"DTHCa7gB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118321901,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:57:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118321770\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118321770<\/a><br>It doesn&#039;t exist at the moment because we have a government to prevent it.","time":1490504228,"resto":118319137,"id":"H3GiloHH","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118321958,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:57:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118321637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118321637<\/a><br>So how would cartels exist without violating NAP?

Circumcision makes it simpler to wash the penis. Washing beneath the foreskin of an uncircumcised penis is generally easy, however.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Decreased risk of urinary tract infections. The overall risk of urinary tract infections in males is low, but these infections are more common in uncircumcised males. Severe infections early in life can lead to kidney problems later on.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Decreased risk of sexually transmitted infections. Circumcised men might have a lower risk of certain sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. Still, safe sexual practices remain essential.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Prevention of penile problems. Occasionally, the foreskin on an uncircumcised penis can be difficult or impossible to retract (phimosis). This can lead to inflammation of the foreskin or head of the penis.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Decreased risk of penile cancer. Although cancer of the penis is rare, it&#039;s less common in circumcised men. In addition, cervical cancer is less common in the female sexual partners of circumcised men.<\/span><br><br>All of those claims.

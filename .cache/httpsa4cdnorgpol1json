In olden times, this was channeled into hunting for your tribal group so they have enough to eat, fighting for your tribal group so they are safe - the community solidarity and shared collective purpose was tangible and real. This seems to be totally missing from modern society - the closest we have is a sports game, where really the &quot;fans&quot; are just cheering for two different corporate franchises. You can work at a job and maybe even achieve something exceptional as part of a team, but really you aren&#039;t a community in any real sense, you are people hired by the same company for economic purposes.

This place is a complete hellole. Politically they think that their form of European Socialism is the key. It confuses me how taxing someone who earns 30k a year at 35% helps the poor man but hey don&#039;t be greedy amarite? The women are all promiscuous to a terrifying degree (going out clubbing at the age of 13) and the men are for the most part effeminate or at best in good shape but still complete bitches. Tolerance for LGBT is persistent and those who disagree such as myself) are called evil and intolerant. To my surprise they hate firearms here. I thought they would have some respect for them considering the historical treatment of Germany by Poles but no &quot;guns cause violence&quot; according to these idiots. Parents have no say in what their children do and they&#039;d rather let them be &quot;free and independent&quot;. I honestly don&#039;t know how a grown man can watch his daughter walk out the door dressed like a slut knowing she&#039;s about to give someone head. Oh and drug use. Not only do they start drinking heavily at the age of 13 but once they get to around 15 and 16 they start doing cocaine and heroin. Last but not least, they&#039;ve been protesting here to legalise abortion. It makes me sick to see thousands of people marching crying out for the blood of children. Germans are lowlife, degenerate commie fag scum who need to be eradicated by any means necessary. This place makes me sick and I honestly believe it should be carpet bombed to fucking rubble. I won&#039;t do it personally but I think Mr. Trump needs to take care of business with a couple of B-52s. -Anon","filename":"rippled-german-flag-720","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":455,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":157,"tim":1492441790819,"time":1492441790,"md5":"p7g3EPXIaS8WBdxFkqogVQ==","fsize":19893,"resto":0,"id":"SXg3AK3r","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-was-born-in-the-united-states-but-moved-to","country_name":"Germany","replies":19,"images":4,"omitted_posts":14,"omitted_images":4},{"no":121537986,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:28:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121535986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121535986<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Last but not least, they&#039;ve been protesting here to legalise abortion<\/span><br><br>Abortions are already legal since forever","time":1492442924,"resto":121535986,"id":"C+2HQMDn","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121538142,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:29:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121537064\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121537064<\/a><br>Depends where you are in Canada what you say is true in most cities,but rural Canada is a haven for people with half a brain and traditional values..but that&#039;s why every city in Canada tries to force people back into the cities.","filename":"CND","ext":".png","w":680,"h":650,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":119,"tim":1492442997614,"time":1492442997,"md5":"akXTOwxQZUm9\/Wc\/k\/\/9NA==","fsize":1025247,"resto":121535986,"id":"RTqcdKlJ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121538429,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:32:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121537064\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121537064<\/a><br>Idiot.

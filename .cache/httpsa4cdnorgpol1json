But four board members and two staffers say that over the past year, Werner confirmed to them that he had sex with underage boys from Mexico, telling them he considered the encounters a positive influence on the children.<br><br>\u201cI said, \u2018These were sexual relationships with minors?\u2019 \u201d said Dr. Davida Coady, a Berkeley pediatrician who became Hesperian\u2019s president after Werner\u2019s resignation.

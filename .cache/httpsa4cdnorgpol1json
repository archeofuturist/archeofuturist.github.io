That&#039;d help you and those around you out a lot more than just SAYING you have depression. They could get you on some meds that could level your hormones. That&#039;d make you feel better. It also might take a few different trials, to find out which medication is right for you. Some might make you feel weird or nothing at all, which isn&#039;t normal. Find one that makes you feel alright and stick with it until negative side effects occur.<br><br>But I agree with what you&#039;ve said about it not mattering. I mean, everything matters immediately and eventually. But ultimately, nothing matters because everyone will forget over 80% of what&#039;s happened during our lifetime. The internet might not survive. Records might be deleted or lost. Who knows.

The killing will never stop. That&#039;s why it&#039;s important to understand the two major ideologies - the Liberal Big Brother agenda, which will strip you of your free will or anarchocapitalism which is ultimate freedom but also incredibly dangerous, since everyone is just as free.

That&#039;s why they are fucking Poles left and right, you won&#039;t believe how common this is in Krak\u00f3w for example. You can have Ukrainian girls for cash, or free, however you want. The things those lustful girls do are absolute madness, from gangbangs, ass to mouth to public blowjobs and so on. Absolutely crazy! I really don&#039;t envy those guys back in Ukraine, cause they are getting cucked bad.","filename":"ukrainian_women_1_23.09.14.jpg","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":967,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":188,"tim":1490395715382,"time":1490395715,"md5":"FDX7tcZ+xdPQwCo8Wfy96g==","fsize":174827,"resto":0,"id":"yrnSpN\/o","country":"PL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ukrainian-girls-fuckfrenzy-in-poland","country_name":"Poland","replies":195,"images":45,"omitted_posts":190,"omitted_images":45,"tail_size":50},{"no":118160047,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:44:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118150495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118150495<\/a><br>jesus, that women is really attractive<br><br><a href=\"#p118146352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118146352<\/a><br>i&#039;ve never been to ukraine. are the women really as attractive as described on pol or is this some meme lies?<br><br>hope you&#039;re staying safe ukranian bro","time":1490402662,"resto":118145271,"id":"RagmfhRz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118160060,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:44:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118159908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118159908<\/a><br>this.<br><br>i think old mate might enjoy looking at different qts in class.","time":1490402667,"resto":118145271,"id":"T2jqCNWx","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118160064,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:44:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118150182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118150182<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ukrainians taking Polish jobs<\/span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; how Ukrainians are just whores<\/span><br><br>Both are true but he&#039;s still a moron.","time":1490402668,"resto":118145271,"id":"oBIzQnRR","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":118160074,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:44:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"I dont know why people think ukranian women are good.

Are you trying to get salmonella or something?<br>You can get salmonellosby eating food contaminated with salmonella. This can happen in the following ways: Food may be contaminated during food processing or food handling.Food may become contaminated by the unwashed hands of an infected food handler. A frequent cause is a food handler who does not wash his or her hands with soap after using the bathroom.Salmonellamay also be found in the feces of some pets, especially those withdiarrhea. You can become infected if you do notwash your handsafter contact with these feces.Reptiles, baby chicks and ducklings, and small rodents such as hamsters are particularly likely to carrySalmonella. You should alwayswash your handsimmediately after handling one of these animals, even if the animal is healthy. Adults should also be careful that children wash their hands after handling reptiles, pet turtles, baby chicks or ducklings, or small rodents.Beef, poultry, milk, and eggs are most often infected with salmonella. But vegetables may also be contaminated. Contaminated foods usually look and smell normal. Symptoms of salmonellosis include diarrhea, fever, and abdominalcramps. They develop 12 to 72 hours after infection, and the illness usually lasts 4 to 7 days. Most people recover without treatment. If you only have diarrhea, you usually recover completely, although it may be several months before your bowel.<br>Salmonellosis is diagnosed based on a medical history and aphysical exam. Your doctor will ask you questions about your symptoms, foods you have recently eaten, and your work and home environments. Astool cultureandbloodtests may be done to confirm the diagnosis.<br>You treat salmonellosis by managing any complications until it passes.Dehydrationcaused by diarrhea is the most common complication.Antibioticsare not usually needed unless the infection has spread","time":1491889498,"resto":120540668,"id":"4Fk4YF2h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120536904,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)22:24:47","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Probably never having kids","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;me 38 German\/Irish American<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wife 36 Lithuanian\/German American<\/span><br><br>She&#039;s a PhD in Molecular Biology \/ Toxicology \/ Pharmacology making a great living as a research scientist with 10 published papers so far. <br>I&#039;m a simple nurse making average American male income.

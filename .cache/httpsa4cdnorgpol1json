For years, before they have sex themselves, they are trained to see sex through a third party lens. They see sex, and learn to be sexually aroused by watching women they are attracted to have sex with other men, usually with very large penises. Porn breeds insecurity into men, and in some, a desire to see the women they&#039;re attracted to have sex from a pornographers perspective. No men are looking for porn with average looking guys, with average penises. Straight men want to see women they are sexually attracted have sex with large muscle bound men with large penises. They have been doing this for years, before they likely even had their first kiss. Their brains is wired in this way by porn. Even when they&#039;re dating girls, they are imaging girls that they&#039;re attracted to, have sex with other men. Having sex is fine for them, but it is not how they&#039;ve spent years training their sexuality. They have spent years watching, not doing. Sure, cuckolding has been around for years, but it is never been so prevalent as it is now with the advent of the internet and internet porn. We cannot say that it is &quot;just natural&quot; when some of the most common &quot;Wants&quot; of cuckolds are for other men to desire their wives so that they can feel validated through their sexual approval of their wives, and wanting &quot;bulls&quot; for their wives. The prime thing cuckold wants seems to be a large black man to have sex with his wife. That is not evolutionary, that is porn culture, and Jews are behind it! <br>Women exploit this rewired men brains. <br>tl:dr<br>Wanting to be cucked is the mental illness of men caused by porn. This mental illness is abused by woman, and men are unaware that they have this mental illness because they succumb to the arousal during cuckery, because the arousal is really really strong, again because they spent years watching porn and training their brain in this way.","filename":"fuck this life","ext":".jpg","w":466,"h":349,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490459727403,"time":1490459727,"md5":"GpB1NVt9sLwgojoDN26Xzg==","fsize":37934,"resto":0,"id":"CzPo9syk","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-truth-about-porn","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":5,"images":2},{"no":118242062,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:37:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"You seem like a cuck","time":1490459877,"resto":118241780,"id":"S0PwfbzI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118242261,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:39:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118242062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118242062<\/a><br>keep using that forced meme to help (((them))) get rid of the stigma of the word, to normalize it.<br><br>the more, and more casually a word is used, the more it loses its meaning","time":1490459982,"resto":118241780,"id":"CzPo9syk","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118242492,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:41:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"they know they&#039;ve won so they don&#039;t even try to hide it anymore","filename":"jews porn degeneracy","ext":".jpg","w":625,"h":2585,"tn_w":30,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490460101666,"time":1490460101,"md5":"vYtnyWwWeToQdqd72P8kdg==","fsize":632062,"resto":118241780,"id":"CzPo9syk","country":"NL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118243644,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:52:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118241780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118241780<\/a><br>This.","time":1490460752,"resto":118241780,"id":"t4+l8loU","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":118244459,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:59:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"they got all adults hook&#039;d, so now they&#039;re after the kids","filename":"troy is the black kid","ext":".jpg","w":699,"h":644,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":115,"tim":1490461189744,"time":1490461189,"md5":"n66x3GWWmUYCJ\/v96jPJiQ==","fsize":110324,"resto":118241780,"id":"CzPo9syk","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118234878,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)11:27:32","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Mayflower Scandal","com":"Donald Trump accepted 0.5% of the largest Russian oil company, and the presidency, in exchange for eliminating sanctions against Russia and softening America&#039;s stance on Ukraine.<br><br>I suggest everyone look through this information.","filename":"mayflowerscandal","ext":".png","w":3720,"h":1372,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":92,"tim":1490455652052,"time":1490455652,"md5":"+LD937NqE2kwe56GIY3LpA==","fsize":2926773,"resto":0,"id":"KuE5GBDy","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mayflower-scandal","country_name":"United States","replies":15,"images":7,"omitted_posts":10,"omitted_images":4},{"no":118241498,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:32:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118240687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118240687<\/a><br>Fuck off, CIA backs &#039;revolution&#039;, why?

They literally know all the exploits and bugs in all kinds of devices. How come? Why do THEY know about all these exploits, but some security software companies (producing antivirus software etc) don&#039;t? It&#039;s not like they would have much less experience?<br><br>Well, these agencies have a nearly unlimited budgets and are capable of employing the brightest hacker minds to work for them. It could be, these people are really so bright, or autistic, or both, they can literally outgun the experienced professionals from the security software companies in the skill of finding bugs.<br><br>Now: what will happen in the near future? In the recent years we saw major improvements in the area of AI. A sudden increase in research, actually. AI and neuronal nets were last developed in the 90&#039;s, and then it all just stayed more or less dormant until 2010&#039;s, with only a few advancements announced. Now we see a rapid grow in the technology, even hardware support for NN.<br><br>What can it mean for the tools used in software development to verify quality of code? Since a few decades we had tools like lint to analyze code for possible issues. What if in the next years we will see a rise in AI-driven code analysis tools? What if we see an improvement in their quality so massive that the code quality checking will make nearly every product hacking-proof? What if AI will outrun even 100% autistic people in the area of bug searching, diminishing any advantage CIA\/NSA had so far?<br><br>Will it mean the end to the secret agencies?

So, the US responds by sending 50+ missiles in retaliation? Why? What do we gain from this? I could possibly understand if the number were higher, but 59? Why would Trump let Putin know ahead of time? Why was the airstrip vacant? Now I&#039;ll go with the argument that the chemical attack was fake. I used to work at a hazmat company. We would never have used respirators, but instead some type of supplied air. Full class A chemical suits would have been worn. Skin and respiratory exposure would have been zero. Even if the attack and photos are fake, why would they not have the sense to have better photography? Are Trump, Putin, and Syria this retarded? Was this fiasco trying to declare to the world that Russia and the US are not in cahoots? I&#039;m left with more questions than answers.

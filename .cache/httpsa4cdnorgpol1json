I look down most of the time as I enter anywhere. At this point you have to just assume the person in front of you needs help. The problem is that most people are thieves and us jews developed a system to counteract this by saying... Don&#039;t steal. It was one of the commandments. Wether you believe the story or not is unimportant as the symbology is more vague than you care to pertain. As children in a safe school by an older teacher who made sure we did not pick on each other so we could all dream and have all our wishes fulfilled... we were the kings. We all owe it to each other to reverse time because most of us did get a shot at American school and could to this day remind each other that maybe life isn&#039;t so bad if we all stuck together as some fucked up race of people who rape and kill each other for the laughs. At the end of the day I was above all that because I did have pride for native americans and I always wanted to live that life style.

Indeed, not long after Penn State had commenced their attack on Kek, they asserted their status as a safe space.

The case was said to reach &quot;the highest levels of the Republican party&quot;. A documentary about the scandal, Conspiracy of Silence, was listed in the TV guide to air on the Discovery Channel in May of 1993 but was mysteriously pulled without notice at the last minute.<br><br>While the courts ruled that the entire case was a &quot;carefully crafted hoax,&quot; there&#039;s plenty evidence to suggest otherwise. Two of the plaintiffs (Alisha Owen and Paul Bonacci) served time in prison because they refused to recant their testimonies while two other plaintiffs (Troy Boner and Danny King) recanted, supposedly under FBI pressure. Another victim, Eulice Washington, refused to recant but served no time. Paul Bonacci was later awarded $1 million dollars in civil court by a judge who believed his allegations of abuse.<br><br>The victims were able to describe rooms of the White House in great detail and matched alleged travel dates with airline receipts. There were several mysterious deaths of key players, such as the explosion of a plane carrying Gary Caradori, private investigator for the plaintiffs. All of his records were promptly impounded by the FBI.<br>http:\/\/spotlightonabuse.wordpress.c<wbr>om\/2013\/05\/02\/tim-tate-on-the-makin<wbr>g-of-the-franklin-scandal-documenta<wbr>ry-conspiracy-of-silence\/","filename":"IMG_4293","ext":".jpg","w":1011,"h":1005,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":248,"tim":1493315747227,"time":1493315747,"md5":"+SdeQQI8hkIAN21B369cTg==","fsize":233320,"resto":0,"id":"IaNihOGU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cia-government-pedophila-franklin-scandal-general","country_name":"United States","replies":48,"images":17,"omitted_posts":43,"omitted_images":17},{"no":123085330,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)16:48:09","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1492469897279","ext":".jpg","w":298,"h":450,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493326089764,"time":1493326089,"md5":"mEmZVLh1hHPlhdSrZ34KOw==","fsize":40033,"resto":123063838,"id":"\/yvNaTR9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123085471,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)16:49:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123085269\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123085269<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw first to be thrown under the bus<\/span>","filename":"1477598988254","ext":".gif","w":260,"h":260,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493326148389,"time":1493326148,"md5":"xD4mta5yLeZ1TWFzluwKaA==","fsize":2106117,"resto":123063838,"id":"\/yvNaTR9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123085948,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)16:52:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123085471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123085471<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw<\/span>","filename":"IMG_4296","ext":".jpg","w":360,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493326335881,"time":1493326335,"md5":"35ZQoT3RyjDNlwJq+VgmuA==","fsize":39738,"resto":123063838,"id":"IaNihOGU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123086353,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)16:54:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123063838\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123063838<\/a><br>Thread Theme:<br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/R1B2zcbiRT4","filename":"1409182265301","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":909,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493326497725,"time":1493326497,"md5":"UdNdA6eiPmjCq2rpUThEEg==","fsize":206891,"resto":123063838,"id":"\/yvNaTR9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123087059,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)16:59:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123083445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123083445<\/a><br>So was Silsby fake news? <br><br><a href=\"#p123083356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123083356<\/a><br>I had to laugh; what else would you eat when you&#039;re trying to pork a low-class who&#039;re?!

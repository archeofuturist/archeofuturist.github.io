I&#039;m not saying its right to continue on the path we are on, no I&#039;m agreeing with you. Carbon emissions are a serious problem, but more for the health issues they are causing and not because our ice caps are melting (something that has been occurring constantly). And our reefs will survive anon, if you ever get a chance go diving off of Belize (off topic soz), life will always find a way, just like it has for millions of years. Also back to your ice core samples, you can see that our carbon ratios are nowhere close to the highest they&#039;ve been in our history. ( I think the core samples record the end of the Pleistocene but I&#039;m not entirely sure) The end of the Permian Period saw a HUGE increase in carbon levels which was caused by volcanoes and marine microbes emitting huge levels of methane, and this ridiculously dangerous combination of effects caused the largest mass-extinction in earth&#039;s history (sorry to lecture you this is for the people that aren&#039;t marine aquarists), but we are not even close to being at these levels of methane and carbon emissions, and it would be practically impossible for us as humans to create this same effect. Anoxia is another cause of this, but as we can see, there are many marine environments that are flourishing and surviving and not being killed by dangerous microbes. There are flares of these sure, but this is normal and is something that recurs throughout history.","time":1493148482,"resto":122756654,"id":"JTLTeLpx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122774417,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:29:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122773794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122773794<\/a><br>We&#039;ve been warming for the last 20,000 years.","filename":"2000px-All_palaeotemps.svg","ext":".png","w":2000,"h":583,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":36,"tim":1493148579841,"time":1493148579,"md5":"LwWJABEnZuH92lxw88xabQ==","fsize":183335,"resto":122756654,"id":"9Nn0sTrd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122774446,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:29:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122756654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122756654<\/a><br>The evidence is in several published papers you don&#039;t care to understand, lol.","time":1493148594,"resto":122756654,"id":"kRSC0DYX","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122754006,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:45:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"You may only respond to this thread if your country has the most feared fighting force on the planet.","filename":"Marine-Corps-Logo","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493138731582,"time":1493138731,"md5":"JEbRC1dYr4UXeUI\/Qri8VA==","fsize":490711,"resto":0,"id":"DpwvSPd7","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-may-only-respond-to-this-thread-if-your","country_name":"United States","replies":209,"images":78,"omitted_posts":204,"omitted_images":76,"tail_size":50},{"no":122774261,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:28:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"You are all wrong, the kekistani special forces are far superior","time":1493148505,"resto":122754006,"id":"77AgIxIh","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122774301,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:28:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122773663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122773663<\/a><br>It seems I&#039;ve struck a nerve lol, not my fault you faggots are easily manipulated by better civilizations, I remember hearing stories from Marines who got sent to Bosnia in the 90s that at one point they just buttoned down at that airport they landed in because they couldn&#039;t figure just what fuck all you idiots were fighting over or who was fighting for what<br><br>Sort yourselves out pls<br><br><a href=\"#p122773719\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122773719<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They&#039;re literally the real life version of the Navy Seal copypasta<\/span><br><br>And don&#039;t you fucking forget it fag","filename":"United States Marine is not amused by Japanese Tactic","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":650,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493148527032,"time":1493148527,"md5":"JtJ9OQr8pxD0L7QwqdIYbA==","fsize":62936,"resto":122754006,"id":"aI3Y68J5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122774395,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:29:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122759022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122759022<\/a><br>Also in 1812 lost to Canada in a war.","time":1493148569,"resto":122754006,"id":"pDwdTgsV","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122774408,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:29:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122773747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122773747<\/a><br>Well.A soldier is a person who fights.You can break down the soldier to branches like army guy,seaguy and airguy or anything you want.<br>Hungarian language has no distinction between army guy or airguy or seaguy.So the translation is correct and you got triggered by it.Sorry,im not sorry.","time":1493148575,"resto":122754006,"id":"HumaNLuU","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":122774445,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:29:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122754006\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122754006<\/a><br>Ayy","time":1493148592,"resto":122754006,"id":"sSKZ0GD1","country":"CO","country_name":"Colombia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122774443,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:29:51","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Google censoring search results","com":"Why is nobody talking about this? https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/arti<wbr>cles\/2017-04-25\/google-rewrites-its<wbr>-powerful-search-rankings-to-bury-f<wbr>ake-news","filename":"IMG_2997","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":1000,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493148591943,"time":1493148591,"md5":"pYXB7XpUk9E8ORzAFV2EmA==","fsize":266142,"resto":0,"id":"F37A3swH","country":"AR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"google-censoring-search-results","country_name":"Argentina","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122757656,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:16:44","name":"Anonymous","sub":"LE PEN GENERAL - Final Push Edition","com":"Alright everyone, our golden queen has won the first round and must now face her final opponent Macron Antoinette.<br><br>While the media want you to believe that her chances of winning are close to zero, all is not lost.

Pol is subconsciously aware of this, and we are hoping for the greatest happening, a dissolution of this reality and to expand humanity&#039;s consciousness and ascend to our original levels. <br><br>https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=PFas8<wbr>-SKXTQ","filename":"IMG_1681","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490133183546,"time":1490133183,"md5":"KKaemhMHGyzNX1DsPQ5GGA==","fsize":31136,"resto":0,"id":"Yo8z7zJR","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-ultimate-happening","country_name":"United States","replies":191,"images":64,"omitted_posts":186,"omitted_images":62,"tail_size":50},{"no":117704983,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)22:12:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117703579\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117703579<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;unproductive<\/span><br>What do you suggest we do, nuke Saturn?","filename":"1434782026969","ext":".gif","w":1000,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490148739446,"time":1490148739,"md5":"ttaquXiCAEzs4LadjtTuJA==","fsize":2094381,"resto":117676034,"id":"HD\/yZFAL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117705036,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)22:12:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117704622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117704622<\/a>","filename":"1488897301865","ext":".gif","w":720,"h":404,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490148775850,"time":1490148775,"md5":"JLF8oSDq2kBToXW3NF1UdA==","fsize":1870784,"resto":117676034,"id":"0Vr7begx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117705115,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)22:13:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117676034\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117676034<\/a><br>Anyone have intense insomnia ?<br><br>Ever since these SJW freak outs and culture\/race wars, i&#039;ve been finding it increasingly harder to shut my mind off and get a good night&#039;s sleep","time":1490148820,"resto":117676034,"id":"alIFqy+M","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117705133,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)22:13:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"Jews behind this, that&#039;s why they want us in spiritual prison while they suck Archons dicks and got the devil&#039;s bargain for money and power on earth.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":412,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490148831866,"time":1490148831,"md5":"HkGaJnRN5qzi5uRs98iEWQ==","fsize":92293,"resto":117676034,"id":"W20xIriG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117705260,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)22:14:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117676034\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117676034<\/a><br>after reading the nag hammadi scriptures, i can whole heartedly tell you that david icke completely mis-represents their ideals. he neglects to mention this entire universe was made by the archons in the first place, and this is the distorted realm that is modeled after the kingdom of heaven.","time":1490148891,"resto":117676034,"id":"d9P1FKwH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117697371,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)21:02:11","name":"Anonymous","sub":"North Korea: &quot; We are fully prepared for war with the US&quot;","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; North Korea, officially the Democratic People&#039;s Republic of Korea (DPRK), is fully ready to go to war with the US, the country&#039;s foreign ministry said in response to US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson&#039;s comments on military strike.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;The US should face up to the situation of the world with its eyes wide open.

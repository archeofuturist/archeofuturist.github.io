Each group has its own facilitator. The group facilitators steer participants to discuss preset issues, employing the same tactics as the lead facilitator.<br><br>Participants are encouraged to put their ideas and disagreements on paper, with the results to be compiled later. Who does the compiling? If you ask participants, you typically hear: \u201cThose running the meeting compiled the results.\u201d Oh-h! The next question is: \u201cHow do you know that what you wrote on your sheet of paper was incorporated into the final outcome?\u201d The typical answer is: \u201cWell, I\u2019ve wondered about that, because what I wrote doesn\u2019t seem to be reflected. I guess my views were in the minority.\u201d<br><br>That is the crux of the situation. If 50 people write down their ideas individually, to be compiled later into a final outcome, no one knows what anyone else has written. That the final outcome of such a meeting reflects anyone\u2019s input at all is highly questionable, and the same holds true when the facilitator records the group\u2019s comments on paper. But participants in these types of meetings usually don\u2019t question the process.<br><br>Why hold such meetings at all if the outcomes are already established? The answer is because it is imperative for the acceptance of the School-to-Work agenda, or the environmental agenda, or whatever the agenda, that ordinary people assume ownership of the preset outcomes. If people believe an idea is theirs, they\u2019ll support it. If they believe an idea is being forced on them, they\u2019ll resist.","time":1491727485,"resto":120259369,"id":"q++j\/sg2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120260443,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:44:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120260046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120260046<\/a><br>All the ctr shill posts like this one are trying to divide us. <br><br>Its making it hard to sift to good, useful Trump criticism.

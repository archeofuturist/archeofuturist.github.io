We must all be content with our crowded apartments, our drugs, our masturbation and pornography.","time":1492876798,"resto":122287768,"id":"EVL+8N9z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122282425,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:32:25","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Marine Le Pen gets poll boost after Paris attack as Trump tweet","com":"I told you guys so","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-22 at 7.31.33 AM","ext":".png","w":970,"h":1020,"tn_w":237,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492871545315,"time":1492871545,"md5":"gUYofIOZaddX182s+slRTQ==","fsize":839507,"resto":0,"id":"xxKxTbPh","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"marine-le-pen-gets-poll-boost-after-paris-attack","country_name":"United States","replies":89,"images":18,"omitted_posts":84,"omitted_images":18},{"no":122291616,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:58:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122291475\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122291475<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;won<\/span>","filename":"19789999","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":518,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":107,"tim":1492876736415,"time":1492876736,"md5":"oGXedBS9U+CDvTAwyIEqMw==","fsize":49239,"resto":122282425,"id":"xxKxTbPh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122291642,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:59:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122289728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122289728<\/a><br>Kek, maybe.<br>If so she&#039;ll be killed by Islamic extremists for her deportation plans.","time":1492876750,"resto":122282425,"id":"2v\/Z+q7K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122291669,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:59:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122291221\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122291221<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Facts = bad<\/span><br>Boy I sure am happy there are no greedy rich white men and they&#039;re all jews!","time":1492876760,"resto":122282425,"id":"qL51ZuPs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122291720,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:59:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Even if she wins, she won&#039;t change much things.<br>First migration policies is ruled by EU.<br>Second stuff like &quot;french first&quot; for work is forbidden by EU treaties.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Change things<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Remains in EU<\/span><br>pick one","time":1492876785,"resto":122282425,"id":"Nx4nfFTm","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122291747,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:59:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122291616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122291616<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Corruption means the people consent<\/span>","filename":"1492384279014","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":217,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":50,"tim":1492876796949,"time":1492876796,"md5":"6a35+ndew8vA4sDyDvJTDQ==","fsize":18457,"resto":122282425,"id":"qL51ZuPs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122288714,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:31:50","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Berkeley Logistics and Tactics","com":"Last Thread: <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/122240659#p122240659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122240659<\/a><br><br>For all the talk of how to deal with various Antifa tactics, one very important thing has been overlooked: Logistics<br><br>Food, water, medical supplies, etc. An army of the best fighters will be outlasted without the logistics to back it up.

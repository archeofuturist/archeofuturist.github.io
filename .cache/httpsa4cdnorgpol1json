We would bear all these evils (disease, disfigurement, loss, shame, death) happily, because we would all support each other, and these sorrows would just be an opportunity to show our love for each other. The REAL evil is not natural evil, but MORAL evil, i.e. wickedness in men&#039;s hearts. This is why the world is like Hunger Games - because men are proud, arrogant, envious, greedy, traitorous, mean-spirited, indifferent, cruel, lustful, etc. This is why God seems so distant, because we fill up our lives with so much filth - &quot;And because iniquity hath abounded, the charity of many shall grow cold,&quot; ; &quot;All things are clean to the clean: but to them that are defiled, and to unbelievers, nothing is clean: but both their mind and their conscience are defiled,&quot; ; &quot;Blessed are the clean of heart: for they shall see God.&quot;","time":1490228944,"resto":117834162,"id":"vre7UkUY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117856515,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)20:29:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117853450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117853450<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mentally ill<\/span><br>The first step is admitting you have a serious problem.","filename":"bible v wiki","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":614,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1490228963772,"time":1490228963,"md5":"qxy2bKwTtXUSQQ4AYxdWGw==","fsize":87516,"resto":117834162,"id":"VVWRla25","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117856600,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)20:29:58","name":"Praceteom","com":"<a href=\"#p117856036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117856036<\/a><br>Atheists are necessarily relativists.<br>But I don&#039;t know in what world you think moral absolutism magically becomes synonymous with relativism, since they&#039;re direct opposites.<br>Maybe in dipshit land?","time":1490228998,"resto":117834162,"id":"VNR4cdrD","country":"US","trip":"!!nRmWeBC0+kN","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117853279,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)20:07:23","name":"Anonymous","sub":"What benefits do Conservashits gain by voting against their economic interests?","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; less workplace protections <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; less unionized jobs <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; less functional government that protects workers and consumers from predatory corporations <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; voting away your healthcare so that the rich can get free tax cut Gibs<\/span>","filename":"IMG_4286","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":554,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":216,"tim":1490227643422,"time":1490227643,"md5":"PYgJLKqi5HIm5YiwOjobOw==","fsize":115688,"resto":0,"id":"UtkluwgB","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-benefits-do-conservashits-gain-by-voting","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":4,"omitted_posts":11,"omitted_images":3},{"no":117855709,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)20:23:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; unironically posting an Occupy Democrats picture<\/span>","time":1490228631,"resto":117853279,"id":"YwrG9Lip","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117856186,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)20:27:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117853279\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117853279<\/a><br>My economic interests are to keep foreigners out and bring back real jobs.<br>My economic interests are to keep the educated from becoming tyrants over me.<br>Don&#039;t you try to tell me what my interests are.<br>Go fuck yourself.","time":1490228820,"resto":117853279,"id":"UTfejr2b","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117856273,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)20:27:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Union labor is the worst shit I ever did.

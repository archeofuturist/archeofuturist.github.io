Much of the ethnic tensions that still exist in Europe can be sourced from very old and very bitter rivalries. In some sense it could be argued America gets used but it absolutely must stop *acting* like it has the inside track on the complexities that riddle European ethnic cultures and divides. When America stops regarding the old country as quaint and old fashioned, and begins to recognise that minutiae matter, America will have begun to mature as a nation state and it will see that the lessons learned in Europe could prevent Balkanization in America.

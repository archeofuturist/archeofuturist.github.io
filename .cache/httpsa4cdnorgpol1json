What is causing this? Social contagion? More openness for gays identifying as trans?

Simply pointing out someone&#039;s biological gender can now be grounds for firing which scares me and will hopefully put a rift between gays and transgender individuals who have been lumped together assumedly by the latter since about the 60s. <br><br>Does trans numbers increasing demonstrate the poor conditions of life for gay men or a crass capitalistic endeavor of cosmetic surgery, makeup, and drugs to appeal to a wishful thinking lifestyle? <br><br>As a gay man I have never really seriously contemplated trying to be a woman and I can&#039;t wrap my mind around what makes you think because you are effeminate you should dress and physically resemble the part as well.<br><br>Also it is impossible now to pass anti-discrimination laws regarding gays that don&#039;t also include language about gender identity, which makes them harder to pass. <br><br>Are there any trannies on \/pol\/ who can walk me through how someone could consider being effeminate = being the other gender as a non-autistic reasoning. <br><br>https:\/\/www.yahoo.com\/news\/best-swi<wbr>mwear-want-throw-gender-140000399.h<wbr>tml","filename":"swimweear","ext":".jpg","w":575,"h":863,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492341759359,"time":1492341759,"md5":"og6YXoEIDFlRUy7un+hijA==","fsize":65503,"resto":0,"id":"EagF9W05","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"14-million-transgender-americans","country_name":"United States","replies":25,"images":6,"omitted_posts":20,"omitted_images":4},{"no":121349817,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)07:42:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121349478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121349478<\/a><br>There literally no effort needed.

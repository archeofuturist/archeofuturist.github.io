This general is for the discussion of Marxism-Leninism, the ideology of revolutionary socialism and communism.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491873977368,"time":1491873977,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"3fa\/bzoT","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":66,"images":35,"omitted_posts":61,"omitted_images":32},{"no":120534628,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)22:09:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120533916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120533916<\/a><br><br>Fug u gommie X-DDD<br>No stebbing on benis!","filename":"422222222","ext":".png","w":275,"h":183,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491876555203,"time":1491876555,"md5":"xT4kP+ifg\/wqU60VMclCDQ==","fsize":8043,"resto":120527602,"id":"LKbXsVKP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120534793,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)22:10:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120534353\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120534353<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Didn&#039;t we destroy you on the automation argument like 5 fucking times yesterday and you absolutely couldn&#039;t respond?<\/span><br><br><br>Probably yes.<br><br><br>The more I argued with them, the better I came to know their dialectic. First they counted on the stupidity of their adversary, and then, when there was no other way out, they themselves simply played stupid. If all this didn&#039;t help, they pretended not to understand, or, if challenged, they changed the subject in a hurry, quoted platitudes which, if you accepted them, they immediately related to entirely different matters, and then, if again attacked, gave ground and pretended not to know exactly what you were talking about. Whenever you tried to attack one of these apostles, your hand closed on a jelly-like slime which divided up and poured through your fingers, but in the next moment collected again. But if you really struck one of these fellows so telling a blow that, observed by the audience, he couldn&#039;t help but agree, and if you believed that this had taken you at least one step forward, your amazement was great the next day. The Jew had not the slightest recollection of the day before, he rattled off his same old nonsense as though nothing at all had happened, and, if indignantly challenged, affected amazement; he couldn&#039;t remember a thing, except that he had proved the correctness of his assertions the previous day.","time":1491876627,"resto":120527602,"id":"SnwM8g1s","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120535001,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)22:11:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120534097\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120534097<\/a>","filename":"1491574570742","ext":".jpg","w":859,"h":597,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1491876699019,"time":1491876699,"md5":"tbs7akaik0s7455ZcBr0pQ==","fsize":217900,"resto":120527602,"id":"yhQoAFuB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120535042,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)22:11:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120534242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120534242<\/a><br>what did you just said to me you little shit","time":1491876714,"resto":120527602,"id":"u2PeeGI7","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120535456,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)22:14:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120534260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120534260<\/a><br>not an argument","time":1491876897,"resto":120527602,"id":"yhQoAFuB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120533920,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)22:04:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Be one of the only countries without a Rothschild central bank<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nationalistic <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Try your hardest to give your people a good life while being crippled with sanctions from western forces<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hated, ostracized and mocked by the rest of the world, but don&#039;t care because your people love and appreciate you <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get forced into war by a neocon, Zionist Cheeto <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Defend yourself to the best of your ability and never give up, but inevitably lose <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tfw you go down in history as the bad guy when all you wanted to do was make your country strong and proud<\/span>","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":808,"h":1200,"tn_w":168,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491876284592,"time":1491876284,"md5":"xcHt9\/fKlFFugQH64eGX0A==","fsize":122638,"resto":0,"id":"w05DCkcf","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"be-one-of-the-only-countries-without-a-rothschild","country_name":"United States","replies":15,"images":3,"omitted_posts":10,"omitted_images":1},{"no":120535220,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)22:13:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fake communist failed dictatorship that cucks their people into 50s level technology thanks to retarded leader.

Gangs are adhoc organizations that literally spring up overnight when a bunch of kids decide to become a &quot;gang.&quot; Gangs have become so informal that many times the people in the gang don&#039;t even know how many members they have. All the serious criminal syndicates got shut down in the 60&#039;s to 80&#039;s due to RICO laws, so all that&#039;s left are the incredibly violent youth gangs. <br><br>It&#039;s a tough problem to handle. If the gangs don&#039;t even know who&#039;s a member, how will law enforcement? How do we criminalize organizations that are fly by night operations? Also most of the members are kids, so obviously there are some cultural issues at play. And for those that just want to kill &quot;darky&quot;, gangs are becoming a lot more multicultural in the modern era, meaning more whites, Hispanics, and asians.<br><br>It&#039;s not so simple. I think the best way to stop the gang culture is to stop the economic incentive. Many of these gangs are simply foot soldiers for cartels. We need to get rid of the economic incentive that makes gang culture possible.","filename":"consider-the-following-300x226","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":226,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1490889336061,"time":1490889336,"md5":"Sj5vzMLVn7PVQKrGpDr1PA==","fsize":16562,"resto":118911970,"id":"wAlccR\/C","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118934006,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:58:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bring back National Service.","time":1490889483,"resto":118911970,"id":"BFlhNAPI","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118934186,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:59:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118911970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118911970<\/a><br>Isocubes and Judges, obviously.","time":1490889586,"resto":118911970,"id":"5ou+0Xdl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

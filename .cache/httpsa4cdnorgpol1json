I understand you are shelled and thrown rocks at all the time by the muslims, but in all honesty you chose that area yourself because of your beliefs of thousands of years ago. Stop making the US topple dictators as it makes matters far worse in those countries. I understand you want to expand, but you already have land as well as being the most prevalent in the US. All you are causing is more misery in already miserable countries, as well as trying to subdue white people because white people are dumb and let you. I understand that you want to be on top, everyone does at all times by any means necessary but you are fighting against everyone. I have no hate towards you, and I acknowledge that you are smart and know your way around politics and major issues thus deserve to be on top, but the wars really need to stop. I don&#039;t blame them all on you, but most. All the things you have made in the media and cucking the white man has been funny and working to your advantage, but I can&#039;t enjoy TV or my life for that matter, because everything is shilling me to be degenerate and feel bad about myself if I don&#039;t follow the mainstream.

D&#039;abord parce que la pl\u00e8be intellectuelle est tout de m\u00eame largement majoritaire dans le monde, qu&#039;elle a des bras et des jambes, et qu&#039;elle sait utiliser des armes, ensuite parce que m\u00eame au sein de l&#039;intelligencia la plupart des gens ont des codes moraux qui leur indiquent que ce n&#039;est pas un bon comportement. Beaucoup de gens, m\u00eames intelligents, ont du mal \u00e0 accepter que le bien et le mal n&#039;existent pas et que chacun d\u00e9finit le sien (soit seul, soit en fonction d&#039;un groupe). A partir de l\u00e0 ils ont forc\u00e9ment un blocage quand au fait de diviser l&#039;humanit\u00e9 en deux castes clairement d\u00e9finies dans un rapport dominant-domin\u00e9.<br><br>Donc pour en arriver \u00e0 cette s\u00e9paration, \u00e7a passera forc\u00e9ment par l&#039;\u00e9ducation. \u00c7a se travail au fil des g\u00e9n\u00e9rations, \u00e7a demande un gros suivi. Tout les enfants sont \u00e9lev\u00e9s pareils, ont d\u00e9c\u00e8le leur potentiel cognitif (qu&#039;il soit exploit\u00e9 correctement ou non hein, je ne demande pas \u00e0 tout le monde d&#039;\u00eatre g\u00e9nial), et pass\u00e9 un \u00e2ge relativement avanc\u00e9 on s\u00e9par\u00e9 les intelligents des moins intelligents.<br><br>Apr\u00e8s le nombre de caract\u00e8res est malheureusement limit\u00e9, mais rien que cette s\u00e9lection soul\u00e8ve beaucoup de questions. Comment \u00e9valuer pr\u00e9cis\u00e9ment l&#039;intelligence ? Ou plut\u00f4t LES intelligences, puisqu&#039;il y en a de diff\u00e9rentes natures. Comment soumettre la pl\u00e8be malgr\u00e9 sa majorit\u00e9 \u00e9crasante ? Comment maintenir l&#039;intelligencia dans un vrai culte de l&#039;intellect sous toutes ses formes ? Etc. J&#039;ai des id\u00e9es sur \u00e0 peu pr\u00e8s tout, mais bien entendu elles sont tous sauf infaillibles.

Wars of aggression, even in the name of liberation, will never be supported by the party. Alliances will not be taken lightly thus, meaning some current agreements may require reconsideration in regards to the risk and reward factor that it poses the state. The state will also resist the attempts of any foreign power, ally or not, to influence the internal politics or society of the nation. Continued attempts at the influence of the nation from a foreign power will eventually lead to economic sanctions or potentially the severing of diplomatic ties until operations cease and an official apology is issued. Due to the isolationist stance, an overwhelming military like that of the current United States will not be necessary, though the nation will never disarm or leave itself weak in contrast to neighbors or other powerful spheres of influence. With the modest military format, the draft will always be opposed by the national libertarian party on the basis of individual liberty unless there are enemy forces amassing on our sovereign soil.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anti-Immigration<\/span><br>The national libertarian party will support closing the borders of the state to immigration save for those explicitly skilled in positions deemed empty and unfillable by nations. When immigration is opened up, cultural brethren will be given priority. If there is a decrease in population due to low birthrates in the nation, this will not be treated with hordes of foreign migrants but rather state incentives to national-born citizenry to reproduce and bear more children. All illegal immigrants, or foreign invaders, will be routed out and removed. Refuge status will only be granted temporarily to those fleeing personal political persecution under the party&#039;s protection of whistleblowers whether at home or abroad.","filename":"Oxen","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":814,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":226,"tim":1493856198233,"time":1493856198,"md5":"\/l26rwhSj\/QxL\/aIYQECcQ==","fsize":128389,"resto":0,"id":"MNSZxIy8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"national-libertarianism-a-balance-between-the","country_name":"United States","replies":17,"images":0,"omitted_posts":12,"omitted_images":0},{"no":123990180,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)20:25:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123989215\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123989215<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;smoking down<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;opiate epidemic <\/span><br><br>Complete success","time":1493857526,"resto":123987586,"id":"zdt5btct","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123990273,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)20:26:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123987586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123987586<\/a><br>This is literally what fascism is.<br>What you described there is Roman Empire 101.","time":1493857573,"resto":123987586,"id":"TNrTBO2w","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":123991551,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)20:36:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123990273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123990273<\/a><br>exactly.","time":1493858212,"resto":123987586,"id":"rW5V4n27","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123992005,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)20:41:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123990273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123990273<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isolationism<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Neo-Imperialism<\/span><br>pick one","time":1493858480,"resto":123987586,"id":"7kjYJVpW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123992402,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)20:44:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"OwO, what kind of a 2017 roman empire is this","time":1493858686,"resto":123987586,"id":"\/jXwx4bV","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"}]}]}

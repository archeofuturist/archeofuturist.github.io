And btw, the &quot;smug liberal&quot; phenomenon is not just about paid political commenters anyway. it&#039;s about your average everyday voter. liberals tuned into John Stewart and then went out and proselytized as smug cunts for decades. where were these smug right wingers for years and years? no where to be found. if you&#039;d spent the last ten or twenty years debating politics you&#039;d understand why a liberal, of all people, on Vox, of all places, might feel the need to address this phenomenon.","time":1493611688,"resto":123509660,"id":"10xIZL19","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123576548,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)00:14:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123509826\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123509826<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;waaaahhh we want out of the unholy alliance we&#039;ve made<\/span><br>sorry you&#039;re in the axis now, pleb","time":1493612083,"resto":123509660,"id":"bGJR7yDB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123575904,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)00:08:00","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Redpilled hobbies?","com":"I have recently come to the conclusion that playing video games 8 hours a day is not redpilled and I want to get some redpilled hobbies.

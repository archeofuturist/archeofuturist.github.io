You all smell of cauliflower and garbanzo beans.","time":1491975894,"resto":120703424,"id":"Pyjvnu6u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120720036,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:36:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"ITT: we post our age and current gun collection <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;19<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;delton sport ar 15<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;vz 24 8mm Czechoslovakian mauser <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mosin nagant<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jc higgins model 20 12 ga<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ruger 10\/22<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;stoeger double barrel 12 ga<\/span>","filename":"Bushmaster-M42A","ext":".png","w":793,"h":278,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":87,"tim":1491975401894,"time":1491975401,"md5":"hu+oG7Nl+8\/Yf6bxN9Nf4w==","fsize":22360,"resto":0,"id":"XZas52Sd","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"itt-we-post-our-age-and-current-gun-collection","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":2,"omitted_posts":8,"omitted_images":1},{"no":120720547,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:42:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"army issue 1911<br>springfield m1a scout<br>baby browning mouse gun","time":1491975744,"resto":120720036,"id":"w4ff310z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120720550,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:42:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120720407\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120720407<\/a><br>Wot m8","time":1491975745,"resto":120720036,"id":"XZas52Sd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120720552,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:42:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;n\/a<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;none of your buisness <\/span><br><br>Think that about covers it","time":1491975746,"resto":120720036,"id":"znxT4kSa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120720679,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:43:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120720552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120720552<\/a><br>I thought \/pol\/ would be full of fellow gun lovers :(","time":1491975830,"resto":120720036,"id":"XZas52Sd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120720754,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:44:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120720510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120720510<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120720520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120720520<\/a><br>Cool, the CIA knows I have guns.

Cannabis is less physically addictive and won&#039;t kill you. If it&#039;s not strong enough it&#039;s not strong enough and you&#039;re stuck with addiction.<br><br>This is the thing about medicinal doses of Opioids. Even with strong willpower, after some years you will find yourself using it more frequently, and at higher doses. First off Opioids actually increase your sensitivity to pain, meaning you seek pain relief more often. Second is that you develop tolerance to it. It starts out, 1 bottle of 5mg hydrocodone\/375mg acetominophen pills can last you 3-4 months. Because you don&#039;t take it every day, and you only take 1 for pain relief. After several months you notice that 1 bottle is lasting you just 2 months, because you&#039;re using more frequently and you find your pain is too bad and 1 pill no longer cuts it, so sometimes you use 2. The doctor says this is okay, and generally it is, you want to go low (dosage) and slow (frequency, and increasing dosage slowly just to keep up with tolerance). So you get a new prescription with 10mg hydrocodone\/375 acetominophen, take 1 as needed blah blah. First again, that 58 pill bottle of pills will last you 3 months or so. But then you start finding sometimes you need 2 to get the same pain relief that 1 used to give you, and you have used up your 58 pills in a month and a half, You&#039;re still OKAY at the moment because you&#039;re stretching 1 month of pills out well over a month.. <br><br>But you&#039;re still increasing in tolerance...","time":1490853487,"resto":118854977,"id":"3brXp3qP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118886664,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)01:12:18","name":"Anonymous","sub":"ITS FUCKING HAPPENING","com":"OBAMA TO STAY &quot;UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE&quot; IN PRIVATE FRENCH ISLAND! &quot;WRITING A BOOK&quot; NOT COMING BACK WITH FAMILY!<br><br>http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/art<wbr>icle-4353524\/Obama-write-memoir-Sou<wbr>th-Pacific-private-island.html","filename":"1","ext":".jpg","w":454,"h":600,"tn_w":189,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490850738359,"time":1490850738,"md5":"s8Z5EDh5b+w6CgiTDqKy2w==","fsize":92483,"resto":0,"id":"ziS\/90DH","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-fucking-happening","country_name":"United States","replies":17,"images":6,"omitted_posts":12,"omitted_images":4},{"no":118890836,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)01:55:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118890346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118890346<\/a><br>Fucking KYS","time":1490853348,"resto":118886664,"id":"IQauZxbX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118890884,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)01:56:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118890701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118890701<\/a><br>I knew they didn&#039;t get 2pac.","filename":"1457416687087","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":488,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490853378775,"time":1490853378,"md5":"9Z1qTXLk6FA3vELACCgYjA==","fsize":31895,"resto":118886664,"id":"jlYX6yQ4","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118891063,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)01:58:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118890701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118890701<\/a><br>Why do you think a president wouldn&#039;t have clandestine surgery during almost a decade in office?<br><br>He probably had throat cancer from tobacco use or something","time":1490853518,"resto":118886664,"id":"fENtcg0s","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118891091,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)01:58:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nothing is going to happen to Obama.

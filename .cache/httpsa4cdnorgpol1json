Our Western societies are in a state of squalor and filth. If ((they)) had left the West alone, we would perhaps have had a revival of the faith like we have had in previous centuries. Degeneracy and righteousness have the same relationship as chaos and order, yin and yang. They are mutually dependent on each other for existence and fluctuations are norma.

Add to this the fact that Christianity has been widely mocked by the popular media, debilitating it in the peasant&#039;s mind, whilst the other faith is impossible to discuss and critique in the West without fear of violence. It has cemented itself as a source of fear, which is exactly how the peasants like to be controlled.<br><br>As a people, we are not ready for total secularism, the public still needs a coherent narrative on which they can base their thoughts and behaviours.","filename":"1493552794775","ext":".jpg","w":490,"h":750,"tn_w":81,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493803617305,"time":1493803617,"md5":"7YLaGxei5N4FdONaZLmmhw==","fsize":59756,"resto":123888740,"id":"qV9MZFdC","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123894653,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)05:28:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123894151\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123894151<\/a><br>The church is an institution ran by man.

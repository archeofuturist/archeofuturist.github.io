Achievable by all, even down syndrome aidsbabies, if they can find someone to fug through miracle or money. This generally means very local DNA is statistically inferior. Multiple children with different partners is ideal. Freedom of genes, spreading of genes. Quality through diversity, a statistical net gain. European and american genes are generally diverse.<br><br>Negative eugenics, Stagnation of genepool by appealing to purity, not allowing people with genetic defects to procreate. Making the personal decision to not have kids because of your genetic inferiority, basically cucks. Regulating genes.

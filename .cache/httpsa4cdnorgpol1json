Everybody here thinks they&#039;re fucking historians or some shit.<br><br>First of all, lets talk about the Macedonians between 800BC and 570AD. For starters, nobody is sure which peoples made up the Macedonians. It could be Dacians, Celts, Epirots, or whoever the fuck else. It could be a mix of all of them. This shit happened 2500 years ago who the hell knows for sure? What is known, however, is that Athenians, Spartans, and Achaeans refereed to Macedonians as &#039;barbarians&#039; because they did move south from the mountains on the modern greek-macedonian border into their territory.<br><br>But since 570AD, the original population of the entire balkans, not just present-day Macedonia, has been largley replaced by slavs and other migrants during the middle ages. Yes this includes greeks too. Dont give me the &#039;100% pure greek blood&#039; bullshit. Ive seen greeks that look more turk than greek. <br><br>All the modern Macedonians that claim to be direct descendent from Alexander are so cringe-worthy it physically pains me. If you go to Macedonia and look at the people, some are obviously slav, some are probably albanian (in skopje 50% chance), some look like roaches, while some look like you would expect ancient greeks and macedonians to look like. And its the same everywhere in the balkans. <br><br>The whole &#039;Macedonia is a meme country&#039; stems from all the surrounding countries claiming ownership of part or all of FYROM because at one point in history, it was part of their empires. Greece is salty because of the name, which part of me understands. Bulgaria thinks its their rightful clay because Tsar Samuil incorporated Macedonia into the Bulgarian Empire during the 10th century. Albania thinks it belongs to them because WE WUZ ILLYRIANS and the entire balkans are rightfully theirs. And the Serbs, they think its theirs because it was part of the Serbian empire between 1346 and 1371. Wow Serbia, what an empire.","filename":"pQo7e8E","ext":".jpg","w":514,"h":536,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493390637083,"time":1493390637,"md5":"1uU8lL+4CpGPP1cKf6Ymfg==","fsize":43715,"resto":123174734,"id":"joO0Ipke","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123201751,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)10:47:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123190508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123190508<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123190413\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123190413<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123190200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123190200<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123190047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123190047<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123190017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123190017<\/a><br><br>Looks like we&#039;re gonna get a new Kosovo!","time":1493390849,"resto":123174734,"id":"v1Z1eFVo","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123201936,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)10:49:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123201133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123201133<\/a><br>did I say enslave? that&#039;s your serb mentality speaking.

But when you actually go to a school and community where people share your goals for the future (AKA, not breaking the law, finding a career, not making enemies) you realize it&#039;s not actually school that&#039;s the problem but your peers that have made it a living hell as a result of their genetic inferiority. It was great to open a textbook at a public school that didn&#039;t have wads of bubble gum tucked between the first page and the cover. It was nice to not have pages ripped out of your book. It was nice to not have to share textbooks with three people in your class because the Dominican kid&#039;s parents sold it for drugs. It was nice to finally come out of your shell and be yourself without some nigger, puerto spican, or hispanic calling you out for being a goofy cracker. It was finally nice to have friends that had common bonds that went beyond &#039;being the white kids.&#039; It&#039;s really nice walking down the street without having to watch your ass because some angry nigger decides to pick on the white boy. Living and being educated in a multiracial community is nothing but fear, depression, and loneliness. You really have to live in that garbage to get it. It sucks. It&#039;s miserable. I still think it fucked me up a tad bit. I still have a lot of issues regarding socializing and being a bit too reserved (effect of being in fear and watching every little word that comes out of my mouth, no matter how insignificant said words could be, for the first 14 or 15 years of my life.)","time":1490600664,"resto":118477591,"id":"9HfUnzEd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118487511,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)03:44:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118487442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118487442<\/a><br>No, faggot, I&#039;m 23.

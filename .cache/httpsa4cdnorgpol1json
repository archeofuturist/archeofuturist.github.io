Real life isn&#039;t Star Trek. People aren&#039;t going to farm and dig up coal and man the power lines because it&#039;s fun. They&#039;re doing it because they get paid to do it. And communism completely strips away any reward for these activities and replaces it instead with a demand and a loaded gun.

The old Soviet axiom remains true: &quot;We pretend to work and they pretend to pay us.&quot;<br><br>Long story short, Sven Libshit in San Fagcisscum who gets mad because he has to work 35 hours at the Apple Store instead of 10 would be one of the first people to starve to death under communism, and not just because they&#039;re extraneous and useless. But because the system they advocate would see economic output plummet, leading to a general collapse of the standard of living.

You screech like autists because you want the Trump presidency to run like a fan fiction.<br><br>It was one airfield, minimal casualties, Russians and Syrians were warned beforehand, airfield became operational two days later, no regime change and killing ISIS was still the priority. Now, considering all this, the only reason you have to be upset at Trump is because you think he&#039;s a neocon. Let me tell you something, in my day neocon meant something different. It meant an extensive, exhaustive, continuous effort with wars in the Middle East, boots on the ground, nation building, and the strengthening of Israel as a political ally. Nowadays it is a buzzword used by people like you as a descriptor for ANY KIND of intervention by the US, period. Now lefty\/pol\/ and other leftist subversives on this board can update their scripts, like they have during the NK happening, to make it seem like the US getting involved in anything is serving the interest of the Jews. All they have to do is shout NEOCON NEOCON! and suddenly wtf \/pol\/ loves communism now.","filename":"1480753719503","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":960,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492700292440,"time":1492700292,"md5":"sTNmpaivzjRwT28DpA4Aww==","fsize":76515,"resto":121983381,"id":"ERop38Oh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122002352,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:58:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122001758\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122001758<\/a><br>I suppose their current plan is to just shit things up until people leave. <br><br><a href=\"#p122002086\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122002086<\/a><br>I looked around on several other sites at the time, and the same thing happened.

You consummate your marriage to her, looking into innocent teen eyes as you orgasm, coming into her virgin pussy unprotected. She&#039;s pregnant with your son and you start working on the farm, or by fishing, or hunting or whatever your trade was in order to start providing for your family. You do this over the next several years, and by the age of 30 you have 10 kids with her all working in the same village. Work is hard but it keeps your body in good shape.

They didn&#039;t speak one language, but despite this they had a common origin and cultural backround. Rome itself was a mix of more Italic tribes: Romans were a mix of Etruscans, Samnites, Campanians and Gauls from Northern Italy. During the III century b.C. Romans conquered the Celtic peoples of Northern Italy, unifying the &quot;boot&quot;. It is since that moment that it start the process of creation of the Italian people\/folk as we know it today.

The Caliphate of Sicily, after the Norman reconquest, saw the deportation of all the Arabic people to a little city of Puglia, in which they were segregated.

In the rest of Italy this percentage is only of 0%, 2% in the best ipothesy.<br>The descendents of Longobards and of the other germanic peoples are attested to be no more than 10% on the continent. The descendents of Greeks on the continent are very low.

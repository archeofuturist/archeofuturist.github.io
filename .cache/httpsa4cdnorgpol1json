In a thread earlier today we discussed CNN&#039;s position as the default news station of most of the English speaking world and the obstinate position they have taken with regard to the Susan Rice scandal - with Don Lemon going so far as to say he considered it a distraction and would purposely ignore it. This coming from a news station that gleefully ran with the Trump Hires Russian Hookers to Piss in Obama&#039;s Bed claptrap 24 hours a day for a week. This is not acceptable.<br><br>CNN is played all over North America as the default news station blaring it&#039;s propaganda from TV&#039;s in waiting rooms, diners, hotel lobbies and businesses to the casual observer. I propose we bring this to an end. It&#039;s time to start complaining to the management about CNN. It&#039;s time to get the normies on your Zuckbook to complain about CNN. The first step is memes. This thread is for gathering all currently available memes showing the irresponsible reporting and outright lies propagated by CNN. This thread is also for the creation of new memes about CNN from the most recently available material. Once created we spread these memes. Once these start appearing on the Zuckbook feeds of angry Boomer normies we can hope to see the Boomers begin to do what they do best - which is complain. Over time, we need to have CNN turned off in as many public places as possible. Some well crafted memes posted to the local dentist or doctors office with a question as to why they still play CNN could work wonders.","filename":"170226132128-how-trump-turned-fake-news-into-a-slur-00021929-full-169","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491359179514,"time":1491359179,"md5":"jYw6BxiS16c2IARAthO+lw==","fsize":208548,"resto":0,"id":"WEc64uTp","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cnnmwg-cnn-meme-war-general","country_name":"Canada","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":119553609,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:27:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119553475\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119553475<\/a><br>bump","time":1491359245,"resto":119553475,"id":"Gppnp1Jn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119553638,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:27:39","name":"\/cnnmwg\/ **CNN Meme War General**","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;CNN DON LEMON INSTRUCTS VIEWERS TO IGNORE SUSAN RICE STORY <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Zl<wbr>isHOP69Js<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CNN cameraman BUSTED pretending to be &quot;ANTI TRUMP&quot; protestor<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7C<wbr>lR5yHBfks<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CNN FAKE NEWS COMPILATION pt 1<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ZQ<wbr>ei9cy8RF8<\/span>","time":1491359259,"resto":119553475,"id":"WEc64uTp","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119553939,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:29:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119553475\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119553475<\/a><br>Here&#039;s your meme<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Donna Brazile leaked debate questions<\/span><br>fired<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wolf Blitzer leaked debate questions<\/span><br>on air<br><br>CNN is either racist or sexist","time":1491359398,"resto":119553475,"id":"GojwCgCA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119543944,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:00:04","name":"Solomon","sub":"\/psg\/ - Pxls.space General","com":"Remember place from leddit?

Late in January, the White House declared Trump would enforce an Obama administration order barring companies that do federal work from workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual identity. But in February, it revoked guidance on transgender students&#039; use of public school bathrooms, deferring to states.<br><br>The case stems from a lawsuit by Indiana teacher Kimberly Hively alleging that the Ivy Tech Community College in South Bend didn&#039;t hire her full time because she is a lesbian.<br><br>Hively said she agreed to bring the case because she felt she was being &quot;bullied.&quot;<br><br>She told The Associated Press in a telephone interview that the time has come &quot;to stop punishing people for being gay, being lesbian, being transgender.&quot;<br><br>The Chicago ruling followed a so-called en banc hearing of all the judges in the appeals court, with eight agreeing that the civil rights law prohibits discrimination because of sexual orientation, and three dissenting. The vote is notable because the 7th Circuit is considered a relatively conservative appeals court.

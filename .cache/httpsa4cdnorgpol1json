Indeed, a great deal of the first part of his book Hitler devotes to pouring scorn on Austrian history and the House of Hapsburg in particular. In fact, one of his complaints about the Bavarian people, after arriving there, was that they continued to view the Austrian monarchy as German and a reliable friend. Hitler viewed such people, as he viewed most other than himself, as hopelessly stupid.","filename":"hGLrB","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":750,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490607671327,"time":1490607671,"md5":"YCNzmQmliswVNhzfBmRctQ==","fsize":212789,"resto":118494335,"id":"lVbKJ75X","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118495097,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)05:41:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118495019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118495019<\/a><br>Have fun becoming a minority in your own nation, asswipe.","filename":"alt right fighting jews","ext":".gif","w":300,"h":388,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490607717909,"time":1490607717,"md5":"\/ojBSeMiDzzXjfmizx55ng==","fsize":2027222,"resto":118494335,"id":"AsDxujb0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118495103,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)05:42:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118494912\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118494912<\/a><br>lol is that picture the Bong posted supposed to have Hitler somewhere in it?

This was the intended goal:<br><br>1. If it wasn&#039;t a false flag he responded appropriately. All he did was bomb an airfield storing the chemical weapons - targeting aircraft and infrastructure while avoiding personnel - after warning the Russians. No Russian casualties = No WWIII. Currently conflicting reports on SAA casualties - Pentagon says none, SAA says yes one dead. Doesn&#039;t matter. By targeting the air base and not Assad&#039;s headquarters (like Libya) he demonstrated this had NOTHING to do with regime change. Just sending a message.<br><br>2. He just put Assad in check while sedating Neo-Cons like McCain, liberals who want Assad gone, and Israel (who are the people who would have supported the false flag). He&#039;s winning over support from people stonewalling him with a glorified firework show. <br><br>3. He&#039;s being tough on China and North Korea. He was meeting with the leader of China today. By pulling the trigger unannounced like this he&#039;s showing he&#039;s not fucking around with North Korea. No doubt a message to Iran as well. <br><br>4. Even if Syrian forces are grounded they still have Russian air support. Essentially nothing has changed strategically speaking.<br><br>5. The momentary salt of some of his supporters will fade as the hysteria dies down when it&#039;s seen as it is - truly nothing of significance. He gets to keep them too. <br><br>6. Another nail in the coffin for the Russian collusion narrative<br><br>Whether it was a false flag or not is IRRELEVANT. Syrian is a done and finished conflict for the most part with Assad assured victory. This minor setback won&#039;t change ANYTHING and of course if Trump continues he&#039;ll out him self as a ZOG puppet. But that would be fucking retarded of him.","filename":"1490855646400","ext":".png","w":587,"h":721,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491557804770,"time":1491557804,"md5":"sIPoZzruwhZXjdH\/nfOEgg==","fsize":881935,"resto":119918716,"id":"6y5HpbYj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119921158,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:37:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119919605\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119919605<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;chemical weapons being used against innocent people not a good enough justification<\/span><br>nice<br><br>while this most likely has some deep state hidden agenda.. you&#039;re retarded.","time":1491557832,"resto":119918716,"id":"Zg9xdmv2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119923233,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:57:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Unknown, possibly some commander stupidly decided he would make some DIY chemical weapons probably due to running low on conventional bombs.<br><br>If it really happened and there&#039;s plenty of evidence there&#039;s probably little choice besides punishing them.

You know how Chinese view Koreans and the Japanese? It&#039;s like that but way worse, since Chinese actually fulfill all the stereotypes (loud, cheap, rude, pushy, racist, filthy). China is a country with &quot;10,000 years of civilization,&quot; but no morals, values, or culture to speak of.<br><br>The Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution did not select for kind, caring, polite Chinese. Only the rude, pushy assholes survived. Now their kids are coming to former US manufacturing cities, driving their new BMWs and Mercedes around town while stiffing waitstaff and not speaking English. People take notice. The same people are eager to nuke your country until it glows... or perhaps kick off a trade war, and let the next dynastic cycle take its course.<br><br>China&#039;s newly-modernized navy is raring for a fight in the South China Sea. I fully expect that the US will give it to them, and that the current Chinese government will fall within two years of that event.","time":1491558955,"resto":119919323,"id":"TIYFPl2l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119923113,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:56:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119921730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119921730<\/a><br>Despite all the poo and rape we have your back and you have ours.","time":1491559008,"resto":119919323,"id":"5A6GY7nj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119923229,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:57:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119923002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119923002<\/a><br>kek","time":1491559071,"resto":119919323,"id":"6+XYopna","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":119923377,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:59:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119919323\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119919323<\/a><br><br>Oh yeah, I almost forgot<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Its obvious America doesn&#039;t care about international rules<\/span><br><br>Tell me more about China&#039;s relationship to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea.","time":1491559173,"resto":119919323,"id":"TIYFPl2l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119923388,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:59:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119919323\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119919323<\/a><br>All i ever wanted is a massive happening, I guess christmas came early this year.","filename":"The end","ext":".jpg","w":1737,"h":981,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491559178666,"time":1491559178,"md5":"6MGSa82\/IueKGUeJ+MTW+g==","fsize":721190,"resto":119919323,"id":"OUxYRpBV","country":"SE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Sweden"}]}]}

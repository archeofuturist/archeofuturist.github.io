If we take the maximum extent of each country, essentially all of them will be superimposed on each other. I&#039;ll own Iran and Egypt by that logic. My point is that &quot;Bulgaria proper&quot; is the core of the original Bulgar Khanate, which is south of Danube and extends around Preslav. The Bulgar component is what makes Bulgarians &quot;Bulgarian&quot; and not &quot;Serbian&quot;, because otherwise you&#039;re pretty close anyway.<br><br>If you&#039;re talking about the Greek areas that once belonged &quot;politically&quot; to Bulgaria, that&#039;s a dumb point. There was never much hostility about them, and there are no &quot;Bulgarians&quot; there anymore. They either left or assimilated. Nowadays, those areas are mostly home to refugee Greeks that came in the population trade with Turkey in 1923. They outnumber all previous populations.<br><br>Anyway, there&#039;s no point in arguing. I don&#039;t really mind if Pelagonia and Skopje go to Bulgaria, I just think they are a better fit for Serbia.<br><br><a href=\"#p119319428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119319428<\/a><br>Based.","filename":"Structure_of_the_First_Bulgarian_Empire_during_the_IX-X_century","ext":".png","w":1920,"h":1692,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1491221694589,"time":1491221694,"md5":"uPspbao0u7tyLj1X1BErSQ==","fsize":1228588,"resto":119313172,"id":"H64vkNnP","country":"GR","m_img":1,"country_name":"Greece"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119321159,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:14:55","name":"Anonymous","sub":"White is Purity","com":"Prove Nivea wrong.

Turkey is a player in this whether we like it or not and Erdogan has no friends.<br>Erdogan has remained neutral, and will do what is good for him. Erdogan wont allow a kurdish state in Syria, if you think he will or an Arab state you probably never heard about Syria before this war. There is a reason why kurds never got this bullshit kurdistan, no one likes them in the region.","time":1492710193,"resto":122014657,"id":"77B91+Pr","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122018929,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:44:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122018387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122018387<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; kurds have tanks.<\/span>","filename":"1103","ext":".jpg","w":599,"h":407,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":84,"tim":1492710244653,"time":1492710244,"md5":"Urzty2\/erd+sIJBTFMJqJw==","fsize":46617,"resto":122014657,"id":"77B91+Pr","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122018971,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:44:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122018020\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122018020<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also they do have tanks<\/span><br>Not a lot outside their mememobiles<br><a href=\"#p122017727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122017727<\/a><br>isislithuanian is right","filename":"kurdmememobile","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492710272386,"time":1492710272,"md5":"uRLSN+Y1YLvULcEMovqKuw==","fsize":135994,"resto":122014657,"id":"q8hHMTxa","country":"BE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":122018977,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:44:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;still giving (You)s to the spanish commie<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;still giving (You)s to commies<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;still giving (You)s to YPG-Got-Aleppo tier posters<\/span>","filename":"40598124","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":381,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":119,"tim":1492710276022,"time":1492710276,"md5":"HQaQYwVtZwo5o8XatR6nCQ==","fsize":31031,"resto":122014657,"id":"d2wPa525","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122019003,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:44:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122017899\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122017899<\/a><br>Just ass-kissing Erdogan hoping he will send them some money.","time":1492710290,"resto":122014657,"id":"77B91+Pr","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122014993,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:08:36","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/ptg\/ -

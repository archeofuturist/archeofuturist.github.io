It includes every ghetto, all the cities like Detroit where no sane white person would live. So if you&#039;re just living in a normal neighbourhood the chances of your home being broken into are definitely less than 1:375, probably significantly so since a relatively small number of high-crime areas tend to skew statistics. Let&#039;s be conservative and say this pushes the odds down to 1:500.<br><br>So, the chance of you being burgled is probably less the 1:500.

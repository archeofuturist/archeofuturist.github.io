More stupid men and more genius men than women; and the average woman may be smarter than the average man (although some studies suggest that average man has +4 IQ points ahead). In the same way, the average Asian is smarter than the average Westerner, but the (white) West produces more geniuses by far. Jews have a lot of geniuses, too, as &quot;Jews&quot; are an artificially-selected white group with ancestral Semitic genes focused on intellectual pursuits. Sorry, Asians, you&#039;re great at managing the lesser races and providing quality developmental work, but are not as good at abstract reasoning. Northwestern Europeans are superior with certain mental tasks; these genes occasionally appear in mixed-race offspring. Genetic engineering means that people from around the world will be choosing useful genes from around the world, popularized subtlety by an AI, so none of this worry matters much. Some need to worry, however, or we won&#039;t get to the next stage.<br><br>Also: Women have more white matter and men have more grey matter \u2014 on average, as always. This likely varies by race.<br>Also: The brains of men and women start and stop maturing at different times. Again, averages and individuals. I believe this applies to races, too (like everything else). I also believe that some whites have genes which maintain their mental plasticity for decades. And, again, some mixed-race people inherit these genes and genetic engineering will help make &quot;civilization&quot; the global norm.","time":1493621097,"resto":123562495,"id":"Qzxy6LHD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123586336,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:05:20","name":"Anonymous","sub":"So this is why the middle east is so mad at Isreal...","com":"How do we still support this country?","filename":"798746545","ext":".jpg","w":1149,"h":695,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":151,"tim":1493618720213,"time":1493618720,"md5":"l+l\/mfV3CECtIPCRrTNrlg==","fsize":251714,"resto":0,"id":"iCcbcxuZ","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-this-is-why-the-middle-east-is-so-mad-at","country_name":"United States","replies":42,"images":11,"omitted_posts":37,"omitted_images":10},{"no":123589195,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:41:36","name":"Anonymous","filename":"35132165431321","ext":".jpg","w":1014,"h":1559,"tn_w":81,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493620896284,"time":1493620896,"md5":"pRsAY8PV4gIB0NEBmDJwSw==","fsize":232656,"resto":123586336,"id":"iCcbcxuZ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123589250,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:42:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123589011\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123589011<\/a><br>Because you were the aggressor in that war retard, and it wasn&#039;t your land to begin with","time":1493620954,"resto":123586336,"id":"UC7e2N\/Y","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":123589300,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:43:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123589117\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123589117<\/a><br>FTN<br><br>Let Israel and the Arabs have another war.

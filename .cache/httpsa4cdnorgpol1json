In 2009 the UK government cut ties with the MCB after it signed a public document which appeared to condone violence against any country supporting an arms blockade of Gaza. The government report also found that a number of Brotherhood groups have for years been raising funds in the UK. Some of those funds have allegedly been linked to Hamas, whose military wing was proscribed by Britain as a terrorist organisation in 2001. The MCB was also criticized for its ties to Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamic group linked to a number of terror organizations in Pakistan whose members have been accused of war crimes in Bangladesh.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/archive.is\/Cbqna<br><br>https:\/\/archive.is\/z56lM<br><br>https:\/\/archive.is\/hvwVV<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jamaat-e-Islami<\/span><br>https:\/\/archive.is\/4qEkx<br><br>https:\/\/archive.is\/5tjle<br><br>They love to use the term &quot;controversial&quot; to get progressives to write off any reports that come out which challenge the preconceived narrative","time":1490645310,"resto":118551038,"id":"Hkky6tqc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118554950,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)16:09:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118554791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118554791<\/a><br>Why has no one ever investigated the Muslim Brotherhood and CAIR in the US?

There are plenty of introverted women out there who are just as content to sit at home cuddling on the couch watching Netflix with you as there are women who want to go out and party every night. Just find one who&#039;s compatible, it&#039;s not hard to figure out which way they lean. If she&#039;s too into the social scene then detach yourself from her immediately and continue the hunt for a better one. <br><br>As for claiming you&#039;re ugly - I&#039;ve found throughout life that we&#039;re our own worst critics. We tend to exaggerate our failures and shortcomings more than anyone else would. Maybe you aren&#039;t great looking, but you&#039;re probably at least slightly better looking than you believe you are. Plus some girls just have really weird kinks or they&#039;ll overlook a lot of shit if you have one singular thing they&#039;re into. Doesn&#039;t matter if you have big ears, crooked teeth, too much body hair, short, a bit overweight, lanky, too skinny, whatever, there&#039;ll be girls that either don&#039;t mind certain things, or like you more for them for whatever reason. Just try not to be super overweight, that&#039;s like the one that brings the most grief from what I&#039;ve observed, but even that can be fixed through time and hardwork.","time":1493653229,"resto":123632332,"id":"APUCfJEb","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123634400,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:42:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"Lel<br><br>&#039;Teenage love&#039; and clubbing is fun for like a month, then it turns to shit pretty fast.<br><br>Make sure you land a high paying job, get a nice car and House, then find girl and make kids<br><br>You&#039;re 26, men kan make babies until 45 or some shit<br><br>Stop moaning like a bitch","time":1493653353,"resto":123632332,"id":"fWoSL\/4X","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":123634520,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:43:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"just lift and bee yourself","time":1493653425,"resto":123632332,"id":"z1gLiWN5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123634642,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:44:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123632332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123632332<\/a><br>Are you me?","time":1493653493,"resto":123632332,"id":"q4FbJPAY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123619080,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)09:11:18","name":"Anonymous","sub":"PARIS HABBENING","com":"Riots starting.<br>Cop was just on fire.<br>commie music playing on the background<br><br>Shooting antifags in the face when?<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GQs<wbr>7BRX6HFo","filename":"1404523234612","ext":".jpg","w":467,"h":413,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":221,"tim":1493644278952,"time":1493644278,"md5":"yhdlogbqFHYaYZLggjFWhQ==","fsize":26899,"resto":0,"id":"QMrg80kN","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"paris-habbening","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":247,"images":38,"omitted_posts":242,"omitted_images":37,"tail_size":50},{"no":123634439,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:42:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"WHITE MANS STATUS: DOMESTICATED","time":1493653379,"resto":123619080,"id":"m\/zXVAPb","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123634471,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:43:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123634340\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123634340<\/a><br>They are literally fighting for your rights anon!!","time":1493653396,"resto":123619080,"id":"DGgS5psD","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":123634543,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:44:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"The streets of Paris look whiter than usual","time":1493653440,"resto":123619080,"id":"ZHtDwKE+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123634554,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:44:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123633926\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123633926<\/a><br>Sacre bleu!","time":1493653445,"resto":123619080,"id":"UyHQc2o+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123634637,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:44:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123634471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123634471<\/a><br>:^)","time":1493653491,"resto":123619080,"id":"oYq5VWDq","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123621259,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)09:35:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"If you had a humble,beautiful girlfriend that loved you and wanted to start a family,would you still be a white nationalist?<br>Honest answers please.","filename":"10","ext":".jpg","w":1788,"h":2964,"tn_w":150,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493645750732,"time":1493645750,"md5":"1eWu+CHdCOL1ffIETt7iiw==","fsize":2412236,"resto":0,"id":"jOMODRW3","country":"HR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"if-you-had-a-humblebeautiful-girlfriend-that","country_name":"Croatia","replies":91,"images":10,"omitted_posts":86,"omitted_images":10},{"no":123633947,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:38:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123633732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123633732<\/a><br>yea traps are literally gay, as it&#039;s textbook sodomy dumbass.<br>You&#039;re a double faggot bc u both fuck traps and bc all libertarians are by definition faggots","time":1493653102,"resto":123621259,"id":"vBdXwYzW","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":123634017,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:39:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123633689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123633689<\/a><br>Oh this point I think if you&#039;re caught crossing with Coke or some shit, just shoot them.

This is because the total number of internet users on this planet is about 2 billion, or approximately 2^{31}. Initially, all one knows about an anonymous internet user is that he or she is a member of this large population, which has a Shannon entropy of about 31 bits. But each piece of new information about this identity will reduce this entropy. For instance, knowing the gender of the user will cut down the size of the population of possible candidates for the user&#039;s identity by a factor of approximately two, thus stripping away one bit of entropy. (Actually, one loses a little less than a whole bit here, because the gender distribution of internet users is not perfectly balanced.) Similarly, any tidbit of information about the nationality, profession, marital status, location (e.g. timezone or IP address), hobbies, age, ethnicity, education level, socio-economic status, languages known, birthplace, appearance, political leaning, etc. of the user will reduce the entropy further. (Note though that entropy loss is not always additive; if knowing X removes 2 bits of entropy and knowing Y removes 3 bits, then knowing both X and Y does not necessarily remove 5 bits of entropy, because X and Y may be correlated instead of independent, and so much of the information gained from Y may already have been present in X).","filename":"1489375340160","ext":".jpg","w":369,"h":220,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":74,"tim":1493477935225,"time":1493477935,"md5":"lClieINi++63QaoW4NCe8A==","fsize":31027,"resto":123340618,"id":"YS3lnGSG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123340779,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)10:59:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_os<wbr>-ysZJM_I<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_os<wbr>-ysZJM_I<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_os<wbr>-ysZJM_I","filename":"Bowden-Icon2","ext":".jpg","w":1400,"h":1400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493477945460,"time":1493477945,"md5":"XvAER4uUxlGdmPaFX+mAwA==","fsize":511678,"resto":123340618,"id":"+2xyeXj+","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123340784,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)10:59:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123331634#p123335350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123335350<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What about the consumerist, industrialised West?<\/span><br>90% vs 3%.

But as one approaches the threshold of 31 bits, the level of anonymity drops exponentially fast. Once one has revealed more than 31 bits, it becomes theoretically possible to deduce one&#039;s identity, given a sufficiently comprehensive set of databases about the population of internet users and their characteristics. Of course, such an ideal set of databases does not actually exist; but one can imagine that government intelligence agencies may have enough of these databases to deduce one&#039;s identity from, say, 50 or 60 bits of information, and even publicly available databases (such as what one can access from popular search engines) are probably enough to do the job given, say, 100 bits of information, assuming sufficient patience and determination. Thus, in today&#039;s online world, a crowd of billions of other people is considerably less protection for one&#039;s anonymity than one may initially think, and just because the first 20 or 30 bits of information you reveal about yourself leads to no apparent loss of anonymity, this does not mean that the next 20 or 30 bits revealed will do so also.","time":1493477967,"resto":123340618,"id":"YS3lnGSG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123340856,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)10:59:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123340768\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123340768<\/a><br>Restricting access to online databases may recover a handful of bits of anonymity, but one will not return to anything close to pre-internet levels of anonymity without extremely draconian information controls.

That said many people look at today&#039;s world and feel like they can&#039;t give their kids a better childhood than they had. We are wired to give our children better chanses than we had. But it&#039;s not possible because we&#039;re in the beginning of the decline, so people choose to play the waiting game instead. That and the fact that back in the day kids were an investment, in the sense that you may face poverty raising them but in the end they&#039;ll take care of you in your old days. Nowadays you can be pretty certain you&#039;ll be left to die in an old people&#039;s home, your kids hoping it won&#039;t cost them their inheritance. Not to mention the cost of raising a kit, at +300.000 per child to the age of 18 (excluding college). So the smart people think about it and choose not to have kids. They settle for cats and dogs because they know they can&#039;t produce a child more successful than themselves. The dumb population procreates all it wants, because even tho they live in poverty and marginalisation, they are sponsored by the state. Either way the reason why I choose to not have kids is because women these days want to be mothers but not wives. Hyper individualism has made us more detached than ever. With our wealth, came loneliness. Truly it&#039;s the first time in history people are living on their own, being kept awake by artificial lights. Sometimes I feel like tribes in the jungle have it better. At least they have a sense of togetherness. For us in the west, there&#039;s only anonymity in the hive.","filename":"1257121686051","ext":".jpg","w":1707,"h":1280,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490835591516,"time":1490835591,"md5":"1jrGTKDeBXZw\/gQR+fvP7A==","fsize":279889,"resto":118833788,"id":"FG8HTIKA","country":"BE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Belgium"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118855036,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)20:12:28","name":"Anonymous","sub":"PENNSYLVANIA THREAD","com":"FACT: Pennsylvanians are the most powerful thread.<br><br>These threads are fun and we&#039;re the best state so PA thread.

It argues that ongoing conspiracy theories relating to Hitler\u2019s survival and the supposedly poor quality and ideologically driven nature of the British investigations are not supported by any credible evidence. Through a series of primary source driven thematic chapters, it analyses the relations between Great Britain, America and the Soviet Union during investigations into Hitler\u2019s death in order to demonstrate that British conclusions regarding Hitler\u2019s suicide were not tainted by Cold War ideological motivations. Through analysis of recently declassified files which contribute new evidence to the historiography, it demonstrates how British intelligence were able to confirm that Hitler had committed suicide on 30 April 1945 and how they thoroughly investigated and disproved survival rumours which have been reported as fact as recently as 2015. The thesis concludes by providing a plausible explanation for the 2009 DNA revelation that the skull once thought to be Hitler\u2019s in Moscow archives was that of a woman by suggesting that this discovery tells us more about the poor quality of the Soviet investigations than Hitler\u2019s suicide. <br><br>The Death of Adolf Hitler: British Intelligence, Soviet Accusations and Rumours of Survival (PDF Download Available).

It is impossible to overestimate the power of psychosomatic suggestion on an African. If he is told that he will wake up next week with a paralyzed arm, he will wake up next week with a paralyzed arm. If he is told that he will die next week, he will lie down next week and die, if he is sufficiently frightened. A policeman told me that his grandfather had succeeded in murdering a troublesome African on his farm simply by convincing the man that he would die as predicted by a vision. The man obligingly proceeded to do just that. I am not sure I believe this, but I believe it is possible.<br><br>Even educated Africans believe in the tikolosh (I am sorry to say that I do not know how to spell it). This is an invisible little African boogie man capable of taking over men\u2019s bodies and doing great evil. He is little short fellow and cannot climb very high, so all your servants must have their beds put up on stilts from time to time. Branches rubbing on a tin roof at night (Africans do not like trees very much) can terrify your servants into quitting, so you must put a pair of scissors under the bed. <br><br>A common punishment for minor offences used to be to put the miscreant in a dark cell and tell him there was a tikolosh inside. By morning he is scared to death: he has seen that tikolosh. No more trouble out of him.<br><br>Once a man committed fifteen murders and pled not guilty on the grounds that the tikolosh did it. A group of educated factory workers in Johannesburg in 1954 dismembered and ate a nun who had nursed them most of her life. A Portuguese doctor was killed for his shiny tools and certificate to practise medicine by a boy he had raised as his own child.<br><br>It is difficult to get inside the mind of an African. He has his own way of life: he has lived it for 10,000 years. You cannot enter into it, you cannot understand it.

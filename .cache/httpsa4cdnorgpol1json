All of it and all of Ireland must bend the knee. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Completely conquered British isles become the Empires top secret naval base.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Crews sail from there to Iceland to Greenland, establishing military outposts and colonies along the way.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Very important. At Newfoundland we abduct a few Indians and try to expose them to small amounts of Euro viruses. Survivors would be inoculated and transported back to Rome. their roles would be to teach maize agriculture to the Empire. Other things we could learn from the Injuns, if we managed to reach Central and South America, using inoculation techniques as much as possible, would be...<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how to beat metals into thin sheets like the aztecs and incas and mayans. While they did it for aesthetics we would use the knowledge to create lightweight body armor. (Hopefully our policy of very, very limited contact would not wipe out everyone in the Americas. the plan is to nurse the era of contact so that when we take shit over we have native slaves instead of africans)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;African policy would be very, very simple...every man woman and child south of the Nile has to die. No survivors. aiding and abetting survivors is the death penalty for you and your entire family, including distant relatives. No Niggers Left would be State policy.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wherever the line was that separated Rome from the barbarians we would build the greatest wall of all time and we wouldnt push east in any visible manner. Agents would fan out into those lands to poison every well and burn every crop and assassinate every identified leader they could. We would depopulate the east if possible. No military adventures would ever take place beyond the eastern wall except from the beginning of spring until mid-fall. under no circumstances would we fuck around there in winter.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; jews would star in the games.<\/span>","time":1492008208,"resto":120753173,"id":"AVDfHcO6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120762726,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:44:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120758221\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120758221<\/a><br>Are you a goddamned kike?","time":1492008260,"resto":120753173,"id":"W9Grhxoj","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":120762769,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:44:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120759034\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120759034<\/a><br>I think that if you where the inventor of every modern technology they would give you a free pass for everything.","time":1492008284,"resto":120753173,"id":"3OYojznr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

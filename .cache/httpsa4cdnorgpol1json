If only one has it, there is a 50% chance that the gene is lost to the child.<br><br>Thus, if one parent has a lot of good genes and the other lacks these, you are statistically bound to cause lasting harm to the genepool. What genes are good or bad, we still do not exactly know.<br><br>In most cases the parents offer a mix of good and bad and the result will be randomly better or worse. This way you can mix two &quot;good&quot; parents and still end up with absolute trash. <br><br>Breeding humans to the point where one could speak of races as animal breeders can is quite impossible, as humans have a tendency to escape out of their cages and murder you in your sleep. You can make a case for geographical isolation causing a certain standard set of genes to beome predominant, which may also coincide with a distinguishable phenotype, but very few human populations remain truly isolated for long and there is pretty much always at least a small exchange of genes between neighbouring populations.<br><br>Effectively if there was a &quot;smart&quot; gene in european whites, it would have passed onto all populations in the world eventually in small numbers. This way you could end up with a few &quot;european-smart&quot; sub-saharan africans, but the overall populace would not have it unless the gene had been the difference between survivial or not for many generations.","time":1492294505,"resto":121262101,"id":"HCF1ZkfB","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121270445,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)18:18:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hmm, I participate actively in several sports and there is nary a nigger to be found.

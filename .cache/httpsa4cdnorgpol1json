The 2012 National survey on Drug Use and Health estimates that 2.7 million people 12 years of age and older meet the DSM-IV criteria for dependence on Marijuana. More so, an adolescent brain is much more suspectable to addiction than an adult. This has received support from studies where animals have shown that parental exposure to THC can recalibrate the sensitivity of the reward system to other drugs. That same exposure affects interferes with cytoskeletal dynamics which are critical for the establishment of axonal connections between neurons.","filename":"SayNoToWeed","ext":".jpg","w":484,"h":502,"tn_w":241,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493694317866,"time":1493694317,"md5":"AIhG4rnqwAz5w9CRL2puww==","fsize":60291,"resto":0,"id":"ypSMYy9H","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-are-a-degenerate-if-you-smoke-marijuana","country_name":"United States","replies":272,"images":46,"omitted_posts":267,"omitted_images":45,"tail_size":50},{"no":123748713,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:12:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123748098\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123748098<\/a><br>Do cars or guns alter your ability to think? <br><br>No?

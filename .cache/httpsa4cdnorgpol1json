Assad being in power is not beneficial, after all he is Putins lap dog, not the US&#039;s. Thats not an american port in syria, its a russian port. Its not coincidence that every middle eastern dictator has met a gruesome fate, the question is why do you care. Do you actually care about the Syrian people? The same people you recognize as shitskin terrorists? The foreign terrorists came in after Assads own people started shooting his soldiers in retaliation. Its a civil war after all, not an invasion force. Clearly the current political climate of the middle east isnt stable. The french and british fucked that up a long time ago when they drew the map and created all these fake countries.

During most of that time I was a Natsoc sympathizer. He would paint them in such a good light and give me redpills, but I wasn&#039;t going to fully buy everything off of just one guy.<br><br>Started to look into it myself. Browsed the approcity and other racialist message boards. What really opened my eyes was The Greatest Story Never Told documentary made by Denis Wise. World-view changing if your open to it. <br><br>That&#039;s when it hit me hard. I was incredibly angry, sad, yet inspired. I couldn&#039;t believe how history had been painted in almost an opposite light of what really happened. Germany was fighting to preserve the West, our culture, and everything our people hold dear. I felt regret, that I would never have a chance to experience true Western culture, that nobody really ever will again unless some miracle happens.<br><br>Since then, I have had a lot of ups and downs (to put lightly). But lately, I&#039;ve felt pretty depressed about it all. I can&#039;t go a day without thinking how that war effects the world in every conceivable way. In many ways, it hasn&#039;t ended. But it seems we&#039;ve been on the loosing end for decades. <br><br>I&#039;m thankful I have a few close friends (actually my best friends from high school and college) that have the same views as me. But even despite that, I feel estranged from society, that I will never fit in or relate to others. Overall, would not recommend. <br><br>Spoiler alert: it will probably ruin your life in a lot of ways. But If your like me and value truth, go for it.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":669,"h":1001,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493178280622,"time":1493178280,"md5":"eH9u1gANnFllzdT+kB+AJw==","fsize":163901,"resto":122829204,"id":"L0E8HTJB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122837862,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:44:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122829204\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122829204<\/a><br>\/pol\/ made me hate Hitler and Nazism far more than any Jew ever has.

The practical upshot of this is that the exposure to new information was nearly identical for most people. Either you read the news paper or you didn&#039;t. That was it. There was one story and you could choose your reaction to it and have different opinions on it but that&#039;s all it was, the one thing. Even moving forward into the age of radio the amount of programs were still limited and often would simply be a vocalization of what was written in the newspaper, with culture and reactions in the news being nonpartisan in order to reach the widest audience possible.<br><br>However if one compares modern or even 90s news to older sources of news, there is pressure to do the exact opposite. As there are so many sources, one has to stand out, and often this means presenting a biased view in order to fully capture one part of an audience rather than having to compete for more than one.<br><br>Thus the birth (at least in the U.S.) of news stations like Fox, MSNBC, etc.<br><br>That is merely an aside of course.<br><br>What is important is that it can be seen clearly that experiences of news alone are drastically different in the past than they are now, and lead to a further spread of culture amongst the population.<br><br>The current state of politics is a great example of this. If one looks up &quot;millenial traits&quot; you likely won&#039;t find &quot;radically traditionalist&quot; amongst them although there are clearly radical traditionalists who are supposedly in the &quot;millenial&quot; generation despite their politics. Moreover, there are similarly &quot;millenials&quot; who have little interest in phones or &#039;social media&#039;.<br><br>3\/4, misjudged, sorry","time":1490385337,"resto":118104251,"id":"l+iCB8Zd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118121456,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)15:55:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is where the trend to append a new &#039;generational&#039; label fails as those who apply it can only denote those cultures which are most apparent, in the case of modern times, the ones pushed by the media.<br><br>The &quot;millenial&quot; generation then is not a product of the people but rather a product of the media.<br><br>Culture in the 2000s has radicalized too heavily for the media to cover all aspects even in a cursory sense so much as before instead of engaging in a nonpartisan view, the most profitable one is shown in which the &#039;average&#039; person is lionized to be the &#039;central norm&#039; of a group of people.<br><br>An analogy of this would be describing &#039;workers&#039; in terms of fast food rather than in terms of neuroscience based on the number of workers.

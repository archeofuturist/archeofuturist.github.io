I tend to relate more to people on television who are just themselves, for good or for bad, than I do to someone who I believe is putting on some sort of persona.&quot;[1]<br><br>Here he pretty much states how he does not want to be a &quot;normal&quot; fitting in news reporter he wants to be &quot;himself.&quot; Which on the surface doesn&#039;t sound bad at all in fact it sounds appealing to almost everyone. The problem here is that he is literally influencing the state of the entire world with a position like his. He stretches past the veil of a news anchor and wants to be himself and give his own opinions and beliefs on any matter. Breaking the actual reason we have news reporters, to get the news; nowdays its the exact opposite. Any news anchor from any source will no longer just &quot;tell you the news&quot; they will give their opinion which even if you don&#039;t know it will sub-consiously prime your thoughts[2].

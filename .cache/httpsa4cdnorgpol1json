She talks about how her high school bf &quot;pumped and dumped&quot; her. She wanted to abort because &quot;muh freedom&quot;, but he talks her out of it. She goes on to make a secret abortion appointment anyways. The day before, extreme guilt racks her with panic attacks, so she cancels the appointment. <br><br>She spends like half the post talking about how the baby ruined &quot;her&quot; life and how it wrecked her body and now she no longer tries to look good for anyone. She complains about how after the baby ruined her body, no men are interested in her. Literally half the goddamn post is her whining about how the child ruined her life and how her ex is living the perfect life while she is shackled to her &quot;little human&quot; mourning how she could have been a supermodel, partying all night, getting gangbanged by foreigners, and &quot;living&quot;. Literally all of her ambitions are gone and she even admits she has never worked a job and is living off of gibsmedats.

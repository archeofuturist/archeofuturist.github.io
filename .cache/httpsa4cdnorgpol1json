Life seems inherently meaningless and without value. And having children just seems absurd. The family structure is destroyed and divorce is inevitable at this point. Children are fucking annoying and expensive not to mention will take up all of your time. Besides it seems cruel to impose non consenting life on a sentient being. I for one am childfree and although I am only a measly 19 years of age I plan to get sterilized. I am an antinatalist. Antinatalism is the most advanced form of evolution. We can reason and make logical decisions unlike animals. Once we realize that having children is a pointless absurd silly thing to do we reach the pinnacle of human evolution. Prove me wrong. The white race is superior and is already showing signs of the ultimate evolution.

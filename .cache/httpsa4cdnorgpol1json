Take this paragraph about homogeneity in Japan<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Racial homogeneity means Japan has none of the oppressive machinery America has instituted to cope with \u201cdiversity.\u201d It has no civil rights commissions, equal employment offices, or diversity consultants. Japanese never yelp about discrimination when something goes wrong, and never sue employers for \u201cracism.\u201d There is no racial tension, race riots, or hate laws. No one gets in trouble because the board of directors is all Japanese or because all the faces on television are Japanese. Nobody complains about \u201cprofiling\u201d when the police pat down the most likely trouble-makers. No one is ever fired because he said something \u201cinsensitive\u201d or told a forbidden joke or used a forbidden slur. Elections are about politics, not about whether Hispanics or blacks are taking over. Voting districts can have logical geograpahic boundaries, because no one worries about whether black or Hispanic votes are being diluted. There are no ethnic or national minorities that meddle with Japan\u2019s foreign policy.

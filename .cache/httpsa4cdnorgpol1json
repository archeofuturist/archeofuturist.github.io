His views were holistic views based on the golden mean to attain true and lasting happiness. This is not something that just philosophers look for, anon. If anything the philosophers believed that ideally the common man should live simple, rustic, and traditional agrarian lives. Sex was a means of creating new life, based on marriage that tied two families into a single familial bond. Homosexual sex was seen as unseemly and self gratifying. It was seen as something that did not edify a brotherly bond.","time":1491473467,"resto":119720632,"id":"52dsttX\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119727874,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)06:13:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119721901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119721901<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;objectively hot<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;objectively<\/span><br>Buhahah.

His name is Yahushua. He was obedient to His Father to the end in every way. If He lives in you, you ought walk just as He did, following Torah. The law does not pass away until heaven and earth pass away. That happens in Revelation 21:1. It has not happened yet. Man does not live by bread alone, but by every word from the mouth of YHWH (God). <br><br>Ask yourself, did God speak Torah to Moses? He did. How should man live? By every word, or only the words your teachers tell you are not &quot;done away with.&quot; <br><br>&quot;Ceremonial law&quot; is a man-made concept that is not found in Scripture. All of God&#039;s law is moral. <br><br>YHWH bless you.","time":1492661846,"resto":121880559,"id":"nC3kScCg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121951187,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:22:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121947330\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121947330<\/a><br>Aren&#039;t you like supposed to record a shooting in the favela rodrigo?","time":1492662128,"resto":121880559,"id":"O7pKKV+J","country":"PR","country_name":"Puerto Rico"},{"no":121951824,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:28:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121881964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121881964<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121883858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121883858<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i&#039;m a gnostic<\/span><br>just fuck off retard","filename":"1468542858064","ext":".jpg","w":423,"h":590,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492662496569,"time":1492662496,"md5":"OjTnVCT0b9z2zYX+MkJxfA==","fsize":138618,"resto":121880559,"id":"ED7ssMzx","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121951983,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:29:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121932615\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121932615<\/a><br>If this is true, a single desert jew is better than anything the pagan &#039;west&#039; had to offer.<br><br>Pathetic really.","filename":"1464576609114","ext":".png","w":600,"h":900,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492662597415,"time":1492662597,"md5":"nX\/PPYN7YsggWXAIuaoWLg==","fsize":1198684,"resto":121880559,"id":"yigalRju","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121946449,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)23:38:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"Women will be obsolete.<br><br>We will be free.

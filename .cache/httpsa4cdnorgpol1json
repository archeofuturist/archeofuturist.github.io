When some guy just snaps out of nowhere and kills his woman, &quot;their&quot; child, and then himself. Nobody ever talks about it beyond saying men are just inherently violent. Bad men.<br><br>Not saying it&#039;s defensible but if buddy figures out his child isn&#039;t his - and this is the case for 1 in 20 children born in the West, I would argue with today&#039;s culture this figure is rising - and realizes he&#039;s trapped, gonna have to pay for Chad&#039;s spawn one way of the other for the rest of his life... add in maybe that the woman KNOWS he&#039;s trapped and rubs it in his face if they get in an argument about it... all of a sudden it&#039;s way less of a mystery why he snapped.<br><br>Current law generally states that any child born into a marriage is the responsibility of both parents, but with today&#039;s DNA tech that is BULLSHIT and I look forward to it being struck down. <br><br>Any guy who figures out his kid ain&#039;t his and can prove it with DNA should have a clear path out of that situation.

Explain your sexual orientation to me in terms of intimacy. I&#039;ve been watching some gay porn lately, mostly amateur stuff just to see what the fuss is about and I was a little taken aback. If you watch straight or even lesbian amateur porn, there is a lot of emphasis placed on intimacy, kissing, close contact, cumming together, a lot of skin touching. <br><br>In most of these gay clips there is basically a seedy undercurrent of rape, power play, domination and submission. Often an older man will pin down and force fuck a younger man who does his best to sound like a woman or a younger boy. The concept is enforced by roleplaying, titles such as &quot;daddy breeds my ass&quot;, &quot;straight teen broken in&quot;, &quot;twink can&#039;t handle 10 inches&quot;, &quot;new fuck toy&quot;. The sex is often brusque, direct insertion, no foreplay, the bottom is power fucked until the guy on top cums, dicks get sucked often but the goal seems to be to force someone to cum as quickly as possible. I thought I would be extremely disgusted, but I am just left puzzled. This is what you fought so hard for? To be basically raped and\/or rape over and over again? And this is just the vanilla gay stuff. Don&#039;t get me started on the creepy dudes who stick horse sized dildos into their assholes and stretch their stomachs out.<br><br>Not only is your lovemaking pointless and unnatural, it seems to be more of a denial of your biology than anything else. Clearly, CLEARLY, the bottom wants to be a female but is stuck in a male body. Clearly the top wants to rape or physically force the bottom to submit after initial resistance. No kissing, no intimacy just psychopathic hedonism, rushed pleasure and self-gratification. Are you all just broken and mentally ill? If medical science got us to hormone pills before society embraced homosexuality would you all just be trannies instead?<br><br>mature discussion pls.","filename":"1489431750476","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492180331129,"time":1492180331,"md5":"gLSLWPBrsblkUvKlLgi5bA==","fsize":234341,"resto":0,"id":"boVg3Pr8","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-question-is-mostly-to-the-few-gays-we-have","country_name":"Australia","replies":87,"images":24,"omitted_posts":82,"omitted_images":23},{"no":121072174,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:24:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Join the OFFICIAL \/polgb\/ Discord:<br><br>https:\/\/discord.gg\/9URub","filename":"polgbt2","ext":".jpg","w":1420,"h":1922,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492183442171,"time":1492183442,"md5":"ADb2VxQmSSjdFAk\/qMUCew==","fsize":103728,"resto":121066282,"id":"vPzkRBqE","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121072262,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:24:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121071490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121071490<\/a><br>Same as any bond youd have with another male.<br>Youd have no issue with it if those that partook also fathered children?","time":1492183488,"resto":121066282,"id":"KizC1IDk","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121072456,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:26:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121066282\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121066282<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121066526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121066526<\/a><br>im not gonna lie.<br>i wish i was a girl.<br><br>i use submissive homosexualty to mask that pain","filename":"cute cuddle","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":282,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492183592971,"time":1492183592,"md5":"Qmqv3LKykcKYNIgs2GfIYQ==","fsize":925814,"resto":121066282,"id":"40PLuobT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121072608,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:27:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121066526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121066526<\/a><br>What the fuck did I just watch","filename":"0f4b4df4f7a8992034ab48e355992f79","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":1104,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492183665082,"time":1492183665,"md5":"nRHsyTuFzZ0SnDpYZMF1qg==","fsize":186031,"resto":121066282,"id":"4lUtb3M+","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121072850,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:29:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121066282\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121066282<\/a><br>Porn is gross.<br><br>But I can honestly say that there&#039;s a strong undercurrent of self-loathing and masochism throughout the gay community, at least from what I&#039;ve seen.

We spend a lot of time on foreplay, oral is most commonly the &quot;main event.&quot; Anal CAN be nice, but it requires a lot of preparation, and it can kind of cause some pain and digestive issues the next day, so it doesn&#039;t happen often. We&#039;ve done a little bit of roleplaying and kinkier stuff, but it generally tends to be pretty affectionate and &quot;vanilla.&quot; I like it that way<br><br>In fairness to the masochistic types - most of them have awful, tragic relationships with their families. Many of them were molested when they were very young. That&#039;s usually where this type of behavior comes from.

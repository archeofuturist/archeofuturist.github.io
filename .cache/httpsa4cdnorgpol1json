The leader of the expedition was Steve Currey and he suddenly died from a brain tumour shortly before the expedition began so all of the money they got from people who were going to join the expedition was refunded. The new leader of the expedition was Brooks Agnew and the new expedition was meant to be in 2013, but shortly after THAT expedition was about to begin, his film crew suddenly vanished without a trace so THAT expedition was cancelled too (and, once again, the money they got from people who wanted to join their expedition was refunded). The expedition was\/is known as the &#039;North Pole Inner Earth Expedition&#039;. Here&#039;s a link to the official North Pole Inner Earth Expedition page:<br><br>http:\/\/www.x2-radio.com\/phoenixscie<wbr>ncefoundation\/npiee\/index.html <br><br>Also, Terry Smith was an Alaskan bush pilot associated with this expedition who agreed to fly directly over the North Pole to see if there was an opening there but he suddenly died in a plane crash on August 9 2010 before he could make that flight. NONE of these incidents are (((coincidences))).

It has been estimated that as a result of Earth&#039;s rotation on its axis during its formative state, polar depressions and openings thus formed would measure about 1,400 miles in diameter. <br><br>Some of the original fire and incandescent materials remained in the center of Earth to form a central &#039;sun&#039;, much smaller, of course, than our Sun, but capable of emitting light and supporting plant growth. We shall also see that the Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis that illuminate the sky over the poles come from this central &#039;sun&#039; whose rays shine through the polar openings. Thus, if Earth was originally a ball of fire and molten metal, some of this fire remained in its centre, while centrifugal force as a result of its rotation on its axis caused its solid matter to be thrown toward the surface, forming a solid crust and leaving its interior hollow, with a fiery ball in its centre, forming the central sun, which provides illumination for plant, animal and human life.","filename":"astronaut","ext":".jpg","w":1331,"h":1024,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1490453096468,"time":1490453096,"md5":"tLjlxebt5H\/KwnFCDnopIA==","fsize":177664,"resto":118203515,"id":"4GBoEO9S","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118229808,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)10:33:54","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/ptg\/ PRESIDENT TRUMP GENERAL - &quot;Blue Collar Billionaire&quot; EDITION","com":"PRESIDENT DONALD J TRUMP<br>https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov<br>https:\/\/www.donaldjtrump.com\/<br>DAILY SCHEDULE (WH Press Corps)<br>https:\/\/publicpool.kinja.com\/<br>Trump Playlist<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/X9qQJVKJ<br> <br>APPEARANCES<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump Weekly Address #9 3\/24\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZGt6lkLApuo<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump meets Medal of Honor Recipients 3\/24\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/LWhzEfdjeHg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump statement on Healthcare Law 3\/24\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/7F2pGAhaiSI<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump hosts Greek Independence Day party 3\/24\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/nHC0lNmTfrM<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump meets Charter CEO w\/Gov Abbott 3\/24\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/RNSbOnqAXrw<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump meets Natl Econ council 3\/24\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/ildvB672GDA<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump meets with Truckers 3\/23\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/o9pT5vs6sGY<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump roundtable w\/truckers 3\/23\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/4VSpfqjxvW0<br>PREV APPEARANCES<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/ynXV6CHT<br>NEWTRUMP NIGHTLY NEWS<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/yArfUKdC<br>WH PRESS BRIEFINGS<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/QidpHWKJ<br> <br>FUN STUFF<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TrumpWave S P A C E<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/s1qhafzPkAM<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Story behind MAGA hats<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/Aoro6PA9S6g<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;God Emperor Trump Was Born To Rule<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/pf4RSgb_Pqg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Donald Trump Emperor of America<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/xQCaWLF2gfs<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TrumpBot vs Mexico<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/jNmTBESoJ1A<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shadilay<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZNriNoWOtXA<br> <br>INSPIRATION<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/Nyuv_bPSHBA<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hold Back The Night<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/ldnH5ms50Jc<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Inauguration of Fire<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/XKf8jSiaghU<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;#TrumpTheEstablishement<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/kIsctZlgMqg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;American Hero<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/d-X3BVxySLo<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TRUMP - MAGA<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/PagVeZgHbhk<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump Triumphant<\/span><br>www.dailymotion.com\/video\/x4ulway<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We Are The Silent Majority<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/3lrrPG5iPAk<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;American Comeback Story<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/pm8n9qVIK_8<br> <br>OP pastebin: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/nygxu29R<br>prev <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118224023#p118224023\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118224023<\/a>","filename":"1486605950322","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":517,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":172,"tim":1490452434869,"time":1490452434,"md5":"JzzVsU9aJISmpd5thWn2fg==","fsize":48901,"resto":0,"id":"\/2FEuLNj","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ptg-president-trump-general-blue-collar","country_name":"Australia","replies":62,"images":22,"omitted_posts":57,"omitted_images":19},{"no":118230824,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)10:44:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118230623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118230623<\/a><br>A lotta loyalty for an elected official","time":1490453059,"resto":118229808,"id":"Dkw5xm8I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118230836,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)10:44:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118230786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118230786<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He thinks Congress works for the people<\/span><br><br>ha ha ha","time":1490453066,"resto":118229808,"id":"KBi\/P+SX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118230850,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)10:44:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118230169\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118230169<\/a><br>Not interested in SnK S2?

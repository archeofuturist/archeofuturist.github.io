But I really do not give a fuck, I don&#039;t care enough to make a ruckus about it. I just don&#039;t. <br>There are people out there who feel a deep-seated horror at the thought of it, and who feel it&#039;s their moral imperative to stop it. That&#039;s cool, good for them.

The best compromise, in my opinion, is to stop forcing them to pay for the wanton slaughter of unborn children for the sake of convenience with their own tax dollars. At the very least, we can give them that. Why the fuck would we be paying for that anyway? <br><br>On that note, leftists have really taken to the argument that Planned Parenthood has to keep being funded by the government because it provides oh so many super duper important services for women other than abortion. They seem to think this is an airtight argument, and conservatives have even begun saying they&#039;d support funding PP if they stopped performing abortions. <br>No. Cut that shit out. <br>Not to sound like an MRA fag, but why should the government be paying for any of that shit? Why do my tax dollars have to pay for pap smears and mammograms, let alone some teenage slut&#039;s birth control? Where does this moral imperative to force all of society to pay for female-specific healthcare come from? When my dad spends a full night drinking shit-your-brains-out juice so that the doctor will have an easier time jamming a hand up his ass the following morning, he pays for it himself. Seriously, how do women act this entitled with a straight face? Should we just start doing that? Should we be marching through Washington D.C. with signs that say &quot;You don&#039;t get to suck my dick just because I have a throbbing erection&quot; and screaming about the matriarchy refusing to pay for our vasectomies?

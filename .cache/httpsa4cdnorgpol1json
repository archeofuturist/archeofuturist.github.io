Explain your sexual orientation to me in terms of intimacy. I&#039;ve been watching some gay porn lately, mostly amateur stuff just to see what the fuss is about and I was a little taken aback. If you watch straight or even lesbian amateur porn, there is a lot of emphasis placed on intimacy, kissing, close contact, cumming together, a lot of skin touching. <br><br>In most of these gay clips there is basically a seedy undercurrent of rape, power play, domination and submission. Often an older man will pin down and force fuck a younger man who does his best to sound like a woman or a younger boy. The concept is enforced by roleplaying, titles such as &quot;daddy breeds my ass&quot;, &quot;straight teen broken in&quot;, &quot;twink can&#039;t handle 10 inches&quot;, &quot;new fuck toy&quot;. The sex is often brusque, direct insertion, no foreplay, the bottom is power fucked until the guy on top cums, dicks get sucked often but the goal seems to be to force someone to cum as quickly as possible. I thought I would be extremely disgusted, but I am just left puzzled. This is what you fought so hard for? To be basically raped and\/or rape over and over again? And this is just the vanilla gay stuff. Don&#039;t get me started on the creepy dudes who stick horse sized dildos into their assholes and stretch their stomachs out.<br><br>Not only is your lovemaking pointless and unnatural, it seems to be more of a denial of your biology than anything else. Clearly, CLEARLY, the bottom wants to be a female but is stuck in a male body. Clearly the top wants to rape or physically force the bottom to submit after initial resistance. No kissing, no intimacy just psychopathic hedonism, rushed pleasure and self-gratification. Are you all just broken and mentally ill? If medical science got us to hormone pills before society embraced homosexuality would you all just be trannies instead?<br><br>mature discussion pls.","filename":"1489431750476","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492180331129,"time":1492180331,"md5":"gLSLWPBrsblkUvKlLgi5bA==","fsize":234341,"resto":0,"id":"boVg3Pr8","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-question-is-mostly-to-the-few-gays-we-have","country_name":"Australia","replies":23,"images":8,"omitted_posts":18,"omitted_images":7},{"no":121067413,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:43:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121067207\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121067207<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wtf is going on in a dudes mind where he wants anything inserted into him<\/span><br>Search: prostate orgasm","filename":"canadian_bottoms","ext":".png","w":720,"h":603,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1492180980309,"time":1492180980,"md5":"PIT+AwQ5G18oOAr6pPuGgg==","fsize":652801,"resto":121066282,"id":"A82CWbxF","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121067465,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:43:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121067048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121067048<\/a><br><br>This","time":1492181007,"resto":121066282,"id":"+hI9ozuJ","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121067487,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:43:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121066526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121066526<\/a><br>No, because trans is not a real thing","time":1492181021,"resto":121066282,"id":"yAce7xki","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121067603,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:44:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121067487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121067487<\/a><br>Bigot.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=TpK<wbr>1gf-rw5s","filename":"stefonknee","ext":".jpg","w":2560,"h":1440,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492181081325,"time":1492181081,"md5":"6eCcte4GiD2YEdE4B0eb0Q==","fsize":423080,"resto":121066282,"id":"A82CWbxF","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121067615,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:44:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m a crossdresser.<br>I want to be a (gentle) top.

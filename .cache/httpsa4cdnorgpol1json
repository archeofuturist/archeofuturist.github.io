The party had produced hate-filled rhetoric not seen in Europe since World War II. Van Doorn\u2019s former party was responsible for producing the film Fitna, which defamed Islam, resulting in widespread protests throughout the world.<br>And then came his change. \u201cMy story of how I came to Islam is not remarkable,\u201d he says very humbly. When he saw the outrage caused by the film, he made a concerted effort to study the Qur\u2019an, Hadith collections and the biography of the Prophet (peace be upon him). After some time, he realized that Islam was the total opposite of what he had thought it was, and it then became easy to embrace the faith.<br>Van Doorn acknowledges that his views on Islam were formed 10 to 15 years ago based solely on negative stereotypes and prejudices spread by the media. \u201cFor me, Islam was a violent religion that oppressed women and was no good for society,\u201d he says.<br>After embracing Islam and assisted by the Toronto-based Canadian Da\u2019wah Association, Van Doorn visited the Kingdom this week to perform Umrah. He also visited the Prophet\u2019s Mosque in Madinah.<br>Van Doorn met Sheikh Abdul-Rahman Al-Sudais, imam of the Grand Mosque and head of the Presidency for the Affairs of the Two Holy Mosques. Al-Sudais said he was delighted that Allah had selected Van Doorn to become a Muslim. Van Doorn expressed his sorrow and regret for helping to distribute Fitna, although he had no part in its production, to which Al-Sudais quoted the Qur\u2019anic verse stating that good deeds wipe out bad ones. Van Doorn intends to do good by making a film about the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), to present a true picture of Islam.","filename":"1430063907882-0","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490760000354,"time":1490760000,"md5":"R0m6XbTu47vk7PUMc3urkQ==","fsize":152060,"resto":118741468,"id":"ahc9kC4Q","country":"IN","country_name":"India"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118743228,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)23:51:48","name":"Anonymous","sub":"DRIP

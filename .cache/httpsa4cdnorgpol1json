One of the unique aspects of Rader\u2019s crime spree was his enormous ego; he kept in contact with the press in the 1970s in an effort to spread fear throughout Wichita. In an early letter, he blamed \u201cFactor X\u201d as the motivation behind his murders. Rader fancied himself as an aficionado of serial killers and said that everyone from Jack The Ripper to Ted Bundy to the Son of Sam had the same Factor X.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After his arrest, he narrowed down what Factor X was: a demon. In 2007, he described it being as something that \u201ccontrols\u201d his desire to kill. He\u2019s even drawn it\u2014depicting it in varying ways as a frog or as a more traditional-looking demon. It was Factor X that pushed him that fateful day, he claimed. \u201cI knew somewhere along the line of eighth grade or freshman in high school that I had some abnormal tendencies at that point in time. But it exploded on January 15, 1974. That\u2019s when the ball game exploded.

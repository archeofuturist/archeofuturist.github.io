Seven out of 10 Turks have never even read a book. Sennels points out the difficulties this creates for Muslims seeking to succeed in the West. &quot;A lower IQ, together with a religion that denounces critical thinking, surely makes it harder for many Muslims to have success in our high-tech knowledge societies.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Only nine Muslims have ever won the Nobel Prize, and five of those were for the &quot;Peace Prize.&quot; According to Nature magazine, Muslim countries produce just 10 percent of the world average when it comes to scientific research measured by articles per million inhabitants.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In Denmark, Sennels\u2019 native country, Muslim children are grossly over represented among children with special needs. One-third of the budget for Danish schools is consumed by special education, and anywhere from 51% to 70% of retarded children with physical handicaps in Copenhagen have an immigrant background. Learning ability is severely affected as well. Studies indicated that 64% of schoolchildren with Arabic parents are still illiterate after 10 years in the Danish school system. The immigrant dropout rate in Danish high schools is twice that of the native-born.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mental illness is also a product. The closer the blood relative, the higher the risk of schizophrenic illness. The increased risk of insanity may explain why more than 40% of patients in Denmark\u2019s biggest ward for clinically insane criminals have an immigrant background. The U.S. is not immune. According to Sennels, &quot;One study based on 300,000 Americans shows that the majority of Muslims in the USA have a lower income, are less educated, and have worse jobs than the population as a whole.&quot;<\/span>","time":1491146928,"resto":119181779,"id":"H\/4onuiI","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":119210136,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)11:29:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119209070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119209070<\/a><br>You know that these 25% people have massive identity issues and hate their part-nation. <br><br>Also only East-Asians can measure up to Europeans.","time":1491146944,"resto":119181779,"id":"f4OJN1Xi","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119210138,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)11:29:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119210104\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119210104<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sennels concludes: There is no doubt that the wide spread tradition of first cousin marriages among Muslims has harmed the gene pool among Muslims. Because Muslims\u2019 religious beliefs prohibit marrying non-Muslims and thus prevents them from adding fresh genetic material to their population, the genetic damage done to their gene pool since their prophet allowed first cousin marriages 1,400 years ago are most likely massive. This has produced overwhelming direct and indirect human and societal consequences.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bottom line: Islam is not simply a benign and morally equivalent alternative to the Judeo-Christian tradition.

What you\u2019re referring to as Elites, is in fact, JEW\/Elites, or as I\u2019ve recently taken to calling it, JEW plus Elites. Elites are not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning ((JEW)) system made useful by the JEW Old Testament, jew social utilities and vital system components comprising a full State as defined by Constitution.<br>Many citizens live a modified version of the JEW system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of JEW which is widely used today is often called \u201cDemocracy\u201d, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the JEW system, developed by the JEW Project. There really are Elites, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use.<br>Elites are the kernel: the element in the system that allocates the states\u2019s resources to the other programs that run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Elites are normally used in combination with the JEW world order: the whole system is basically JEW with Elites added, or JEW\/Elites. All the so-called \u201cElite\u201d variations are really variations of JEW\/Elites.","time":1491478504,"resto":119720632,"id":"beCIFBXJ","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119734264,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)07:44:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119731933\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119731933<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes, but you&#039;re talking about rape.

The law doesn&#039;t do that much, its society that changes.<\/span><br><br>The Rotherham scandal is partly due to immigration from a society in which age of consent laws are lax and sex with teenagers is destigmatised. Doesn&#039;t help your case much. The Catholic priest scandal is an example of full-on pedophilia (something which we can hopefully both agree should remain illegal), and both scandals were also due to shitty enforcement of the law by incompetent\/corrupt authorities.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the US we have an extremely high amount of drug abuse and cartels\/gangs peddling drugs, despite the most harsh laws in history.<\/span><br><br>Because social attitudes to doing drugs and having sex with minors are different.

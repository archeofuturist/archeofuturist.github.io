It is a mistake to think that here He is giving either of those roles to Peter. There is a sense in which the apostles played a foundational role in the building of the church (Ephesians 2:20), but the role of primacy is reserved for Christ alone, not assigned to Peter. So, Jesus\u2019 words here are best interpreted as a simple play on words in that a boulder-like truth came from the mouth of one who was called a small stone. And Christ Himself is called the \u201cchief cornerstone\u201d (1 Peter 2:6, 7). The chief cornerstone of any building was that upon which the building was anchored. If Christ declared Himself to be the cornerstone, how could Peter be the rock upon which the church was built? It is more likely that the believers, of which Peter is one, are the stones which make up the church, anchored upon the Cornerstone, \u201cand he who believes on Him will by no means be put to shame\u201d (1 Peter 2:6).<br><br>The Roman Catholic Church uses the argument that Peter is the rock to which Jesus referred as evidence that it is the one true church. As we have seen, Peter&#039;s being the rock is not the only valid interpretation of this verse. Even if Peter is the rock in Matthew 16:18, this is meaningless in giving the Roman Catholic Church any authority. Scripture nowhere records Peter being in Rome. Scripture nowhere describes Peter as being supreme over the other apostles. The New Testament does not describe Peter as being the \u201call authoritative leader\u201d of the early Christian church. Peter was not the first pope, and Peter did not start the Roman Catholic Church. The origin of the Catholic Church is not in the teachings of Peter or any other apostle. If Peter truly was the founder of the Roman Catholic Church, it would be in full agreement with what Peter taught (Acts chapter 2, 1 Peter, 2 Peter).","time":1492247608,"resto":121177212,"id":"S217NGmj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121191521,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:13:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121191443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121191443<\/a><br>That doesn&#039;t mean the early christians are PRODDIE or agree with them<br><br>Retard","time":1492247632,"resto":121177212,"id":"J9STZT4C","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121191529,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:14:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Happy Ishtar everyone!<br><br>It&#039;s that time of the year again where we celebrate the goddess of fertility and love.<br>But don&#039;t forget, love can be fatal!","filename":"Ishtar_vase_Louvre_AO17000-detail","ext":".jpg","w":528,"h":1168,"tn_w":56,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492247640274,"time":1492247640,"md5":"BP0C03XDBgxPvxRoYU5IWA==","fsize":458078,"resto":121177212,"id":"ymG6E\/m+","country":"AT","m_img":1,"country_name":"Austria"},{"no":121191586,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:14:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121180117\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121180117<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Please say prayers to these people who are not Jesus<\/span><br><br>Heresy<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You may not find salvation without going through a middle man (clergy)<\/span><br><br>Heresy<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You need to use a middle man (clergy) as a conduit for God<\/span><br><br>Supreme Heresy<br><br>Clergy are for spreading the word and education.

And it turns out your brain is actually amazingly plastic: it can be reconfigured in many different ways.

Since your brain is so plastic and can be reconfigured via repeated external stimuli, scientists, propaganda agencies and advertisement specialists have learnt to manipulate you to the very core, and you are unaware of it.

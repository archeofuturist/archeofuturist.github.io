It follows that to be of a minority demographic, say to be a European living in China, means for my features to be perceived among Chinese people, as a variation from the familiar image for what is to be a human.<br><br>Where intersectional feminism is especially retarded, is in seeing this as a bias. As a pathology. When majority demographics happen to constitute the familiar basis of certain categories, it is something they think is correct in shaming. You can not &quot;unlearn bias&quot;, as perception is always already based on familiar consistencies at the expense of variation. <br><br>If you happen to be of a minority demographic, you are going to just have to deal with being a variation among many norms. This isn&#039;t class oppression, for which through revolution you can &quot;dismantle privilege&quot;, achieving a utopia without majorities. Majorities can only give way to other majorities.<br><br>When for example you witness the accusation of white privilege, this effectively is the command to feel shame for happening to be of a majority demographic.

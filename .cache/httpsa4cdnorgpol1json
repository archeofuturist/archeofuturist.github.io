So Fat Our Vending Machines Are Adjusted In Response","com":"http:\/\/archive.is\/8sk6q<br><br>If you wanted a bag of Doritos from one of Brad Appelhans&#039; experimental vending machines, you&#039;d have to wait. The associate professor of preventative medicine at Rush University Medical Center designed a device that fits inside of vending machines and waits 25 seconds before releasing the typical processed snacks. But healthier fare \u2014 like peanuts or popcorn \u2014 drops instantly.<br><br>Think of it as a sort of &quot;time tax.&quot; The idea is that every second you spend waiting for a snack will make you want it less, similar to how a tax on sugary drinks might get you to buy less soda, Appelhans says.<br><br>&quot;We were interested in the ability to test whether time delays can nudge people to healthier choices,&quot; he says.<br><br>So, he created DISC, or &quot;Delays to Influence Snack Choice,&quot; to test the idea. The device is a platform inserted inside a vending machine that catches snacks falling from the top half of the machine, where a vending machine operator would sort all of the unhealthy snacks. On the display window, a written decal tells customers they&#039;ll have to wait for an extra 25 seconds for less-healthy snacks.<br><br>When a snack falls onto DISC, it triggers a 25-second countdown on the vending machine&#039;s display screen. At the end of the countdown, DISC drops its platform and the snack falls into the vending machine&#039;s bay. Healthier snacks are all sorted into the bottom half of the vending machine and so would bypass the platform altogether.<br><br>To qualify as &quot;healthy,&quot; snacks had to meet 5 out of 7 criteria, such as packing fewer than 250 calories, 350 mg of sodium or 10 mg of added sugars per serving, containing no transfats or getting less than 35 percent of their calories from fat. (Some might quibble with that last point.)","filename":"vendingmachine","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":670,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":186,"tim":1491139097332,"time":1491139097,"md5":"mUvrHOp48ycZidPU+Nhv7A==","fsize":202825,"resto":0,"id":"AhH4JoMC","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"americans-so-fat-our-vending-machines-are","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":2,"omitted_posts":4,"omitted_images":2},{"no":119199379,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:34:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;paying a 1.25 for a bag of stale popcorn that is maybe 50 calories<\/span><br><br>what if people buy food from vending machines because they want to be nourished? a tiny bag of peanuts or popcorn isn&#039;t going to keep you going very long.","time":1491140047,"resto":119198080,"id":"VZtKsTdC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119199471,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:35:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw somebody is paying this asshat to invent DISC<\/span>","time":1491140121,"resto":119198080,"id":"JDXbMc4z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119199634,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:37:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119198282\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119198282<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;19 19 82 82<\/span>","filename":"9674e3288291edfe35587673f59bca5ac8ffcaa99a783a7c574b967caf1d1691","ext":".jpg","w":260,"h":194,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491140233601,"time":1491140233,"md5":"XT9PuzCSfLgvZL2BL8Mg+Q==","fsize":4019,"resto":119198080,"id":"SxxyWHSa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119200124,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:42:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119198080\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119198080<\/a><br>Wait until Big Snack takes this to the Supreme Court.","time":1491140575,"resto":119198080,"id":"Hk5mSsa+","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119200303,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:44:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119199119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119199119<\/a><br>Every single bully in my high school was a giant fat slob<br><br>It&#039;s nothing what hollywood portrays it as.

Sounds like National Socialism-- right? The main difference is that the NS movement goes a step further and blames these philosophy&#039;s and all the other ills of the world on the Jews. Fascism is basically not anti-jewish and as a matter of fact had many Jewish members, including the grand Rabbi of Rome! Additionally, while they believe in the ideal of superior leaders rising to the top of government, Fascism is not racist.<br><br>Second; in the area of economics Fascism is based on more of a traditional form of socialism whereas National Socialism rejects traditional socialism as being just another Jewish swindle. The main difference is that Fascism is more rooted in an economic form of government while the NS movement is based on race and the folk community. While there clearly were socialist elements in the Third Reich these are actually closer to what we today have in America, with things like old age pensions and public health care. I have been repeatedly told that National Socialism uses any economic element that will benefit the people of their nation and is neither a left wing nor a right wing movement.<br><br>Fuck off Nazis.

I&#039;m just saying that the system that propagated their development was based on aggregating resources which was an early form of the process that became severely corrupt through the Cold War that bankrupted the people who lived in the societies where those R&amp;D power structures became entrenched. There appears to be more meritocracy in that earlier era, or more social mobility through merit. That social mobility has stagnated completely in the last decades, and any trace of meritocracy has been erased. Instead you have to participate in empty professionalism and tick the right boxes and be held in thrall to those boondoggle institutions to have a seat at the table for a comfortable stable life. Starting in the late 1800s there were industry titans who aggregated more resources than they were capable of managing without being affected by their capricious human limitations, and in doing that they made decisions for the lives of others that were unjustifiable. I don&#039;t believe that things were idyllic in the past, so much as it being the case that the information about institutional inefficiency wasn&#039;t available then.<br><br>It isn&#039;t a secret conspiring society, it&#039;s a network of self-interested people who don&#039;t have cause to question their place in society, because they don&#039;t want to have to give up their comfortable lifestyle that was afforded to them through irrational in-preference. It&#039;s human behavior en-masse, not a conspiracy. But letting that capricious human nature make unscrutinized decisions that have impacts for other people only furthers the amount of chaos to contend with in developing a stable society. All that does is continue to stratify people and further the rich-poor divide, which is untenable for long term stability.","time":1491140624,"resto":119190418,"id":"HOyF4eWI","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119200299,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:44:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119198725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119198725<\/a><br>Christian theology demands the Earth be 6k years old, abiogenic processes and the other fun stuff like the iron pirates from the inland sea that ravaged pre classical Egypt to the point they rebooted in 7k AD disprove that.","time":1491140688,"resto":119190418,"id":"My\/Q1g4P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119197595,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:11:55","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Jordan Peterson thread","com":"Explain, in a sentence, why this man is so based.","filename":"peterson meme 4","ext":".png","w":619,"h":602,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":243,"tim":1491138715367,"time":1491138715,"md5":"X09axxqf+c0ubgwoAK56vg==","fsize":119190,"resto":0,"id":"3twAUKJl","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"jordan-peterson-thread","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":12,"images":3,"omitted_posts":7,"omitted_images":2},{"no":119199743,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:38:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119198292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119198292<\/a><br><br>He is the father figure society tried to deny us. <br><br>But we found him in the chaos of the fray, nonetheless.<br><br>The dragon attacked him and so we clad him in the armour of our time (memes), revivifying him in the process.","time":1491140324,"resto":119197595,"id":"KU5qFBhx","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119199807,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:39:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119198323\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119198323<\/a>","filename":"1438937112176","ext":".jpg","w":267,"h":323,"tn_w":103,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491140370146,"time":1491140370,"md5":"hTWY8ivJ+ZWu0WFNZdPPFg==","fsize":7173,"resto":119197595,"id":"CqVGbr9g","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119199879,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:40:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119198618\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119198618<\/a><br><br>Damn - I&#039;ve watched a lot of his videos and I&#039;d never heard him say that about social anxiety and the dominance hierarchy.

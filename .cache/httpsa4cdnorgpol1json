Claiming that war was being declared &quot;on behalf of all Jews&quot;, economic boycotts against Germany followed, along with agitating for war with Germany and the destruction of the German people. Six years later World Jewry got what they openly said they wanted, total war against Germany and the German people. Amidst the terror bombing of German cities, Hitler threatened retaliation against the enemy population of Jews in Europe. The Allies didn&#039;t stop the slaughter of German civilians by the saturation bombing of cities, and Hitler made good on his threat of retaliation against enemy Jewish civilians. Many Jews loyal to Germany remained untouched, as is evidenced by the fact that millions of German Jews were still alive at the end of the war. These are irrefutable facts.

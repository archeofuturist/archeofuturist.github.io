Thus, they often do not know what they want (and will even admit as much in moments of lucidity). This is why, up until the 20th century, in every society on earth, women were more or less treated like the property of their father or oldest male relative until ownership was transferred to a husband with a formal contract and generally payment of a dowry. <br><br>Thus the father prevented the woman from riding the cock-carousel and getting pregnant by 16, and then the husband kept after her once she was his responsibility. Except in the worst cases, the couple learned to love each other and shoulder the responsibilities of adulthood and family management by the age of 30. <br><br>In the absence of this system, men and women both remain in a constant state of immaturity (with few exceptions) well into middle age, which contributes to general hedonism and irresponsibility. Women still don&#039;t know what they want so they sleep around until they&#039;re too old and then at 40 become professional spinsters whose only joys are ice cream and cats, or they manage to snag a beta, pop out a few kids, Rob him blind in the divorce, rinse and repeat until nobody will touch them anymore, then raise shattered wrecks of children because they didn&#039;t have a father or stable family growing up, children who will perpetuate and exacerbate the problems of their parents generation. <br><br>Long story short, women are too stupid for their own good, and when allowed to run wild, fuck up society as a whole for everyone, men, women, and children. Their incapability for rational thought extends into the political world, with disastrous consequences, which are collectively referred to as &quot;national suicide&quot;. The most lucid and rational women are the ones who will admit that they don&#039;t know what they want, that women are awful, and that they would sacrifice their own &quot;rights&quot; to make society better for all","time":1492195448,"resto":121090185,"id":"DQhzBgmi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121095759,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:44:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121092571\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121092571<\/a><br>hes right though schlomo","filename":"1492005650278","ext":".png","w":501,"h":585,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492195499652,"time":1492195499,"md5":"wqsZ9X\/FGSxp4dMlYyL16w==","fsize":100165,"resto":121090185,"id":"by+pg3bZ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121090514,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:00:42","name":"marina lopez","sub":"ask whatever to a young spanish girl!!","com":"will answer anything about spanish life, culture, people<br>pls be seriousss","filename":"1491140016408","ext":".png","w":865,"h":966,"tn_w":223,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492192842032,"time":1492192842,"md5":"fhQO2Euqr7n6qh3oHEF6qA==","fsize":54510,"resto":0,"id":"IAby90hy","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ask-whatever-to-a-young-spanish-girl","country_name":"Spain","replies":232,"images":38,"omitted_posts":227,"omitted_images":38,"tail_size":50},{"no":121095676,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:44:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121095479\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121095479<\/a><br><br>You again?

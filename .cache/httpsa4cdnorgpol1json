Impression Products is a small business with about 25 employees. It specializes in buying used printer cartridges and remanufacturing them. In 2012, Lexmark decided to add Impression to an already existing lawsuit against other remanufacturers. While the other defendants eventually settled, Image has stuck it out and the case has made it to the highest court in the land.<br><br>You can read the full, technical details of the case here but the simple version goes like this: Since the \u201890s Lexmark has used what\u2019s called a \u201cshrink-wrap license\u201d with its cartridges. It offers a \u201cprebate\u201d to consumers by knocking off 20% of the price in exchange for their agreement to never resell or reuse the cartridge. The consumer agrees to this the second they open the package. Essentially, Lexmark believes that those cartridges belong to them, not the consumer reselling them because the consumer didn\u2019t have the right to sell them in the first place.<br><br>25 years ago, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears patent cases, carved an exception out of the patent exhaustion principle allowing patentees to set post-sale restrictions so long as these are otherwise legal and \u201cclearly communicated.\u201d In a separate case, the Federal Circuit concluded that when a patented item is sold abroad, the patentee\u2019s U.S. rights are not exhausted at all. The Federal Circuit upheld both of these precedents when it ruled against Impression Products earlier this year. The Supreme Court has never ruled on either of them.<br><br>http:\/\/www.scotusblog.com\/2017\/03\/a<wbr>rgument-analysis-justices-skeptical<wbr>-categorical-exhaustion-patent-righ<wbr>ts\/","filename":"printerink","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490503197854,"time":1490503197,"md5":"Kap9854Z3o8WFSNkOH723w==","fsize":70064,"resto":0,"id":"U5CtO5Kj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"supreme-court-printer-cartridge-case-could-be-the","country_name":"United States","replies":104,"images":7,"omitted_posts":99,"omitted_images":7,"tail_size":50},{"no":118332959,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:09:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;not buying a lifetime supply of refill ink for $10<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.ebay.com\/itm\/10oz-Premiu<wbr>m-black-Refill-Ink-Kit-with-syringe<wbr>-for-All-Hp-Inkjet-Printer-\/1214633<wbr>22288?hash=item1c47c736b0:g:-H0AAOS<wbr>wstxVIJZF","time":1490512182,"resto":118320433,"id":"CuCjeUml","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118332995,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:10:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118332959\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118332959<\/a>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/<wbr>watch?v=seHVU-FPS8w&amp;spfreload=10","time":1490512212,"resto":118320433,"id":"CuCjeUml","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118333181,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:12:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118332959\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118332959<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not just filling your cartridges with hit sticky cum <\/span><br><br>Faggot.","time":1490512379,"resto":118320433,"id":"idOFEtFl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118333291,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:14:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118320433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118320433<\/a><br>aaaaaaaaand how, pray tell, will they be enforcing this at things like yard sales, backdoor dealings, under the table things, etc?<br><br>Did these retards learn absolutely nothing when they tried to ban alcohol?","time":1490512472,"resto":118320433,"id":"FNWs2rew","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118333355,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:14:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118325223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118325223<\/a><br>\/pol\/ in one post","time":1490512497,"resto":118320433,"id":"L1Ucn4S8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118333351,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:14:56","name":"Anonymous","sub":"NO MORE SHILL THREADS, LETS FALSE FLAG THE JEW","com":"Idea is simple, post these around your favorite public area and turn the leftists against their (((masters)))<br><br>https:\/\/www.pdf-archive.com\/2017\/03<wbr>\/19\/jewish-privilege-1\/<br><br>https:\/\/www.pdf-archive.com\/2017\/03<wbr>\/19\/jewish-privilege-harvard\/<br><br>https:\/\/www.pdf-archive.com\/2017\/03<wbr>\/19\/jewish-privilege-holocaust\/<br><br>https:\/\/www.pdf-archive.com\/2017\/03<wbr>\/19\/jewish-privilege-nazism-vs-zion<wbr>ism\/<br><br>https:\/\/www.pdf-archive.com\/2017\/03<wbr>\/19\/jewish-privilege-salaita\/","filename":"1489880319952","ext":".jpg","w":1275,"h":1650,"tn_w":193,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490512496867,"time":1490512496,"md5":"mxshVeVzUvw\/qCZSMPE92g==","fsize":286255,"resto":0,"id":"L37AnBQF","country":"KR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"no-more-shill-threads-lets-false-flag-the-jew","country_name":"South Korea","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118333182,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:13:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"So Drumpf has no chance of winning a second term, right?","filename":"Untitled","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":468,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":182,"tim":1490512381237,"time":1490512381,"md5":"fcCwvqWjuTmeP7FR2iEQ9g==","fsize":80729,"resto":0,"id":"5v5\/i2R2","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-drumpf-has-no-chance-of-winning-a-second-term","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0},{"no":118333233,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:13:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118333182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118333182<\/a><br>He will be impeached within 6 months","time":1490512437,"resto":118333182,"id":"liR2LweL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118333325,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:14:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sorry sweetie, a second term is practically guaranteed at this point.

I&#039;m not going to go deep into why the wars started and who were the good\/bad guys, it doesn&#039;t matter for this topic. In Serbia as soon as the wars started, anti war and anti Milosevic protest started, first in 1991 when tanks cleared hundreds of thousands of people out the streets. During the next 10 years, at least 7-8 more similar semi-violent protest were held until Milosevic was brought down. During that time, as he had all the power in the country, the media was heavily censored and journalists and political figures were often assassinated. Somewhere around the end of 90s a government was formed along with the Radical Party (the first party ever in Yugoslavia to rule along with the Socialist) and here in story comes our current PM Aleksandar Vucic. At the time he was a information minister and notorious for his right wing policies and assassinations of journalists (many murders are associated with him, but no evidence was ever found, the witnesses always disappear or decide to stay silent) <br><br>In 2000 on 5th of October, the protests finally reached critical mass and Bulldozer revolution happened(see wikipedia for details), Milosevic was arrested and the Democrats took the government.

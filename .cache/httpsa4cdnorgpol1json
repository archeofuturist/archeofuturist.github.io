Unless all sexual feelings can be put aside somehow, it really doesn&#039;t work because one is always secretly hoping to be with the other one, and one is generally taking advantage of these feelings whether they realize it or not. This is why women love gay dudes. They crave the male attention, protection, ability to not be fucking retard about basic shit, etc, but want it without paying the pooter price (they always want free shit and who can blame them for trying). This is also why they collect beta orbiters. At least with the gay dudes, their intentions of never fucking him are clear (though they probably secretly want to fuck him too).<br><br>Anyway. Sure, you can go out and have fun with a girl who&#039;s your friend, but she&#039;s not going to fuck you and her boyfriend is going to think you&#039;re weird and probably not want you around. Most couples won&#039;t tolerate a 3rd wheel for long. You&#039;ll just naturally drop off as they seclude themselves for alone time.<br><br>And let&#039;s say you&#039;ve got a female best friend who tells you all her problems. What happens when you get a gf? Now you have 2 women demanding all of your attention to prattle on about the dumbest shit you can imagine and you&#039;re going to have to choose who gets priority.

They are having to play this game of loose threats and shit to keep from getting alot of heat on the upcoming Russian American Greatness. Tested their new system, took out a majority of Syria&#039;s air force. Which now gives Russia even more control over Assad. Which now I think the US will back off significantly out of there and that will leave Russia as the main dominant force over Assad.","time":1491584389,"resto":119975973,"id":"3wFrg2Kd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119981911,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)12:59:48","name":"Anonymous","sub":"GUNBOAT DIPLOMACY","com":"This has little to do with Syria and everything to do with China<br>Let me break it down for you:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;america starts moving military units to SKorea in preparation for a shitshow<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;NK drops ICBM in ocean as a FU to america<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Assad supposedly gasses civvies<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump goes from &quot;idgaf about assad&quot; to &quot;something must be done&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Xi Jinping comes to America to discuss NK shenanigans<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Russia says support for Assad isn&#039;t unconditional<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Russia gets a warning call from Trump to pull troops out of the base about to be bombed<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump lives up to his &quot;responsibility&quot; and &quot;does something&quot; on the SAME DAY he&#039;s meeting with Xi Jinping<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Drops 50 fucking bombs on base where gas strikes &quot;were launched&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No russian troops injured or killed<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;China sees what happens if it doesn&#039;t play ball and get NK to chill<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Evidence starts coming out about the false flag nature of attack<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump gets more excuse to gut intelligence community<\/span><br><br>HYPOTHESIS:<br>Russia and Trump are working together to put China on their heels.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Russia supposedly has control of all Assad&#039;s chemical weapons<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Chemical weapon attack came out of a russian controlled airbase<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Images coming out of syrian attack don&#039;t make sense for sarin or chlorine gas -&gt; likely false flag<\/span><br>MEANWHILE<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;duerte (a us ally) makes moves in the south China sea, taking uninhabited islands<\/span><br><br>End result?<br>Xi is SHITTING HIS PANTS","filename":"mlady","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":350,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":148,"tim":1491584388002,"time":1491584388,"md5":"K2A3PycEQ+tUVqLzA0bI9w==","fsize":43057,"resto":0,"id":"ArJTBQSM","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gunboat-diplomacy","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":119976417,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)12:28:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why did he betray us \/pol\/?","filename":"pepe1","ext":".jpg","w":1106,"h":553,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491582511175,"time":1491582511,"md5":"Tlf6Xxd96KFVlkFCBO32sg==","fsize":47378,"resto":0,"id":"aVmcSLzj","country":"PT","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-did-he-betray-us-pol","country_name":"Portugal","replies":48,"images":8,"omitted_posts":43,"omitted_images":7},{"no":119981595,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)12:58:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119978812\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119978812<\/a><br>Yep, we need \/pol\/ to have the nuclear codes.

All public knowledge of the attack indicates a false flag - but Trump may be sitting on undeniable evidence.<br><br>HOWEVER - it&#039;s irrelevant whether it&#039;s true or not in the grand scheme of things.<br><br>And this is why:<br>1. If it wasn&#039;t a false flag he responded appropriately. All he did was bomb an airfield - targeting aircraft and infrastructure while avoiding personnel - after warning the Russians. No Russian casualties = No WWIII. Currently conflicting reports on SAA casualties. Doesn&#039;t matter. By targeting the air base and not Assad&#039;s headquarters (like Libya) he demonstrated this had NOTHING to do with regime change. Just sending a message. Also, the way he was silent about this until the attack was is just what a President ought to do. That ought to scare the shit out of any other country.<br><br>2. He just put Assad in check while sedating Neo-Cons like McCain, and Israel (who are the people who would have supported the false flag). He&#039;s winning over support from people stonewalling him with a glorified firework show.<br><br>3. By pulling the trigger unannounced like this he&#039;s showing he&#039;s not fucking around with China or North Korea. No doubt a message to Iran as well.<br><br>4. Even if Syrian forces are grounded they still have Russian air support. Essentially nothing has changed strategically.<br><br>5. Another nail in the coffin for the Russian collusion narrative.","filename":"sa on syria","ext":".png","w":758,"h":548,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1491584363462,"time":1491584363,"md5":"bGNi65w5zHqLKhbaC7i49Q==","fsize":69912,"resto":119976417,"id":"pUl0Vd9n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119981904,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)12:59:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119981624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119981624<\/a><br>If you want a pic reflecting reality you should remake it with trump with his mouth around the Jews cock.","time":1491584387,"resto":119976417,"id":"wS6IV1m3","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"}]}]}

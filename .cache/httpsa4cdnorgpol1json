I&#039;m tall, actually moderately attractive, with a state job making ~145k a year in tech. I currently spend most of time free time reading, playing video games, working out, and cooking. Over the last 5 years or so I have slowly lost my desire for any kind of relationship with women. <br><br>I was not really a Chad, but I was one of the lucky few who was getting laid pretty steadily in high school, and on through college and my early adult life. I had my heart broken, and I broke some hearts. But the last 5 years I have really found the company of women in general to be less and less tolerable. Most of them want to talk about the same old boring shit. Whats on TV\/Movies\/Social Justice\/Whatever dumb hobby they&#039;re into. Given I live in a liberal infested shithole, it just seems like I can&#039;t find a single woman out there who brings any kind of excitement to the table anymore. Even the ones where politics is never brought up once. I don&#039;t drink often at all, not into the party scene. I despise degeneracy in general. I&#039;ve just gotten to the point where I&#039;m giving up hope on finding a decent companion, ya know? I can deal with it. Really, pussy is great and all, but it has seriously come to the point where I don&#039;t see it worth the effort of going through the motions of picking up women. Its like the same shit on repeat. Fuck it, I&#039;d rather just beat my meat in the shower every once in a while and call it even. <br><br>Given my growing apathy toward women in general, I&#039;ve come to question if this is strictly internal, or if the direction society is going is attributing to it. I didn&#039;t used to feel this way, but that was 5 years ago, before SJW, Cultural-marxism, and Socialism was mainstream. I see these &#039;anti-values&#039; reflected in the women I meet and it sickens me.<br><br>What does \/pol\/ think?

The former two would be easy to dismiss if women were not the subject of their whims in the immediate moment and prone to acting in ways they feel satisfies their current desires in the present with no consideration for consequences in the future. That need to fit in. Somewhere in there is the most annoying trait that seems universal in them which is their compulsion to never make their intentions known in anyway but childlike deceptive riddles. A corollary to that is they are incapable of satisfying 90% of their own needs without co-opting someone else to do it for them. This could be the simplest decisions to entertainment and escape from boredom. They are fleeting and demanding creatures. The good ones fail to keep themselves aesthetically up to code and are one confused impulse away from becoming the bad ones. The bad ones fail to keep themselves socially up to code and are one empowered delusion away from becoming aesthetically displeasing. There are few scenarios in modern society where women are not enormous liabilities and where they do have objective value, reproduction and offspring, they need to essentially be conned and charmed into the act which in many ways precludes them from being acceptable mates to begin with.

Trump lies. Of course all of them lie. It&#039;s just that when Trump lies, it&#039;s something completely outrageous. He&#039;s not doing the usual &quot;look into the camera and speak with conviction and sincerity&quot; that an accomplished politician lie Bill Clinton would use. He says something completely off the wall and has a smirk on his face when he does it. And everyone goes nuts. And it is actually seems to be a sound strategy, because when his political opponents begin to hone in on something they might make stick, we&#039;re talking about whatever crazy thing he tweeted about at 4:30 in the morning.

Well, for one, the Democratic Party I was loyal to either has changed, or it never really existed in the first place. Maybe it&#039;s perspective that comes with age. When the Democrats were saying, &quot;we need to include everyone&quot; I was on board. When the Democrats started saying, &quot;Straight white Males, Get Out, REEEEEEEEE,&quot; I listened. See, I spent most of my likfe believing the republicans were evil and the Democrats could do no wrong. Then Obama spent the last half of his second term destroying the progress made i race relations over the last twenty years and the DNC conspired to anoint Hillary Clinton.

When blacks were liberated, they were left poor, because of that, a large portion of them resolved on committing crime. Which left a large portion of their children fatherless, because of course, their fathers were left in prison, due to being poor which lead to them being criminals. It developed a Rap-Crime Culture. And because those kids were left without fathers and with the culture that their fathers developed, which is one of the only things blacks have as a culture btw, and at the same time not having a role mode, it&#039;s safe to assume that culture became their role model. You can see the same thing here, in Bulgaria, with the whole Batka\/Chalga low-iq culture. I actually don&#039;t think that Blacks would have the same capacity as whites, but I don&#039;t think It&#039;s as big as people make it up to be due to the large percentage of socioeconomic factors.

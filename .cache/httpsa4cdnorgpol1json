Over the last 10 years I have had the pleasure of seeing the private parts of many, many people. What I&#039;m about to tell you may come as a bit of a surprise.<br><br>I&#039;d estimate that as many as 4 out of 100 people have messed up junk. You might have a guy named John with all the male secondary sex characteristics (beard, baldness deep voice etc.) but if you have to catheterize &#039;him&#039; you might find that there isn&#039;t a dick.

Politically, things like this make arguments about gay marriages, insurance funded transition operations and bathroom designations more difficult than they appear.<br><br>That being said, everything SJW&#039;s rant about is concerning 56 genders, fanciful pronouns and otherkin is obviously complete bullshit.

The 4 wives you will have are a bonus.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isn&#039;t it anti-nationalistic?<\/span><br>No. Islam commands us to respect all races and cultures and only cut out the blasphemous and degenerate aspects. That&#039;s why Islam in Indonesia differs greatly from say SA Islam. Obviously like christianity the religion itself hass no boundaries by country but it very well respects nations within. Without Islamic birth rates your race and nation will soon go extinct.","filename":"4ec98fe0f739d52bb37740609a96688e01c59cca32d77484352c5aa14beaad91","ext":".png","w":1437,"h":909,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":158,"tim":1493115042471,"time":1493115042,"md5":"Kry9YCndXBZjVEox6seM+w==","fsize":89757,"resto":0,"id":"3iqdDX6B","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"islam-general-chemo-edition","country_name":"Germany","replies":152,"images":21,"omitted_posts":147,"omitted_images":20,"tail_size":50},{"no":122731810,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)09:08:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122731481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122731481<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I B E T Y O U A R E<\/span>","time":1493125716,"resto":122718937,"id":"F\/9PwY13","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":122732094,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)09:11:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122718937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122718937<\/a><br>Who are the twelvers?<br>Who is Mahdi?","time":1493125914,"resto":122718937,"id":"UYxo2jMn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122732111,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)09:12:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122728010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122728010<\/a><br>congratulation for your newly clogged toilet","time":1493125924,"resto":122718937,"id":"bjcpeCXY","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122732214,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)09:13:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122718937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122718937<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Islam is truth.

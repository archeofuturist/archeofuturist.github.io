So I decided, just this past Monday, 4\/10, that I would look at the &quot;stupidest&quot; red-pill I could find, and naturally it wasn&#039;t even a question...there was no second option....I decided to research the flat earth theory.<br><br>Just like all of you, I have seen snippets of this madness but I deemed it too ludicrous to consider. I may have even been able to flip a coin on the actuality of the moon landing, but even with that doubt, I never considered that the earth was flat and that we were being lied to . Hell, what would the purpose be for the lie.<br><br>I am a Bible-believing Christian, which is even more absurd that I would hold so fast to the heliocentric model when the scripture is full of one-sided flat earthedness.<br><br>I fully believe that people who believe they see aliens or that have been abducted are really dealing with fallen angels and demons and STILL I laughed at the possibility of the flat earth. But don&#039;t you see, the enemy HAD to make us believe in a limitless universe if they were going to extend the lie and &quot;return as our alien father&#039;s that seeded the earth with out evolutionary ancestors.&quot; How could beings from another planet be our gods if there were no planets, only different stars and celestial bodies of the same design.<br><br>My life has changed this week. And all glory belongs to the Father and to our Lord Yeshua ha Mashiach. I beg you all to look with open eyes and open hearts to this ridiculous notion.

Not to mention, a simple state ID card or driver&#039;s license is something that fraudulent voters probably have anyway. I would rather a firmer affirmation of natural citizenship, lets say you had to provide a US birth certificate or naturalization papers. Would there be anything wrong with that? No. Why can&#039;t we do that?

They oppose even the most basic voter ID laws in their state legislatures (like having a drivers license) because of (1) organized voter fraud like busing campaigns, car rental schemes, multiple state voting, dead registrars which largely takes place from DNC (see Veritas, Creamer, ACORN, etc etc) and (2) non-citizen voters. Even the simplest voter ID implementations suppress this. So yes, the intention is to suppress ILLEGAL VOTING which happens to be committed by mostly by democrats.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Seriously, the number of voter fraud cases in this country doesn&#039;t even get into triple digits, there are like 10-20 cases per year for the whole nation.

It&#039;s (for protestants anyway) 66 different books written over the course of ~1500 years.

That&#039;s why I believe Jesus was who He claimed to be. Secondly, the Christian narrative as it seems to me, to describe my heart, the human heart, and the human condition in exactly the way it is, and that there IS truth to the way it describes the world. Maybe not the nature of quarks or neutrinos or such. But in the most abstract realm. <br>Thirdly, it is what I would call a subjective truth, a term I borrow from Soren Kierkegaard. Meaning, that while it is indeed true, it requires full delving into, a &quot;leap of faith&quot; to understand\/experience as true. And I&#039;ve experienced it as true. I&#039;ve experienced the presence and breath of God, I&#039;ve prayed enough and waited on God enough to hear Him. Which might sound all magical and crazy... But it&#039;s a truth to me.

You can no longer use &quot;god&quot; as an argument for why fags shouldnt be celebrated.

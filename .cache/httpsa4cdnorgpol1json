Came up to the house, big fucking house looking off of a mountain.<br>Met with the jews once I was inside.<br>The lady was in her early-mid 40s, lips with botox small fucking thing. Nice ass though. But the guy was much older like 70 years old. The wife only referred to him as &quot;the Doctor&quot;. <br>Something was fucky with this girl. Always swearing and shit. She was basically a fucking teenager like the &#039;cool moms&#039;. She would even call her husband a fucking idiot, always putting him down and shit. He would just roam around the house like an old dog with no owner. The reason I knew she was a jew was because she flat out told me. Showed me a picture of her mom and dad and how the &quot;survived auschwitz&quot; and shit.<br>Anyways, she was trying to get some lighting in her walk-in closet and I was like yea sure. Done deal set for work tomorrow.<br>This is where I fucked up.<br>Tomorrow came and was set on working. Got to the house but only the poor bastard was there.Got straight to working and setting shit up. The lady came back and I realized that I hadn&#039;t told her the price yet. So when I told her that I was charging $500 for all these lights to be installed (reasonable price), she fucking flipped.<br>And when I say flipped she fucking went psycho. <br>Bitch was calling me a faggot loser with a small dick. No fucking lie I tell you \/pol\/ she was fucking flaming mad. Holy shit I will never forget that day.

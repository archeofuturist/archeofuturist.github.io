The numbers:<br><br>Le Pen - 25%<br>Melenchon - 21.7%<br>Macron - 21.0%<br>Fillon - 20.2%<br>Hamon - 5.2%<br><br>Shut up an trust me on that. I will be right. Le Pen historically always overperforms her polls unless there is another credible right wing candidate for her votes to go to. There isn&#039;t. I have used a variety of other methods to calculate the other numbers; to be very brief, always remember that Macron&#039;s base is FRAGILE (1\/3 of voters could change minds) and is attracted to Melenchon&#039;s base, where as Fillon has stalled because of Penelopegate, and there is no reason to vote for Hamon as Melenchon becomes the candidate for the Left. <br><br>2nd Round will be 51.43% for Le Pen and 48.51% for Melenchon. Polls after the first round will show roughly a 54\/46 race, favouring Melenchon. <br><br>The crucial moment will come when Fillon ENDORSES Le Pen (or several prominent members of his party). Why would he\/they do that, you ask? Because they support Le Pen AGAINST the commie Melenchon (he wants 100% tax on rich). ALSO, they will have a parliamentary majority, and want to get shit done. THEY CAN GET SHIT DONE WITH LE PEN, BUT NOT WITH MELENCHON. This is crucial to remember.<br><br>This will be the FINAL BLOW. Currently (((polls))) predict the abstention rates of Fillon supporters in a 2nd round Le Pen\/Melenchon to be approximately 50%. (i.e. 50% do not vote at all). Fillon\/his party&#039;s endorsement of Le Pen will reduce this rate to approximately 30%, which results in the 51.43% victory I described above. So, add all these factors in and Le Pen will Make France Great Again. I&#039;m waiting, \/pol\/. Shortly, you will see that I was right.","filename":"presidentlepen","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492589938472,"time":1492589938,"md5":"df5FUFBiXd\/yCZVKj6QXiw==","fsize":110927,"resto":0,"id":"KxqN++CX","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"le-pen-will-win-guaranteed-i-explain-how","country_name":"Australia","replies":236,"images":55,"omitted_posts":231,"omitted_images":54,"tail_size":50},{"no":121837210,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:13:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121821130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121821130<\/a><br>oh FUCK OFF RUSSIAN SHILLs","filename":"LePutin&#039;strolls","ext":".jpg","w":631,"h":490,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":97,"tim":1492604022602,"time":1492604022,"md5":"X9eLcbv1VeviTpz42+ffVg==","fsize":43746,"resto":121821130,"id":"eqlEojHk","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121837241,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:14:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121837143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121837143<\/a><br>Watch your words.","time":1492604048,"resto":121821130,"id":"fPFkaRZg","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":121837263,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:14:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121836762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121836762<\/a><br>What on earth could make you so sure?

One of many I&#039;ve noticed. <br><br>Why is this so? Is it because these are bottom of the barrel white males and cannot find a suitable white wife? Do they want to be worshipped for their whiteness.

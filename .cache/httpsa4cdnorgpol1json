But if any of you are interested in a real answer, here&#039;s my take as a Westernized chink.<br><br>Let&#039;s review, every race has had different selection pressures placed on it but one of the most significant differences between races is how &quot;tame&quot; they are. In many ways, humans have self-domesticated in order to leave peacefully among non-kin in the large societies made possible by agriculture. The very concept of retributive justice, which exists in all human societies, is a huge selection against aggressive, violent behaviour. The &quot;5000 years of glorious history&quot; is a bit of a meme for China, but it is true that the Chinese were the first society to produce a state with a centralized bureaucracy about 3000 years ago. In addition, southern China&#039;s main staple has long been rice, which produces significantly more calories per plot of land than wheat, but is more labor and water intensive, which necessitates a more community based culture wherein everyone works together to create the irrigation systems that water the rice. <br><br>The net effect is that Chinese people have lived in much denser societies than most of the world for most of recorded history. Asians are essentially the most domesticated race, in contrast to sub-Saharan Africans, who lived in some of the least dense societies for most of history and are the least domesticated. Asian men on average have lower testosterone than men of other races. This was never an issue within Asian societies where you were competing with other Asian men and society often punished individuality harshly. <br><br>1\/2","time":1490657391,"resto":118568603,"id":"XwQFc3AE","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118572627,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:35:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"i&#039;ve heard so many conflicting opinions on this that it&#039;s hard to come to a solid conclusion, so i want to hear some anecdotes from people who&#039;ve tried it.<br><br>is it a meme, or are there really benefits?","filename":"logo","ext":".png","w":400,"h":129,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":80,"tim":1490654133188,"time":1490654133,"md5":"PXZ2O3cd2rOx5x6mzMzgfw==","fsize":26125,"resto":0,"id":"cbyz2UV1","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ive-heard-so-many-conflicting-opinions-on-this","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":121,"images":10,"omitted_posts":116,"omitted_images":10,"tail_size":50},{"no":118578934,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:28:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118578763\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118578763<\/a><br>Probably because they are all addicted to fapping and are trying to stop.","time":1490657322,"resto":118572627,"id":"3mex3ZgH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118578944,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:28:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118577223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118577223<\/a><br>Okey-dokey<br><a href=\"#p118578819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118578819<\/a><br>Jokes on you im from the Lake District we don&#039;t have any.","time":1490657328,"resto":118572627,"id":"r5mBsSH7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118578961,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:28:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118578744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118578744<\/a><br>yeah, out of anything.

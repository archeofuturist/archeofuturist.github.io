Without the Jews, we would see the world with different eyes, hear with different ears, even feel with different feelings. And not only would our sensorium, the screen through which we receive the world, be different: we would think with a different mind, interpret all our experience differently, draw different conclusions from the things that befall us. And we would set a different course for our lives.<br><br>By &quot;we&quot; I mean the usual &quot;we&quot; of late-twentieth-century writing: the people of the Western world, whose peculiar but vital mentality has come to infect every culture on earth, so that, in a startlingly precise sense, all humanity is now willy-nilly caught up in this &quot;we.&quot; For better or worse, the role of the West in humanity&#039;s history is singular. Because of this, the role of the Jews, the inventors of Western culture, is also singular: there is simply no one else remotely like them; theirs is a unique vocation. Indeed, as we shall see, the very idea of vocation, of a personal destiny, is a Jewish idea.<br><br>Our history is replete with examples of those who have refused to see what the Jews are really about, who - through intellectual blindness, racial chauvinism, xenophobia, or just plain evil - have been unable to give this oddball tribe, this raggle-taggle band, this race of wanderers who are the progenitors of the Western world, their due. Indeed, at the end of this bloodiest of centuries, we can all too easily look back on scenes of unthinkable horror perpetrated by those who would do anything rather than give the Jews their due.","filename":"the_holy_jewish_people","ext":".jpg","w":230,"h":150,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1492916374018,"time":1492916374,"md5":"dHnfD53Ywq1wu5RmWGHxBQ==","fsize":22052,"resto":122364882,"id":"Vz\/eBJUa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122369326,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:59:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122368481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122368481<\/a>","filename":"1492208654477","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":509,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1492916389630,"time":1492916389,"md5":"WKFJR7KTMd5jmEBffNEX4A==","fsize":67461,"resto":122364882,"id":"Sk1HN2tK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122362259,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)21:59:00","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Montrealers line up to cast votes in French presidential election","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;One voter, Florian Castarede, said it was &quot;unthinkable&quot; to have Le Pen ... as French president.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;It&#039;s simple, if Marine Le Pen is elected, I&#039;m asking for my (Canadian) permanent residency,&quot; he said.<\/span><br><br>STOP.

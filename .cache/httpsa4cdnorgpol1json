Blizzard keeps the game in the headlines every month because of controversy, and the community generates endless amounts of porn, fanart, and porny fanart to keep the game alive much longer than TF2 did with its all-male cast. oh and did I mention the backstory for the game is literally just a social justice version of the backstory to The Matrix, but instead of the machines taking over the world, a Marvel Cinematic Universe Avengers analogue steps in and saves the day?<br><br>the jig is up Blizzard, I&#039;ve figured your shit out, you&#039;re evil geniuses, pls hire this unemployed game programmer","filename":"1492391017021","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493405329271,"time":1493405329,"md5":"Ny1chYW1b45uTtEDJjchEA==","fsize":92666,"resto":123211407,"id":"VDu2kGuB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123229520,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:55:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123228641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123228641<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BjM<wbr>iDZIY1bM<br>Start writing more songs please.","time":1493405742,"resto":123211407,"id":"aLxe3fvV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123229643,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:56:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123221159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123221159<\/a><br><br>This.

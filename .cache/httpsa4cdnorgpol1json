It is characterized by a number of psychiatric symptoms such as throwing yourself into the path of lorries driven by Muslims, asking Muslims to sexually assault you in a public, asking Muslims to shoot you in crowded places and asking Muslims to behead you underneath the Eiffel Tower.[1] Similar syndromes include Jerusalem syndrome whereby sufferers may constantly repeat false claims relating to fictional accounts of genocide [2] and Berlin syndrome whereby afflicted males may ask the nearest person of the same sex to repeatedly pleasure their wife. The condition is commonly viewed as a severe form of culture shock.

Examples of this form of love can be found in Deuteronomy and other books of God&#039;s law: men having cute female children as brides; men being the ba&#039;al (overlord) of the female(s); men holding down and raping virgin female children (Deuteronomy 22; v28-29, in Hebrew) and never letting them go; men killing women who leave them by committing adultery. This type of love is completely banned in white countries because whites are cucks for women and worshipers of the false idol jesus and his alternative religion that now rules the entire world. Men who display possessive love end up in prison in these women&#039;s countries<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Or to put it simply<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Selfless love is madokas love for others. Possessive love is homarus love for madoka. Glad homaru won in the end, it is stifling to be ruled by those who force one to have only selfless love.<\/span>","filename":"MadokaSample-ee2b70f5aad4c27c3f1996aa2279bac3","ext":".jpg","w":850,"h":544,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1492146896930,"time":1492146896,"md5":"3WQ79vcSl7OvE0Ur30v+ew==","fsize":181177,"resto":121016530,"id":"afq8UK5l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121021085,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)00:59:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Alright Turks explain to me how you are not trash without mentioning Byzantium.","filename":"download (1)","ext":".png","w":255,"h":170,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492145967527,"time":1492145967,"md5":"+tnyPfE1eYSHQt+El0s7Ow==","fsize":1397,"resto":0,"id":"PdjYrJ8n","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"alright-turks-explain-to-me-how-you-are-not-trash","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":4,"omitted_posts":9,"omitted_images":2},{"no":121022364,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:12:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121021872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121021872<\/a><br>What?","time":1492146764,"resto":121021085,"id":"KLTFUmxw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121022371,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:12:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121021085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121021085<\/a><br>*Appears and whispers<br>&quot;Armenian Genocide&quot;<br>*Disappears","time":1492146767,"resto":121021085,"id":"0zxptWC9","country":"PH","country_name":"Philippines"},{"no":121022448,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:13:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121021919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121021919<\/a><br><br>As should you","filename":"Smyrna-vict-families-1922","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":394,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1492146817470,"time":1492146817,"md5":"wb1TSiRjcGqzhUHjGrdiMQ==","fsize":209449,"resto":121021085,"id":"f5QNU4vj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121022481,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:13:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121021919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121021919<\/a><br>PONTIC GENOCIDE<br>ARMENIAN GENOCIDE<br>INVASION OF CYPRUS 1974<br>YOU FUCKING IDIOT","time":1492146839,"resto":121021085,"id":"339eR0nG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121022561,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:14:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"ANATOLIA IS GREEK","time":1492146897,"resto":121021085,"id":"3tBc2r33","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121019395,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)00:42:56","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Is she Retarded?","filename":"Untitled","ext":".png","w":725,"h":686,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":236,"tim":1492144976260,"time":1492144976,"md5":"4EucyK0uGjZ\/dyhtoaTf5Q==","fsize":625868,"resto":0,"id":"hSo+bdLM","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-she-retarded","country_name":"United States","replies":76,"images":27,"omitted_posts":71,"omitted_images":26},{"no":121022421,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:13:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121022070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121022070<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what lies<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;other than the lies<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;because nothing in the image was real<\/span><br>Jokes are supposed to be funny, anon.

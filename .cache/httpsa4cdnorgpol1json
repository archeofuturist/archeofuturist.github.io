Alex and many other analysts have said it multiple times, Trump is not here to make America great again, he&#039;s here to buy the people time to prepare, to get us some more money immediately before the collapse. You&#039;ve heard it for so long from people like peter schiff and Ron Paul, we are in route of the biggest economic collapse in history and only the prepared ones will survive. Start running and becoming stronger, buy some guns (I know that&#039;s illegal in Brazil-land, but where does Paco the drug dealer get them?) buy some storage food (Alex jones sells some good stuff) do what you must to prepare, I&#039;m sure there will be a revolution in your country before ours since you&#039;re under communist control. <br><br>There will be a collapse, there is no debate. There are so many bubbles around the world. Just one popping and it&#039;s done. Hillary was supposed to bring forth the collapse and to have humanity basically enslaved.

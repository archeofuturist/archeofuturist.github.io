She predicted Donald Trump would become President and would use her Twitter account to relay what she claimed were messages from God that only enlightened human beings would be able to understand, one of them being that the past present and future are not sequences of events one after another but are actually all happening at the same time. Another was that there is an infinite number of universes in which every detail can be infinitely different. Also, she tried to kill herself in 2012 and claimed that she succeeded but that successfully killing yourself will only result in your consciousness being shifted into another universe in which you become another &quot;you&quot; who survived your own suicide attempt, but are still in the same life situation that you experienced before your attempt. Since then Tila claims to have developed a special relationship with God by which she can receive messages to share with the public. Interestingly, she does not claim to be God himself, but tells her fans to follow Jesus so as to dissuade a personality cult. She consistently criticizes (((Them))) in her videos and also claims that she has the power to alter our universe with her mind. Most importantly, she is now claiming the return of Jesus is imminent with the coming of a third world war.<br><br>Two videos for the intrigued:<br><br>&quot;A Recap on World War 3!

It has ruined lives, and I cannot put those back together.\u201d<br><br>His grandson, a white supremacist who had just pleaded guilty to nine counts of murder for the June 17, 2015, massacre at Charleston\u2019s Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, looked ahead impassively, just as when sentenced to death in federal court in January.<br><br>Under a plea arrangement, he received life terms for each of the murder charges, which will be appended consecutively to the 18 death sentences imposed by a judge and jury in his federal trial. Mr. Roof turned down an offer to address the court directly on Monday, leaving his grandfather as his only advocate. It was the first time a relative had spoken on his behalf in court.<br>\u201cEveryone should understand that nothing is all bad, and Dylann is not all bad,\u201d Joseph Roof said, adding that he and his wife pray each day for the victims\u2019 families. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we could ever feel what they\u2019ve felt and what they\u2019ve lost, just as no one can understand what we\u2019ve been through.\u201d<br><br>The elder Mr. Roof, who occasionally attended the federal trial, said he still could not fathom what had driven his grandson to such violence in the expressed hope of inciting a race war. \u201cI will go to my grave not understanding what happened,\u201d he said.<br><br>The 80-minute hearing Monday effectively ended the trial-level prosecution of Mr. Roof, who turned 23 a week ago.

I.E People of wealth, talent, and ability don&#039;t tend to focus so much on your race as what you can accomplish. It tends to be underachievers and people of low intellect that put the focus on Race. Mulls tend to either forget this or never come to this realization and so they spend alot of time fretting over &quot;fitting in&quot; to one or another racial group. Instead of achieving. Its retarded in a literal sense, as they spend more time looking for a peer group based on skin tone than creating something for themselves and thus bringing people to them by their accomplishments. <br><br>I didn&#039;t fall into that trap.

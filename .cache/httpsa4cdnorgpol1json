Then they ramped up production and hit 150k in two years. These are vehicles that go for anywhere between 100,000 to 150,000 dollars. <br><br>The Model 3 will go for anywhere between 50,000 to 70,000 dollars. This is important, because once you start comparing the number of vehicles sold in the same price range, you see how Tesla outsells their competitors. <br><br>It isn&#039;t about collective number of units sold, obviously they don&#039;t sell nearly as many vehicles. This is because they only have two types of vehicles to sell currently, and only one of them as it stands has the proper production pipeline. The Model X has more or less been sidelined due to the greater impact that the Model 3 will have on their bottom line. <br><br>So compare the number of 50 to 70k vehicles that Ford sells per year, and then compare that to the number of Model 3&#039;s Tesla expects to sell and you&#039;ve got it.

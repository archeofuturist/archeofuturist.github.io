Anarchists hold that capitalism and the state are inextricably linked and that to get rid of one you need to get rid of the other, they therefore advocate the immediate abolition of the state and the transferal of power to democratic unions or councils, alonside the abolition of private property, meaning that anarchists support the democratic control of resources by the community. They wish for goods to be produced for need, rather than for profit. <br><br>The abolition of private property is NOT taking away your home, toothbrush or television, the abolition of private property is the abolition of that relationship which allows one to profit from the labour of another, the abolition of the private owner, the usurer the banker, the rentier, the factory owner etc. In place of these, the community will own the housing and provide it rent free, the workers will control the factory democratically and its profits will go to them not the owner, etc. Anarchists make a distinction between personal property (home, television, a thing that you are using and whose value would be depleted were it to be used by somebody else, i.e a home is of no use to you if you might go back and find your bed with somebody else in it) and private property (when you charge another for the use of something you are not using (for example, I have my house, and you work every day to pay me to live in my second or third house). <br><br> Anarchism is distinct from Marxism in that Marxist believe the state should be seized and used to create communism, whereas anarchists believe communism can only be achieved after the abolition of the state, though there are libertarian Marxists who have considerable overlap with anarchism, the council communists and autonomists etc.","filename":"Bakunin","ext":".png","w":220,"h":279,"tn_w":197,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493038320804,"time":1493038320,"md5":"WgmghVSzrsyAbh+v+Cf6VQ==","fsize":99896,"resto":0,"id":"UwvSLU2y","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"leftypol-here","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":190,"images":21,"omitted_posts":185,"omitted_images":21,"tail_size":50},{"no":122594095,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)10:57:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122593671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122593671<\/a><br>its the way you use emotionally loaded words like &quot;barbaric&quot; as well, you sound like fox news.

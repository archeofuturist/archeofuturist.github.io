People were afraid of Hillary offering amnesty and netting the Dems 30 million new voters and continuing these suicidal immigration platforms we have been doing. Even if we take the racial aspect out of current immigration trends, my main reason for advocating for a huge reduction in illegal and legal immigration is the looming automation boom that is coming. I think that when this arrives in the next 10-20 years we are going to see massive amounts of people out of work and the last thing we need are undereducated immigrants leeching off the government tit because they dont posses the necessary skills to contribute to this new era of industry.

Speaking in Geneva last week, the Greek Eurocrat denied terror attacks are linked to migration and warned the \u201cbiggest threat\u201d to Europe is \u201cthe rise of populism, nationalism and xenophobia\u201d. Declaring \u201cthe 27 [member states] will need 6 million immigrants in the future\u201d, Avramopoulos explained the Commission is going to open reception centres to recruit migrants, because an open borders approach would fuel populism. \u201cWe will open offices in all countries on the southern shore of the Mediterranean and in West Africa.

If white men were not allowed to vote, it is unlikely that the United Kingdom would be leaving the European Union, it is unlikely that Donald Trump would now be the President of the United States, and it is unlikely that the Democratic Alliance would now be governing four of South Africa&#039;s biggest cities.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If white men no longer had the vote, the progressive cause would be strengthened.

The influence of reckless white males were one of the primary reasons that led to the Great Recession which began in 2008. This would also strike a blow against toxic white masculinity, one that is long needed.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At the same time, a denial of the franchise to white men, could see a redistribution of global assets to their rightful owners.

Meaning that she was born chromosomally male, but unable to develop full male sexual characteristics. See, all fetuses are originally female by default and then develop into males when testosterone begins to be produced and used in the body, instructing the body to develop male sex organs and so forth. Puberty completes the process. A CAIS female like Jamie isn&#039;t, strictly speaking, male, despite her chromosomes, because she was never able to develop into a male. Then at puberty, she was given extra female hormones so at least she could grow boobs and be as much one gender as possible. Male wasn&#039;t possible because her body has a flaw which means that no matter how much testosterone is produced, the body doesn&#039;t recognize it and isn&#039;t able to use it. But it could use female hormones to take that process as far as possible.<br><br>It&#039;s quite interesting really. Because of their hormone composition and development CAIS females often have great, clear skin. That with their height and bone structure, combined with certain softer feminine characteristics, makes them really striking and good for use as models. They can never have kids though, obviously, as they have no womb. (They do have vaginas and clits, though the vaginas may not be as deep as they should be. This can be helped w\/surgery so they can have normal sex easily.) Jamie is indeed an adoptive mother only. <br><br>If someone you think is CAIS has a kid and you know that for sure, then they aren&#039;t CAIS.","filename":"jamie lee","ext":".gif","w":615,"h":462,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492082963546,"time":1492082963,"md5":"nGbi0T2y\/tYvDE\/VI9tJZQ==","fsize":160200,"resto":120890863,"id":"SwBXdtgP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120899342,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:29:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120898659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120898659<\/a><br><br>It&#039;s like that all over the western world m8ey especially in the U.S. and Canada. <br><br><a href=\"#p120898663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120898663<\/a><br><br>I like tomboys with vaginas so fucken shove it m8.","time":1492082973,"resto":120890863,"id":"93eIsbTj","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120894527,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)06:25:45","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Goyim, I have a question","com":"Are any of you actual legit holocaust deniers IRL or is it just epic meme posting? <br><br>If yes, have you ever revealed your power level?

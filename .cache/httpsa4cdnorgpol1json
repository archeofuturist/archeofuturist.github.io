The Visigoths, along with the Barbarians, the Vandals, the Franks, and the Huns, were what we would call today \u201cbarbarians,\u201d and were not into learning science, math, philosophy, and architecture. They were interested in conquering and destroying civilizations, the very epitome of \u201craping and pillaging.\u201d And conquer and rape and pillage they did. So why is Europe so civilized today? Did these early barbaric conquerors of Europe all of a sudden take up an interest in culture? The answer is that the Catholic Church, and specifically the monasteries of St. Benedict (the Father of Europe) befriended the conquerors, converted them to the Church of Jesus Christ, and then took up the task of educating them and civilizing them.","filename":"bad_posture_2","ext":".gif","w":951,"h":657,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":172,"tim":1493668211250,"time":1493668211,"md5":"\/R3tpsnmKTo3RwYPVUej\/w==","fsize":650246,"resto":0,"id":"94ktHa9o","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ancient-rome-was-the-center-of-culture-science","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":123664111,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)15:59:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ha gaeyyy!","time":1493668792,"resto":123662921,"id":"YDajuxBB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123654979,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:47:13","name":"Anonymous","sub":"It gets worse for Fox News: Bill Shine is OUT as co-president","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bill Shine has been removed from his position as co-president of Fox News, after less than a year in the job.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Two sources told New York Magazine that Shine was no longer co-president of Fox as of Monday morning.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This follows a meeting Shine had last week with Rupert Murdoch, the owner of Fox News&#039; parent company, 21st Century Fox. <\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/news\/art<wbr>icle-4463516\/Bill-Shine-pres-Fox-Ne<wbr>ws.html<br><br>This means Hannity is also walking, right?","filename":"og-fn-foxnews","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493664433510,"time":1493664433,"md5":"5Q0psq5LGy41803rzjwE9g==","fsize":109092,"resto":0,"id":"Hn2gSfXo","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"it-gets-worse-for-fox-news-bill-shine-is-out-as","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":44,"images":6,"omitted_posts":39,"omitted_images":6},{"no":123663661,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)15:56:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123662987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123662987<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;like the Republican party itself<\/span><br>You&#039;re thinking of the Conservatives<br><br>The Republican party was hijacked back in the 50&#039;s and 60&#039;s.

I&#039;m dead serious when I ask this (although this entire post is of course sarcasm). Been researching quite a bit about alt history recently and began starting to understand the history and origins of the aryan race and indo-european peoples.

As whites become increasingly a minority, they will by necessity develop an ingroup preference which will make it very hard to eliminate the last remaining group. Clearly Amalekites aren&#039;t to be treated nicely though, so... what will they do to us? Will the holoyouknowwhat come back and be used as an excuse to gas whites en masse? <br><br>I get a bit scared when I think about these things... am I the only one?

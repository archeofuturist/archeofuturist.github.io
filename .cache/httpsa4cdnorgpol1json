Not a lot of evidence survives, and much of what we have is either uninformative or unreliable. Many popular ideas about Vikings are nineteenth-century inventions. Others are the result of early historians accepting sources which modern scholars now regard as completely unreliable. In Scandinavia the Viking Age is regarded as part of prehistory because there are practically no contemporary written sources. Even in western Europe, the Viking Age is often seen as part of the &#039;Dark Ages&#039;, from which comparatively few historical records have survived.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Surviving accounts of Viking activity were almost exclusively written by churchmen.<\/span><br>(fucking SIC!)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;These include monastic chronicles, such as the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle and similar Frankish and Irish Annals, which outline broadly what happened, at what date. There are also sources of a more directly religious nature, such as the much-quoted letters of Alcuin, and Wulfstan&#039;s famous &#039;Sermon of the Wolf&#039;, both of which chose to interpret the Viking raids as God&#039;s punishment on the Anglo-Saxons for their sins. Even the chronicles reflect the fact that the Vikings often attacked monasteries for their wealth, which created an obvious bias against them, and the hostile tone of these contemporary accounts has done much to create the popular image of Viking atrocities. However, modern historians have noted that the same sources show Christian rulers behaving equally unpleasantly, but without being condemned on religious grounds.<\/span><br><br>So fuck off. <br>This wasn&#039;t wiki, but even wikipedia tells:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The image of wild-haired, dirty savages sometimes associated with the Vikings in popular culture is a distorted picture of reality.[2] Viking tendencies were often misreported, and the work of Adam of Bremen, among others, told largely disputable tales of Viking savagery and uncleanliness<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw delete everything you could during dark ages<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wonder it&#039;s hard to find<\/span>","time":1491387640,"resto":119583376,"id":"u2kQkkjv","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119592410,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)06:22:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119591251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119591251<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but it often results in decreased vigour, size, and fertility of the offspring because of the combined effect of harmful genes that were recessive in both parents.<\/span><br>This is a fallacy, brought about by observing animals that were bred to be &quot;purebred&quot; and in doing so, the breeders bred sister\/brother and mother\/son, etc.<br><br>Purebred species that have a large enough genetic pool of their kind to choose from, and do not breed within families, are actually healthier. stronger, and more viable than mongrels.","filename":"DEVOLUTION","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":650,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491387766245,"time":1491387766,"md5":"BW6WhVBItdIIHC0b2mEnkQ==","fsize":54172,"resto":119583376,"id":"aFDRzaDW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119592718,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)06:27:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119590592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119590592<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119590720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119590720<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;none of the google Erasmus Darwin<\/span><br>Americans...","time":1491388025,"resto":119583376,"id":"LQpfXTJe","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119592913,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)06:29:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119592091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119592091<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119592410\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119592410<\/a><br>This is useful.

Today (and going forward), however, young people can choose to discuss their beliefs only with others who think the same way, which not only fortifies their convictions, but as we&#039;re seeing right now, can lead them to cultivate their entire adult identity with these convictions at the center.<br><br>Consequently, for a typical SJW to confront the notion of doubt in their convictions isn&#039;t as innocuous as &quot;getting wiser with age,&quot; it&#039;s a confrontation of the validity of his or her (or ze or zir or zem) entire conception of personal identity, which obviously can be a terrifying prospect. It&#039;d be much easier and enticing to recede back into one&#039;s echo chamber.<br><br>Another contributing factor is that these beliefs aren&#039;t coming exclusively from MSM and each other, but also very crucially from their humanities professors, who they&#039;ve been conditioned to regard as possibly the most trustworthy intellectual authorities in their lives.<br><br>So what do you guys think? Will the SJW movement still be around, say, 10 years from now? If so, will it have faded considerably? or will it be stronger than ever?","filename":"fatty pig fatso SJW","ext":".jpg","w":712,"h":612,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":214,"tim":1491372466633,"time":1491372466,"md5":"CODYuM85+QKPgfFewvBTPg==","fsize":81540,"resto":0,"id":"6Vk\/2y4i","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-future-of-pcoutrage-culture","country_name":"United States","replies":70,"images":15,"omitted_posts":65,"omitted_images":15},{"no":119591872,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)06:14:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119591679\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119591679<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Oh no Jordan Peterson the liberal cuck-whisperer was eaten by his own<\/span><br>Fuck him","time":1491387299,"resto":119575344,"id":"D\/nCI4XZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119591877,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)06:15:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119591062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119591062<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;every girl that&#039;s generally &quot;my type&quot; is also a zealous radfem<\/span><br><br>i know that feel","time":1491387304,"resto":119575344,"id":"ZnJ1SdZC","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119592152,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)06:18:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119575344\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119575344<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;however, young people can choose to discuss their beliefs only with others who think the same way<\/span><br><br><br>HAHAHA 4chan pretending like it&#039;s all reasonable and shit.

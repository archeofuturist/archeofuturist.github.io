It&#039;s what established Babylon as the first organized state in history. It allowed babylon to expand it&#039;s power over much of the middle-east including Assyria, to the Egyptian border. By using the law he was able to affect a foothold in places which had no writing, and in doing so expanded their culture and laws in a way local regents and kings couldn&#039;t.

We live in California and we used to both be pretty liberal people. Over time, he started becoming more and more right leaning, and I see the shit ya&#039;ll put on here and it&#039;s thought provoking and interesting but sometimes its problematic. He became more and more obsessed with the idea of nazism, &quot;alt-right&quot; ideologies, and has been isolated from the general public at his high school. He lost his friends over time and can hardly relate to anybody at his school. Teachers are feeding him &quot;lies&quot; and the liberalism is unbearable. He doesn&#039;t feel like he belongs anywhere. Today he tried to commit suicide, and had notes in his room that related to things seen here that seemed to be schizophrenically written out. 4chan was definitely a reason for his depression. He would sit in his room all day and browse, learn about nazism and watch Sam Hyde shit. This website radicalized my brother to the point where he went over the edge and did not understand how to cope with all the things learned. I just wanted to vent and see if any of ya&#039;ll could relate.

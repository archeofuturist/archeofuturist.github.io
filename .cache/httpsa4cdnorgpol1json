As under the 1928 law, citizens were required to have a permit to carry a firearm and a separate permit to acquire a firearm. But under the new law:<\/span><br><br> Gun restriction laws applied only to handguns, not to long guns or ammunition. The 1938 revisions completely deregulated the acquisition and transfer of rifles and shotguns, and the possession of ammunition.[8]<br> The legal age at which guns could be purchased was lowered from 20 to 18.[9]<br> Permits were valid for three years, rather than one year.[9]<br> More classes of user were exempt from the requirement to hold an acquisition permit; holders of annual hunting permits, government workers, and NSDAP (the National Socialist German Workers&#039; Party, aka the Nazi party) members were no longer subject to gun ownership restrictions. Prior to the 1938 law, only officials of the central government, the states, and employees of the German Reichsbahn Railways were exempted.[8]<br> Manufacture of arms and ammunition continued to require a permit, with the proviso that such permits would no longer be issued to any company even partly owned by Jews; Jews could not manufacture or deal in firearms or ammunition.[8]<br><br>Under both the 1928 and 1938 acts, gun manufacturers and dealers were required to maintain records about purchasers of guns, with serial numbers. These records were to be delivered to a police authority for inspection at the end of each year.<br><br>The 1938 Regulations Against Jews&#039; Possession of Weapons, which came into force the day after Kristallnacht,[10][11] effectively deprived all Jews living under the Third Reich of the right to possess any form of weapons, including truncheons, knives, firearms and ammunition.[12] Before that, some police forces used the pre-existing &quot;trustworthiness&quot; clause to disarm Jews on the basis that &quot;the Jewish population &#039;cannot be regarded as trustworthy&#039;&quot;.[8]","time":1491912865,"resto":120586170,"id":"Ea1+u+mm","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":120590382,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:14:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120590170\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120590170<\/a><br>Even if he was a garbage truck driver he would still be in the right","time":1491912878,"resto":120586170,"id":"a0nLxxlB","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120590388,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:14:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120589712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120589712<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120589746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120589746<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Board<wbr>ing_%28transport%29<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Boarding starts with entering the vehicle and ends with the seating of each passenger and closure of the doors.<\/span>","filename":"wrong","ext":".gif","w":480,"h":287,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":74,"tim":1491912880257,"time":1491912880,"md5":"8R15BwOYK3fNGPX9\/kbVuw==","fsize":1272861,"resto":120586170,"id":"UcXMjWe\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120590401,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:14:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120590230\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120590230<\/a><br>If &quot;overbooking&quot; was outlawed then we wouldn&#039;t have this problem in the first place","time":1491912888,"resto":120586170,"id":"dtc3nyww","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120585011,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)07:09:16","name":"Anonymous","sub":"I am proud to be Norwegian","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; Equality<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Freedom<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Happiest country on earth<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The best nation on ski<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Most winter olympics medals<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Invented the cheese cutter<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Paper Clip is a Norwegian invention<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The spray box - the first spray box was invented by Erik Rotheim in Oslo, 1926.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Beautiful Fjords, mountains midnight sun and nothern lights. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Hundreds of thousands of lakes and they\u2019re really beautiful<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 240,000 islands and a coastline that stretches over 64,000 miles<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Beautiful nature in general<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Wild Reindeer<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; polar bears ( On the Svalbard Islands )<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The national drink is Aquavit<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; It\u2019s really safe<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Norway donate the Trafalgar Square Christmas tree in London every year in gratitude to the people of London for their assistance during WWII<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; In 2008, Norway knighted a penguin<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The L\u00e6rdal Tunnel is the world\u2019s longest road tunnel at 15 miles<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Minnesota is the unofficial Norwegian capital of the United States, and more Norwegians live in Minnesota than in any other state<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Norway is the world\u2019s largest exporter of salmon<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Norway is not a formal member of the European Union, having opted out during a referendum in November 1994<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The Norwegians founded Dublin, Ireland, in A.D. 836.d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Norway is one of the most peaceful countries in the world, ranking 11th out of 162 countries<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Norway was one of the founding nations of the United Nations in 1945, and the first U.N.

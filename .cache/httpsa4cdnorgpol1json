I am a 27 year old male who left my 28 year old worthless, useless wife today who not stop farting. It sounds ridiculous because it is, but I could not take it anymore.

I support us both and she stays at home barely cleaning, occasionally cooking but not every day. But the worst part is there is just no respect for me or anything I do. As I got home she didn&#039;t greet me. I went back to my office to relax and after a while went into the living room to greet her. She barely said two words to me and then the farting came. She continually farted and stunk up our living room and would not apologize, I must have counted two dozen farts before I snapped.<br><br>I work hard all day, she does NOTHING, then she has the gall to not even treat me with respect when I come home but fart at me like a maniac. I snapped, I threw some things, came THIS CLOSE TO PUNCHING HER. our boy was crying but I could not take it any more. I left and had to call my friend to just let me stay with him for tonight. I know this sounds like a joke but I am just sick of her, I&#039;m sick of this world and I want out. People just have no respect for each other anymore, including my wife, and I am honestly at my wits end. I just wanted to vent and am strongly considering divorce. I come here to \/pol\/ to laugh with you guys and share in the general shittiness of this world and I&#039;m living it right now. She has no respect for me.

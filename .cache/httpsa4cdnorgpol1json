It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491652396466,"time":1491652396,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"Wuap9VPw","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":133,"images":15,"omitted_posts":128,"omitted_images":13,"tail_size":50},{"no":120131186,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:28:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120130610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120130610<\/a><br><br>i&#039;m agnostic, and i know christianity is fiction<br><br>i don&#039;t consider myself an atheist because i don&#039;t know everything that can and can&#039;t exist<br><br>but christianity is objectively false, and it&#039;s easy to prove the only problem with proving it to a christian is that their beliefs run deep and are set in a way where logic and knowledge are quickly combated and nothing gets accomplished as a result","time":1491658098,"resto":120123024,"id":"+abGLe+i","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120131276,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:29:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120131000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120131000<\/a><br>You don&#039;t understand any fundamentals of church doctrine.","time":1491658150,"resto":120123024,"id":"m66Uu17n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120131278,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:29:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120131000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120131000<\/a><br>Some Catholic Nunneries in Ireland have been exposed, where they&#039;ve murdered and subjugated Orphans and un-baptised children and youth to inhuman conditions.<br><br><a href=\"#p120131062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120131062<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Can&#039;t Handle<\/span><br>More like can&#039;t be fooled.","time":1491658150,"resto":120123024,"id":"m\/J6xcis","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120131330,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:29:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120131186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120131186<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i know christianity is fiction<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but christianity is objectively false<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and it&#039;s easy to prove <\/span><br>ok, let&#039;s hear it","time":1491658180,"resto":120123024,"id":"YlaCaLw3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120131351,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:29:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120131062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120131062<\/a><br>There is nothing greater than human ingenuity and tenacity.

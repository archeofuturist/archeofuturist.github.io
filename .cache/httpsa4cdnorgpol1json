The fellowship was initially located at Redwood Drive, in San Rafael. The Harbinger facility was located on 1,085 acres, in Lake County, California, about 100 miles north of the San Francisco Bay Area.<br><br>The extremely rural isolated area would have provided a perfect location for activities like those alleged to have taken place by commenters on Harbin&#039;s social media who describe sexual abuse as well as CIA activities involved with mind control.<br>Don Hamrick, as a pilot, flew a Cessna Twin C1J from one destination to another, 23 - 24 times per month, for a sold year and a half, from 1967 to 1969. He was usually accompanied by Owen Jones, one of the three directors, for Frontiers of Science Fellowship<br><br>With his physics background, Hamrick had previously been responsible for the research and development, and the patent filing, of a number of highly sophisticated medical, musical (sound, switching), and machining apparatus and methodologies. They were filed in relation to the Syndyne corporation which Hammrick owned, but later sold.&quot;<br><br><br>h ttps:\/\/steemit.com\/news\/@whitedeer9<wbr>217\/ra-anon-esalen-ring-pedophilia-<wbr>tied-to-hai-global-harbin<br><br>h<br><br>ttps:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/place\/95<wbr>+Harbor+Master+Rd,+South+San+Franci<wbr>sco,+CA+94080\/@37.6625717,-122.3773<wbr>101,446m\/data=!3m1!1e3!4m21!1m15!4m<wbr>14!1m6!1m2!1s0x808f78663b33c841:0x1<wbr>4ea1db97e7f5672!2s95+Harbor+Master+<wbr>Rd,+South+San+Francisco,+CA+94080!2<wbr>m2!1d-122.3750173!2d37.662358!1m6!1<wbr>m2!1s0x808580d8d708cbcb:0x802835dc7<wbr>589b6ee!2s2+Marina+Blvd,+San+Franci<wbr>sco,+CA!2m2!1d-122.4317732!2d37.806<wbr>8223!3m4!1s0x808f78663b33c841:0x14e<wbr>a1db97e7f5672!8m2!3d37.662358!4d-12<wbr>2.3750173","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-03-24 at 10.26.50 PM","ext":".png","w":710,"h":596,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":209,"tim":1490412465633,"time":1490412465,"md5":"qXXjdQyHYtRY8XZCvlWwsA==","fsize":636873,"resto":0,"id":"C5AowQpr","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"esalen-hai-global-pedogate","country_name":"United States","replies":129,"images":50,"omitted_posts":124,"omitted_images":49,"tail_size":50},{"no":118190921,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:32:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118190270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118190270<\/a><br><br>And we all know USAID is CIA -

Syria is basically a highly prosperous dictatorship in the Levant that is financially independent from Israel, won&#039;t allow western forces to put an oil pipeline through the country, and is in Russia&#039;s sphere of influence.

The &quot;rebels&quot; don&#039;t exist. There are several factions of them, but they are essentially ISIS. There is literally no reason for the average European nor American to give a shit about Syria, but we got lied to about &quot;muh gas attack&quot; back in 2012 and they&#039;re doing it again now.

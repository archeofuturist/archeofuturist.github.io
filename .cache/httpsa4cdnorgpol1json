Some romans claimed that shaving the beard and armpits was hygenic, but shaving any more than that was feminine.<br><br>However the argument can be made that shaving at all is feminine because you are reducing the gender dividers. Women simply don&#039;t grow beards, and if everything was left natural this would be an obvious divider.<br><br>Trannys go so far as to have laser hair removal on their face.

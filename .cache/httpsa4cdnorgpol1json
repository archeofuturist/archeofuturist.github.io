But don&#039;t his views undermine identity politics rather than promote it?<br><br>All SJWs seem to believe that identities are something pre-existing; something that you&#039;re born with. Foucault tried to show that power creates its own subjects; identities only arise as a result of discourse. &quot;Homosexuals&quot; did not exis until discourse shifted in the late 19th century and created the concept of sexual orientation. Previously sodomy had been seen as a crime, something anyone could do, but suddenly there was a whole new category of human being defined by sexuality that people began to be identified by and identify themselves with. Doesn&#039;t identity politics just reinforce the current discourse? It also seems to exist under the assumption that power is a deviation from some prehistorical utopian state with no power relations, something they are trying to get back to. Foucault sought to prove that power is ubiquitous, and again, that who we are is the product of that; we do not create power but the other way around.

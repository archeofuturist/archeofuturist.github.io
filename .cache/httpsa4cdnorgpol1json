It allows you to navigate through the world, provide for your needs, create things, have power and avoid getting backstabbed. For this, you must see the world with a critical eye.<br><br>To start with, try doubting everything you see or hears. This is very important, because you don&#039;t know something unless you have a reason to believe it&#039;s true or you have proof that it&#039;s true. This doesn&#039;t mean that you should believe everything is true, but instead just accept that you don&#039;t know what you don&#039;t know.<br><br>Realise the implications and logical steps in a position. For example, the belief that all morals and ethics are relative. This can be used as a justification for multiculturalism or mass immigration because their values, morals etc. are just as meaningful as ours.<br><br>Another example is the belief that we have free will and that circumstances don&#039;t make who you are. You can use this belief to justify not giving welfare to people and defunding social programs because they chose that.<br><br>Notice that these &quot;higher beliefs&quot; (morality, religion, values) often idealy determine &quot;lower beliefs&quot; (gun rights, lgbt rights, capitalism etc).

So I&#039;ll try to summarise as easily as possible.<br>Firstly, you got Liberalism. Now in America and Australia, Liberalism this HUGE thing that has been there around each different kind of revolution. However, Liberalism is built on the idea of change. To change ones ideas to be inclusive and evolve to accept all. While this sounds nice at first, think about what this means in the long run. At first, it&#039;s accepting of Women&#039;s Rights to Vote, then Blacks, then gays then so on and so on. It&#039;s an organisation built on acceptance. Which again, sounds nice in theory, which is why a lot of young, white kids are attached to it. After all they grew up watching Saturday Morning cartoons about heroes who save the day, protect the people and do good.<br>This is why people are so attached to Liberalism. Twenty years ago, I would have been all for it too. But Leftism is an ideology that will, without fail, slowly consume itself. It begins to go full circle. Now you have to understand, leftists think they&#039;re heroes. They&#039;re people who can never do wrong, which is why Leftism itself can never be wrong. And so, they can never blame themselves for their or their ideologies failing and must blame someone else. Leftism has started to accept people that do not conform to the ideology itself. Namely Muslims. The Muslim religion is inherently conservative, and there are branches of the religion just like in Christianity or Cathlocism (see; sunni or shiite etc. etc.) that get more and more extreme as you go further and further right.<br><br>CONT","time":1490975061,"resto":119063781,"id":"WvQ09uyf","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119067186,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)11:44:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119067159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119067159<\/a><br>And now you begin to see the problem. Leftism and Liberalism, an ideology originally based on Liberty and Freedom, starts to accept people who are inherently against that. In Iran, it is against the law for Gays to exist without changing their sex. In Saudi Arabia Gays can be executed (in fact, there was a recent Saudi diplomat who applied for asylum in America after his sexual preferences were revealed due to fear of being behead).<br><br>Can you see the problem? Now you&#039;re probably thinking, what does this have to do with being white or proud of that fact? Well, it has to do with the acceptance, remember, they&#039;ve come full circle. They can&#039;t readily accept Muslims, but they also can&#039;t readily decline them. So they choose to simply bury their head in the sand, complain that it&#039;s racist to say anything about them and find someone to blame. And the easiest choice to blame people for their shortcomings, are whites. After all, their knowledge doesn&#039;t go outside of their own country, they only know what they know because of movies and what the inherently leftist colleges tell them. Whites were Nazi&#039;s, whites were there during colonization, whites were slave owners. etc. etc. Except what they fail to understand, is that all countries, both white, black, arab, asian and whatever else all did similar things. The Egyptians enslaved Jews. Africans sold out their own people and even today, still partake in slavery and genocide of religious groups. Chinese killed Tibetans, and millions of their own people. <br>But, these facts go against leftism. Remember, leftism and liberalism can never be wrong, they&#039;re the heroes, the ones that belong to liberty.","time":1490975083,"resto":119063781,"id":"WvQ09uyf","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}]}

Or we plow up grasslands and do the same thing. <br><br>We should be mimicking natural cycles when it comes to producing our food. When bison used to roam the great planes, they&#039;d move as a giant bunched up herd, eat some of the grass, and trample a bunch of the rest and move on after a short while, and the grass would recover and grow again. For annual crops, we can use annual\/biennial cover crops, graze our cattle in a similar manner in the spring, plant our crops, and start the cycle over again. Then leave some native prairie that we graze on a planned rotation based on how the plants there grow. If we would do that, we could build soil a fuckload faster than 1 inch every hundred years, and that means locking carbon into the soil. That&#039;s just one of many ways that people have figured out how to mimic the natural cycles of nature while producing food.","time":1490677199,"resto":118600918,"id":"J882vvUM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118613045,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:56:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why didn&#039;t niggers vote for Bernie?","filename":"la-na-tt-democrats-black-voters-20160226","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1152,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490676973006,"time":1490676973,"md5":"KeIDoZvhPVB9FJ3aOqtXEw==","fsize":637519,"resto":0,"id":"V4HEniRx","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-didnt-niggers-vote-for-bernie","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":118613124,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:57:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118613045\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118613045<\/a><br>He was a cuck, niggers don&#039;t respect weakness.","time":1490677031,"resto":118613045,"id":"0BmLpDOT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118613371,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:00:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118613124\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118613124<\/a><br>this also niggers don&#039;t vote","time":1490677200,"resto":118613045,"id":"l9ehpbl+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118612682,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:51:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"so basically i found a network of CP on youtube. how do i report this and what can i legally do to get it taken down. i wont make an account just to report this.","filename":"1488506273595","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":451,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":181,"tim":1490676713303,"time":1490676713,"md5":"sxqOJ7Jp4d3xX9jhbyy\/Jg==","fsize":50474,"resto":0,"id":"PyX8ZIVe","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-basically-i-found-a-network-of-cp-on-youtube","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":2,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":1},{"no":118612960,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:55:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118612682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118612682<\/a><br>FBI tip site YT wont do shit","time":1490676912,"resto":118612682,"id":"pxOENxAN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118613204,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:58:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118612960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118612960<\/a><br><br>whats the best FBI tip site?<br><br>and there is a fucking lot of it. several hundred channels. they all have each others channels saved. i can&#039;t fucking believe none of this has been reported yet.","filename":"1461445805852","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1920,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490677092297,"time":1490677092,"md5":"yUP1jixlKvVa2jYZzo16aA==","fsize":358576,"resto":118612682,"id":"PyX8ZIVe","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118613269,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:58:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"Post the link so we can report it","time":1490677131,"resto":118612682,"id":"BcQholb1","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118613354,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:59:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118613204\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118613204<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.fbi.gov\/tips<br><br>after the comey shit who knows if they will do anything but it&#039;s worth a shot","time":1490677188,"resto":118612682,"id":"pxOENxAN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118613367,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:59:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118613269\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118613269<\/a><br>yeah right.<br><br>report.","filename":"tumblr_n0n0xn5x7v1qz6f9yo4_1280","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":1028,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1490677198738,"time":1490677198,"md5":"oniIueQtRaD1CSzMiMQKbQ==","fsize":176610,"resto":118612682,"id":"H5qvgO6K","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118597526,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)22:16:41","name":"White privileges","com":"White privilege is bullshit what do<br>Y&#039;all think","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":800,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490667401826,"time":1490667401,"md5":"VJ5Y7j8Iudp2G3N1tat6Kw==","fsize":200883,"resto":0,"id":"d8Q9+S+3","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"white-privilege-is-bullshit-what-do","country_name":"United States","replies":59,"images":13,"omitted_posts":54,"omitted_images":11},{"no":118612394,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:48:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118597526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118597526<\/a><br>what is my privileged?

This trick can be easily shot down by pointing out non-equivalence in the definitions of \u201cblackness\u201d and \u201cwhiteness\u201d. \u201cBlackness\u201d is defined by possession of \u201cblack\u201d heritage. \u201cWhiteness\u201d, on the other hand, is defined not by possession of \u201cwhite\u201d heritage, but by non-possession of \u201cnon-white\u201d heritage. (For example, Zionist puppet Barack Obama, who has one \u201cblack\u201d parent and one \u201cwhite\u201d parent, is considered \u201cblack\u201d by most self-identified \u201cblack\u201d people, but is not considered \u201cwhite\u201d by most self-identified \u201cwhite\u201d people.) Therefore, \u201cBlack Pride\u201d means being proud to have \u201cblack\u201d ancestors, which is not offensive. On the other hand, \u201cWhite Pride\u201d means being proud to have no \u201cnon-white\u201d ancestors, which is of course highly offensive. In agreement with common intuition, and contrary to what many WNs claim in public, \u201cWhite Pride\u201d indeed implies contempt for \u201cnon-white\u201d people as a whole.<\/span>","time":1492520165,"resto":121680612,"id":"G8XYWvLh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121681600,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:58:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121681080\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121681080<\/a><br>Letting it go unquestioned in the media for decades is a good way to get a whole generation of white kids hating their own people.

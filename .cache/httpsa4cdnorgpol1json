Why take a neglectable sum from each of the workers when you can take a big chunk from the owner? If the state&#039;s income would consist largely out of taxation of the workers, perhaps it would feel more inclined to ensure that workers get more money and that the workers&#039; word is heard. In the current terms though, the state is interested to ensure that the owners make more money. Because if the percentage for the owner is 50% and for the worker is 10%, The state would get 50% of the profit if it taxes the owner, and would get 10% of it if it gets distributed to the workers through bigger wages.<br><br>Thus progressive taxation ultimately enslaves the people to the owner+state duo.","time":1493909085,"resto":124057013,"id":"OsGpG6OD","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"}]}]}

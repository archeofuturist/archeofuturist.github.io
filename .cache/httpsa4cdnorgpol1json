Malloy has proposed a laundry list of harsh and unpopular spending cuts to cities and towns, social services and environmental programs, and lawmakers are scrambling to come up with alternatives.<br><br>According to supporters of the legislation, pot taxes would include a 23.65 percent gross receipts tax plus the 6.35 percent sales tax, for an effective overall rate of 30 percent. The bill calls for alegalization date of July 1, 2018.<br><br>Looney said experts estimate that pot taxes would bring in $13 million in revenue in the first six months, $64 million in the first full year of legalization, and $100 million a year after that.<br><br>The legalization bill would prohibit pot use by anyone under 21; limit legal possession to no more than 1 ounce of marijuana; and allow home cultivation of five plants per adult. The legislation would allow for five types of marijuana businesses, all licensed and regulated by the state: pot retailers, lounges, cultivation facilities, product manufacturers, and laboratories.<br><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/i0Lhf<br><br>Two Illinois state lawmakers introduced legislation last week that would allow residents 21 and older to possess, grow or buy up to an ounce (28 grams) of marijuana and license businesses to sell marijuana products subject to regulation. They say it would help fill Illinois\u2019 multibillion-dollar budget hole with $350 to $700 million in new tax revenue.<br><br>A national advocacy group, the Marijuana Policy Project, based the estimate on the proposal\u2019s $50-per-ounce wholesale tax, Illinois\u2019 standard sales tax, federal marijuana consumption data and recreational pot prices in Colorado. The proposal earmarks 50 percent of wholesale revenues for the state\u2019s general fund and divides the remaining half 30\/20 between education and public health.","filename":"weedman2","ext":".jpg","w":553,"h":310,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490642408218,"time":1490642408,"md5":"3zxoZZmDDVHlC\/orXV4y8Q==","fsize":21747,"resto":0,"id":"cXg0dt7q","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"illinois-connecticut-considering-marijuana-for","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":118550980,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:39:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118548720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118548720<\/a><br>I heard his wife left him.","time":1490643542,"resto":118548720,"id":"KK\/7y7ux","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118551346,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:41:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m from Illinois and it might just help us with the crime problem here in shitcongo.","time":1490643703,"resto":118548720,"id":"XZNnKP+g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118551731,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:44:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Taxing pot to cover other shortfalls as a condition of legalization?<br><br>Totally ok with this","time":1490643893,"resto":118548720,"id":"xNCnN3c7","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118533759,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)13:14:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Would \/pol\/ support the Stormcloaks or The Empire?","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490634851672,"time":1490634851,"md5":"XAqMrK9hFzYva3hd+F6Iug==","fsize":97503,"resto":0,"id":"\/GD63+9X","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"would-pol-support-the-stormcloaks-or-the-empire","country_name":"United States","replies":110,"images":16,"omitted_posts":105,"omitted_images":16,"tail_size":50},{"no":118551388,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:42:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118551143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118551143<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Implying that isn&#039;t misinformation in the case the dossier is compromised<\/span>","time":1490643720,"resto":118533759,"id":"stbnwDOW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118551423,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:42:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118550995\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118550995<\/a><br>Thinking a compromised Cyrodil and High Rock could do anything against the AD.<br><br>You may have missed it but the Empire is not what it once was.<br>At this point it is barely an alliance nevermind an Empire.","time":1490643738,"resto":118533759,"id":"2d5ZJgLB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118551480,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:42:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118533759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118533759<\/a><br>Neither, the people of the Black Marsh will rise again.","time":1490643765,"resto":118533759,"id":"JrilM389","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118551654,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:44:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118533759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118533759<\/a><br>As a redguard, I would support neither.

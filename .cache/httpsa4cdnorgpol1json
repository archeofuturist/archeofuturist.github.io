I&#039;ve got a crazy sex drive and it&#039;s still wired only to female insertion fantasies. That may be due to the fact that I didn&#039;t listen to porn ever. I would feel guilty if it seemed like the chick wasn&#039;t into it, so I turned the sound off and used it for purely visual stimulation. The lack of penetration and sheer vanilla-ness of lesbian porn was boring enough with sound, so without sound it was almost a complete turn off. Eventually, I found the only porn sounds I actually enjoyed enough to listen to were ones of female submissives who clearly did enjoy being submissive, and the heavy ball-slapping sounds of the rougher stuff being carried out. Dildo pron turns me off for the most part unless it is used sparingly to get the female ready. I guess I got lucky because even when visiting the most degenerate body-transformation and fuck-everything-in-sight fantasy games there are I would always fantasize as the penetrative agent in any encounter in those games. Additionally, the gay stuff never held any sway.<br><br>When I started seeing porn of black dudes fucking whoever it was like , sure whatever. I&#039;d do that too. But then I noticed that white and jap culture save for the gangbanging genre has little to no examples of this. THen I started noticing more and more cuck shit.

At the time the first Aboriginals came to Australia 50,000 years ago, humans were still in the Stone Age. They did not have the technology to build seagoing vessels of any kind. Since Australia was always separated from other countries by an ocean; humans could not have travelled to Australia on any sort of sea-going vessel such as rafts, canoes or boats. The final crossing to Australia was probably made by accident. It is most likely that the initial arrivals got to Australia unintentionally. These people were probably carried across the ocean on drifting debris as a result of a major flood or even a tsunami in a land somewhere further to the north. Some say, that given the genetic homogeneity of the aboriginal population, this could have even been just one pregnant female.&#039;<br><br>&#039;The first Australians branched off from an Asian population that had already separated from the ancestors of Europeans.&#039;<br><br>The out of africa theory is quite obviously bullshit.

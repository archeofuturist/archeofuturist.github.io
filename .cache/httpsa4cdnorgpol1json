This creates a problem where the parents of a child between 16 and 18 do not consent to their child having sex. It may in some cases be considered as \u2018statutory rape\u2019: If the parents are willing to go through the criminal procedure by opening a case and if the court can determine that the child did not possess the mental capacity to be considered \u201cemancipated\u201d or of a mental state to make decisions like an 18-year-old adult. The latter is usually the more difficult one to proof, as many children do show some mental level of \u2018adulthood\u2019 as early as age 15, and are generally perceived more responsible than younger kids. http:\/\/www.wikigender.org\/wiki\/ages<wbr>-of-consent-to-sex-in-south-africa\/<wbr>.

To understand them you must think of them as two separate items. Communism is used purely to justify the formation of the cult, once established there is no need to work towards communism, the cult devotes almost all it&#039;s resources to expanding the influence and power of the cult. After the initial creation the group no longer even attracts members by promising communism, standard cult tactics are used. As a result the average marxist or communist doesn&#039;t even care about communism, they&#039;re there due to social pressure and other non-political motivation. It&#039;s why calmly explaining to them communism is impossible in reality does nothing, they aren&#039;t interested in communism to begin with.","time":1492858782,"resto":122260491,"id":"fEKwalk0","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122255233,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:36:55","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Trump puts EU ahead of Britain in trade queue","com":"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA","filename":"trump puts EU ahead of Britain","ext":".jpg","w":521,"h":659,"tn_w":197,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492850215113,"time":1492850215,"md5":"qYPkGrWUH+qNRIY+pdx4oA==","fsize":153239,"resto":0,"id":"EAxGvST+","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-puts-eu-ahead-of-britain-in-trade-queue","country_name":"Germany","replies":42,"images":9,"omitted_posts":37,"omitted_images":9},{"no":122264386,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)06:54:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122263733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122263733<\/a><br>No, every time I see a new one of these threads I&#039;m reminded just how happy I am to be leaving a union with you guys. <br><br>I just honestly don&#039;t understand why you are here.","time":1492858496,"resto":122255233,"id":"Hd+LDTUQ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122264489,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)06:56:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122255233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122255233<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the times<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;posted by a fucking nigger<\/span><br><br>Made me think","time":1492858576,"resto":122255233,"id":"BWRLu5Ww","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122264640,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)06:58:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122255233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122255233<\/a><br>Obsessed.<br><br>Go back to your wurst Ulf.","time":1492858691,"resto":122255233,"id":"WgLLG2Lr","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122264746,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)06:59:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;trusting a Newspaper like the Times<\/span><br>That&#039;s called fake news, friend.

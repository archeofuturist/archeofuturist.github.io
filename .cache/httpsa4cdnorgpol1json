People, who not only deny, but also fight against Him and His glory. In the middle ages, these people were the muslims. They denied the teachings of Christ, and in the same time, fought against it, slaughtering christians an burning churches everywhere they went. The crusader threw away their purity, their sin-free lives, they stepped down from the path of holiness, just to save others. They drove out these barbarian muslims from our land, so they can&#039;t kill more christians and they can&#039;t destroy christianity. And God knows this.

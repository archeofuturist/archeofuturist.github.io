He developed a new style of writing that modernized French literature. His most famous work is the 1932 novel, Journey to the End of the Night.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In 1935, British critic William Empson had written that C\u00e9line appeared to be &quot;a man ripe for fascism&quot;.[13] Two years later C\u00e9line began a series of pamphlets containing antisemitic themes: Bagatelles pour un massacre (Trifles for a Massacre) (1937), L&#039;\u00c9cole des cadavres (The School of Corpses) (1938) and Les Beaux draps (The Fine Mess) (1941).

Bernhard Payr, the German superintendent of propaganda in France, considered that C\u00e9line &quot;started from correct racial notions&quot; but his &quot;savage, filthy slang&quot; and &quot;brutal obscenities&quot; spoiled his &quot;good intentions&quot; with &quot;hysterical wailing&quot;.[18][19]<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In February 1944, while C\u00e9line was having dinner in the German embassy in Paris with his friends Jacques Benoist-M\u00e9chin, Pierre Drieu La Rochelle and Gen Paul, he asserted to German ambassador Otto Abetz that Hitler was dead and had been replaced by a Jewish double.[22]<\/span>","filename":"IMG_0634","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":1088,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493121434031,"time":1493121434,"md5":"cLHdjQa6inVpsOVZ3JZTKQ==","fsize":211959,"resto":122722700,"id":"\/VfDinnT","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122726423,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:59:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122722700\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122722700<\/a>","filename":"mishima","ext":".jpg","w":497,"h":750,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493121578340,"time":1493121578,"md5":"XHg1Mm3X7mTqBl8m7EmLnQ==","fsize":59289,"resto":122722700,"id":"qKVnXiP2","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122726442,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:59:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122724442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122724442<\/a><br>I agree","time":1493121587,"resto":122722700,"id":"HR2XF7QO","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122714103,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)04:53:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;the holocaust didn&#039;t hap--<\/span>","filename":"Pile-of-Shoes-Auschwitz","ext":".jpg","w":3872,"h":2592,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":167,"tim":1493110406648,"time":1493110406,"md5":"CY41bKxwlFV06BBgF96WhA==","fsize":2571981,"resto":0,"id":"hQe40534","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-holocaust-didnt-hap","country_name":"Australia","replies":284,"images":97,"omitted_posts":279,"omitted_images":97,"tail_size":50},{"no":122726174,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:56:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122725955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122725955<\/a><br>HOLY SHIT, THEY ACTUALLY DISABLED COMMENTS<br>MY SIDES","filename":"l04he","ext":".jpg","w":399,"h":385,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1493121364975,"time":1493121364,"md5":"baBX2GH9x0BEBn0aLFr8oA==","fsize":28148,"resto":122714103,"id":"aM9HYMCh","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":122726181,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:56:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122725955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122725955<\/a><br>They also (((shut down))) the comments on the BBC&#039;s holohoax remembrance video too. <br><br>Sad to see it go, but I still love the fact that we fucking own the internet.

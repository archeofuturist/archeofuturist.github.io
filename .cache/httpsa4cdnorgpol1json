Those records went up in flames.<br><br>The 2nd was the lease on the twin towers owned by a jew who you can Google.

What a surprise.<br><br>Invading the middle east was necessary to get us to where we are now. So that was a big reason. Blame them, destroy those countries, bring another holy war and start WW3 all over again. The flooding of muslims into Europe is absolutely a side effect of destabilizing that region.<br><br>US also controls the poppy fields out there. Heroin is pretty big these days in case you haven&#039;t heard... guess who&#039;s earning all that money?<br><br>Many companies in the twin towers &amp; in WTC7 held gov&#039;t records... I believe the FBI or CIA had an office in one. Many many records were destroyed and will never be found because of those events. That one thing alone is reason enough.<br><br>As for mystical reasons I do not have answers there yet. <br><br>Rituals typically work on many levels and this was a ritual sacrifice. People died. Blood and fear are energies that can be harvested during these rituals. Whether occultists were practicing a ritual and harvesting this energy as it occurred is beyond my knowledge.

One thing shift managers always look for is guys who can be counted on and are flexible. I saw several generations of summer job kids over the years and a staggering proportion of them were complete slobs, thinking they can slack off and just go from where the fence is lowest. If you prove that you take your job seriously even when working some complete shit of a task, you&#039;re already a cut above the rest. Working your way into the management the old fashioned takes a lot of time and patience, but it still happens in the current year.

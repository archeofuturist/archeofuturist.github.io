Yes, we know you don&#039;t like Trump and yes, we know you are upset that he won. But what are you trying to spin by saying Trump and Russia are colluding?<br><br>1.

All it did was show that the DNC and their super delegates had Hillary coined as their nominee before the election process even started. Which people should be happy about knowing.<br><br>2. Russia had absolutely no idea Trump was going to win the election, just like everyone else had no idea. Everyone was surprised. <br><br>3. The Trump administration has not done anything that empowers Russia or done anything that would hint that Trump is a secret shill for Russia. The administration has been clear on where they stand with Ukraine, Crimea and other hot spots in the world. Trump has not done anything to weaken us.<br><br>4. Wasn&#039;t it the Obama administration that wanted to Buddy up to Iran, and gave them billions of dollars only for Iran to spit in our face?

Europe is set to be transformed-into a &quot;retirement home&quot; this is because of an increasing number of older people, who isn&#039;t economically active. To counter this development should the European countries open their borders and allow young people to immigrate from states outside Europe? From what areas can you assume that those who move to Europe comes from? What difficulties do the immigrants face as they to move to Europe?<br><br>3. Examine how HIV\/AIDS is spreading in the world. Where it spreads rapidly and where the increase has come to a halt? Why is sub-Saharan Africa hard hit by HIV \/ Aids? How does society of many cases of HIV\/Aids?

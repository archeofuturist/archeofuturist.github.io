We had just lit the candles to celebrate the Sabbath when an SS officer and a Greek policeman burst into the house. They told us we should get ourselves ready for a big trip.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The 85-year-old slides the sleeve of his shirt up and uncovers his left forearm. The number 182558 is tattooed there in dark-blue ink.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The transport to Auschwitz took two weeks. His sick father died on the journey. Upon arrival, they had to strip and submit to an inspection. Ganon&#039;s mother and five siblings were then sent to the gas chambers.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yitzhak Ganon was taken to the Auschwitz-Birkenau hospital, where Josef Mengele, the so-called &quot;Angel of Death,&quot; conducted grisly experiments on Jewish prisoners.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ganon had to lie down on a table and was tied down. Without any anesthetics, Mengele cut him open and removed his kidney. &quot;I saw the kidney pulsing in his hand and cried like a crazy man,&quot; Ganon says. &quot;I screamed the &#039;Shema Yisrael.&#039; I begged for death, to stop the suffering.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After the &quot;operation,&quot; he had to work in the Auschwitz sewing room without painkillers. Among other things, he had to clean bloody medical instruments. Once, he had to spend the whole night in a bath of ice-cold water because Mengele wanted to &quot;test&quot; his lung function. Altogether, Ganon spent six and a half months in the concentration camp&#039;s hospital.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When they had no more use for him, the Nazis sent him to the gas chamber. He survived only by chance: The gas chamber held only 200 people.

I hate to rain on the moral purists&#039; parade here, but realistic silicone sex dolls have to be made child-size for ergonomic reasons. Adult-sized silicone dolls would weigh more than 100 pounds, which is likely to result in injury when storing and retrieving them. The most you can safely expect the average user to be able to lift routinely without risk of injury is 75 pounds. I looked at some listings for these once, and the weight was listed at 80 pounds, which I thought was pushing it with regards to consumer safety.<br><br>Like, I can lift 100 pounds just fine. But sex dolls are an unwieldy shape that is more likely to result in improper lifting technique than, say, two bags of cement. I could easily injure myself with a 100-pound load if I lifted it improperly. So, consumer products that weigh more than 75 pounds are a safety concern even for the physically-fit.<br><br>If we consider sex dolls of realistic softness and density to be morally-neutral, or indeed a moral good if you consider the well-being of the severely-deformed or mentally-disabled, then we must consider child-sized sex dolls to be acceptable.

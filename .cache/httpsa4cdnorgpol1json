It wasn&#039;t getting reformed, it was being formed, that&#039;s different. If you want to change something about the treatis that define how the EU works, it requires that all the 27 State leaders, and all the 27 Parliament agree to it, and also it needs sevreal favorable referendums in some countries. It&#039;s impossible.","time":1492439188,"resto":121509754,"id":"x1pwlN++","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121531418,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:28:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Lesquen","filename":"IMG_0364","ext":".png","w":640,"h":1136,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492439300979,"time":1492439300,"md5":"Nz895WfPc7LGNWpccWuhJw==","fsize":401958,"resto":121509754,"id":"TJ3sxzl4","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121531508,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:29:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121509754\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121509754<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/121530796#p121530796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121530796<\/a>","time":1492439352,"resto":121509754,"id":"zobrsvN3","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":121531558,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:29:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121531144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121531144<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The whole campaign of Asselineau is based on that, He said himself that he won&#039;t do a referendum on that because it&#039;s the substance of his campaign so the election IS the referendum.<\/span><br>He literally can&#039;t do it without the parliaments approval which he won&#039;t get without referendum.

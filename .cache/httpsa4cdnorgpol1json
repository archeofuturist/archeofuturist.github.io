I think the US has a 3-point scheme:<br><br>- Step 1: Create an artificial civil war in a country. This is usually done to countries laden with oil.<br><br>- Step 2: Allow the civil war to continue for a year or two, completely destabilizing the entire region.<br><br>- Step 3: Come in with forces and &quot;finish&quot; the war. Appoint a leader who is basically an American puppet.<br><br>Meanwhile, large hoards of oil is drained from the country. I think this is their primary motivation.

Daily reminder that sea levels around the world were about 400 feet lower just before the end of the last Ice Age.<br><br>Near the end of the last Ice Age about 12,800 years ago, a giant comet that had entered the Solar System from deep space thousands of years earlier, broke into multiple fragments. Some of these fragments struck Earth, causing a global cataclysm unseen since the extinction of the dinosaurs. At least eight of the fragments hit the North American ice cap, while further fragments hit the Northern European ice cap. The impacts, from comet fragments a mile wide approaching at more than 60,000 miles an hour, generated huge amounts of heat which instantly liquidised millions of square kilometres of ice, destabilising Earth&#039;s crust and causing the global flood that is remembered in myths all around the world.<br><br>A second series of impacts, equally devastasting, causing further cataclysmic flooding, occurred about 11,600 years ago, the exact date that Plato gives for the destruction and submergence of Atlantis.

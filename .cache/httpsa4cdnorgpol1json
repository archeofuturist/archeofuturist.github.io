I read The Guardian every day. When terrorist attacks happened in the past, their columnists would quickly descend on their keyboards to write self-righteous articles filled with empty platitudes. illogical arguments for why everything&#039;s ok and contempt for &quot;right-wing&quot; politicians that might &quot;use these&quot; attacks.

Over the last 10 years I have had the pleasure of seeing the private parts of many, many people. What I&#039;m about to tell you may come as a bit of a surprise.<br><br>I&#039;d estimate that as many as 4 out of 100 people have messed up junk. You might have a guy named John with all the male secondary sex characteristics (beard, baldness deep voice etc.) but if you have to catheterize &#039;him&#039; you might find that there isn&#039;t a dick. You might see a little nub with no balls, a prehensile labia, some malformed balls with a strange peehole mound. <br><br>It really is a crap shoot and all I&#039;m saying is I had to change my viewpoint on gender as a strictly binary concept.<br><br>I know about x and y chromosomes, and yes humans come out somewhere along a male\/female continuum, but I get how IDENTIFYING as some gender you don&#039;t appear to be can at times be a completely rational thing considering the mess that happens in some people&#039;s pants due to how the hormones were dealt. I can&#039;t think trans sexual people are strictly insane moonbats with &#039;body dysphoria&#039; anymore after seeing what I&#039;ve seen. I have no reason to think that gayness is strictly a bad habit or kink either, it likely is a result of such odd distribution of hormones during development as with the trannies.<br><br>There are 2 sexes, but I have to face up to the reality that gender, as a social identifier is kind of an arbitrary label. Politically, things like this make arguments about gay marriages, insurance funded transition operations and bathroom designations more difficult than they appear.<br><br>That being said, everything SJW&#039;s rant about is concerning 56 genders, fanciful pronouns and otherkin is obviously complete bullshit.

To mix things a bit up I decided to make an FAQ about Islam<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why Islam?<\/span><br>Islam is truth. Christianity though initially having been based on a revelation by God has been thoroughly disproven. The bible is completely unreliable with the originals still unknown to this day. The quran however has been perfectly preserved since the beginning.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Are Islam&#039;s teachings and \/pol\/&#039;s views compatible?<\/span><br>Yes perfectly. Islam fights any form of degeneracy with an iron fist. No drugs, no alcohol, no feminism. Strong patriarchic family values. The sound of children&#039;s laughter has almost silenced in the west, Islam has the highest birthrate in the world.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isn&#039;t it mysogynistic?<\/span><br>No. 3 women convert to Islam for every male convert. Women realise feminism is a false gospel and only when you find your purpose in life you can be truely happy. Yes Islam commands modesty but so did the west for millenia. People know start to realise that&#039;s the norm. It is time that \/pol\/ realises that too. The 4 wives you will have are a bonus.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isn&#039;t it anti-nationalistic?<\/span><br>No. Islam commands us to respect all races and cultures and only cut out the blasphemous and degenerate aspects. That&#039;s why Islam in Indonesia differs greatly from say SA Islam. Obviously like christianity the religion itself hass no boundaries by country but it very well respects nations within. Without Islamic birth rates your race and nation will soon go extinct.","filename":"4ec98fe0f739d52bb37740609a96688e01c59cca32d77484352c5aa14beaad91","ext":".png","w":1437,"h":909,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":158,"tim":1493115042471,"time":1493115042,"md5":"Kry9YCndXBZjVEox6seM+w==","fsize":89757,"resto":0,"id":"3iqdDX6B","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"islam-general-chemo-edition","country_name":"Germany","replies":130,"images":18,"omitted_posts":125,"omitted_images":17,"tail_size":50},{"no":122729875,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)08:43:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122729685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122729685<\/a><br>Is it bad that I would feel safer going on vacation to to Saudi Arabia than Germany?<br>I feel that you have the less toxic muslimes in comparison.","time":1493124210,"resto":122718937,"id":"dgJUdY9D","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":122729888,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)08:43:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122718937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122718937<\/a><br>Can we nuke these fucking threads and gas OP already?<br>ffs this place","time":1493124222,"resto":122718937,"id":"qZwd3HEh","country":"HK","country_name":"Hong Kong"},{"no":122729952,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)08:44:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/islam\/ general<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;germany<\/span><br>Of fucking course","time":1493124261,"resto":122718937,"id":"KscySa93","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":122729969,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)08:44:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122729200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122729200<\/a><br>I will punch them whenever they disrespect our laws or way of life.","time":1493124274,"resto":122718937,"id":"MnIRSHnG","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122729984,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)08:44:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122728886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122728886<\/a><br>I&#039;m fully aware what Arabs are, and islam is.

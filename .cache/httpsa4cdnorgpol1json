Historical records, archaeology, and mitochondrial and Y-chromosome DNA have been marshaled in support of one theory or another, but there is little consensus regarding the overall genetic background of North African populations or their origin and expansion. We characterize the patterns of genetic variation in North Africa using \u223c730,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms from across the genome for seven populations. We observe two distinct, opposite gradients of ancestry: an east-to-west increase in likely autochthonous North African ancestry and an east-to-west decrease in likely Near Eastern Arabic ancestry. The indigenous North African ancestry may have been more common in Berber populations and appears most closely related to populations outside of Africa, but divergence between Maghrebi peoples and Near Eastern\/Europeans likely precedes the Holocene (&gt;12,000 ya). We also find significant signatures of sub-Saharan African ancestry that vary substantially among populations. These sub-Saharan ancestries appear to be a recent introduction into North African populations, dating to about 1,200 years ago in southern Morocco and about 750 years ago into Egypt, possibly reflecting the patterns of the trans-Saharan slave trade that occurred during this period.<\/span>","time":1493485060,"resto":123336553,"id":"\/Es+gsq6","country":"EG","country_name":"Egypt"},{"no":123352720,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)12:57:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123336553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123336553<\/a><br><br><br>When is this bullshit meme going to end?<br><br>Blacks weren&#039;t Egyptian, EGYPTIANS were EGYPTIANS.<br><br>Look at modern day Egypt, THOSE are the Egyptians!<br><br>How stupid can the black people be?<br><br>Also, if you are white and you think Egyptians were white, kill yourselves.<br><br>Egyptians ARE Egyptians.<br><br>Google it.","filename":"Modern Day Egyptian","ext":".jpg","w":236,"h":380,"tn_w":77,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493485066322,"time":1493485066,"md5":"PBm9FsHNNfkLSNUBxXTyhg==","fsize":32920,"resto":123336553,"id":"diWCeMt3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123352933,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)12:59:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123352304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123352304<\/a>","filename":"1469256561233","ext":".jpg","w":726,"h":590,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":101,"tim":1493485184676,"time":1493485184,"md5":"+U+3nTeaXvz7QMYDsNC6IA==","fsize":150244,"resto":123336553,"id":"\/Es+gsq6","country":"EG","country_name":"Egypt"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123346562,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)12:00:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"What&#039;s your opinion on India, \/pol\/?

I also believe that the Zodiac symbols we have today (like the constellation of Pisces the fish, for example) have existed for many thousands of years. Yes, it is true that there are some variations of Zodiac symbols here and there (for example, the Babylonians considered the constellation of Pisces to be represented by a sparrow), but the Zodiac symbols we Westerners are familiar with today have nevertheless existed for many thousands of years. Bolstering this argument is the fact that Indian astrology also uses the same Zodiac symbols (for example, Pisces is also represented by a fish in Indian astrology) and Indian mythology itself outright describes human lineages extending over a BILLION years into the past (you can read about these human lineages in the Puranas). This knowledge of astrology and the Zodiac also existed in Ancient Egypt, as demonstrated by the lion-bodied Sphinx (which was originally lion-headed to match its body). The Sphinx had the head of lion because it was created during the Age of Leo, which was between 11,000 to 13,000 years ago, which also means that it was created during the Younger Dryas period.

Ancient ruins like Gobekli Tepe and structures like the ancient pyramids around the world (ESPECIALLY the Great Pyramid in Egypt) are a legacy of an older global civilisation that no longer exists. This is the reason why about 5,000 years ago, ancient civilisations in places like Egypt and Sumer seem to have appeared virtually overnight and also seemed to suddenly have knowledge of astronomy, mathematics, agriculture, etc. It&#039;s because that knowledge was INHERITED from that previous civilisation (some people call this previous civilisation &#039;Atlantis&#039;, but personally, I think this shit is WAAAAAY BIGGER than Atlantis). When this previous civilisation collapsed, their successor civilisations created structures with certain mathematical principles encoded into them because they knew then (just like we know now) that mathematics is a UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE and that, when the time was right (which is basically now), we&#039;d notice the mathematical principles that they encoded into their structures and that the REASON why they encoded mathematical principles into their structures was because they wanted to bestow upon us a MESSAGE - a MESSAGE that we are now READY to decipher.","time":1493738000,"resto":123766141,"id":"OO27leKw","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123777030,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:14:55","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1483127819749","ext":".png","w":1320,"h":2652,"tn_w":62,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493738095896,"time":1493738095,"md5":"dCXU\/37t732JPQc\/lTDrjA==","fsize":399521,"resto":123766141,"id":"oxnWfymR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123767279,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)09:33:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/realDonaldTrump<wbr>\/status\/859393829505552385<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Madman<\/span>","filename":"tumblr_inline_oo4u1hlnoA1sv8lzv_540","ext":".png","w":540,"h":216,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":100,"tim":1493732007149,"time":1493732007,"md5":"Hf93KNDI+6HmoEoujZ7mAA==","fsize":112181,"resto":0,"id":"4ocYmKFO","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"madman","country_name":"United States","replies":36,"images":7,"omitted_posts":31,"omitted_images":6},{"no":123775954,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:03:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;republicans control the government<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;somehow we&#039;re still at risk of it being shutdown<\/span><br><br>Man, without a black guy to blame everything on these guys really don&#039;t know what to do.","time":1493737430,"resto":123767279,"id":"age9swyH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123776301,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:07:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"this is not responsible governance","time":1493737646,"resto":123767279,"id":"o3mKsmsc","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123776340,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:07:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123769317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123769317<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A government shutdown means Trump can&#039;t do anything, and the left is against that.

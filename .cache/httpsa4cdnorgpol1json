On 12 September 1942, RMS Laconia carrying some 2,732 crew, passengers, soldiers and prisoners of war (POWs), was torpedoed and sunk by the German U-boat submarine U-156 off the coast of West Africa. Operating partly under the dictates of the old prize rules, the U-boat commander, Korvettenkapit\u00e4n Werner Hartenstein, immediately commenced rescue operations. U-156 broadcast their humanitarian intent on open radio channels to all Allied forces in the area, and were joined by the crews of several other U-boats in the vicinity.<\/span><br>After surfacing and picking up survivors, who were accommodated on the foredeck, U-156 headed on the surface under Red Cross banners to rendezvous with Vichy French ships and transfer the survivors. En route, the U-boat was spotted by a United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-24 Liberator bomber. The pilots, having reported the U-boat&#039;s location, intentions, and the presence of survivors, were then ordered to attack the sub. The B-24 killed dozens of Laconia&#039;s survivors with bombs and strafing attacks, forcing U-156 to cast their remaining survivors into the sea and crash dive to avoid being destroyed. The pilots of the B-24 mistakenly reported that they had sunk U-156, and were awarded medals for their bravery.<br><br>There&#039;s more stupid shit like this the niggers did in the war","time":1491345800,"resto":119521035,"id":"3Wcpeskt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119528546,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:44:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"To be fair we were aiming for factories which were legitimate targets.

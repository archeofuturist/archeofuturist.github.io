They were usually shot in the Alps, the Black Forest, or the L\u00fcneburg Heath and always involved the outdoors. These films were noted for their rural settings, sentimental tone and simplistic morality, and centered on love, friendship, family and non-urban life. Also, the polarity between old and young, tradition and progress, and rural and urban life was articulated. The typical plot structure involved both a &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; guy wanting a girl, conflict ensuing, and the &quot;good&quot; guy ultimately triumphing to win the girl to the happiness of everyone and the children.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Heimat is a German word that can be translated as home, homeland, home soil or fatherland (each having a different emphasis and connotation).<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heima<wbr>tfilm","time":1490170338,"resto":117735261,"id":"vACcaDRj","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117737713,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:12:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117737372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117737372<\/a><br>Haneke is quite popular in Europe and I agree that his movies are anti-Western (die Weisse Fahne, Cach\u00e9, the Pianist, etc.)","time":1490170373,"resto":117735261,"id":"t5mBF7gb","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":117737749,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:13:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117735261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117735261<\/a><br>KUBRICK","time":1490170407,"resto":117735261,"id":"KhdF9ODi","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":117737754,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:13:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117737680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117737680<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Piano Teacher (film)<\/span><br>About some perverted shit, that Freud would have a field day over.","time":1490170410,"resto":117735261,"id":"vACcaDRj","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117737844,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:14:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;watch 71 Fragments<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the most spiritually alive and pragmatic character is a refugee child<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the most despicable character is a young white male<\/span>","time":1490170493,"resto":117735261,"id":"nfyHbtPr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117725261,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:27:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Amy Schumer&#039;s Netflix thing<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gets 1 star because it&#039;s genuinely bad<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Blames &quot;Alt-Right&quot; \/pol\/<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Netflix conveniently states that in response is remove the 5 star rating system<\/span><br><br>It&#039;s simple, I am canceling my Netflix subscription.","filename":"IMG_0882","ext":".jpg","w":660,"h":495,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490160443581,"time":1490160443,"md5":"8Mj9Qnuetf6s8pveBIC2eA==","fsize":59409,"resto":0,"id":"rFOpWlIk","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"amy-schumers-netflix-thing","country_name":"United States","replies":153,"images":38,"omitted_posts":148,"omitted_images":38,"tail_size":50},{"no":117737042,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:01:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117725261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117725261<\/a><br>Special Jew arrangements.

The answer to that question is noone. You might think the elites might use it to rid the earth of their enemies and reduce population, but even for them this way of doing it a) causes to many side effects and influence on nature and b) has too many variables, since you can&#039;t be sure who nukes where and you can&#039;t plan the outcome good enough to be able to stabilize a new society afterwards.<br><br>I mean look at the war zones we have today, war isn&#039;t what it used to be and the war in those countries is neverending.

This chaos would last for at least some decades and again the outcome would be very unstable and hard to plan for.<br><br>Second we have to ask ourselves why everyone keeps their bombs then. This one is simple and you heard it before: So no madman can push the button without killing himself. And there is a second answer: You can use nuclear weapons on a smaller scale for tactical combat. Small rounds with nuclear parts that wreck a lot of devastation will come, will be in use and will not influence nature too much. You can predict the outcome.

Then there is the prospect of a terrorist attack using a nuke, perhaps a \u2018dirty bomb\u2019.We must also recall that most false flag attacks, including 9-11, were drills that went live \u2013 they were pre-planned as a fake event designed to test emergency response but ended up being real events. This fact raises the disturbing notion that a nuclear event is being planned for NYC; and doubtless, it would be blamed on someone other than the perpetrators. The finger of blame might be pointed at ISIS in order to justify a US return to war in the Middle East, or perhaps it would point at North Korea to justify Trump\u2019s \u2018Armada\u2019 launching a strike on that nation.<br><br>Of course, it is likely that this is nothing more than a simple training exercise, but we think it is always sensible to take note of these events, just in case they later become part of some nefarious false flag event. <br><br>https:\/\/strategika51.wordpress.com\/<wbr>2017\/04\/25\/operation-gotham-shield-<wbr>u-s-govt-to-simulate-nuke-blast-ove<wbr>r-manhattan\/","filename":"15-Mt-on-Manhattan-500x422","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":422,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":211,"tim":1493307137261,"time":1493307137,"md5":"wRZVIOnVXdguR6IA0Bi6NQ==","fsize":64158,"resto":0,"id":"\/z3\/p74c","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"operation-gotham-shield-us-govt-to-simulate-nuke","country_name":"France","replies":15,"images":1,"omitted_posts":10,"omitted_images":0},{"no":123053459,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)12:25:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Watch the jews.

A lot of times, they say these things are exercises just as an excuse to get more police and personnel in the area because they have intelligence on something. If they know or believe a group is planning a certain type of attack somewhere, they&#039;ll call an exercise ahead of time, just in case the shit actually does go down. <br><br>I actually believe that to be the truth about what happened on 9\/11. They had intelligence that some sort of plan like that was in the works (which makes false flag people pick it up and reeee, &quot;they knew about it!&quot;) and their intel teams had picked that day as one of the potential dates. I mean, picking a significant date is natural in humans. Attackers will pick a day to make it more memorable or personal, even for themselves. 9\/11 is a pretty obvious date why it was chosen.<br><br>I think people are seriously underestimating May Day.

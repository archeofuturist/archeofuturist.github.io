Maybe some of them will use the UBI to get an education\/technical training. However, most would use it to support a meagre existence without bothering to improve themselves. We can already see this through current welfare systems. In my country education has been free up to Bachelor&#039;s for a long time yet poor people remain dumb and uneducated. They simply lack the will or ability to improve. Poverty is a subculture that actively discourages self-improvement.","time":1493064889,"resto":122613661,"id":"cZte9CNV","country":"TT","country_name":"Trinidad and Tobago"}]}]}

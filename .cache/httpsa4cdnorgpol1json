Corbyn has honest policies and honest expectations and for you to say a vote is wasted voting for someone who actually stands for the values i believe in is both insulting and ludicrous. What shall be the alternative the liberals who haven&#039;t shown any promise for years or the conservative government who have single handedly failed those of less fortune and young age. The conservative party has never once tried to include the younger voters because they have never been for the young or the lower class. They rely on us not to vote so they have an easier win for the general election.

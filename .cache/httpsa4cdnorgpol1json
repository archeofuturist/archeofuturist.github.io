The problem we have with migration is actually not people just arriving. These people are fairly low in number and most of them want to reach the UK anyway and only cause trouble because they are stuck at the Channel.<br>The real problem is the complete failure in integration of the many, many people who came (mostly from Algeria) after the peak of the 70s, in the 80s just to find unemployment and the beginning of recession. This results in the second generation being not only large in numbers but also the highest risk population in the country, the one that falls the most into all forms of criminality, etc. They are the most prone to extreme behaviors be it in gang activity, religious extremism, antisocial behavior, you name it. And there is little we can do since they are legally french thanks to soil laws + specific algerian family-grouping regime. These are the dangerous ones that are fucking up our national demographics, our empoverished neighbourhoods, who are filling the radical mosques, etc. Not the &lt;50k\/year migrants who try to get to Britain or the Netherlands.<br>And guess what?<br>Le Pen has no proposition regarding the actual issue.<br>The &quot;migrant issue&quot; is a demagogue smokescreen to hide the much more uncomfortable problem we&#039;ve refused to face since the 90s. The only thing she has is removing bi-nationality with countries outside of Europe which isn&#039;t going to do anything because again, all of these people are born in France and not even eligible to dual nationality.","time":1491900177,"resto":120566248,"id":"foStZBeM","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120575528,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)04:52:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120574905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120574905<\/a><br>Whatever. tldr.<br>I can tell you wnat your real problem is, and you&#039;re all pretty much infected by it.<br>The belief that Fraternity, Liberty and Equality are 3 things which can co-exist in any meaningful sense.<br>Equality is the opposite of Liberty, unless it is restricted very strictly to equality of opportunity.<br>But it isn&#039;t, is it? because you let the fuckwits vote and they don&#039;t understand this.","time":1491900720,"resto":120566248,"id":"H1Fgtm4T","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120575929,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)04:57:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120575528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120575528<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lol tl;dr<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;by the way this is why the stuff I didn&#039;t read is wrong<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cue blanket statement completely unrelated to the point<\/span><br>nice<br>(not that the misunderstanding regarding equality isn&#039;t one of the major issues in Europe and North America, it absolutely is, but it has nothing to do with anything I previously said, nor does it have anything to do with your previous point about corruption in politics)","time":1491901065,"resto":120566248,"id":"foStZBeM","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120576053,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)04:59:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120574905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120574905<\/a><br>Annex Algeria making it part of France and send all your nogs there","time":1491901178,"resto":120566248,"id":"h7uKsERs","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":120576077,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)04:59:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120575929\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120575929<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;failing to understand that tldr isn&#039;t a literal statement.

Holidays and frivolous things like that are basically something you do to reward yourself for earning so much money that you couldn&#039;t spend it all on things that you needed. If you haven&#039;t bothered to earn that money, what are you even rewarding yourself for? Simply stop doing it. Get yourself some hobbies that don&#039;t cost so much.

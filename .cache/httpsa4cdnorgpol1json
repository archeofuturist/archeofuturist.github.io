One thing I have to admit I never really connected to is the idea of charity or service -- NOT because I lack empathy, but rather because it seemed almost strange to me to focus on, say, feeding a homeless person, when there are all these other problems that are &quot;closer&quot; to me that need fixing -- helping the people in my own life with their struggles, illnesses, grief, etc., being a better person for my family, and that sort of thing. It almost seemed arbitrary to think of going out and putting my energy toward a problem removed from my own life when there&#039;s always so much &quot;at home&quot; that needs that kind of care. <br><br>Today, however, it struck me in a new way. As I look at the world around me, I can&#039;t help but feel that humanity is an unsolvable problem. I&#039;m sure I don&#039;t need to elaborate on what I mean by that. So I&#039;m suddenly seeing this call to service as an answer to that. It&#039;s unsolvable at the macro level, but as an individual, I can spread truth, mercy, and grace wherever I go, and there is no place that doesn&#039;t need those things, and that is what saves us, in a way, because the world will never be &quot;saved&quot; in the way we want it to be.<br><br>I&#039;d be curious to hear what other Christians think. It&#039;s been a tricky subject for me, as I don&#039;t wish to enable addicts, for example, or to misspend resources.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 kike on a stick<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 cucktianity is cucked<\/span>","filename":"1492025852917","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":1189,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":232,"tim":1492060646352,"time":1492060646,"md5":"T5vHiYdBAvzZKqybJ0QX4w==","fsize":559847,"resto":0,"id":"DJ+09OZD","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"serving-others-in-christ","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0},{"no":120872083,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)01:22:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"not &quot;unsolvable on a macro level&quot;... you just need to re-imagine Christ as a guerilla war chief directing his Nation\/Tribe in a long, pitched memetic battle against sin and death, with all signs pointing to defeat.<br><br>And then remember that happened last time, too.","time":1492060922,"resto":120871685,"id":"IfXrIZEP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120872164,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)01:22:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"Not a christcuck but heres my 2 cents.

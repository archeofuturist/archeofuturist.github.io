Russian muzhiks were indeed de facto slaves but their lives were anything but worthless to their feudal lords. To the contrary: the extent of a fiefdom was measured not by its area but by the number of serfs, because for most of its history Russia suffered a shortage of workforce relative to the size of its arable territory. The other thing that did not quite happen so often as the text suggests are the petty wars of nobles, although it did happen sporadically, especially in the Troubled Century.<br><br>I think whoever wrote this was extrapolating from Western serfdom. The incorrect aspects should be removed especially since they find no parallel in the fate of slaves. Slaves weren&#039;t worthless to their owners either (they represented monetary value like cattle) and dying in a petty war between slaveholder families was not a significant concern for them, either.","time":1490680492,"resto":118594143,"id":"RY+\/biJ6","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":118618478,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:57:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118600078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118600078<\/a><br>Are you retarded?","time":1490680651,"resto":118594143,"id":"5NJBQDSN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118618581,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:58:45","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1466150036222","ext":".jpg","w":460,"h":329,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1490680725264,"time":1490680725,"md5":"mIf0twNfZUNxXF1P4MpzLA==","fsize":22247,"resto":118594143,"id":"AfxH8i6W","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118618695,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:59:58","name":"Anonymous","filename":"dSgfa","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":518,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1490680798273,"time":1490680798,"md5":"aJLK16cu\/oOZExKLE6+R9A==","fsize":71297,"resto":118594143,"id":"AfxH8i6W","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118609305,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:15:39","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Are serial Killers Still Even A thing what happened to them?","com":"\/Pol redpill me Are serial killers still even a thing at least in america back in 40s trailing all the way even in to the early 1970s serial killers seemed to be a common thing or even a threat in news now in todays world it seems like they just vanished.<br><br><br>What happened was it just do to the increase of a police state, More Surveillance, A more armed society in america example Cheap Ar15 that anyone can buy parts for and build himself ?<br><br>desu its interesting in the sense that serial killers don&#039;t ever seem to be a big thing these days ITT: i didn&#039;t grow up in 50s or 60s im genz but they seemed to have been a part of that culture at least in the media so what happened pol?","filename":"serial killers","ext":".jpg","w":722,"h":406,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490674539381,"time":1490674539,"md5":"Igjvdr6iEGj6VWdEmfILKw==","fsize":38943,"resto":0,"id":"i+ywgkJS","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-serial-killers-still-even-a-thing-what","country_name":"United States","replies":275,"images":38,"omitted_posts":270,"omitted_images":38,"tail_size":50},{"no":118618593,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:58:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"yeah but your Canadian, its practically murder highway in this country, as long as you don&#039;t make a big mess of it they aren&#039;t going to fund a investigation.","time":1490680730,"resto":118609305,"id":"uzeXor3X","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118618594,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:58:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118618379\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118618379<\/a><br>You weird, ROC.

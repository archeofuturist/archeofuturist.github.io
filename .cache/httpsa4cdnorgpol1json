You never figured out how to live in a society bigger than one or two squabbling families. Starting thousands of years ago, everyone else on this planet without exception did - they invented religion, the idea of law, and the ideas of property and respect for the value of human life. This enabled tribes to coalesce into bigger groups and become organized. The rest is history, or rather civilization. But your lot never did this, did they? Abstract thought and problem- solving have never been the black man&#039;s strengths, have they? Did they invent a long-lived and intellectually coherent religion? Nope. Did they ever build a city? Nope. Did they even invent bricks? Nope (the reason there&#039;s no Stonehenge in Africa is because it took more than 20 people to move the slabs of rock - clearly a non-starter in Africa, where assembling more than 20 niggers normally results in a war). Did they till the land? Nope. Did they domesticate an animal for their use? Nope. Did they invent a written language? Nope. Did they invent the wheel? Mainly, nope. Were they curious enough about what lay out across the sea to sail upon it? Nope. And blacks are the only &quot;humans&quot; on this planet of which all this is true. Eskimos are more technically advanced than blacks were, despite the handicap of having no raw materials to work with other than dead fish and snow. Indians managed to domesticate the elephant. Why couldn&#039;t niggers? So why do you fail everywhere even today? Let me offer you jigaboos a hypothesis. It&#039;s because feral behavior - innate savagery, murderous violence if annoyed, predisposition to rape many women and thus fecklessly father many children - conferred valuable survival advantages on individuals","filename":"1490612245385","ext":".gif","w":400,"h":222,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":138,"tim":1491046978072,"time":1491046978,"md5":"reSq6l49dK81enp98rQw7Q==","fsize":1450070,"resto":0,"id":"eBz5MtjV","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"face-the-facts-niggers-your-race-are-a-failed","country_name":"Germany","replies":78,"images":26,"omitted_posts":73,"omitted_images":26},{"no":119183257,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)05:25:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119172147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119172147<\/a><br><br>In this map you can see thousands of years of invasions.

It is responsible with a protein that makes &quot;unbreakable\u201d bones, as surgeons say (because it tears apart surgical instruments more often). Another reason why for thousands of years the nomadic tribes did not have a chance against the western world, or even neanderthals (both mutations are associated with neanderthal areal, found only in Europe). This meant that individuals having these genes were better suited for harsh weather, had bigger brains, stronger bones, wider shoulders, a much bigger constitution. Having the genes to extract from the same glass of milk twice the nutrients and minerals, for generations on and on was a very big biological advantage - that&#039;s why one &quot;westerner&quot; could easily win against 5 or 6 &quot;easterners&quot;.

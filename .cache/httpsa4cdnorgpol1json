Put yourself in a historical mindset here, alphas lose the most by accepting monogamy and betas have everything to gain. 100 years ago, alphas could get more women living as a criminal. Criminals used to be a very small amount of the population, compared to today, precisely because betas (the largest group by far) avoided crime. They were getting women and a livelihood easily just by following the rules, which is what betas are good at. Why would they commit crime if they could get what they want just by being themselves?<br><br>Betas always hated and feared crime as long as they had access to wives. Now betas are attracted to crime because it&#039;s easier to fuck some dumb roastie who likes drugs than it is to find a wife as a typical law-abider. When betas (not omegas) start turning to gangs in droves it&#039;s a clear sign that your society is dying.","time":1492983808,"resto":122447930,"id":"f4yB86qo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122493138,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)17:43:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122463568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122463568<\/a><br>There is nothing dumber than the idea of evangelical atheism.

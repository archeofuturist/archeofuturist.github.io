These people lack fear at a primal level, and without fear they themselves do not respond to adverse stimuli properly. All empathy comes from having a perception of self. Basically, these people don&#039;t get a knot in their gut when someone is shooting at them, and thus, aren&#039;t able to truly understand why someone might not want to be shot at, or etc. That was kind of a ramble, but these should help you get what I mean cont","time":1493665196,"resto":123619118,"id":"zUFqeSy6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123654800,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:45:28","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Why was there the Civil War?

Papal authority is derived from scripture and a very early tradition, whereas the Orthodox today have modeled their church after a Roman system with the emporer at the head calling councils and such, but they no longer have the emporer so there hasn&#039;t been any doctrinal councils in the last thousand years or so whereas Catholics have had many.<br><br>2. the Catholic Church functions whereas the Orthodox do not. Catholics have held councils and had rulings on newer issues such as divorce, contraception etc. whereas the lack of unity and ability to articulate teachings has left the Orthodox accepting of divorce and contraception etc.<br><br>3. the Pope has acted universally within the church as a ruler and as a final court of appeals very early on before the schism. during the iconoclasm for instance almost every eastern Bishop was excommunicated by the pope and forced to comply later on.<br><br>4. the Orthodox churches have accepted papal authority as an entire body of bishops at two different councils after the schism (councils they hold to be infallible and binding). they reached agreements and the council of Lyons and council of Florence. but because there was little support amount laity back home it just fell apart, but they are technically still in affect according to ecclesiastical law.<br><br>5. the Catholic Church fits the marks of the true church better (one holy universal) they are not a conglomerate of national churches like the Orthodox but rather are totally unified, they are also global and much larger and not restricted to small regions like the Orthodox who are also split among nationalities.<br><br>these are few among many examples that I can think of at the moment.","time":1493529218,"resto":123409829,"id":"0ydxXZZR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123440126,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)01:14:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123431722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123431722<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Calvinism<\/span><br>Cancer","time":1493529242,"resto":123409829,"id":"4aSWYpR9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123440194,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)01:14:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123439285\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123439285<\/a><br>Saint Paul&#039;s Cathedral London<br><br>Original was concecrated in 1300<br>This current one was in 1697<br><br>Go there if you can","filename":"25f5108b45705da367fcf6dbf83301fe_large","ext":".jpg","w":533,"h":800,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493529289752,"time":1493529289,"md5":"JBL6TLVYmVGvOSNOIZ9n7w==","fsize":455077,"resto":123409829,"id":"6NLECe28","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123440198,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)01:14:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123439940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123439940<\/a><br>oh god please don&#039;t tell me you&#039;re a young earth creationist","time":1493529292,"resto":123409829,"id":"+CYIn7EJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123440197,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)01:14:52","name":"Anonymous","sub":"D.C. here it is hot as FUG for April","com":"How can \/pol\/ deny global warming when it is RECORD HOT in April?

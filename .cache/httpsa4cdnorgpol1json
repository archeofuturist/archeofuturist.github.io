Many of the rural areas surrounding it have dial up, satellite, or no internet at all. Chattanooga wants to expand its network so these rural areas can have the same Gbps and 10 Gpbs connections the city has. Rather than allow that to happen, Tennessee&#039;s legislature just voted to give Comcast and AT&amp;T a $45 million taxpayer handout.<br>This year, the Tennessee state legislature was finally considering a bill that would have let EPB expand its coverage (without providing it any special tax breaks or grants; EPB is profitable and doesn&#039;t rely on taxpayer money). Rather than pass that bill, Tennessee has just passed the &quot;Broadband Accessibility Act of 2017,&quot; which gives private telecom companies\u2014in this case, probably AT&amp;T and Comcast\u2014$45 million of taxpayer money over the next three years to build internet infrastructure to rural areas.<br><br>To be clear: EPB wanted to build out its gigabit fiber network to many of these same communities using money it has on hand or private loans at no cost to taxpayers. It would then charge individual residents for internet service. Instead, Tennessee taxpayers will give $45 million in tax breaks and grants to giant companies just to get basic infrastructure built. They will then get the opportunity to pay these companies more money for worse internet than they would have gotten under EPB&#039;s proposal.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":320,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":129,"tim":1491989145439,"time":1491989145,"md5":"aV8GI3vdkCyvbWNriP527A==","fsize":68814,"resto":0,"id":"uHvQ5V36","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"tennessee-votes-to-pay-45-million-for-slower","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":13,"images":1,"omitted_posts":8,"omitted_images":1},{"no":120737341,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:37:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120737290\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120737290<\/a><br>:^)","time":1491989835,"resto":120736602,"id":"\/+mxZIPk","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120737349,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:37:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120736602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120736602<\/a><br>East TN anon here.<br><br>AT&amp;T and Comcast are notoriously terrible corporations, and our state legislature is full of cuckservative shitkickers -- so this doesn&#039;t surprise me at all.

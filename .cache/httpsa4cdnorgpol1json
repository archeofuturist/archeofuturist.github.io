Our airforce would mop any threats up easily (as the Iraq war proves, tanks and amount of infantry dont mean anything if you dont control the sky) and the THAAD would destroy whats left of their nuclear arsenal if there is any left that is launched. Or Seoul\/Tokyo becomes rice krispies.<br><br>Next, accidental conflict. With all the current tensions on the border and at sea, its very much possible that one day a guard or ship is at the wrong place at the wrong time and a border conflict starts, this could quickly grow until it becomes a proper battle\/war. North Korean troops would rush the border causing severe casualties, more of which on the Northern side. But after some decisive battles because of American superior arms and technology, the Northerners would be pushed back. Kim might be less tempted to nuke Seoul in this situation in hopes of being able to capture the city, but more nukes would likely be launched than in the previous scenario, Many japanese cities would be targets and many south korean (more of the ones away from the border) <br><br>Finally, North Korean Preemptive nuclear strike. Self explanatory, Major cities like Seoul and Tokyo are targeted (possibly west coast USA cities depending on how far away this war is), A nuclear counterstrike would most likely be done against north korea by the US and there wont be much of a korean peninsula left. The THAAD system hasnt really been proven well enough to be at ease...<br><br>Frankly, I believe there will be a unified korea in a decade or two, I just dont know if it will be original recipe or extra crispy.<br><br>what do u think?","filename":"article-2292207-189824A2000005DC-496_634x423","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":423,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491887214600,"time":1491887214,"md5":"Std0IGqKR\/ObKK+itljWQg==","fsize":78574,"resto":0,"id":"nl4jxWlv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-have-a-few-theories-on-how-a-second-korean-war","country_name":"United States","replies":59,"images":8,"omitted_posts":54,"omitted_images":7},{"no":120561832,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)01:56:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120561693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120561693<\/a><br>Manpo<a href=\"#p120561674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120561674<\/a><br>Seems like a fun site i found after lookin up nk memes","time":1491890216,"resto":120556928,"id":"NVNX+VO7","country":"KP","country_name":"North Korea"},{"no":120561841,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)01:57:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120561649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120561649<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying basket weaving is not wholesome activity for whole family<\/span>","time":1491890222,"resto":120556928,"id":"0LjvzAbp","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120561987,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)01:58:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120561649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120561649<\/a><br>A true autist, indeed, I&#039;m sure","time":1491890326,"resto":120556928,"id":"Jb2kByZQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120562071,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)01:59:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120561832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120561832<\/a><br>what is your Songbun rank?","time":1491890380,"resto":120556928,"id":"PHyTZfz5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120562081,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)01:59:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120561832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120561832<\/a><br>how many times per day do you pray to the Great Leader?","time":1491890387,"resto":120556928,"id":"U1Z4usmz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120556391,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)01:01:53","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Persian living in Sweden - Ask me anything","com":"Hello \/pol\/!

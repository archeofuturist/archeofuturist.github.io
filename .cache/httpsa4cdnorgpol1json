Pakki, balkans, somalians and arabs have their own parties, becuase they know they won&#039;t get invited, they poison themselves with the drugs that they sell and only the skankiest and most desperate girls show up to their joint.<br><br>Also, viking cultural heritage is sincerely the best heritage. Even better than samurai, I don&#039;t get why weebs want to be samurais, they all get fat from it too. Go to the gym or MMA places and look at the guys who want to be vikings, a bunch of strong manly men who lift and fight better than anyone you&#039;ve ever seen. They&#039;re like lions!

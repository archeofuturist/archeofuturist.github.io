It is known in occult circles as the black sun, the inner trauma that binds us to karmic cycles. The wound in Christ&#039;s side. This is the result of denial of self love, which is projected onto the external world, often resulting from a reaction to being position of subjugation to an oppressor and reflecting the others nature outwards. It might sound like hippy washy bullshit, but love is syntropy and homeostasis, which naturally arises OUT of chaos. You don&#039;t realize this because you are like a fish immersed in water, unconscious of the ocean. You, consciousness, arises out of the same chaotic fluctuations into which cyclically it perishes, however it&#039;s very arising suggests a momentum toward increased complexity as a consequence of increased entropy, an increase in the wavelength of the wave, within the universal system. This appears to happen in a fractal fashion as above so below.<br><br>My understanding is that there is an infinite mathematical set that consists of all self perpetuating patterns which give rise to stable coherent geometries with stable levels of entropy, enough novelty and redundancy to continue generation of a logarithmic growth pattern and also enough entropy to allow for robustness in adapting to fluctuation in the incoming data stream.<br>There is also however, an infinite set of patterns that are inherently self limiting and create vicious cycles of karmic annihilation.

Liberals are very, well, liberal on which scientific evidence is enlightening or racist pertaining to this subject. Part of the reason is Boasian anthropology, a Jewish institution dictated by Franz Boas to make gentiles abandon Darwinism (due to racists like the Nazis using it to fuel their fascist endeavors) and supported by dishonest anti-scientific research in an attempt to show that even savage cultures are &quot;equal&quot; to Europeans&#039;, and there is no such thing as race. This was popularized in the 30s through Jewish media and peer reviewed by Boas&#039;s own students to give the ideas credence, and ever since then it&#039;s become taboo to talk in terms of protecting European culture or preserving the white race.<br><br>Liberals will tell you it sounds stupid, but people of a genetic background that didn&#039;t survive thousands of years of snowy wastes simply don&#039;t think the same way as Europeans. It&#039;s not a bad thing, but it means non-white people in white countries can exploit their democratic institutions to work against white interests (like the Jews have always done) or live off of their empathy and charity (guess).<br><br>The West has tried to fight off multiculturalism for this reason without sounding racist, but it&#039;s an impossible victory to attain.

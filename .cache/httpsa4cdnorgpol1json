It just depends on the individual. If you don&#039;t like teaching, you probably won&#039;t like raising a kid (because it&#039;s all about teaching). If you do like teaching, it is the most wonderful thing in the world. Money and materialism isn&#039;t everything to some people. For some people, they want to raise kids as a way of indirectly fixing the problems they experienced in their own childhoods, thus metaphorically saving themselves. It makes some people happy to give children the things they wish they had as a kid. Others just don&#039;t give a fuck. If you don&#039;t give a fuck, don&#039;t have kids, because being a good parent is 100% selflessness.","time":1493133105,"resto":122730548,"id":"EN+v2btF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122743656,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)11:13:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122732158\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122732158<\/a><br>No. I respect women who sacrifice their bodies for our tribe.

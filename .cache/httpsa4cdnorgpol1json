To symbolise this new autonomy and rebirth, he renamed the country from the French colonial Upper Volta to Burkina Faso His foreign policies were centered on anti-imperialism, with his government eschewing all foreign aid, pushing for odious debt reduction, nationalising all land and mineral wealth, and averting the power and influence of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.

On the localised level, Sankara also called on every village to build a medical dispensary, and had over 350 communities build schools with their own labour.

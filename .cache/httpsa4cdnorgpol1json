AMA","com":"There is serious epidemic here in Somalia, 60% of the youth aged between 18-35 have migrated to Europe taking various routes. The most used route is from Somalia-Ethiopia-Sudan-Libya, then the boat ride to Italy. The crazy thing is these people will start their journey with no or little money and once they make it to Libya they happily surrender themselves to two people smuggling rings know as (Magafe) and (Maqade) who will take them as a hostage and instruct them to phone back their poor family back here in Somalia demanding at least $8,000 USD in order to ensure that their kids will have a safe crossing through the Mediterranean sea. If the family refuse to pay the money or don\u2019t pay within the deadline, they will sell their organ parts.","filename":"Somali_Immigrants","ext":".jpg","w":399,"h":258,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":161,"tim":1491331679036,"time":1491331679,"md5":"rfofp1a77VbOcjetOBRmSQ==","fsize":28745,"resto":0,"id":"w3ftXJYi","country":"SO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-does-people-smuggling-to-europe-happens-ama","country_name":"Somalia","replies":214,"images":30,"omitted_posts":209,"omitted_images":30,"tail_size":50},{"no":119513535,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:42:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119500364\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119500364<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119512652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119512652<\/a><br>Passport with timestamp\/some other validation?","time":1491338541,"resto":119500364,"id":"C2uVES9A","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119513603,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:42:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119505995\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119505995<\/a><br>I know a Gambian nigger who says he might Be a nigger but at least his not Somali.","time":1491338572,"resto":119500364,"id":"iLPqWPVh","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":119513650,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:43:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119513470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119513470<\/a><br>Somalians get deported after a while atleast here dunno about other countries","time":1491338597,"resto":119500364,"id":"7j56nwYp","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119513772,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:44:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119513046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119513046<\/a><br><br>I like this guy","filename":"laughing micks","ext":".png","w":1440,"h":960,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491338663153,"time":1491338663,"md5":"pxzHY4aaJJuWaAJLbyB76g==","fsize":2646787,"resto":119500364,"id":"8Z922wuh","country":"IE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":119513823,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:44:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"whats the name of the french billionaire jew that&#039;s using NGO&#039;s to circumvent EU coast guards and just importing immigrants 24\/7 from N.

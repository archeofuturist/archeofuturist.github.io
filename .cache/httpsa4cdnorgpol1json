Wealth accumulation is multiplied exponentially due to stability. This is a known powerlaw of sociology. <br><br>Classist struggle inherently destabilizes the system, its hard to create chains when your workers are striking right out from under you? Even harder when you cant use the rule of law to clamp down on instability. Plus negative reinforcement on the 1% and positive class mobility assistance moves more lower classes to middle class and attritions the gap between 10 &amp; 1% (1% expatriate country, wealth redistributed etc). So yes its harder for new money to 1% but on the whole better for society as the 1% ability to influence society is limited to a handful of people and if their views run counter to society its more of a stark difference. An example is everyone knowing Randolph Hearst is full of shit because he&#039;s the only one squawking about something than a shadowy cabal of news networks pushing an agenda and consolidating information between hundreds of vested interest groups or figures.","time":1490161372,"resto":117719320,"id":"ryHTO0PY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117726652,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:44:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117719722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117719722<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;<a href=\"#p117719480\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117719480<\/a><\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I don&#039;t have the $2 million in starting capital you need to start a high end shop like this.<\/span><br><br>...This.

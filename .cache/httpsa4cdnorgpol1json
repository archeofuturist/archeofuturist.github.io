The FBI is now graduating to investigating evidence that points to the Trump campaign and Russia colluding for the specific purpose of strategically harming Hillary Clinton in the election. This new revelation from CNN goes so far as to confirm that the Trump campaign was giving the Russian government the \u201cthumbs up\u201d on when to release stolen information.<br><br>This is a crucial shift, because it means that members of the Donald Trump campaign are now being pursued as criminal conspirators. The Russian hacking was a felony; knowingly being involved in a conspiracy to commit a felony means you\u2019re essentially just as guilty of that felony. The CNN report does not identify which Trump advisers were part of the illegal conspiracy. However, it\u2019s long been widely reported that the FBI has been investigating Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn, Carter Page, and Roger Stone for their Russian contacts.<br><br>This new revelation may have been what House Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff was referring to earlier today when he upgraded his own assessment of the evidence. Schiff had stated as recently as two days ago that there was \u201ccircumstantial evidence\u201d of collusion, and \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of deception. But today he held a televised press conference and stated that there is now \u201cmore\u201d than circumstantial evidence of collusion. Schiff is one of two members of the committee who are being actively briefed on the most severely classified evidence in the Trump-Russia investigation.<br><br>Even if the FBI does not have evidence that Donald Trump himself was involved in this criminal conspiracy, it can use the guilt of his advisers to get them to flip on Trump in exchange for leniency.","time":1490334286,"resto":118045364,"id":"0fqeTX4Z","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":118048217,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:44:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118047948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118047948<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Oh that argument will completely destroy me, but, alas!

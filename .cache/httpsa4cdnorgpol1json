I was working on one last-ditch effort at possibly digging myself out of the hole. One day while studying the mistake our country made in WW2 I cried out to God with tears of rage in my eyes and vowed to devote the rest of my life to fighting His enemies if He&#039;d only let me survive through my ordeal. What happened to me next was like the most unbelievable twist in a movie, the kind that makes you want to walk out of the theatre because it&#039;s such bad writing and an insult to your intelligence that you&#039;re expected to believe it could happen in real life. I am incredibly wealthy now, and I know God is real and He wants us to stop the globalists. If we are sincere in giving ourselves to His will, He will keep helping us. He wants us to win. As long as you are sincere in wanting to help, He will continually steer you onto a good future. I hope to see you all on the Le Pen timeline. I know what to do to get myself there and I hope you are all able to do the same. Think of a contribution you could make toward a Le Pen win which frightens you to carry out because it could damage your standing in life if it backfired. If you push through the fear and do it anyway then God will reward you. God communicates directly through emotion and more rarely through visions, learn to listen to both, please at least try. This is reaching wall of text status so I&#039;m going to resist ranting about how this all ties into quantum mechanics, but my basic point would be that even if you&#039;re a fedora-tipper you should still take my advice","time":1490633682,"resto":118503351,"id":"Cv+L3Ij3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118532245,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)12:59:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118531771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118531771<\/a><br>Interesting vision of god...","time":1490633981,"resto":118503351,"id":"QTlb0EVS","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118525925,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)11:55:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Elves = White people<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Orks = N*ggers<\/span><br><br>What else?","filename":"elves","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":700,"tn_w":178,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490630155250,"time":1490630155,"md5":"klwq6VSkliHWYCbSveKuLQ==","fsize":82272,"resto":0,"id":"3bpqI0GS","country":"GR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"elves-white-people","country_name":"Greece","replies":120,"images":29,"omitted_posts":115,"omitted_images":26,"tail_size":50},{"no":118532011,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)12:57:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118525925\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118525925<\/a><br>Elves=Nordics\/ Scandinavian <br>Dwarves=Celts<br>Rohirrim=Early Anglo-Saxons<br>Gondorians=South Europeans\/ Meds<br>Hobbits=19th-20th century rural English<br>Easterlings=Persians\/ Ancient &quot;Arabs&quot;<br>Haradrim=Moors<br><br>Orcs and Uruk-Hai are not meant to represent a specific race or worldly culture (although they supposedly were meant to look Asian).

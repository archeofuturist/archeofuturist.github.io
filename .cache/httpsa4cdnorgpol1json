Several countries started to go on spending sprees, making massive tax breaks coupled with expensive social policies like low retirement ages, ample breaks\/time off work, pensions, public spending, etc. They kept running deficits and procrastinated the bill to a later day. Then in 2008, the credit bubble burst and creditors weren&#039;t willing to keep lending to the PIIGS, and without money to foot the bills, they turned to Germany for cash. Germany started to negotiate austerity measures and countries like Greece protested because they felt like they were being manipulated by them. Germany just saw the Greeks as lazy and who couldn&#039;t keep up their way of life without improving their labour market productivity and cutting out some of these lavish social policies which they can&#039;t sustain economically.<br><br>The story goes a lot longer, but the gist is that Germany has subordinated many of the smaller European countries to their will, given that they have significant influence over their economies. And cleverly, whether it planned this from the beginning or not (I think they did), Germany has used the PIIGS&#039; economic mismanagement as an excuse to pass &quot;fiscal policies&quot; across the entire continent, basically creating a political union. Their reasoning is that they need to enforce a common set of laws on economic spending policies, and constant judicial implementation of those laws, to make sure that countries don&#039;t simply abuse the Euro and spend at a level that the rest of Europe has a say in deciding.<br><br>This &quot;fiscal union&quot; shrinks national political power over important topics. For example, EU countries have no control over intra-EU immigration.","time":1490784285,"resto":118772563,"id":"BzxYK9pO","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118772083,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)06:33:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is there literally ANYWHERE I can go to find out about what&#039;s going on in the world that doesn&#039;t have ANY ulterior motives to influence me and will just present me with objective facts?","filename":"kP4Yax1","ext":".png","w":960,"h":742,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":193,"tim":1490783636235,"time":1490783636,"md5":"kwYP3QU1kIJfktnemcbaSw==","fsize":577577,"resto":0,"id":"TtxlK68c","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-there-literally-anywhere-i-can-go-to-find-out","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":10,"images":3,"omitted_posts":5,"omitted_images":3},{"no":118772559,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)06:41:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118772083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118772083<\/a><br>Wikileaks","time":1490784060,"resto":118772083,"id":"Z0Bocd3l","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":118772677,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)06:42:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118772083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118772083<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BBC<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Guardian<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CNN<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MSNBC<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Washington Post<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;NY Times<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Minimal partisan bias<\/span><br><br>Truth is, OP, everyone is biased.

In particular, \/pol\/, the &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; board, has been a central figure in the outlandish 2016 US election season, as it has often been linked to the alt-right movement and its rhetoric of hate and racism. However, 4chan remains relatively unstudied by the scientific community: little is known about its user base, the content it generates, and how it affects other parts of the Web. In this paper, we start addressing this gap by analyzing \/pol\/ along several axes, using a dataset of over 8M posts we collected over two and a half months. First, we perform a general characterization, showing that \/pol\/ users are well distributed around the world and that 4chan&#039;s unique features encourage fresh discussions. We also analyze content, finding, for instance, that YouTube links and hate speech are predominant on \/pol\/. Overall, our analysis not only provides the first measurement study of \/pol\/, but also insight into online harassment and hate speech trends in social media.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1610.03452<br>https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1610.03452.pd<wbr>f","filename":"11906233_1661938980737600_1330127617_n","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490771465969,"time":1490771465,"md5":"OEuOpn+b3Pn08jwliM9QbQ==","fsize":37964,"resto":0,"id":"udLRojoq","country":"EE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"daily-reminder-that-there-is-a-uni-research-paper","country_name":"Estonia","replies":100,"images":27,"omitted_posts":95,"omitted_images":25,"tail_size":50},{"no":118772391,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)06:38:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"plz include me in psuedo-study mr pseudo-scientist","time":1490783919,"resto":118759493,"id":"rbu7AOw7","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118772501,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)06:40:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118759710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118759710<\/a><br>pennis and also dicke and balls","time":1490784014,"resto":118759493,"id":"7v1GctJj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118772517,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)06:40:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"FAKE SCIENCE!<br><br>SAD!","time":1490784029,"resto":118759493,"id":"rbu7AOw7","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118772648,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)06:42:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118759710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118759710<\/a><br>Gas the kangs, race war now","time":1490784141,"resto":118759493,"id":"ANpCifiF","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":118772789,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)06:44:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118771817\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118771817<\/a><br>I&#039;ve seen the coursebook on memes at UNSW.

Two<br>early Latin verse fragments indeed appear to set this category in the sky, and several later poets follow suit.39 The equation caeruleus =<br>\u2018sky-blue\u2019, however, is not correct.40 Many of these instances use<br>caeruleus explicitly as the property of a sky raining heavily, or<br>heavens about to open. Others are implicit. In the Georgics, for<br>example, Virgil describes as caeruleus color the colour of the sun<br>when it is about to deliver rain (pluuiam denuntiat).41 Several references<br>describe stars that herald rain.42 Caeruleus could denote stormclouds,43<br>and marked out the most watery parts of the rainbow (see<br>below pp. 40\u20131).

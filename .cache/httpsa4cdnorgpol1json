I&#039;m pretty outgoing in real life, but almost never actually post online, especially 4chan. I just lurk and like to look into the mindsets of everyone here. Don&#039;t really game online or anything either. It just doesn&#039;t give the same kind buzz I&#039;d get actually interacting with people face to face. Anybody else in the same boat?","filename":"1453594995595","ext":".png","w":250,"h":250,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493452386601,"time":1493452386,"md5":"GJTbs4oKT1MTwezzppGhVw==","fsize":80713,"resto":123284823,"id":"zlRNHZYU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123311240,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)03:53:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123292624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123292624<\/a><br>Same, supposedly Trump is an ESTP","time":1493452412,"resto":123284823,"id":"nU4CxP3N","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123311380,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)03:55:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123285123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123285123<\/a><br>INTP here and i got this","filename":"mw","ext":".png","w":549,"h":268,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":61,"tim":1493452531790,"time":1493452531,"md5":"2tGeQ4ZVEfEKb\/7qMpWbug==","fsize":27131,"resto":123284823,"id":"x2lZ9GJV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123311620,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)03:59:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123309158\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123309158<\/a><br>I get what you&#039;re trying to say, it just seems you are adding unnecessary qualifiers to whether it&#039;s dogshit or not. Also, are you replying to multiple people? I&#039;m not an INFP. The fact remains that people can get these apparently &quot;dogshit&quot; letter combinations, and then they will share common life experiences, tendencies, behavioural patterns with others, complete strangers, who have that same assortment of letters, and have experience of dynamics between other combinations of letters. This thread will provide plenty of support for that.<br><br>You&#039;re making some kind of unnecessary, out-of-nowhere false-objective requirement of something being &quot;correct or not&quot;. Think about that for a second. In what way are personality types &quot;correct&quot;? You cannot deny that these set of characteristics exist, and that by identifying the specific four letter groupings of them (even if there are only 16), it does indeed provide a reasonable system of classification. Certainly not the only classification ever needed, and it is debable whether or not such classification helps people improve or merely get stuck in self-reinforcing patterns. To certain people like myself, who enjoy systems and interplay of points within the systems, this kind of personality theory is interesting from an analytic standpoint.<br><br>You are most definitely trying to assign, whether you realise it or not, some &quot;higher&quot; requirement to the MBTI framework than needs be. Talking about correctness, or trueness. WHAT is true, or correct about personalities? What truth claim, what correct-ness claim do these tests and theories make, other than that if you can be classified as the thing, then you have the traits of the thing (as i said, its tautology. at worst, its just &quot;obviousness&quot;, but the obviousness still provides a level of summary that some people find interesting)<br><br>You keep repeating this &quot;wrong&quot; thing.

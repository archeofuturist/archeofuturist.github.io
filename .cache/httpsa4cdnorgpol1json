For instance, here are some of my examples. <br><br>1: A voting system. This system is tried and true and it helps filter discussion into the right direction - no more wasting time and energy sageing or replying to obvious shills.<br><br>2: Make it easier to create accounts. This &quot;tripcode&quot; stuff is really confusing and also you can&#039;t get to see any post history, or add friends. This method is easy in building a strong community.<br><br>3: Redesign the first page of the board so instead of showing the recently posted in threads, it shows the highest supported and commented in ones instead.

The Tomahawk launch is a slap on Assad&#039;s wrist that 1) eliminates the &quot;Putin stooge&quot; card from Democrats&#039; repertoire, and 2) makes Trump look noble and strong in the eyes of normies (contrast this to Obama&#039;s wet noodle\/doormat approach). It also motivates the Russians to keep Assad on a tighter leash and sends a message to the Chinese concerning the South China Sea, given the timing. This does nothing to fundamentally change the outcome of the war and relations with Russia are left completely intact.","time":1491540232,"resto":119879167,"id":"oAsPa+Sf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119883341,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)00:44:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119879537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119879537<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;putin has to back down and end up looking like a cuck<\/span><br><br>Putin is \/ourguy\/<br><br>Fuck Trump","time":1491540242,"resto":119879167,"id":"iv8IV9Um","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":119883350,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)00:44:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"the one were we have to spent another 5 trillion dollars on some god forsaken hellhole","time":1491540245,"resto":119879167,"id":"GJ1haHKN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119883362,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)00:44:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119879167\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119879167<\/a><br>Not gonna lie, former Assad supporter here.

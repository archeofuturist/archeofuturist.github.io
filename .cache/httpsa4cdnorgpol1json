Theres no requreiments anymore and to say someone is a fetishist or a fucking degenerate slag is to be ostracized by the entire community. Id say 98% of the people who claim to be transgender arent and are just shallow kids having an identity crisis and latch onto whatever they can to get some sort of validation and attention. They dont present any of the common factors that would indicate they are transgender such as dysphoria and are just making shit up to be a unique fucking snowflake. <br><br>Also a large majority are just crossdressing transvestites sissies in denial.

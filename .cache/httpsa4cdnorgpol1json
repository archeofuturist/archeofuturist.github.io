At what precise moment in history this occurred is not certain but most probably the Sumerian language disappeared from India by 2000 BC. In this latter case there was no question of preserving it for ritual purposes either. This is because the IndoSumerian-Austric language never developed as a fully written language in India to inscribe full texts. In any case, a better Indo-Aryan language with its own full-fledged script soon emerged probably because of Hittite influences in the Indian sub-continent around that time.<\/span><br><br><a href=\"#p120151568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120151568<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;explain this<\/span><br><br>see above.","time":1491669890,"resto":120144979,"id":"H9QpjsPj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120150457,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)12:34:09","name":"ManlySpirit","sub":"Latest Chapter of your favorite Trump Manga","com":"Links to the previous chapters:<br><br>http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/SpTpx<br>http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/LBnXs<br>http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/TniNU<br><br>And link to the current chapter for the impatient ones:<br>http:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/SzqqT<br><br>We&#039;re building a formal site, should be up soon, and we&#039;re working on a publishing deal once we reach chapter 6.<br><br>Chapter 5 should be out next weekend.<br><br>Feel free to ask any questions and whatnot btw.

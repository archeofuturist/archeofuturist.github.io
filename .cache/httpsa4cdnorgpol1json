Chances are that guy has lived a very innocent life, he probably went to church his entire life, enjoyed the simple things. Grew up and spent his youth in a much simpler and more innocent time. Thats probably his best shirt he&#039;s wearing. His wife probably buttoned it up for him, making sure to button up the top button so he doesn&#039;t get too much of a chill. Thats probably why he wore his hat too, and to keep the sun off his face. He&#039;s probably known all around the neighborhood as the sweet old man who greets everyone on his daily walk. Going for a walk for him would have been a much bigger deal then it is for a younger person, much more exciting and enjoyable. His doctor probably recommended to him to go out for some gentle exercise as often as he can, and he&#039;s always made sure to do so. His wife probably wanted him to as well, and he liked to keep her happy. <br><br>He probably was happy that somebody was coming to talk to him, a younger person. Maybe when he brightened up when he saw the guy because it reminded him of himself when he was younger and healthier. He was probably always a little worried about running into some kind of trouble on his walks, but he had gone out for walks so many times without incident it had been pushed to the back of his mind. But his wife probably worried about him every time he went out the door. Imagine what he must have been thinking and feeling when he saw that nice young man draw a gun on him. Was his mind even quick enough to properly process what was going on in the time it took for the trigger to be pulled?

In my experience, this is at least true insofar as they are more tolerable than blacks, spics, and sandniggers. I grew up in a suburb of LA that has the highest demographic of 1st and 2nd generation East Asian americans in the country, went to primary\/secondary school with a ton of Asians, and pursued STEM in college, so I&#039;ve had casual and friendly relationships with asians. I have even dated 2 asian girls and gotten to know their families over the course of the relationships. So my question arises not out of a state of ignorance, but of discomfort with the implications of my own observations. <br><br>Why is it that in my entire life I&#039;ve not met a single Asian who possesses the irreducibly complex inner reality referred to as a human soul? I have not associated with Asians personally since my university days (when I came to this realization) because I can&#039;t find in any of them any of the aspects that I&#039;m looking for in a fruitful adult friendship. Asians don&#039;t seem to cultivate personal identity or knowledge of arts\/philosophy of their own volition, nor do they seem to experience life with the same sense of self-important individualism that embodies the best aspects of western society. I can see that they have somewhat of a drive toward achievment in life, and that they abide by at least some simulacrum of morality, and yet literally NONE of the hundreds of asians that I&#039;ve met in my life have seemed to have that &quot;spark&quot; of personality seems essentially commonplace in white people.<br><br>Why is this so?

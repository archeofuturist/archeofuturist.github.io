Humans are Tribal by nature. Prejudice is ingrained in our genes. Now what we have prejudice towards os guided by whatever in group we apart off. Race, Culture, Religion, class, etc etc. Psychologically it doesn&#039;t matter what we&#039;re prejudiced against only that we are prejudice. This is a evolutionary trait is meant to keep tribes together and potentially dangerous or unknown circumstances. <br>That being said being prejudice and acting prejudice is too different things entirely. As Human beings we have the ability to override our base instincts. Which is good because it allows us to judge individuals based on their own circumstances and merits instead of arbitrary tribes. Which should be the goal as we&#039;ve developed to a point where tribes are much less important than ever before.<br><br>Also Prejudice in and off itself isn&#039;t a bad thing. What quality acting prejudiced against is the deciding factor. Generally (though there are exceptions like with most rules) acting prejudice against inherit traits is something to avoid. However I&#039;d argue that acting prejudice against some people is good. Not hate mind you but recognition of qualities in people that should be distrusted or disliked. <br><br>Basically the question is way to simplistic and leading for a college level course.

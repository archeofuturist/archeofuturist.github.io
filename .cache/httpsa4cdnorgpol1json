During the European Wars of religion a group came in that was educated in the terrible acts of the wars and this propaganda history and decided to focus on promoting tolerance and separating state and church so to ensure the battles end. Some Protestant groups already had this notion of keeping your faith a matter between only you and God so this was a big win for Protestants and effectively ended Christendom. <br><br>During this shift and beforehand during the sectarian wars many thinkers began to separate from the academic teaching of the middle ages (Scholasticism). Partially from issues they had and largely from how those teachings were so closely tied to the Catholic Church structure. This led to a movement away from that that culminated in those old academic studies being shamed (For instance, the term &quot;dunce&quot; comes from insulting the Scholastic genius DUNS Scotus) and the very idea of Natural Theology was rejected by these Enlightenment thinkers. Natural Theology is the study of theology and theism through study of the natural world. <br><br>Due to the anti-Catholic propaganda and the sectarian wars, people shifting away from Christendom thought highly of themselves and their use of reason compared to those old &quot;barbaric&quot; times and so their movement came to be known as The Enlightenment. And while some still tried to use Natural Theology to defend their theism and redefine the soul under their new non-Scholastic worldview, the popular thing was to uphold that it must be defended as a &quot;leap of faith&quot;.<br><br>Eventually the new defenses for theism fell apart and Natural Theology generally fell out of disuse and people promoted tolerance to stop violence.<br><br>So without a reason to care about your denomination (through tolerance), a &quot;bad history&quot;, a diversity of views, and no rational defenses it fell out.","filename":"3826bccecec5789bb2d87415445b6bfe1502a2dca2ba4e30303272e86f65a2d8","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":809,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":79,"tim":1492715602105,"time":1492715602,"md5":"bCUqFgemHxzjvyJ4xMImvg==","fsize":197759,"resto":122025116,"id":"L47W6RkE","country":"US","trip":"!!tuOwy1ct2dy","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122028643,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)15:14:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122026290\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122026290<\/a><br>wow can you not be any more defensive?","time":1492715670,"resto":122025116,"id":"me4hmgmB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122028682,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)15:14:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122027497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122027497<\/a><br>This.

As a Christian minority in the Middle East this hits me where it hurts. <br><br>Bush toppled Saddam and created a power vacuum in Iraq which killed millions, with sectarian violence still raging to this day. Obama comes along and campaigns about how he was against the war in Iraq and toppling governments. However, he does the exact same thing to Libya. A once prosperous nation is literally sent into hell by forcibly removing the dictator. Anyone with a half brain would know this was bound to happen with military action against Gaddafi yet Obama did it anyway even after his &quot;I was against the war in Iraq&quot; campaign slogan. There was definitely malicious intent here. Obama also wanted to attack the Syrian government over the &quot;alleged&quot; chemical attacks but did not have the support of the American people.<br><br>Next comes along Trump. He states continuously that he was against the war in Iraq. He also goes further and states that the US cannot be sure of who they are arming in Syria, and that while Assad is a bad guy, he is necessary for stability in the region. This is music to my ears and all other Christian minorities in the Middle East. This might come as surprise but we LOVED Saddam, we LOVE Assad. There is a time and place and a very specific type of society where democracies work... they absolutely do not work in the Middle East. A heavy hand is needed to keep the peace in the Middle East. <br><br>Now this two faced piece of shit Trump says he has &quot;changed his attitude on Assad.&quot; Is this a fucking joke? He just pulled a bait and switch in front of our fucking eyes! What&#039;s worse is he now has the consent of the public to put American soldiers wherever he desires without the consent of the public for &quot;surprise attack&quot; reasons. This is looking to be the biggest fucking con in human history. <br><br>Does \/pol\/ actually support Trump in this or is all the cheer leading here from the_Donald?","filename":"FullSizeRender (9)","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":976,"tn_w":192,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491456587972,"time":1491456587,"md5":"DM+qN0le2ORHIugJkUWQGQ==","fsize":139051,"resto":0,"id":"TO9cMJKe","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"itt-sincere-discussion-on-trump","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":119709583,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:22:43","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Insider Here.

I&#039;ve been interested in religion for a long time, even as a lifelong atheist. Satanism is a way to be spiritual without being religious, since most satanists are atheist. You can get into rituals and meditation and reach a feeling of enlightenment through your own self, rather than through the belief in a god.<br>2. I would say so. When you gain the ability to manipulate other peoples reality through covert techniques (kinda like day to day propaganda) you&#039;re invoking spirits, and when you gain the ability to raise your will to power and act on it with actual results that wouldn&#039;t have been obtainable without a belief from satanism, you&#039;re invoking a spirit. Also look up egregores\/group think. <br>3. I think that the archetype of Satan is actually the good guy. He is the liberator and the bringer of freedom, enlightenment and self reliance. He is the cosmic rebel and does only what is natural and human to him. <br>4. Honestly quite prevalent. I&#039;m not really sure if they practice an authentic version or if it is just meant for show\/entertainment but I doubt any of them actually meditate or are able to perform metamorphoses, two basic foundations of occultism. They seem like they like to sacrifice animals and people which is honestly more of a Christian practice gone awry. <br>5. Hmm. In the biblical sense he wants you to give in to your innate drives and desires. But again, this is merely metaphorical and is actually a good thing if you don&#039;t let yourself degenerate. It opens up portals to levels of consciousness that you can&#039;t get to with mainstream religions. I believe people like Carl Jung and Nikola Tesla were basically occultists because they dared venture where others hadn&#039;t. This is what Satan desires. <br>6. To free one from the wrath of Christianity or false guilt. <br>7. Ultimate freedom and knowing how to use that freedom to your advantage. It is egotistical but the ego shouldn&#039;t be viewed in a pejorative sense.","time":1491456359,"resto":119698667,"id":"kFwTWOSY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119709987,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:27:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119709109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119709109<\/a><br>I hit rock bottom and was struggling with my love for life and my self hatred. I could not forgive myself for being shit and I had only myself to blame. I had a strange religious experience that made me really start to appreciate creation during that time. It brought me to Paganism since I was still unwilling to let go of my aversion to all things Christian. I was unsatisfied by the fact that it is nothing like the religion of my ancestors and so I would dig through whatever sources I could find on the old ways and kept finding things that seemed to predict Christ.

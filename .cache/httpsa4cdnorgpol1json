In 1852, with the support of Horace Mann, another strong advocate of the Prussian model, Everett made the decision to adopt the Prussian system of education in Massachusetts. Unfortunately for the children and poor Irish Catholics of Massachusetts and elsewhere, the system produced a willing, cheap labor force with minimal reading and numbers skills. The Everetts of the world understood that people who could read and understand are dangerous because they are intellectually equipped to find out things for themselves, thus becoming a threat to already established power elites.&quot;<br><br>https:\/\/<br>hybridrogue1.wordpress.com\/2015\/04\/<wbr>26\/compulsory-schooling-indoctrinat<wbr>ion\/<br><br>Inglis, for whom a lecture in education at Harvard is named, makes it perfectly clear that compulsory schooling on this continent was intended to be just what it had been for Prussia in the 1820s: a fifth column into the burgeoning democratic movement that threatened to give the peasants and the proletarians a voice at the bargaining table. Modern, industrialized, compulsory schooling was to make a sort of surgical incision into the prospective unity of these underclasses. Divide children by subject, by age-grading, by constant rankings on tests, and by many other more subtle means, and it was unlikely that the ignorant mass of mankind, separated in childhood, would ever reintegrate into a dangerous whole.","filename":"AyyLmao6","ext":".jpg","w":1114,"h":620,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1490238856964,"time":1490238856,"md5":"H3uXZWArGPAwWiP9mWIyDw==","fsize":569392,"resto":117865678,"id":"6rY\/PM\/r","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117878559,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)23:14:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117878497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117878497<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eeE<wbr>WPbTad_Q","time":1490238883,"resto":117865678,"id":"6rY\/PM\/r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117880886,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)23:35:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","filename":"WalkingDeadBrazil 4chNoSound","ext":".webm","w":352,"h":640,"tn_w":68,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490240102272,"time":1490240102,"md5":"b8LArfgOXVCnWWeeYrbK+g==","fsize":2358388,"resto":117865678,"id":"6rY\/PM\/r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117882042,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)23:44:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"I was depressed during High School and I was brought to a therapist.<br><br>He said I had no friends and I did not believe him, but years later I realized it was true.

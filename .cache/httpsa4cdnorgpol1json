Neither border nor marine police were given descriptions of Madeleine for many hours, and officers did not make house-to-house searches.[72][73] According to Kate, roadblocks were first put in place at 10 the next morning.[58] Police did not request motorway surveillance pictures of vehicles leaving Praia da Luz that night, or of the road between Lagos and Vila Real de Santo Ant\u00f3nio on the Spanish border. Euroscut, the company that monitors the road, said they were not approached for information.[74] It took Interpol five days to issue a global missing-person alert<\/span><br>Not everyone in the resort at the time was interviewed; holidaymakers later contacted the British police to say no one had spoken to them.[73] The crime scene was not secured. Police took samples from Madeleine&#039;s bedroom, which were sent to three forensic labs in Portugal. It was reported on 1 June 2007 that DNA from one &quot;stranger&quot; had been found. But around 20 people had entered apartment 5A before it was closed off, according to Chief Inspector Oleg\u00e1rio de Sousa of the Pol\u00edcia Judici\u00e1ria.[75][46] According to Madeleine&#039;s mother, an officer placed tape across the doorway of the children&#039;s bedroom, but left at 3 am without securing the apartment.[67] The Pol\u00edcia Judici\u00e1ria case file, released in 2008, showed that 5A lay empty for a month after the disappearance, then was let out to tourists before being sealed off in August 2007 for more forensic tests.<br><br>The police involved in such a butchered investigation should&#039;ve been fired.","time":1493572402,"resto":123470687,"id":"zjG4Tl94","country":"BO","country_name":"Bolivia"},{"no":123499188,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)13:14:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123498693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123498693<\/a><br>There is only two sources for that claim and they&#039;re blogs.

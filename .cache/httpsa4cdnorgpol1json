Both the magnetic compass and weaponized gunpowder are also claimed by the Chinese, invented during the Song Dynasty. The compass, of course, would prove fundamental to the great Chinese voyages of exploration and trade under Admiral Zheng He in the early Ming Dynasty, while gunpowder would prove so formidable that the Song would drag the Mongol conquest of China out until from 1232 to 1276 - a truly stunning amount of time, given that the conquest of Kievan Rus took them 3 years (1237-40), Bulgaria took them a year (41-42), Anatolia in a year (1243), the Abbasid Caliphate another year (1258), and would prove the only nation targeted by Genghis personally that he did not see through to completion or near-completion. Speaking of the Mongols, they do what no one managed to do before of since - politically and economically unite almost the entirity of Asia through force of arms.

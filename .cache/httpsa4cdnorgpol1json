This is another way to make you consciously aware that you are in a dream state.<br><br>These 2 exercises concentrate to overcome the issue that is persistent in everybodys dreams, which is the fact that even in the weirdest dream scenarios, <br>if not lucid, your brain does not implicitly realize that things are bizarre and impossible, but rather take things as they are and assume that everything is normal.<br><br>Another thing is to set an alarm in the morning, e.g 6\/7 o clock before your waking time, so that you wake up and go back to sleep for a couple hours and your chances are increased.<br><br>Another thing is to sleep into the noon or beyond, because this is the time when you are normally awake, and by sleeping during this hour, your brain might think that you should be awake, thus invoking a higher chance for consciousness to active in your dream state.","time":1493219624,"resto":122880882,"id":"uGwi\/LtF","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122893907,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:14:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122889665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122889665<\/a><br>imaginary girlfriend","time":1493219666,"resto":122880882,"id":"vcHodnhK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122893942,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:14:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122893062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122893062<\/a><br>Actually everyone dreams 7 times each night, its just that you forget them.<br><br>Stop doing drugs, get enough sleep, then, whenever you eventually remember a dream, even if its just a snippet, hold onto it like its gold.<br><br>Make sure you rememeber all you can rememebr, then write it down.","time":1493219688,"resto":122880882,"id":"m6TVv72C","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122893088,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:07:08","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Canada\/pol\/","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Government Continues to cuck on border hoppers, Media follows along like lapdogs despite polled majority of Canadians wanting immediate deportations<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.thestar.com\/news\/canada<wbr>\/2017\/04\/26\/could-canadas-border-cr<wbr>ossers-prompt-a-political-shift-on-<wbr>immigration.html<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Justin Trudeau boasts about his dad getting his late brother acquitted of marijuana charges<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.calgaryherald.com\/news\/n<wbr>ational\/trudeau+says+father+used+co<wbr>nnections+brother+michel+cleared\/13<wbr>321874\/story.htmles<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;StatsCan: Total sales from private and public retail outlets down 0.6% in February<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.570news.com\/2017\/04\/26\/s<wbr>tatistics-canada-says-retail-sales-<wbr>slipped-0-6-per-cent-in-february\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BC Provincial Debates Continue: http:\/\/www.theglobeandmail.com\/news<wbr>\/british-columbia\/bc-party-leaders-<wbr>head-into-high-stakes-debate\/articl<wbr>e34815965\/<\/span><br><br>Proposed Cannabis Act: https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/docum<wbr>ents\/3565207-Cannabis-Act.html<br><br><br>Recommended readings:<br>Lament for a Nation by George Grant (Sadly no PDF available)<br>John A.

Our food kinda sucks. A shitload of food is with additives and GMO (though I don&#039;t see anything wrong with the latter). Low sugar? I wouldn&#039;t say so. Just a regular amount of it. Why would we use HFCS? Corn is not our shtick, we use plain old cane sugar. \u0413OCT is something you are obligated to use, the majority of food falls under T\u0423 (technical conditions), it&#039;s pretty much a quality standard set by the manufacturer itself, not the government, which means it is allowed to be shit. <br>The worst things is that after the sanctions a lot of food companies started cutting corners in a big way to stall the soaring prices. That means using palm oil and other inferior resources, smaller packaging, and so on. That was the point when our food truly started to suck badly for the most part.<br>But we indeed don&#039;t have that many fat people.

Bunch of fucking nerds with your dipshit teenage beefs probably started with a resentment of woman who won\u2019t speak to you and now you think you have become POI radicalized.<br>So how did it happen? How did you become a fucking nazi? A bunch of real Nazis whispered poison in your ears while becoming your only community, your only \u201cfriends\u201d. And they used multiple levels to make irony and bigotry and fascism more acceptable by drowning it in \u201coh we\u2019re just joking\u201d So you combine all this with capitalizing on isolated nerd dude resentment and even deeper isolation, BAM nazi.<br>You can talk to any former \u201cchan\u201d boy and they can tell you how it went from \u201cshotty shock humor\u201d to \u201cwhite supremacist recruitment\u201d. The \u201clol only normies care about hurting others attitude\u201d + the general nerd male resentment of these communities. Its prime fertile ground for actual Nazis to grow.

Pol here becomes less of an isolated phenomenon and more of a natural end point for all these circles crashing into one another. And pol, also being its own thing, emans it is rolled back into those communities amplifying your worst aspect then roll it back into pol.<br>So essentially you have an online pressure cooker to turn your typical teenage nerdy bullshit into honest to god fascism. The surrounding of hateful idedas, the detachment from the harm you do?

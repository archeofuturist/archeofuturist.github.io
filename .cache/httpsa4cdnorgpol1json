Since Trump won, white nationalists realized the importance of making strategical alliances, as long as the white nationalist goal is being advanced. <br><br>For example, supporting Malcolm X-tier hoteps is one of the best strategical alliances white nationalist can support, since we share a common enemy (jews and lefties) and most hoteps are dying to go back to africa, but lack the direct incentive to do so. Once a white ethnostate is established, hoteps will become leaders of the &quot;back to africa&quot; movements and will lead the process, which leads them to become heads of entire states and communities of afroamericans in africa.<br><br>Another example is jews who have converted to catholicism, like Brother Nathaniel. Those people are immensely useful as strategic allies. I don&#039;t know a better weapon to launch on kikes than the christian-convert kikes. This would drive a process a mass exodus of kikes, too.<br><br>Yeah, there are some alliances we can forge.

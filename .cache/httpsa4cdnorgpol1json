Otherwise, the dog may have a false pregnancy where she pretends she is pregnant and shows increasingly unstable behavior. This was the first time I learned about the scientific condition in dogs called pseudopregnancy. I was immediately struck by how similar it is to the behavior of adult human women who don\u2019t have babies, especially ones who live in the affluent West. After studying this condition extensively, I speculate that women who don\u2019t fulfill their biological program of having children exhibit the disturbing signs of false pregnancy by becoming insane.<br><br>The symptoms of false pregnancy stem from hormonal changes. The female dog, which I will refer to as the \u201cbitch\u201d from this point on, experiences enlarged mammary glands and may secrete milk. Her abdominum swells, she gains weight, the vagina discharges a fluid, and there may be nausea and vomiting. The bitch may even exhibit cravings for certain foods alongside increased appetite.<br><br>Emotional changes are soon to follow. The bitch shows overt emotional attachment and even defensiveness for abstract objects like toys or clothing. Her nesting instinct causes her to hoard random objects like tennis balls, and she will often appear confused or disoriented. Other symptoms include aggression, depression, restlessness, and anxiety.<br><br>When I read the symptoms of canine false pregnancy, I realized that the majority of childless women over the age of 25 exhibit the exact same symptoms. The most obvious symptom that we can visually observe is weight gain. It is hard, if not impossible, to find a female past her fertile prime that is of normal weight.","filename":"pets3","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":367,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492041067896,"time":1492041067,"md5":"Hm9ZQBLWzKq6UrfKRgT29A==","fsize":49718,"resto":0,"id":"F2J63GRp","country":"FI","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"women-who-dont-have-babies-go-crazy","country_name":"Finland","replies":61,"images":17,"omitted_posts":56,"omitted_images":15},{"no":120843333,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)21:12:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120838255\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120838255<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;owns horses<\/span><br><br>fuck that shit.

It is less than a zero sum game, its the end of civilization. All the \/pol\/acks like to LARP and think somehow they would be spared, but no. In an all out nuclear war you will die, I will die, your parents will die, your friends will die. Basically everyone you know will die. It wont be 1 warhead going off ontop of your city, it will be 7, and they will airburst, wiping out building with 3000 degree 800 mph wind. <br><br>No politician or military tactician thinks a nuclear war will happen. The only scenario which seems to make much sense is if there is a total global economic and agricultural collapse, and billions are starving to death. In that case maybe, just MAYBE, a nation would use nuclear weapons, but it would have to be an existential cause for them to do so. <br><br>Go back to your vodka and state run media roosky.","time":1493557228,"resto":123474199,"id":"CuMD1o+j","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123475443,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)09:04:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123474199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123474199<\/a><br><br>We&#039;re gonna burn together Ivan.","time":1493557442,"resto":123474199,"id":"o+tocVT0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123475812,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)09:08:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123474199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123474199<\/a><br>Only the cities.

The point is not to destabilize it either.<br><br>The point is to allow western companies access to the resources. Warlords are continually paid off in large sums by western countries, for the purpose of allowing the companies to stay, while the people see none of the aid. And the people don&#039;t benefit from the vast resources of their continent [1].<br><br>The last thing we want is some sort of pan-African union, established for the interests of the Africans. That would make what our companies doing a thousand times more difficult - and expensive! Not to mention, probably illegal.<br><br>Whose the most evil man in Africa? Zimbabwe&#039;s Mugabe. Why is he evil? He&#039;s a nationalist. Being a nationalist, the first thing he did was kick all westerners out. Multi-nationals heavily disadvantage the country that lets them in. [2] Africa is rife with such examples. He is mainly blamed for killing whites. If Africans invaded America and stole your resources, you&#039;d want to kill them too, unless you&#039;re a fucking pussy.<br><br>And now, everybody knows &quot;China is doing evil things in Africa&quot;. But the truth is, China has much smaller ownership in mining operations, compared to westerners [3]. The Western media is owned by the same people who own multinationals. They don&#039;t conspire with the multinationals to protect the multi-nationals image. That would imply some measure of equality.

If white men were not allowed to vote, it is unlikely that the United Kingdom would be leaving the European Union, it is unlikely that Donald Trump would now be the President of the United States, and it is unlikely that the Democratic Alliance would now be governing four of South Africa&#039;s biggest cities.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If white men no longer had the vote, the progressive cause would be strengthened. It would not be necessary to deny white men indefinitely \u2013 the denial of the vote to white men for 20 years (just less than a generation) would go some way to seeing a decline in the influence of reactionary and neo-liberal ideology in the world. The influence of reckless white males were one of the primary reasons that led to the Great Recession which began in 2008. This would also strike a blow against toxic white masculinity, one that is long needed.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At the same time, a denial of the franchise to white men, could see a redistribution of global assets to their rightful owners. After all, white men have used the imposition of Western legal systems around the world to reinforce modern capitalism. A period of twenty years without white men in the world&#039;s parliaments and voting booths will allow legislation to be passed which could see the world&#039;s wealth far more equitably shared.

That comes out to exactly 300 Jews every 24 hours (Assuming the gassing and burning of Jews was happening every hour straight for 6 years on an uninterrupted basis) the total # of killed jews would be 657,000 for those 6 years. The official Jewish story is that 4,000,000 Jews were killed at Auschwitz alone.<br><br>How can any Jew, Israeli, or Shill ever even argue this story when just simple math is enough to destroy the whole argument? Can any Jews respond to this?","filename":"1470284701360","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":703,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1492127657453,"time":1492127657,"md5":"szxvQnVoZmlWBcOurGN7Xg==","fsize":246537,"resto":120977594,"id":"Nk0eGQ7G","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120985139,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)19:54:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120985003\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120985003<\/a><br>That&#039;s your kids&#039; future, now you&#039;re gonna have to pay for their shitty schools.","time":1492127659,"resto":120977594,"id":"11IQO1Y2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120985552,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)19:57:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120985133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120985133<\/a><br>Can you do the math and assume that the Nazis shot Jews at the beginning stages of the war?<br>Just curious.","time":1492127853,"resto":120977594,"id":"2ho+7x0d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120985839,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)19:59:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120985552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120985552<\/a><br>I know the einatzgruppen did most of the actual killing (with guns).

This worked, but just barely when the Cuban Missile Crisis occurred.<br><br>All of Kennedy&#039;s advisors were telling him to bomb the missiles and invade the island, despite for the missiles being armed and the fact there were 40k+ Soviet soldiers on the island. Kennedy&#039;s advisors were in effect begging him to start a global nuclear war; he didnt budge and ignored ALL of their advice and worked with Khrushchev through backdoor channels to resolve the crisis before it engulfed the entire world.<br><br>What must be said here is that the Cuban Missile Crisis scared the SHIT out of Kennedy. He was horrified of nuclear war before, but having nearly started a nuclear holocaust he made it his goal to not just avoid nuclear war at all costs but to end the Cold War entirely. <br><br>One of his most important moves towards this was the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963, which he jammed down the throat of the Senate and unleased a massive nationwide campaign to push ratification of one of the first major treaties on nuclear arms. Again, all of his military and CIA advisors opposed this treaty, and were telling him to test more above ground nukes.<br><br>At the same time of talks with Khrushchev on this treaty, Kennedy and Robert Kennedy cracked down on CIA funded and supported Cuban exile groups based out of Miami that were attacking Cuban targets and ships. Kennedy pretty much told the CIA to fuck off by doing this and arrested their Cuban friends. Teamed with his handling of the Cuban Missile Crisis and the firing of Dulles, its not too hard to understand why the CIA fucking despised Kennedy and his policies.<br><br>2\/?","filename":"if we

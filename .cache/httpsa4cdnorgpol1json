More so, an adolescent brain is much more suspectable to addiction than an adult. This has received support from studies where animals have shown that parental exposure to THC can recalibrate the sensitivity of the reward system to other drugs. That same exposure affects interferes with cytoskeletal dynamics which are critical for the establishment of axonal connections between neurons.","filename":"SayNoToWeed","ext":".jpg","w":484,"h":502,"tn_w":241,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493694317866,"time":1493694317,"md5":"AIhG4rnqwAz5w9CRL2puww==","fsize":60291,"resto":0,"id":"ypSMYy9H","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-are-a-degenerate-if-you-smoke-marijuana","country_name":"United States","replies":78,"images":14,"omitted_posts":73,"omitted_images":13},{"no":123723052,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)23:58:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123722624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123722624<\/a><br>I am 25 years old you strawman making fucker, I did not start smoking weed until I was 23 because I knew of the effect it will have on a developing brain.","filename":"V4ZZM","ext":".gif","w":480,"h":270,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493697513436,"time":1493697513,"md5":"1Xc3+VtIOyMMsSw3C6oiiA==","fsize":906394,"resto":123717036,"id":"8\/3MhTJW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123723077,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)23:58:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123722741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123722741<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fuck off.

Some people are sick and others aren&#039;t. But having people pay into the system, even if they&#039;re not sick or vulnerable, lowers the premiums for everyone. So when you eventually get sick - and you will eventually get sick - you end up paying less. But you&#039;re too fucking stupid and selfish to look more than a few days into the future so you don&#039;t understand it. You just think it&#039;s hurr socialism without realizing it&#039;s actually more efficient and saves money in the long run. Even if those fatties don&#039;t have healthcare, they still have to go to the emergency room when their heart finally gives out. What do you think happens then, dummy? The cost they can&#039;t afford gets eaten by the healthcare companies, who raise YOUR rates. There should absolutely be more preventative treatment and people don&#039;t try hard enough, but pretending you can just ignore vulnerable people and they&#039;ll magically go away is totally unrealistic.","time":1493935450,"resto":124102529,"id":"TcRKvKEm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124118424,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)18:07:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124108168\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124108168<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How it would probably play out:...<\/span><br><br>Wow another &quot;prediction&quot; from the retard brigade.

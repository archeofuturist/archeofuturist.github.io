Another senate bill authored by the same pair of ambitious religious freedom fighters would allow people employed in any of Texas&#039;s 65 licensed occupations to refuse service to people if those folks violate their SHRB.<br><br>So, for example, private medical providers wouldn&#039;t really have to help trans patients if they assert that being transgender violates their SHRB; barbers wouldn&#039;t have to cut gay people&#039;s hair if they didn&#039;t feel like it; plumbers could let toilets overflow and electricians could keep people in the dark if they happened to religiously disagree with the customer&#039;s sexual orientation. And the bill would prohibit the state from disciplining them for any of this.<br><br>Other bills allow wedding-industry businesses, such as cake makers and florists, to refuse service to LGBT couples (HB 2876 by Rep. Scott Sanford), allow &quot;conscientious refusal&quot; of healthcare services of any kind based moral beliefs (HB 2878 by Sanford) and allow child welfare service providers to refuse to take in LGBT kids (SB 892\u2014also by Senator Perry).<br><br>None of these bills has made significant headway in the Lege, at least not yet. The so-called bathroom bill, SB 6, has passed in the Senate, but its future is far less certain in the house. A House substitute, HB 2899, is less restrictive than SB 6 and does not include provisions about requiring school districts and cities to enforce bathroom bills based on biological sex, but prohibits jurisdictions from passing trans-inclusive bathroom policies.

This kid is black, comes from a relatively poor family and are are terrible with finances. The kid went into debt buying himself jordans and new T shirts. Before i continue i&#039;m just adding that because SJWs will argue that i&#039;m more privileged then him, i don&#039;t actually care about skin colour. So there&#039;s recent new anti-bullying legislation and my dad used it in a civil law suit against my bully since he beat me up off school property (during lunch hour). Now their family had to move out of the house since they didn&#039;t 24K (what they had to pay) PLUS they barley got money from the mortgage because the extra money they did get they will have to use to pay off their debts. They now are applying for state housing.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 how did u do this bruh<\/span><br>Well assault, harassment, bullying, intimidation, and extortion are all crimes.

And had the job we are now cursed with. He goes up and down lying about us. And Christ intercedes. Not Mary. This female mythos has crept inside absolutely everything because there are two seed lines. That of devil. That of woman. Do women have seeds? No. They did after the cuckening though. Was Adam ever three different kinds of trannies like Plato said and tried to explain heteros and gays but not bisexuals? No. Was lilith real? No. I think. But she wont go after no fags. Why would she. So. It takes over. The animals had pairings. Not all animals reproduce. Some are even exclusively gay. It was good because contrary to popular view. God does NOT have a girlfriend. I explained no genders in Christ. No marriages in Heaven. And that this is all a temporary and earthly fix. Maybe she was made for a help meet. And then a wife. Not the other way around. To have tree of life. Christ. But she failed. We are not to love the things of our hands. Women come from us. They get the remainder of the male&#039;s breath of God of life. No touching involved. Maybe He made the world with His voice. Liars said, His penis. Such blasphemy. And they didn&#039;t stop there. We are not to even love our own lives. They would still be alive. So.

They told us we should get ourselves ready for a big trip.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The 85-year-old slides the sleeve of his shirt up and uncovers his left forearm. The number 182558 is tattooed there in dark-blue ink.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The transport to Auschwitz took two weeks. His sick father died on the journey. Upon arrival, they had to strip and submit to an inspection. Ganon&#039;s mother and five siblings were then sent to the gas chambers.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yitzhak Ganon was taken to the Auschwitz-Birkenau hospital, where Josef Mengele, the so-called &quot;Angel of Death,&quot; conducted grisly experiments on Jewish prisoners.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ganon had to lie down on a table and was tied down. Without any anesthetics, Mengele cut him open and removed his kidney. &quot;I saw the kidney pulsing in his hand and cried like a crazy man,&quot; Ganon says. &quot;I screamed the &#039;Shema Yisrael.&#039; I begged for death, to stop the suffering.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After the &quot;operation,&quot; he had to work in the Auschwitz sewing room without painkillers. Among other things, he had to clean bloody medical instruments. Once, he had to spend the whole night in a bath of ice-cold water because Mengele wanted to &quot;test&quot; his lung function. Altogether, Ganon spent six and a half months in the concentration camp&#039;s hospital.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When they had no more use for him, the Nazis sent him to the gas chamber.

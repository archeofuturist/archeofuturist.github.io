You are just repeating catchphrases. Names in almost every other culture do not work like they do in our current English. Even English names once had more meaning. They are words that describe ones nature as an epitaph of sorts. For example, Sophia comes from the Greek sophos, which is the concept of wisdom, as held by people. Sophia, then, was the personification of Wisdom. The way Sophia was described was not meant in the way you might describe a friend or some real person on the street. Rather, it described the nature and behavior of wisdom, treating that concept as though it had a will and behavior of its own. When the Greeks ranked their gods, it was like a psychological debate arguing which impulse came first in the ordering of the universe, as in, which conceptual structures superseded the which other structures. All ancient religions worked something like this.

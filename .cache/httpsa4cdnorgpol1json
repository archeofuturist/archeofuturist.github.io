He was transported to UMass Memorial Hospital-Leominster, where he was pronounced dead at 4:07 a.m.[10][92][93][11] State Department of Correction spokesman Christopher Fallon first said no suicide note was found in Hernandez&#039;s single-occupant cell, but on April 20, 2017, investigators reported that three handwritten notes were next to a Bible opened to John 3:16 and &quot;John 3:16&quot; was written on his forehead in ink.[94] One note said he was entering the &quot;timeless realm&quot; and would see his family in heaven while another note said he loved his family and told them not to shed a tear; soap was found covering the floor and there were drawings in blood on the walls showing an unfinished pyramid and the all-seeing eye of God with the word &quot;Illuminati&quot; written in capital letters underneath.[95] Prison officials had not observed any signs that Hernandez was at risk for suicide, so he was not put on around-the-clock watch.[96] Upon completion of the autopsy by the medical examiner, the death has been officially ruled a suicide. Hernandez&#039;s brain was released to Boston University to be studied for signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive degenerative disease found in people who have had a severe blow or repeated blows to the head.[97] His lawyer-agent, Jose Baez, disputed any claim of suicide, initiating his own investigation of the death.[98]","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":667,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492996011008,"time":1492996011,"md5":"o7QH+rlsjEf0vDHYY\/vx3A==","fsize":76946,"resto":0,"id":"nIv4nKJw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"illuminati-blood-pyramid","country_name":"United States","replies":56,"images":16,"omitted_posts":51,"omitted_images":14},{"no":122543712,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:42:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"REMINDER<br><br><br>ILLUMINATI HAS ALWAYS BEEN A OBSCURE MEME USED TO:<br><br>DEMONIZE POLITICAL OPPONENTS<br><br>SCARE PLEBS<br><br>PUSH ANTI-NATIONALISM (CATHOLIC SHILLING)<br><br><br>IT&#039;S NOW A VIRAL CAMPAIGN TO COVER FOR THE JEWS<br><br><br>IT&#039;S A COVER FOR THE JEWS<br><br><br>ALEX JONES = CIA (or he would of been dead years ago)","filename":"Alex Jones64","ext":".jpg","w":678,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1493008933377,"time":1493008933,"md5":"aayJb3jXHRz4pjj3HUNRsg==","fsize":114255,"resto":122519612,"id":"vuMjLU4G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122544760,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:52:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=856<wbr>sLAgkZvk","filename":"TI1Eoe","ext":".png","w":1076,"h":649,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1493009539058,"time":1493009539,"md5":"swXK9Tiv\/OC0vZVR8JesEA==","fsize":107829,"resto":122519612,"id":"VgdUF4Yt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122545083,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:55:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122543712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122543712<\/a><br>shilling hard","filename":"i cant believe it&#039;s another shareblue character assassination","ext":".jpg","w":1120,"h":1120,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493009734440,"time":1493009734,"md5":"mi5qviGjx0wpzM0KBN0alQ==","fsize":180994,"resto":122519612,"id":"duYaOAYB","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122545089,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:55:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122543320\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122543320<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;STOB RUINING MY LARP<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;IF I REALLY THOUGHT THERE WAS CHILD SACRIFICE I WOULDN&#039;T BE SHITPOSTING ON AN ANIME IMAGEBOARD <\/span><br>Success!","time":1493009738,"resto":122519612,"id":"70pUGwN1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122545504,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:59:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122529609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122529609<\/a><br>You&#039;re drawing on some fairly abstract ideas here, and not factoring in, at any stage, the arousing and exciting concept of committing acts which are not equalled in depravity by society.<br><br>I would liken it more to the rush of power, immunity,and a god like elevation of ones own ego from amongst the teeming mass of sheep","time":1493009990,"resto":122519612,"id":"I8wluRro","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122537451,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)23:41:57","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Muh IQ is genetic","com":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Eyfer<wbr>th_study<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Eyferth study is the name often given to a study conducted by psychologist Klaus Eyferth concerning the IQs of white and racially mixed children in post-Second World War West Germany.

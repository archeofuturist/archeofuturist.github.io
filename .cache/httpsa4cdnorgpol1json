We don&#039;t produce less, it&#039;s just that the emerging superpowers kind of screw us up we need to react against that FAST. Obviously, a small country of 65M people will get crushed in the mix, but if Europe was a federal country, we would be the first world economy right now. Right now the best move to make in my opinion is to work toward a federal Europe, with common fiscal laws so we don&#039;t get screw over by our fellow European less developed countries. Needless to say, Eu cash mostly comes from Germany and France right now. So who do you think will lead, at least at first? That would also be very beneficial for France and for our industries. We are currently the first energy producer in Europe, the first Nuclear nation, the only one capable of providing equipment for a European army, and we&#039;re not doing to bad in manufacturing.<br>Who do you think will benefit from the massive outcome that generates? Well France obviously.<br> Macron in his program already included working toward unified fiscal laws for Europe, and Merkel is also up for it. <br>Marine on the other end wants to go back to Franc, continued","time":1493035869,"resto":122564956,"id":"g6kusZ8K","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122579264,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)08:14:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122579009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122579009<\/a><br>Which we would have to index on Euro, if we want to survive, making US basically our neighbor&#039;s bitches without any mean of leverage.<br>Right now, we have a fucking HUGE leverage.

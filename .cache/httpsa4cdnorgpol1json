First: It is now federal law that you must have health insurance under threat of tax penalty and potentially jail time. Second: All plans offered by all insurers must cover at a minimum these newly defined &quot;Essential Health Benefits&quot; which include things like birth-control (and yes, abortions) and the plans must cover these &quot;essential benefits&quot; regardless of the sex of the purchaser. Meaning that a 25 year old man must legally buy coverage, and that coverage must include cervical cancer screenings and pregnancy tests.Part 3: of the ACA is about creating &quot;Risk sharing pools&quot; which is basically just paper pushing on the part of the insurance companies. &quot;The obamacare exchanges&quot; so everyone who buys a plan from within the exchange, all the funds from those premiums and deductibles go into one collective bucket to pay for the insurance\/health needs of the people paying into those plans. The problem is - Young people who don&#039;t want\/need insurance aren&#039;t paying for it, so the old\/sick people who do buy these plans get stuck with huge price tags.","time":1493925900,"resto":124093573,"id":"vu6G8RNI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124097591,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)15:25:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124097237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124097237<\/a>...ok..so I take it you burn all of your own trash, build and maintain your own road outside your home then?","time":1493925927,"resto":124093573,"id":"id1+CaKJ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124097808,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)15:26:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124095745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124095745<\/a><br>Well you&#039;re wrong.","time":1493926017,"resto":124093573,"id":"vu6G8RNI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124098080,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)15:28:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124097031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124097031<\/a><br>Think of it this way - option 1: The amount you pay for health insurance is based on how much you need it<br>Option 2: the amount everyone pays is equal and based on the cost of the most expensive person who buys it<br><br>If you&#039;re a leftfag option 2 sounds more fair to you<br>If your a rightfag option 1 sounds more fair.

Otherwise the only people with reason to complain are insurance companies because it changes their market completely, and the few powerful insurers don&#039;t like that. Obamacare encourages a level of competition and boost of the insurer market in a way where the old style of working the market doesn&#039;t work anymore.

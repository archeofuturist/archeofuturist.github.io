A white girl though with a nonwhite baby inside her, that&#039;s just a wasted womb that could be growing a white baby. She got blacked, because her body basically got hijacked and taken over by black seed. Black guy nutted in her, now her whole body changes to accomodate, grow, and nurture a black baby. He basically conquered her, because that&#039;s what a man does to a woman, his seed forces her whole body and even her mind to change to suit it, and changes her life too. It&#039;s pretty powerful when you think about it, he sticks his dick in for a few minutes and lets out his liquid love. He&#039;s still the same guy, but she&#039;s not the same person.<br><br>Also a different implication as well is that women tend to stay with their babies. A guy can pump and dump a girl and not suffer any results. If a white girl gets blacked, it&#039;s not just the act itself, but chances are forever after she&#039;ll have a black kid clinging to her as a forever reminder and real presence. I suppose in theory a white girl could get blacked, and then get rid of the baby after, and negate being blacked. Like a white guy sleeps around and knocks up several black girls but doesn&#039;t stick around, and a white girl sleeps around and has several black babies but gets rid of them all. It&#039;s still gross though.","time":1491910166,"resto":120580881,"id":"1P2URxQ+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120586620,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)07:29:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120583761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120583761<\/a><br>What&#039;s Jada Fire doing now?","time":1491910168,"resto":120580881,"id":"VAp2vzg9","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120586628,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)07:29:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"2017 is the year of the oil driller:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Where Hands Touch: The story of an SS officer falling in love with a black Rhineland bastard during the height of WWII.<\/span>","filename":"1486623424001","ext":".jpg","w":589,"h":549,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":116,"tim":1491910175465,"time":1491910175,"md5":"uTY2Rs4eh6POvXqxi1OaMw==","fsize":49598,"resto":120580881,"id":"fwLoUZ79","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120586655,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)07:29:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120586419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120586419<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Who wakes up and thinks &quot;I&#039;m going to go on \/pol\/ and try to encourage race mixing&quot;?<\/span><br><br>It&#039;s a psy op by niggers and some reddit jew shill group.They are trying to push sheboon to desperate beta virgins in order to fight &quot;racism&quot;","filename":"racemixing 3","ext":".jpg","w":544,"h":767,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491910196731,"time":1491910196,"md5":"2TT9HZvMB6dron2uah5uSQ==","fsize":115171,"resto":120580881,"id":"XC1Q6TPF","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120577893,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)05:26:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Can we have a Liberal Tears Cringe Thread?<br><br>You know, just to remember the good old days of the election (and afterwards too)","filename":"1478709473580","ext":".png","w":305,"h":619,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491902773267,"time":1491902773,"md5":"\/hkqS+hHak+FY4TuUwRyHg==","fsize":29847,"resto":0,"id":"Bbx7V6Bx","country":"PT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-we-have-a-liberal-tears-cringe-thread","country_name":"Portugal","replies":154,"images":74,"omitted_posts":149,"omitted_images":73,"tail_size":50},{"no":120585555,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)07:15:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120578120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120578120<\/a><br>In all honesty","time":1491909356,"resto":120577893,"id":"NL560UF0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120585792,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)07:19:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120578120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120578120<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ywn be back in the primaries, watching Trump humiliate Jeb! while everybody laughs at the amusing sideshow and wonders if it&#039;ll be Cruz or Rubio<\/span>","filename":"cJqrffX","ext":".jpg","w":850,"h":858,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491909540656,"time":1491909540,"md5":"AWYKqikmGRCvVCdDOmnUYQ==","fsize":205706,"resto":120577893,"id":"JU\/lmP6e","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120586007,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)07:21:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120579790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120579790<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw none of this happened.<\/span>","filename":"1491533641808","ext":".png","w":403,"h":403,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491909691220,"time":1491909691,"md5":"A5Rixdsaoc\/+JMtLFuc21w==","fsize":114605,"resto":120577893,"id":"60OU\/tLR","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120586389,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)07:26:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120582759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120582759<\/a><br>This, kek.","time":1491909991,"resto":120577893,"id":"T\/E2uH9q","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120586627,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)07:29:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120581918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120581918<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Muda<\/span><br>Based frog","time":1491910175,"resto":120577893,"id":"NL560UF0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120580882,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)06:11:43","name":"Anonymous","sub":"WHAT THE FUCK BONGS?!

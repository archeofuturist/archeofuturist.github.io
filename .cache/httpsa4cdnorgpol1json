But the bigger problem is... <br><br>2) They are criminally complicit. The unmasked names and transcripts were leaked to the NYT and CNN and others. These &quot;news&quot; outlets absolutely know who is behind all this stuff, because they&#039;ve been getting the material directly from them. And because they have been talking to them and seeing these classified materials, they know this is not merely intel related, but is in fact Obama&#039;s admin using the IC to spy on the Trump team. They knew it, and yet they did their bidding and ran with those Russia stories instead of exposing the biggest corruption scandal since Watergate. The mainstream media has to be shitting their pants, because they are actually a direct part of the corruption in this case. CNN and the NYT are essentially part of the Watergate burglar team. <br><br>Now if these investigations lead anywhere, it goes far deeper than merely asking them &quot;who were your sources&quot; for leaks, because NYT and CNN certainly had a clear enough picture to know that this surveillance was extremely improper. Yet they ignored that fact in order to run the stories their &quot;sources&quot; wanted them to run. <br><br>We are in the infant stages of this scandal. But it threatens to not only bring down major players in the former administration, former IC staff, but it threatens to bring down some major media entities and perhaps even change how 1st amendment protections of the press are viewed. <br><br>This is not a small scandal, this is potentially the biggest scandal of our lifetimes.","filename":"tnWt0iz","ext":".jpg","w":533,"h":461,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1491324292264,"time":1491324292,"md5":"xhj0LqsS35p3rbYq5C0E8Q==","fsize":68108,"resto":119472131,"id":"l9Gm6py0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119476718,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)10:55:14","name":"Anonymous","sub":"So He Wins The War And Accomplishes His Final Solution","com":"What does 2017 look like?","filename":"Hitler","ext":".jpg","w":746,"h":953,"tn_w":195,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491317714750,"time":1491317714,"md5":"tok5srVaJCX9zC9neDg\/vQ==","fsize":68655,"resto":0,"id":"Lt3c8Y68","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-he-wins-the-war-and-accomplishes-his-final","country_name":"United States","replies":43,"images":17,"omitted_posts":38,"omitted_images":15},{"no":119487267,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)12:43:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119487161\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119487161<\/a><br><br>The best government buildings.","filename":"1484329706309","ext":".jpg","w":1638,"h":924,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491324185983,"time":1491324185,"md5":"rj51E8mHDGqi\/ZPBsQOhBA==","fsize":299400,"resto":119476718,"id":"XI7nv5F7","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119487281,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)12:43:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Spoiler alert: exact same german imperialism failing hard","time":1491324194,"resto":119476718,"id":"drfH6Kwx","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":119487284,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)12:43:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119482116\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119482116<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MUH DICK<\/span>","time":1491324197,"resto":119476718,"id":"7lniv8E8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119487440,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)12:44:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119487267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119487267<\/a><br><br>With the most aesthetic uniforms.","filename":"1459124471367","ext":".jpg","w":182,"h":400,"tn_w":56,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491324280108,"time":1491324280,"md5":"I0q5MJFCrfhw3wbdZP\/Chg==","fsize":9630,"resto":119476718,"id":"XI7nv5F7","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119487465,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)12:44:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119477299\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119477299<\/a><br>I would trade this on repeat for the rest of my life in exchange for the death of all Jews.","time":1491324291,"resto":119476718,"id":"Ue7sqw1G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119485690,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)12:27:16","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Ventura The Hero, Kyle The Cuck","com":"So why did this Cuck lie about the bar fight?

I know you keep going back to this point but it&#039;s just not a probable point. In America me and my Israeli roomates often sided with Christian conservatives over Jews.<\/span><br>Ok. Not every time, but it&#039;s still a general trend among Jews, even if not all adhere to it.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Again yes many Jews were behind them but the majority of them still weren&#039;t Jews and the majority of Jews also didn&#039;t have anything to do with it (which you agreed with me). This is my only argument for this issue, calling it &quot;the Jews&quot; distract from the many in Jews involved and targets the majority of Jews not involved. So wouldn&#039;t you say this is a negative thing?<\/span><br>This is the same argument as &quot;but not all Muslims are terrorists!&quot; There&#039;s still noticeable trends. I&#039;m sorry for the Jews that literally have no intention of doing so, but they still are not acceptable in my opinion of an ideal country.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The religious argument is fair in many ways but I can tell you honestly that the only people who believe that shit are the anti Zionist ultra Orthodox Jews and a tiny minority of religious Israelis. The powerful Jews don&#039;t even know of these verses most likely. As for me personally I&#039;m secular, like a majority of Jews in the world. As for how to treat them I&#039;ll repeat it again, if a Jew harms the country with extremist views just deport him but to target all Jews is just counter productive in My opinion. Can we just agree there&#039;s probably a better way to strive for nationalism than 4chans kike posting?<\/span><br>This is the median I&#039;ll come to you on this issue:<br>Jews who practice Judaism and those raised in a household that practiced Judaism, should not be allowed in the country. Same with Muslims. This is simply because of the religion itself - there really isn&#039;t any way of telling which of those who practice the religion adhere to all tenants and which don&#039;t. <br>Ethnic Jews, and those raised in Jewish households, should not be allowed, either.

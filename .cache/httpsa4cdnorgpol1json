I want to be more forward with her, put my arm around her or something, but I&#039;m worried she&#039;ll pull away again. <br><br>Thanks for the advice lads. To clarify, I&#039;m not an outward atheist, and I do have a great respect for the religion. I&#039;m not even sure she realizes I&#039;m an atheist, but she knows I don&#039;t really go to church. I&#039;m working on getting in shape\/NoFap, it&#039;s just a struggle. I didn&#039;t fap yesterday and have no plans to do it tonight, so its a start. <br><br>I think tomorrow night, I&#039;ll show her my vinyl record collection, maybe play some La Vie en Rose, and ask her to dance. Something wholesome but clearly romantic like that.

Weeb&#039;s like to tell themselves that they&#039;re not but they are. They have a very distinct style and can be far more mature than western cartoons.

We do all kinds of fun stuff together. But are we going to start fucking each other? No, because that would be gay. And if one of us were gay, we&#039;d lose respect for each other. <br><br>If we ever did hookup it would be while we&#039;re both wasted, and we&#039;d never talk about it. We are both straight, have girlfriends, etc. That&#039;s how we want to live our lives. Neither of us wants to be a faggot, and I can tell you don&#039;t either.

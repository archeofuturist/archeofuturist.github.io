This server has been mentioned in connection to investigations.<br><br>* Nobody knew who TeaLeaves was. Some speculated it was L Jean Camp herself which is the closest guess. It turned out to be a colleague of hers. See the info above for the damning proof. <br><br>* Tealeaves has a years-old wordpress account coincidentally named in leetspeak teakettle (t34k3ttl3). That&#039;s him. BTW I don&#039;t believe that FeelTheEmailMistake guy found it the way he says. I think he had to present it in a more eh &quot;public safe&quot; manner if you get my drift. Based on some other posts of his i think this guy is into some seriously heavy shit...and think about the timing of all this.<br><br>* The DNS logs contain + signs -- meaning recursive nameserver-nameserver queries which just doesnt happen. Even if we say the Russian nameservers have some weird setup -- well, the American medical nameservers have the same weird setup. Every damn nameserver has the same weird setup. Terribly unlikely...<br><br>* The guy mentions 6 indicators of forgery... says hes only &#039;reasonably confident&#039; based on the indicator above... but it&#039;s pretty fucking damning all by itself.

terrorists<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/sana.sy\/en\/?p=102887<br><br><br>Damascus, SANA \u2013 The General Command of the Army and Armed Forces announced on Friday that army units reclaimed all the points and blocks of buildings which were infiltrated by terrorists north of Jobar.<br><br>In a statement, the General command said that army units, in cooperation with the supporting forces, reclaimed all points and the blocks of buildings that had been infiltrated by terrorists from Jabhat al-Nusra and groups affiliated to it in the factories area in the northern part of Jobar neighborhood at the eastern outskirts of Damascus.<br><br>The statement said that army units are still pursuing the remnants of the fleeing terrorists in the depths of Jobar, while engineering units are dismantling and removing explosive devices and bombs planted by terrorists in the area.<br><br>The General Command pointed out that during the past 48 hours, the factories area north of Jobar has become a graveyard for successive waves of terrorists in which hundreds of them were killed, adding that the success of the Syrian Armed Forces in crushing the successive waves of terrorists in the factories area confirms the terrorists\u2019 foolishness on one hand, and the insistence of their operators and sponsors to use them as fuel and push them to suicide to serve their agendas and goals on the other hand.<br><br>The General Command concluded its statement by renewing its pledge to the Syrian people to remain the bastion that protects Syria, reaffirming its determination to continue the war on terrorism until it is eliminated and until security and stability are restored to the entirety of the Syrian Arab Republic.","time":1490470049,"resto":118239853,"id":"7IntsNAx","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":118260952,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:28:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Also I think im

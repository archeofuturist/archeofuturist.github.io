The American lawsuits, and the concomitant political campaign by American Jewish leaders and American government officials, also unearthed valuable historical data about the financial crimes of the Nazis and their cohorts during WW II. This post-Holocaust restitution movement, while viewed as a success, nevertheless created troubling moral issues, and this article focuses on five of them. First, does the demand for financial restitution demean the memory of the Holocaust? Second, once the funds are collected, how are they to be fairly distributed? This raises the provocative issue of who should be deemed a &quot;Holocaust survivor.&quot; Third, should some of these restitution funds be allocated for Holocaust education and remembrance, or do they belong solely to survivors? Fourth, while payments to individual survivors from these settlements were in the thousands of dollars, the class-action attorneys earned fees in the millions. Are these attorneys entitled to such fees, even though the fees represent less than 2 percent of the total amounts collected through the litigation? Fifth, many of the lawsuits were defended by Jewish lawyers. Although European corporations accused of wrongful conduct both during and after WW II are free to hire Jewish lawyers to defend their interests, should lawyers who are Jewish have taken on the defense of such suits?<br><br> By confronting these gray zones of post-Holocaust restitution, this article aims to shed light on this latest and wholly unexpected legacy of the Holocaust.","time":1493700299,"resto":123714435,"id":"6pyuzlSt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123726543,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)00:31:12","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/ptg\/ PRESIDENT TRUMP GENERAL - DO YOU LIKE MY CAR EDITION","com":"PRESIDENT DONALD J TRUMP<br>https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov<br>https:\/\/www.donaldjtrump.com\/<br>DAILY SCHEDULE (WH Press Corps)<br>https:\/\/publicpool.kinja.com\/<br>Trump Playlist<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/X9qQJVKJ<br> <br>APPEARANCES<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump on Face The Nation 4\/30\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/t55wTLHwGZE<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump - First 100 Days<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/hBw_RhnCDZ8<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump Weekly Address #14 4\/28\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/u7oOmkXYznU<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump Rally @ Harrisburg, PA 4\/29\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/y9viYq9Z3U4<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;VP Pence @ USS Indiana Christening 4\/29\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/-jtmzlLz_2M<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump signs EO establishing Office of Trade and Mfg 4\/29\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/28Blqw7_-lQ<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump interview w\/Martha Maccallum 4\/28\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/8NqMJq6nR_8<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;FLotUS Melania visits sick kids @ Bunny Melon Healen Garden 4\/28\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/s6mOS3mZK9E<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump @ NRA 4\/28\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/0jD-3jp-HUQ<br>PREV APPEARANCES<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/ynXV6CHT<br>NEWTRUMP NIGHTLY NEWS<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/yArfUKdC<br>WH PRESS BRIEFINGS<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/QidpHWKJ<br> <br>FUN STUFF<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;March in the Trumpenreich<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/gwmp3E9VIX0<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TrumpWave S P A C E<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/s1qhafzPkAM<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;God Emperor Trump Was Born To Rule<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/pf4RSgb_Pqg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Donald Trump Emperor of America<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/xQCaWLF2gfs<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TrumpBot vs Mexico<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/Q__bSi5rBlw<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shadilay<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZNriNoWOtXA<br> <br>INSPIRATION<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/Nyuv_bPSHBA<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hold Back The Night<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/ldnH5ms50Jc<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Inauguration of Fire<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/XKf8jSiaghU<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;#TrumpTheEstablishement<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/kIsctZlgMqg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;American Hero<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/d-X3BVxySLo<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TRUMP - MAGA<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/PagVeZgHbhk<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump Triumphant<\/span><br>www.dailymotion.com\/video\/x4ulway<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We Are The Silent Majority<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/3lrrPG5iPAk<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;American Comeback Story<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/pm8n9qVIK_8<br> <br>OP pastebin: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/nygxu29R<br>prev <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123722072#p123722072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123722072<\/a>","filename":"1487546352086","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":467,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493699472208,"time":1493699472,"md5":"fUKEIxKPO\/hL6cHpf4q0Tw==","fsize":31901,"resto":0,"id":"+FbjMrvy","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ptg-president-trump-general-do-you-like-my-car","country_name":"United States","replies":92,"images":49,"omitted_posts":87,"omitted_images":44},{"no":123727996,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)00:44:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123727804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123727804<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123727653\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123727653<\/a><br>damn, this is boring; puts me right to sleep<br><br>Don&#039;t you feel the same way?

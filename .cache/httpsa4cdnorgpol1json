I don&#039;t want a slut. I don&#039;t want someone who lets me make out with them after talking with them in a club for 20 minutes. The thing is, all of them but the ugly ones seem te be like that. Even if I meet a girl at university and she seems genuinely cute and not degenerate, the moment she goes out she just becomes this total slut, so I don&#039;t want her anymore.<br><br>I feel like once I get 30 and have money+a good job, 30yo women will prob like that but then I know they&#039;ve been degenerates for the last 10 years and I don&#039;t even want them.<br><br>Why are women so fucking stupid? Is there a place where they aren&#039;t?","filename":"passed-out-slut","ext":".jpg","w":338,"h":400,"tn_w":211,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491555625160,"time":1491555625,"md5":"9wQDSD7xPVUJVLABgtzG7w==","fsize":24751,"resto":0,"id":"LJjTYFz5","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-are-they-so-ridiculously-degenerate-as-a","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":74,"images":17,"omitted_posts":69,"omitted_images":16},{"no":119927139,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)06:37:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"you are such a faggot, you never fucked a bitch, you stick a dildo up your ass and fuck a doll with shit on its face","time":1491561465,"resto":119917275,"id":"m4TR5Ohq","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119927369,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)06:39:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119921327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119921327<\/a><br>virgin was codeword for child.

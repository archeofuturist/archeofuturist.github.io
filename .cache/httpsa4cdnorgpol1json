I went to college for roughly two years, learned a trade, and you would think with my education on top of my experience working in the field I would get better offers, but almost all of them so far have been low ball minimum wage offers with little to no growing room in the company, basically dead end jobs. <br> <br>This one job offer however was my final straw and I don&#039;t know whether to keep looking or what. I go to school with this guy who is in my shop math class, and he works at this machine shop, he also immigrated from Iran maybe less than a year. I would say it&#039;s a pretty big company that he works for, and he offered me a position in it, told me to send him my resume and then he forwarded it to HR. So I get a call from their HR, who btw was speaking in broken English and I could barely understand her, she sets up an interview the next day (which was yesterday) <br> <br>I go there and ask for Maria, she gives me a tour around the place, a lot of people there looked like your average new comer to USA, didn&#039;t know English too well,, at this point I already know my decision, 9 times out of 10&#039;s if you see new comers from another country, it&#039;s time to go. She then tells me that they would start me out at minimum wage like they do everyone, I frankly right then and there told her I will think about it and left, I&#039;m not even going to call her back. <br> <br>The rumors are fucking true, and this was at a machine shop, if they are hiring cheap labor to run their machines and check out parts, then we&#039;re fucked, these parts have tenths of cleanings and they are paying them minimum wage to work there, unbelievable. Why the fuck am I going to work for minimum wage when I can deliver pizzas all day and make virtually the same, because it gives me the opportunity to work in machining with a &quot;chance&quot; one day to move up, when your own current workers aren&#039;t?

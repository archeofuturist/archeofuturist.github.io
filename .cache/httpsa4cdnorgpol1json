The Trump banner was answered by the unit three floors below, which hung Black Lives Matter and rainbow LGBT pride flags from its balcony. An apartment one floor above the Trump-friendly apartment hung a flag proclaiming \u201cResist.\u201d The newest addition, which went up shortly before the start of baseball season, positions the word \u201cNope\u201d accompanied by an upward arrow directly beneath the Trump sign. And now, what was once a gallery of local sports fandom is just another political shouting match.<br><br>Officially, Lambert\u2019s email is a reminder of many balcony activities prohibited by the building\u2019s rental agreements. His note also warns tenants against installing grills or household furniture, leaving unattended pets, and smoking on balconies.

There will be a day when we will look back at the americans just like we look back at nazis now. Unironically killing millions of iraqi children for no reason whatsoever. All the evil shit that you did is well documented, it is easy to overlook it now because you are in power but once this changes public perception will align itself to actual reality. You will be seen as the monsters that you are.<br><br>2. Everytime you name the american, it will wail and scream &quot;it&#039;s not me, it&#039;s the government!&quot;. You have named him and he reveals his true nature. No responsibility, no honor, no truth, no self reflection capability. Just like the snake that he is, he will evade all points made and scream madly pointing at some irrelevant different thing. Example: &quot;Americans have caused the refugee crisis and killed and displaced millions of middle easterners for absolutely nothing.&quot; Their response: &quot;so fucking what, you jealous or somethin&#039; ??&quot;<br><br>3. The average american is stupid. Now, you all know this trope, but what you dont understand is that it&#039;s actually true. If you are from Europe you might believe that your fellow citizens are stupid but nothing rivals the arrogant, self righteousness of an american. It&#039;s the kind of stupidity that makes a person drive a car into a wall while loudly proclaiming that there shouldnt be a wall there. Americans have perfected the art of saying something without any truth to it whatsoever and loudly proclaim it to be fact. When put one on the spot, the american will simply start acting offended and indignant, loudly proclaiming &quot;so what, fuck you, dont you prosecute you, who the hell are you, i dont give a shit anyway&quot;.<br><br>4.

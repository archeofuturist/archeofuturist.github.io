For starters, it is the least well known and least spoken about of all places - and my colleagues know relatively little about it. <br><br>We do know that it was divided among several countries in a sort of secretive agreement. There are 70 research stations in Antarctica, 40 of which operate year round and 30 which are summer-only, with 1000 permanent research personnel present on the continent at all times and 4000 during the summer. <br><br>The reasoning for all of the travel and exploration restrictions is environmental protection. Yes, they cite environmental reasons for why people are not allowed to explore the continent, as if the few adventurous individuals that decide to traverse the coldest, windiest and driest continent on Earth are going to somehow threaten the &#039;environment&#039; of an ice sheet bigger than the entire continental US. That&#039;s bullshit reasoning if I&#039;ve ever heard it. <br><br>Possible reasons for the secrecy of Antarctica:<br><br>- Lost ancient, non-human civilization. If you&#039;ve ever read The Shadow Out Of Time by H.P. Lovecraft, you will understand what I mean. There could be an entire lost city buried under that ice which would have only survived due to Antarctica&#039;s dry and frigid climate. This one could be likely since multi-cellular life has existed since the Pre-Cambrian, ~700 million years ago, so it is not entirely preposterous to think that an advances civilization evolved before us and wiped themselves out through nuclear war or something similar. We have only existed as a civilization for 12,000 years, so if we wiped ourselves out through nuclear war or virus in the next month, our entire existence on Earth would be a tiny blip on the radar. <br><br>- Secret bio-weapon development or something similar.

Must have came about a quart of sperm. They wanted more, cockslapped them unconcious, I had to hit the gym. Frontflipped from my 14th floor loft into my valet parked 2012 Ferrari (I got connexions) and gave the valet 3000$ in loose change. Pushed my shit to about 4 hundo (mph, mind you) and I was at the gym in no time. When I entered, the room scent suddently changed from sweat to wet pussy. That&#039;s just the effect I have on hoes. Did my usual relax routine, 6000 push-ups, 8500 crunches, bench bressed 30 plates, etc. etc. you know the drill. After doing my shit in 16 minutes, my super strong senses got in action, I was smelling pussy. I looked up, and sure enough this fly honey was coming towards me. When i say fly, I mean that bitch was fine as a fucking umbrella. 18 years old, 44DD titties on a tight fucking frame. I mean a real skinny bitch, the type you losers jack off to, she didn&#039;t weigh more than 5 pounds. Took out my trouser monster and she started to squirt hard, she was convulsing and having 6 orgasms at the same time. Then I gave it to her while all the guys were giving me high fives and all the hoes were on the floor squirting like motherfucking fountains. Made the cunt beg for my cum, but I didn&#039;t give it to her to prove a point, I still came but only compressed air came out, imagine your best orgasm, then multiply it by 35. Didn&#039;t say nothing, hopped back in the Lambo and went back home. Now I&#039;m sitting here, drinking 15 000$ champagne and eating gold plated sushis made by the 2 bitches from earlier. It&#039;s only 6:30 and I did more in 1 hour than you faggots will do your whole life. Enjoy jacking off to stupid drawn pictures.","time":1492042971,"resto":120832462,"id":"7Ac2r8Uq","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120837096,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)20:24:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120834070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120834070<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;come down here an 0assault someone April 155th so you can get hauled off in the back of a police cab.<\/span><br><br>This fucker is a plant","time":1492043095,"resto":120832462,"id":"t\/3aaZ7K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120837491,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)20:28:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120832462\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120832462<\/a><br><br>Nice armchair anthropology Shia.<br><br>Repeat after me: It&#039;s Just A Prank, Bro (&quot;my dude&quot;).","time":1492043280,"resto":120832462,"id":"OM1IgH6J","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120837717,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)20:29:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"OP is homosex","filename":"1491674892423","ext":".jpg","w":658,"h":901,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492043377476,"time":1492043377,"md5":"xg8PF1Hy5bjeqKUlc212xA==","fsize":50005,"resto":120832462,"id":"Q5fOxEub","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120837768,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)20:29:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120833850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120833850<\/a><br><br>He explained that you are hiding your sincere hatefulness behind satire to shield yourself from criticism and confrontation.<br><br>Anyway, he&#039;s a Jew so who gives a fuck.","time":1492043399,"resto":120832462,"id":"OM1IgH6J","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120834443,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)20:05:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"DEFEND THIS POL DEFEND THIS RIGHT NOW","filename":"1492041825313","ext":".png","w":576,"h":587,"tn_w":245,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492041902231,"time":1492041902,"md5":"eyIgcNf1b92M1DGUsbvlvg==","fsize":466827,"resto":0,"id":"tHBMvdLF","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"defend-this-pol-defend-this-right-now","country_name":"United States","replies":98,"images":32,"omitted_posts":93,"omitted_images":29},{"no":120837495,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)20:28:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120834443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120834443<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;DEFEND THIS POL DEFEND THIS RIGHT NOW<\/span><br><br>I know, I know.

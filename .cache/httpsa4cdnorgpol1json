These people have never heard of adult politics in their lives that wasn&#039;t inspired by stuff like anime and videogames , it was completely alien to them. And they can&#039;t participate in these politics because they consider these ideologies &quot;cuckoldry&quot;. They want an ideology that isn&#039;t necessarily smart or practical or well-organized, but that appears to be to appeal to their surface-level taste. Because these people live for that mindless self-validation. They don&#039;t actually understand what makes for good nation-building diplomacy or good economic structure, nor have they ever picked a book about economics. It doesn&#039;t interest their infantile LARPing sensibilities. They want to pretend they do so and circlejerk themselves, that&#039;s what matters. &quot;Facism&quot; is just perfect for its demographic: these same college-age\/under-age self-important RPers who &quot;fucking love hitler&quot;. The entire foundation of the ideaology is built upon the dichotomy between &quot;nothing is more important than le race xD&quot; and &quot; freedom is so outdated bro&quot;. This pseudo-intellectual &quot;it is for the common good tho!&quot; bullshit that the followers of &quot;fascism&quot; shits out on almost every board is what appeals to LARP sensibilities. Their &quot;alt right&quot; ideology doesn&#039;t actually have the tact to offer an interesting presentation and discussion of any economics, so they spouts these edgy RolePlay memes taken straight out of propaganda videos. Nevermind about the fact that their entire political ideas are an irrelevant, forgettable piles of garbage that gets dismissed by actual mature conservatives today, or how their depiction of people who disagree with them have somehow been reduced to even more obnoxious caricatures than before, none of these things matter. What matters is that it appeals to the millennial LARPing audience, and that&#039;s what&#039;s selling &quot;Fascism&quot;","filename":"42","ext":".gif","w":320,"h":240,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493155426602,"time":1493155426,"md5":"KFdOEoqc7He8onUlxMiSYg==","fsize":2511458,"resto":0,"id":"+6uejiVp","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-really-do-need-to-get-into-the-mindset-of-the","country_name":"United States","replies":20,"images":7,"omitted_posts":15,"omitted_images":6},{"no":122793827,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:54:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122789717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122789717<\/a><br>your blaming the youth for being idealistic?<br>It is much better that the new generation is not accustomed to boomer &quot;adult politics&quot;, that means everything of value will be destroyed","time":1493157269,"resto":122789717,"id":"VnVoYtR3","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":122793946,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:55:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122791559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122791559<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that spacing<\/span><br>fuck off nufag. back to the liberal hugbox you came from","time":1493157321,"resto":122789717,"id":"npM2L1f1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122794177,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:57:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122791559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122791559<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Wb5<wbr>5teb1gJ0<br><br>Canadian state dollars made this tbqhwysenpai","time":1493157420,"resto":122789717,"id":"bbEjyAvC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122794389,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:58:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122791559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122791559<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122790189\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122790189<\/a><br>Even more.<br><br>Tell me, why are white countries the only ones accepting massive amounts of immigration outside their own race?

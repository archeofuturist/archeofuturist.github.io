I couldn&#039;t care less about calories. Yet still people make comments like that and honestly it just makes me mad, even though I just laugh it off. <br><br>Again quitting weed made a MUCH bigger difference. Weed kills your ambition. You think you are ok and that you are so successful and &#039;all I do is smoke a couple joints, that&#039;s not bad, could be worse I could be getting drunk&#039; but that&#039;s just being in denial. Weed is still a crutch and you will feel so much better if you quit. Other drugs I haven&#039;t done in over 5 years. I think I did one rail of blow a few years ago when I was really drunk, that&#039;s it. <br><br>As for the fapping... That&#039;s probably the hardest. Being healthy everywhere else in life gives me crazy libido, and my gf isn&#039;t always DTF when I am, so sometimes maybe I&#039;ll fap in the shower if she is on the rag or it&#039;s been a few days and I know I won&#039;t be getting any that night or the next. <br><br>I&#039;m completely no-porn though, porn is the real problem. I think you need to ejaculate at least once every three days for maximum test levels anyway","time":1493296932,"resto":123024736,"id":"b1EwvtQj","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123032213,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)08:43:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123032012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123032012<\/a><br>Evropa means Europe.

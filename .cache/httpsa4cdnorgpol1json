But will this actually fool an ISP that scans your Web traffic and shares it with advertising networks?<br>Electronic Frontier Foundation Senior Staff Technologist Jeremy Gillula is skeptical but hopes he\u2019s wrong. \u201cI&#039;d love to be proven wrong about this,\u201d he told Ars. \u201cI&#039;d want to see solid research showing how well such a noise-creation system works on a large scale before I trust it.&quot;<br>\u201cPerhaps more constructively than using a VPN or Tor, fill up your monthly bandwidth allotment with data pollution,\u201d Smith wrote to us. \u201cYou\u2019re already paying for the bandwidth, so use it all if your ISP is going to sell your private data. This has the dual benefits of obscuring your actual browsing habits, and, if enough people adopt this practice, discouraging ISPs from selling private data.","filename":"t3_5ks2wa","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1536,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491240583019,"time":1491240583,"md5":"5FmQYDPeti7BF3oE4pTHGA==","fsize":1143418,"resto":0,"id":"iC5eac8b","country":"IL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"after-vote-to-kill-privacy-rules-users-try-to","country_name":"Israel","replies":6,"images":1,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":119353648,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)13:33:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119353421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119353421<\/a><br>https:\/\/arstechnica.com\/information<wbr>-technology\/2017\/04\/after-vote-to-k<wbr>ill-privacy-rules-users-try-to-poll<wbr>ute-their-web-history\/","time":1491240816,"resto":119353175,"id":"iC5eac8b","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":119354184,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)13:38:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"bumpp","time":1491241084,"resto":119353175,"id":"lYCf3xlh","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":119354382,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)13:39:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119353175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119353175<\/a><br>inb4 r\/the doland shits up the thread saying its a good thing somehow","time":1491241195,"resto":119353175,"id":"xCrvkcMI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119356700,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)13:59:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119353175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119353175<\/a><br>I had an extension like this on firefox years ago, then i got a message from bing questioning about it, can&#039;t remember what it said but they knew what I was doing and didn&#039;t like it.","time":1491242385,"resto":119353175,"id":"roak4QHv","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119356715,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)13:59:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119353175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119353175<\/a><br>Time to buy a VPN, I think I&#039;ll choose Tunnel Bear it&#039;s trustworthy cheap and does not log you.","time":1491242392,"resto":119353175,"id":"FbJlJhkI","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119345819,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)12:24:12","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Why do you hate France?","com":"France is currently nevertheless the most powerful country in the world.","filename":"losers_resultat1","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":399,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491236652711,"time":1491236652,"md5":"6uKYmKV0Zrcv1SOQdRZETg==","fsize":45740,"resto":0,"id":"FiUu\/Omv","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-do-you-hate-france","country_name":"France","replies":47,"images":9,"omitted_posts":42,"omitted_images":9},{"no":119355587,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)13:50:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119346469\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119346469<\/a><br>You idiot, it was the French that stopped the Muslims from invading Europe.

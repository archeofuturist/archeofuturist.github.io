There&#039;s definitely a fine line between seduction and natural impulse on some kind of sliding scale to determine where the fault lies. <br><br>Personally though I don&#039;t think anything a woman wears, no matter how revealing, should alone be enough to justify any assault or misbehavior directed against her. In such case if she were otherwise entirely wholesome but were dressed provocatively (bikini, lowcut shirt, whatever) it&#039;s still 0% her fault, 100% mans fault<br><br>However if you add in seductive body language and flirting, where she&#039;s intentionally trying to exude sexuality and influence those around her, the scale starts to slide. Still not her fault, but more like 20% her fault, 80% mans fault.<br><br>Then you go further, she&#039;s intentionally exhibiting promiscuous behavior, leading you on hard, talking about the sex she may or may not want to have with you, rubbing your body, etc. Thats when it really pushes towards 60%+ her fault 40%+ mans fault. <br><br>Obviously my percentages are just examples but the point is to illustrate that it&#039;s not as black and white as one group or the other would believe. <br><br>Most feminist\/liberal type groups would have you believe the woman never has ANY responsibility, 0% in any and all circumstances, but obviously when her intent is to illicit a response, that alone puts her at least partially at fault. <br><br>Groups on the other side (like OP here) would rather imply that the woman is 100% at fault just for wearing revealing clothing. As I said, clothing\/appearance alone should never put her at fault; only combined with other behaviors does she assume part of the blame.","time":1493829748,"resto":123911546,"id":"r7Hoa3X7","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123931165,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)12:43:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123924257\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123924257<\/a><br>I have been married twice, no kids and i&#039;m not rich, how ever i own a house, car, motorcycles and i own a small business, girls hit on me so fucking hard, all this girls are from 15 and up and i can&#039;t fucking stand how fucking degenerate they are, last time i had sex was 2.5 years ago and i don&#039;t care.","time":1493829791,"resto":123911546,"id":"+11CxBa5","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":123931332,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)12:44:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123931099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123931099<\/a><br>See &gt;No anon, I&#039;m saying responsibility and restraint fall on both men and women equally, not just women like sand niggers will tell you and not just men like feminists will tell you.

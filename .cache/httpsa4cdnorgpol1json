Jews are the multi-ethnic group of peope enslaved by egypt. The slaves of egypt at the time of jewish formation came from the far reaches of the Egyptian empire, encompassing peoples of many races. These people, once subjected to slaughter of their firstborn or perhaps merely the threat of it (legitimate or not), produced a man named Moses. This man crafted a religion that spread like wildfire through the mixed race slaves, now rivalling the native Egyptians in number. It fabricated aspects of history in the same way it&#039;s inspirations do today. This religion convinced them that their liberation was at hand, and because of that, it was. They became united as a race would be, convinced they were an entirely difference species altogether, chosen by God. When they exited Egypt they set about establishing themselves as a legitimate presence by arming themselves and raiding other tribes which were mostly racially homogeneous.<br><br>Following this action, they were attacked by the Amalekites, led by Amalek, a man who is said by some zionist orthodox jews to be the leader of a germanic tribe. Three of the 613 jewish holy laws mention Amalek:<br><br>As enumerated by Maimonides, the three mitzvot state:<br><br>598 Deut. 25:17 \u2013 Remember what Amalek did to the Israelites<br>599 Deut. 25:19 \u2013 Wipe out the descendants of Amalek<br>600 Deut. 25:19 \u2013 Not to forget Amalek&#039;s atrocities and ambush on our journey from Egypt in the desert<br><br>Seeing a bit of a pattern here?

But the left has doubled down. The leftist tactics of threatening any place that conservative speakers are going to talk, ignoring all &quot;bad guys&quot; on their side, spinning anything the right does to look terrible: we need to step this up. <br><br>Make the left look terrible, letter writing campaigns to advertisers and government, refuse to acknowledge anything anyone remotely on our side does that&#039;s bad or wrong, spamming their jobs to get them to lose their jobs, take anything they say out of context, start memes about jewish privilege, and possibly even use threats to shut down their speakers.<br><br>They are stepping up these tactics, and we can&#039;t win a dirty fight by staying clean. I&#039;ve seen a lot of positive motions for the right in terms of uncucking ourselves. Persuading women to join our side will be a big help also. The left has huge sway over them and they outnumber men. They&#039;re needed to ensure victory. We&#039;re at a tipping point - the globalist leftist scum are using everything in their power to stop us. With a bit more fight we can smash them and red pill most of the country.","filename":"1224646056402","ext":".gif","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493581093058,"time":1493581093,"md5":"bBVStnzpxt4jcSYIUPE38A==","fsize":3196,"resto":0,"id":"uTyvBn1I","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"treating-leftists-as-bad-as-they-treat-us","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":2,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123515653,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)15:39:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Every \/pol\/ack needs to read rules for radicals by (((alinsky)))","time":1493581152,"resto":123515537,"id":"NcqcZuDo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123515790,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)15:40:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123515537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123515537<\/a><br>or we can continue to see what funny things we can make dumbies report about on the telly","filename":"1283579360464","ext":".jpg","w":435,"h":405,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":116,"tim":1493581218121,"time":1493581218,"md5":"77DsSrr5s8oEH0iL461XYA==","fsize":24773,"resto":123515537,"id":"b+4oVdsf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123517787,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)15:55:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123515790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123515790<\/a><br>we could have a bigger impact. we have the autism, we have the power.","time":1493582155,"resto":123515537,"id":"uTyvBn1I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123519218,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)16:07:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123515537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123515537<\/a><br>Centrist reporting in.<br>Both sides are retards with bad manners.<br>Libshits accuse me of being racist, sexist, or &quot;Alt-Right&quot; if I counter their narrative.<br>Conservatards call me shariablue, kike, or communist if I point out their failings.<br>Most of you faggots resort to ad hominem attacks instead of having a real argument.

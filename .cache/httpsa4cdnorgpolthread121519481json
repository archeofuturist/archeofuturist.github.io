We all know here how fake are those polls, they are the same ones who gave Trump a huge loss.<br><br>So if you wanna make easy money and you live in a country in which you can legally bet on anything, put all your hard-earned pounds on Fillon. Why him you ask ? It&#039;s simple.<br><br>We all know medias are manipulating polls. They left LePen voters alone because a big score can scare the other voters to vote &quot;efficient&quot; for the mainstream candidate: Macron. He had a very suspicious surge in polls and is now tied first. But Macron is too weak, he needs another candidate to attack LePen and that candidate is M\u00e9lenchon, he recently got a massively suspicious rise in the polls after attacking LePen.<br><br>But what about Fillon ? Medias spent most of their time to attack him on various affairs, kept repeating his campaign is over (reminds you of something) and there&#039;s too many scandals to be elected and, even if he is, he won&#039;t be able to govern. Despite that, even biased polls make him near the others.<br><br>If one guy is gonna beat the polls and surprise everyone it&#039;s Fillon. I predict Fillon\/LePen in second turn and a Fillon victory full of disgusted leftist voting for him.<br><br>screencap this, it&#039;s the actual results:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; LePen 26%<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Fillon 23%<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Macron 16%<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; M\u00e9lenchon 12%<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Hamon 11%<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; NDA 4%<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Poutou 3%<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Asselinaut 2%<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; LaSalle &gt; 1%<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Arthaud &gt; 1%<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Cheminade &gt;1%<\/span><br><br>Second turn<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Fillon: 62%<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; LePen: 38%<\/span>","filename":"cover-r4x3w1000-5830b338e2c9a-Franc\u0327ois Fillon - bio","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":749,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492431845965,"time":1492431845,"md5":"2LSHvlbDpT5AZRBtr2CWeQ==","fsize":81707,"resto":0,"id":"GRbub7hl","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-to-make-money-on-french-election","country_name":"France","replies":10,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":121519592,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:25:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"money can be exchanged for goods and services","time":1492431937,"resto":121519481,"id":"uSSFJYzM","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121519726,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:26:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121519592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121519592<\/a><br>Unless it&#039;s from Zimbabwe<br><br>or England after Brexit","time":1492432015,"resto":121519481,"id":"GRbub7hl","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121520249,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:33:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121519481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121519481<\/a><br>Do you believe in chemtrails and that the man didn&#039;t go to the Moon too, my conspiracist friend?","time":1492432386,"resto":121519481,"id":"EjPlG5Kx","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121520540,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:36:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121520249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121520249<\/a><br>No. But in believe medias are willingly focusing on polls they like best, shaping the vote themselves.<br><br>But it doesn&#039;t work that great and that&#039;s why there&#039;s so many &quot;surprises&quot; in recent elections.<br><br>Have you seen how arrogant journalists are ?

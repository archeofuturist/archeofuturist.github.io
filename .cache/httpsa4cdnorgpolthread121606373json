Hence, it is our view that Rh+ (Rh-positive) is the original Rh blood allele in humans, since black Africans in Africa who have not mixed either with white populations or with mixed-race persons have ONLY this Rh allele and no evidence of Rh- (Rh-negative).<br> <br>Since Rh- (Rh-negative) is an allele which is found predominantly among white populations (ca. 40-45% in Europe), it must clearly be a mutation which followed after man&#039;s migrations from Africa to Europe.<br> <br>Moreover, Rh-negative is found much more frequently among A and O blood groups, which are the major blood types in Western Europe, whereas Rh-negative is much rarer among persons with B and AB blood types.","filename":"d315f478c4cbcefb09cc64aa0ae63928","ext":".png","w":498,"h":224,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":112,"tim":1492473983523,"time":1492473983,"md5":"0xX0eMTLzvsJzGSqCuY5KA==","fsize":10203,"resto":0,"id":"Jqf2PcPY","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"true-aryans","country_name":"Brazil","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121608007,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)20:19:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121606373\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121606373<\/a><br>Gingers are the apex of human evolution.

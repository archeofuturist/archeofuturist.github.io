This is more a reflection of our own countries than it is of him. People see in Putin a man who puts his own country&#039;s interest before the rest of the world&#039;s. Sure, there&#039;s a megalomaniacal stripe to it, and he&#039;s pretty awful to a lot of his people, but he is, in a weird way, patriotic. <br><br>Our countries, meanwhile, cuck themselves into oblivion, begging vibrant hordes of Muslims, Africans, and Latinos to come in, and then thanking them when they outbreed us and completely take advantage of the systems we&#039;ve built. We don&#039;t envy the people of Russia per se, but we envy that they have a leader who, if nothing else, understands the importance of nationalism and duty to one&#039;s country. <br><br>You can say that sounds like an idealized way of looking at him, and you&#039;d be right, but understand that this skewed perception comes from abuse. Abuse by our own countries, who hate us (straight white men) as much as they hate themselves.","time":1492570723,"resto":121788199,"id":"D\/xfOs5s","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

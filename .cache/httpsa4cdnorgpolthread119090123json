This evil was not least to be dreaded in the election of a magistrate, who was to have so important an agency in the administration of the government as the President of the United States. But the precautions which have been so happily concerted in the system under consideration, promise an effectual security against this mischief. The choice of SEVERAL, to form an intermediate body of electors, will be much less apt to convulse the community with any extraordinary or violent movements, than the choice of ONE who was himself to be the final object of the public wishes. And as the electors, chosen in each State, are to assemble and vote in the State in which they are chosen, this detached and divided situation will expose them much less to heats and ferments, which might be communicated from them to the people, than if they were all to be convened at one time, in one place.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper No. 68<\/span><br>http:\/\/avalon.law.yale.edu\/18th_cen<wbr>tury\/fed68.asp<br><br>The Electoral College was put in place to stop a person who is dangerous to the Union and republican form of government from being sworn in as POTUS, not this &quot;muh our voices count too&quot; shit.

In a pure democracy, the majority vote decides the outcome of laws and initiatives. In a republic, the government is constrained by the limitations placed on it through a constitution or charter. The term democracy is often confused with the representative democracy used in the United States. The United States is a republic, and its elected officials are bound by the protections of the constitution. They vote &quot;democratically&quot; to create laws, but no matter how great the majority, they still must uphold constitutionally protected rights. Changing the constitution is difficult and can only be done through amendments to the constitution. To further protect against the threat of tyranny, the governmental powers are divided into separate branches. In direct democracies, there is no constitutional protection in place, and the majority vote can override any law. There are some states within the United States that do allow people to vote directly on policies through initiatives or referendums.","time":1490991555,"resto":119090123,"id":"OPOpWcyP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119095248,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)16:19:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119090123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119090123<\/a><br>[1] Popular vote doesn&#039;t count.<br>[2] We have a electorial college\/votes so that NY and CA can&#039;t decide every election.<br>[3] He won, get over it shill...<br>[4] SAGE<br>[5] It&#039;s not rocket science, but you still can&#039;t seem to understand simple things.","time":1490991576,"resto":119090123,"id":"dY7CtxFm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119095274,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)16:19:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119095129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119095129<\/a><br>Listen bud I hate her too but there&#039;s no need to use conspiracy bullshit to try and explain why Trump lost the popular vote","time":1490991594,"resto":119090123,"id":"cyV\/tnfm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119095282,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)16:20:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119094967\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119094967<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sure it is.<\/span><br>That&#039;s not a strawman; it&#039;s an attack on the opponents character (still considered to be a fallacy).

This evil was not least to be dreaded in the election of a magistrate, who was to have so important an agency in the administration of the government as the President of the United States. But the precautions which have been so happily concerted in the system under consideration, promise an effectual security against this mischief. The choice of SEVERAL, to form an intermediate body of electors, will be much less apt to convulse the community with any extraordinary or violent movements, than the choice of ONE who was himself to be the final object of the public wishes. And as the electors, chosen in each State, are to assemble and vote in the State in which they are chosen, this detached and divided situation will expose them much less to heats and ferments, which might be communicated from them to the people, than if they were all to be convened at one time, in one place.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper No. 68<\/span><br>http:\/\/avalon.law.yale.edu\/18th_cen<wbr>tury\/fed68.asp<br><br>The Electoral College was put in place to stop a person who is dangerous to the Union and republican form of government from being sworn in as POTUS, not this &quot;muh our voices count too&quot; shit.

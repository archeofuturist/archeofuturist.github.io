I&#039;ve seen on Twitter how they kept taking about \u201cPol\u201d and his Reddit group. I&#039;m banned from his Reddit page for speaking out against him so I&#039;m trying my luck here. . I don&#039;t think you&#039;re all racists like the media says. But I&#039;ve heard you guys do some amazing things like track down ISIS installations and silly things like playing pranks on Shia Labeuf (spelling?). Anyway, President Trump said during the campaign that he wouldn&#039;t deport people who didn&#039;t commit crimes. It turns out that this is NOT the case. I kept trying to attach this pic but it&#039;s too big. Ugh, I hate this stupid site so I&#039;m going to post in two posts. <br><br>It&#039;s important that you read the story so you can hear the harrowing tale. Maybe if enough of you see the damage that President Trump&#039;s immigration orders are doing, you can help.<br><br>Once you read the whole story, I&#039;d like to get a change.org petition started or maybe on the White House site?

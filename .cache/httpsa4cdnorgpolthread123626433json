Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1488223422556","ext":".png","w":264,"h":200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":189,"tim":1493648903337,"time":1493648903,"md5":"CZeJ6Dns1Hdbc+F3CtMj9A==","fsize":276085,"resto":0,"id":"WULs5NJo","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":11,"images":3,"unique_ips":9},{"no":123626707,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:30:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123626433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123626433<\/a><br>No shit, atheism is almost as retarded as Christianity","time":1493649059,"resto":123626433,"id":"JVxleShF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123626956,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:33:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; majority of Russians identifying as Christian<\/span><br><br>Lol implying that means anything","time":1493649202,"resto":123626433,"id":"tXee9+8P","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123627433,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:38:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123626433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123626433<\/a><br>If there&#039;s one thing worse than being a fedora-tipping atheist is [spoiler]saving the thumbnail[\/spoiler]","time":1493649482,"resto":123626433,"id":"eol1GJzr","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":123627884,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:42:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123626433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123626433<\/a><br>you are making our invisible atheist god sad. please repent and convert to atheism, and follow our sacred precepts, otherwise there will be no volcano beer for you in the afterlife","filename":"In_the_beginning","ext":".png","w":300,"h":400,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493649758876,"time":1493649758,"md5":"o6odSaWbipVJdJUV1YE4\/A==","fsize":197277,"resto":123626433,"id":"KRYNJUQy","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":123628077,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:44:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"Atheism isn&#039;t a religion, that&#039;s an oxymoron.<br><br>Also,<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;le fedora maymay<\/span><br><br>Hello, is this 2012?","time":1493649869,"resto":123626433,"id":"\/Abm6WXa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123628142,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:45:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123626707\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123626707<\/a><br>Not having a religion is as stupid as having one?","time":1493649912,"resto":123626433,"id":"QJFKc5wX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123628748,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:50:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123627884\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123627884<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the flying spaghetti monster<\/span><br><br>Will this stupid, unfunny meme ever die?","time":1493650259,"resto":123626433,"id":"\/Abm6WXa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123629072,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:53:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123628748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123628748<\/a><br>protip: we all will","filename":"francisco","ext":".jpg","w":704,"h":492,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1493650424820,"time":1493650424,"md5":"lpsdWhZj2AuoRH05LCrO3A==","fsize":82671,"resto":123626433,"id":"KRYNJUQy","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":123629492,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:57:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123629072\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123629072<\/a><br>Now, wait a minute...","filename":"the rarest pepe","ext":".jpg","w":362,"h":366,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493650661226,"time":1493650661,"md5":"8KkVGrsoSjUI4EPkmpZ17A==","fsize":8347,"resto":123626433,"id":"\/Abm6WXa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123629659,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:59:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"sex junk video did more for religion than anything in humanity.

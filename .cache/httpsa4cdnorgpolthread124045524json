This is definitely something people need to be made aware of. <br>Unfortunately, many European politicians are probably also involved in this scheme, so nothing will be done about it. If you check recent news, people like Van der Bellen claim there is no evidence for a cooperation between people smugglers and NGOs. Unsurprisingly, he&#039;s a lefty lunatic. It baffles me how the general public still thinks relief organizations act out altruistic motives (think of aid we send to Africa, etc) when it is very clear that they are billion dollar industries.","time":1493894133,"resto":124045524,"id":"\/sO6uqwH","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":124047477,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:38:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124047223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124047223<\/a><br>Cuck","time":1493894324,"resto":124045524,"id":"swNcnxtn","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"}]}

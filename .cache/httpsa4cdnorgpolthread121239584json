no such a thing as Jewish race. At least not in the way as &quot;chosen people&quot;. The Jews God talked about as His chosen people are those, who belived in Him and His might. Those, who believed in Him were the chosen people. But they misunerstood that. They tought that the Messiah will be their king, who will make the non-believer suffer, and they will serve Him (the Messiah) and the Jews as slaves. But when Jesus came and said that our mission is to enlighten people about him, and show them the true way, the Jews said that He isn&#039;t their Christ. He teached the way of self-sacrification and love throughout His life. The Jews, who believed Him later became the Christians. It is their duty to spread the teachings of the Lord. They think that everyone have the right to meet with God. On the other hand, the Jews think that it it only their right to live in this world as the &quot;chosen ones&quot;. This &quot;race&quot; thing is a hoax, since they realized what I just said, and they needed something to grab onto while they get attacked for their dirty tricks.","time":1492283737,"resto":121239584,"id":"L5ctgf5m","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":121246821,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)15:15:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121245867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121245867<\/a><br>What exactly is idolatry in the Christian sense?

People, who not only deny, but also fight against Him and His glory. In the middle ages, these people were the muslims. They denied the teachings of Christ, and in the same time, fought against it, slaughtering christians an burning churches everywhere they went. The crusader threw away their purity, their sin-free lives, they stepped down from the path of holiness, just to save others. They drove out these barbarian muslims from our land, so they can&#039;t kill more christians and they can&#039;t destroy christianity. And God knows this.

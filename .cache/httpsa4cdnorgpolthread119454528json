On one hand it&#039;s a right of passage, the path to adulthood, a way to finally make my father proud, a start of my new family, and a symbol of love for my wife and vice versa. On the other hand, everything from buying the rings to buying the wedding dress, to scheduling a party at a wedding reception is a giant blue pilled, jew controlled, over inflated, expensive shit show. The party is fake as fuck. Friends and family are forced to pretend to like each other for a few hours, and my wife gets to forget reality and pretend she&#039;s a disney princess all the way through the honeymoon and be depressed through the red pilled after-crash.

I say, we fix it! You might be asking yourself &quot;why the fuck does husband normie want to bring back chivalry, and asking pol to join his little crusade&quot; well, to answer that, look up the Ten Commandments of chivalry, as you can see, it says to go to war with any infidel, which, I thought you guys would love! Since, as you may all ready know, a infidel is someone who doesn&#039;t believe in your religion! Great huh? I say we try and trick people into getting on our side, since, most people assume chivalry is about being polite, we can use that as a start to get people to start agreeing we need to teach the next generation to live by chivalry! Since let&#039;s face it: our children are getting worse and worse, if we don&#039;t do something soon, we will have rude kids on this lovely site! The ones who have 9gag book marked, who have a Tumblr account, the ones who are absolute trash! So, who is with me to start the movement to I get back chivalry? I say we start the hashtag Chivalry is not dead, and say stuff like the current generation needs manners and the like. I came to pol to ask as, I think that most of your goals align with mine, which is great for me though I can&#039;t offer much, I can offer this: If we get chivalry into schools, this site will NOT go to the SJWs <br><br><br>Side Note: Accidentally posted this on MLPOL due to google redirecting me to the wrong board","filename":"1D4977FB-F358-4415-BF13-3459BDC27F65-1404-0000017487D12ED4","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":1024,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1491190355388,"time":1491190355,"md5":"fbqbmHDc5BSuu9vgy\/fq+A==","fsize":856675,"resto":0,"id":"zBRtOYdl","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bring-back-chivalry","country_name":"United States","replies":64,"images":10,"unique_ips":30},{"no":119285813,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:38:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119285265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119285265<\/a><br>Nice try woman.

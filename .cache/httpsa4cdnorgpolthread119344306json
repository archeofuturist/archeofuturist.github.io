A big part of ideology was an absolute bullshit built and supported by ego of some angry, angry maniacs, Hitler included. Which is expressed in some of the points you mention.<br>Even the war machine was logistic and strategic shitfest - sure, for a time they did surprisingly well but son they started to burn out.

Yes, it was at times totalitarian and there was plenty of shit but for average german person, there were also good times. Pic somewhat related, even if suspiciously propaganda-like in its own right.<br><br>Like often it is, nothing&#039;s black and white - and a lot of nazi shit on \/pol\/ is kinda memetic shitposting. You may have not missed a few red pills as much as you need to just educate yourself further. Perhaps you taken some red pills many anons should take instead of going all fanboy over nazi. I blame them being just charmed by the whole pump and uniforms as well as many anons still being pretty young and if one thing they base their political identity kinda fits (like hate of jews) they swallow up everything that comes with it like little, naive sluts.","filename":"livinginhitlergermanyouthnazi","ext":".png","w":2299,"h":945,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":51,"tim":1491236348338,"time":1491236348,"md5":"c77RDCCI44rGjFcm3TPXCw==","fsize":341535,"resto":119344306,"id":"kFEB7Oyy","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119345536,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)12:21:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119344836\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119344836<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Source?<\/span><br>It&#039;s Googleable.

They were fighting globalism. At worst the national socialist party was subverted by Ashkenzi jews, and the jews holocausted approximately 400,000 refugees by bombing the freight rail used to supply food to the camps (they died from typhoid\/typhus). The Ashkenazi jews used that as a false flag for muh 6,000,000 jews. It&#039;s interesting how the world powers were complicit in the disinformation campaign from beginning to now.

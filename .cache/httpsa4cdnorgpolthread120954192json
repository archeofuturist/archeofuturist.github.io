What isn&#039;t acceptable is ignorant, poorly educated morons thinking it makes them &quot;cool&quot; to be a criminal. I grew up in one of the shittest neighbourhoods in the country and let me tell you, the people in the area thought it was cool to steal cars and hold up post offices, etc. These people should be imprisoned and denied anything but basic sustenance and a library. No cushy prison system, no cushy &quot;assistance&quot; when they get out since they already receive more than the average person anyway.<br>I&#039;ve met homeless ex service men, but I&#039;ve never met a homeless criminal. <br><br><a href=\"#p120954850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120954850<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120954992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120954992<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120954994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120954994<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120955010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120955010<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120955195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120955195<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120955493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120955493<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120955784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120955784<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Drinking alcohol for any reason except occasionally to get half drunk<\/span><br>Untermensch","filename":"1486210311703","ext":".jpg","w":2111,"h":1300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":76,"tim":1492114397492,"time":1492114397,"md5":"kZux1uzMvmkUD9DCumfuSw==","fsize":685906,"resto":120954192,"id":"12qyVqXj","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120956517,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)16:13:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"So who did America nuke today?","time":1492114398,"resto":120954192,"id":"KFNfyUei","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120956550,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)16:13:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120956435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120956435<\/a><br><br>Fuck of Abdul, haven&#039;t you got a taxi to drive?","time":1492114411,"resto":120954192,"id":"cVlYw5v5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120956559,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)16:13:34","name":"Faux Conservatives Must Die","com":"<a href=\"#p120956315\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120956315<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;in a 40% white country <\/span><br><br>Why are you so optimistic?","time":1492114414,"resto":120954192,"id":"JU6AAmbX","country":"GB","trip":"!!03sSxJ9cqcI","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120956563,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)16:13:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Anyone watch Emmerdale tonight?

Go to GP ask for your test to be tested. Just go in and ask directly, when asked act embarrassed and say you have issues getting wood. They have to pay for the test then, if you say you have no muscles its at their discretion and they will tell you to fuck off as money. If you have low test congrats u just got free juice from mummy May.<br><br>When your results come back as normal, then you can be sure you are just shit at lifting<br><br>You shouldn&#039;t be doing any isolation stuff at all as a noob. Only big compound lifts, deads, squats, OHP, bench or something. RC stuff i guess too.<br><br>Basically you need to deadlift faggot, everything else is supplementary to help the dead. Take a couple of months to perfect your dead form, ignore everything else. Twice a week: 3 reps 3\/4\/5 heavy, 8-12 reps light 6 sets. If you do that for 8 weeks, record progress etc, you will see pecs and triceps and traps where once there was none.<br><br>Form is everything, you need a trainer who deads with great form himself. Deadlifted over a quarter ton today lad. Someone told me just what I told you five years ago. Still don&#039;t juice, I will when I am older. The danger with juice isnt the juice itself - its safer than anything you buy in the chemists for your period pains - its that you can permanently injure yourself if you start to juice before you know how to lift.","filename":"1491692347116","ext":".gif","w":420,"h":230,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1492118065112,"time":1492118065,"md5":"Mec1VMdo+k\/ewzjQkaYIdA==","fsize":2213326,"resto":120954192,"id":"Oc9vw9qU","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

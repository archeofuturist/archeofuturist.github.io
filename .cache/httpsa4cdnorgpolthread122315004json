My dad was on the council of our mosque and he was ill so i took over and i did a really good job so my dad and the rets kept me on and now i&#039;m pretty much running the mosque but i&#039;m not religious at all. <br><br>It&#039;s one of the biggest mosques outside of London\/Luton\/Birmingham etc... (muslim shithole ghetto town types). <br><br>Nothing really too radical apart from self segregation and anti semitism. Getting a bit too much visibility now though in the muslim community so I need to find a way to hand the reigns over. More visibility means greater chance people recognise me in town which could be a problem if im with my gf or something. <br><br>I don&#039;t know about ahtiesm though man, it seems like the worst of modernism and hedonism.

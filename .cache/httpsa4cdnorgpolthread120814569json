You Didn\u2019t Listen.","com":"On Election Day last November, I said, and I quote:<br><br>&quot;Remember I said this to you, right-wingers: Trump will fuck you. He will fuck you just like George W. Bush fucked you. He\u2019ll fuck you just like Obama fucked the progressives. The odds are overwhelming that Trump is going to do some things in the next four years that is going to confuse and enrage you. Just watch, and remember I said it, because I\u2019m going to be right.&quot;<br><br>I told you. I warned you. I said it over and over again, both before the election and afterwards.<br><br>In response, I have received anger, excuses, and personal attacks. Trump was going to be different. Trump was going to Make America Great Again\u2122. Trump was going to turn it all around. I was just being negative. I was a \u201cleftist\u201d and a \u201ccuck.\u201d<br><br>Just one problem. I was right all along.<br><br>If you didn\u2019t already know, a few days ago, Donald Trump, a dishonest authoritarian with zero emotional control who supports government health care, hates freedom of speech, and is terrified you might find out what\u2019s in his tax returns, launched 59 tomahawk missiles at Syria, a country that has never attacked the US. Why? Because maybe Syria\u2019s government gassed some of its own citizens (even though Syria has killed literally hundreds of thousands of its own citizens already).<br><br>Trump did this after repeatedly saying that attacking Syria was a crazy idea, that it would start World War III, and that America should focus on America instead.<br><br>But as I\u2019ve said all along, Trump is a liar, so he didn\u2019t mean any of that America First stuff. Nah, he just peddled that line of bullshit to dupe angry, delusional alt-righters into voting for him, the same way Obama duped angry, delusional left-wingers to vote for him, the same way George W. Bush duped angry, delusional conservatives to vote for him, and on, and on.","filename":"1491419446248","ext":".jpg","w":422,"h":422,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492033470287,"time":1492033470,"md5":"D0216ny61tksmhIKoa+oBQ==","fsize":120629,"resto":0,"id":"j+4Yga5F","country":"FI","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-warned-you-about-trump-you-didnt-listen","country_name":"Finland","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":120814645,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)17:45:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120814569\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120814569<\/a><br>Apparently, Trump is simply another warmongering neocon, another supporter of Bush-Obamism, and another supporter of Dick Cheney\u2019s Neocon Empire. I guess Obama\u2019s six different wars weren\u2019t enough for him\u2026 he wants it to be seven now. Perhaps more.<br><br>It\u2019s also very likely that Assad didn\u2019t gas his own citizens. If that\u2019s the case, this makes this attack even worse. It means Trump attacked a sovereign nation that never attacked us because of either a mistake, misunderstanding, or a hoax. Isn\u2019t that nice?<br><br>Even if the chemical attack was real and was indeed ordered by Assad, that means that as a US taxpayer, you just spent about $50 million dollars to attack yet another country. Great. As if we weren\u2019t bombing enough countries already.<br><br>Is this why you guys elected Trump?<br><br>Watching the reactions of Trump supporters over the last few days has been interesting as it\u2019s been depressing. As soon as Trump launched these missiles, Trump supporters fell into two camps:<br><br>The first camp are the Trump supporters who were shocked, shocked! How could he have done this?!? I believed in him!<br><br>Are you guys completely retarded? Haven\u2019t I been saying he\u2019s been full of shit for at least a year now? What did you guys tell me last year when I warned you about Trump? I hope you feel really stupid right now. You deserve it. And you have blood on your hands.<br><br>The second camp of Trump supporters are those true Kool-Aid drinkers who still think that Trump is awesome and is doing everything right. They are bending over backwards, using the most insane, irrational arguments to show that attacking Syria was a really great idea.<br><br>These are lead by, I\u2019m sorry to say, Scott Adams. He posted an article that basically says launching millions of dollars of missiles at yet another country was a good move because it was good persuasion (what?!?) because it helps Israel (who gives a fuck about Israel?), and because it makes Putin mad (what?!?).","time":1492033502,"resto":120814569,"id":"j+4Yga5F","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"}]}

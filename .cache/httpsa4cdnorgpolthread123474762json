There is nothing special about Poland that would allow Poland not to follow rules and demands of EU. The second reason is that I want Poland and its citezens to understand something. Poland is like an old prostitute who sells herself but nobody is intrested in her wrecked, old, dirty, smelly vagina. Poland is full of pride and dreams of its great future and past.

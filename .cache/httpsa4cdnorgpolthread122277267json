The truth is that the NHS is an impractical venture because the economics will never be realistic with changes in demographics and a globalist strategy of destroying the middle class, removing industry and lowering wages - all which means that national tax income has been going down. Any political party in Government would be faced with the same reality but none of them are honest enough to point out that the NHS is unaffordable and will become even more unaffordable as public expenditure in the future. The dumb ass Liberal\/Leftist &#039;solution&#039; of increasing taxes is just a total lie and would never work.","time":1492877301,"resto":122277267,"id":"aqMzGeIE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122292961,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:09:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122287309\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122287309<\/a><br>Summarise please.","time":1492877378,"resto":122277267,"id":"aqMzGeIE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122293000,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:10:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Eat my ass, kartoffel","time":1492877401,"resto":122277267,"id":"ITWCz8LF","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122293106,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:10:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122277267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122277267<\/a><br>Coming from a salty German whose country is too far gone, this means nothing.","time":1492877451,"resto":122277267,"id":"ocALvgzV","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122293137,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:11:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122291559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122291559<\/a><br>Cuck","time":1492877470,"resto":122277267,"id":"ITWCz8LF","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122293247,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:12:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122285601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122285601<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The EU parliament appoints the President of the Commission<\/span><br><br>Point proven, fuckwit. <br><br>The EU council appoints the Commission President.

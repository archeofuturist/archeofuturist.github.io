Something big is definitely up for Sunday.<br><br>Finally though, the biggest sign that something isn&#039;t right is that earlier this week, I awoke to flashing lights and sound. Everyone shuffled out of the building, and I heard some people whispering something about an oven. Are they preparing to put us into gas chambers?<br><br>I&#039;m shaking and scared. I don&#039;t know what&#039;s going to happen Monday, but I suggest that you all buy water filters and get out of the big cities now.

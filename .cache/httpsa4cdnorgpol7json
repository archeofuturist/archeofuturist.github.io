to go apeshit about how immigrants are going to destroy Europe (when they still are pretty much a tiny fraction of the population)<br><br>Coming from an American, where in 1900, 35% of the population were first or 2nd generation immigrants. 117 years later, things are pretty much just fine. Crime rate is at a 40 year low even with &quot;those damn mexicans&quot; Gun violence is higher here but we have more guns. And the biggest problem we have is with blacks who were never integrated the same way that every other ethnic group was.<br><br>So here&#039;s some advice<br>1) Chill the fuck out, you&#039;re not going to have a race war to kill them all its not the 1400&#039;s Thats not going to happen ever again so just deal with that fact.<br>2) Given that &quot;Gas the kikes, race war now&quot; isn&#039;t going to happen, your best bet to &quot;preserve&quot; your culture, and I&#039;m being serious is to include the newcomers into that culture as much as possible. They are coming from shitholes, the last thing most of them want to do is turn where you are into the same shit hole they left (with some exceptions, which I&#039;ll get to)<br>3) Best way to integrate people is to show them how fucking great it is to be like you. And give them the opportunity to be like you. If you don&#039;t then you isolate them and it makes things even worse. Again &quot;race war now&quot; isn&#039;t going to happen.<br><br>Besides, why not exploit the cheap labor and boost up your manufacturing again?

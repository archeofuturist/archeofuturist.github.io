Wikileaks, one week before their release of the DNC hack emails, acquired two servers in Russia on which to store all their data. The owner of these massive servers was the hacker Pyotr (Peter) Chayanov, head of Hostkey. Mr. Chayanov deleted his entire account, but not before people screenshot all of it. Wikileaks had not merely bought or acquired Russian servers, they had given Chayanov and Hostkey their SSL keys. That in turn meant that Vladimir Putin, Chayanov\u2019s boss, can see the IP of everybody reading anything on Wikileaks and indeed, can see the IP address of anybody who ever donated to Wikileaks. It was Russia who hacked US voter databases, because it is the same company and the same server. Julian Assange has released every IP that ever visited Wikileaks to the FSB (a.k.a. KGB). The Alfa Bank server was passing voter database info to and from the Russian state, and then handing this info to SCL and Cambridge Analytica (ultimately owned by Alfa Bank) for targeting by the Trump campaign. Assange has released ALL donor data from those who supported WikiLeaks to the KGB.

There&#039;s a plauge in this world, a thick darkness that covers it. A sickness of the moral parts in man, and it is directly caused by sin. Since most people are completely unaware of how to solve this, and since they&#039;re more than content in their sins, they rather lash out at their savior, who by the way happens to be the only way out of the decadence of sin, than to admit that they are hardened sinner (no worse than the criminal negroes and godless jews that are so despised on this board).<br><br>really, if only they took the time to look in the mirror and see themselves for what they are, filthy sinners in dear need of a moral beacon of pure light, they&#039;d be running to Jesus Christ, and they&#039;d follow his teachings with the same zeal they have when they blame all the faults of the world on jews. But it&#039;s much easier to blame other people, than to attempt to fix the flaws in their own life.<br><br>Repent now before it&#039;s too late.","time":1491161187,"resto":119231824,"id":"v8o8\/bqG","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119235269,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:29:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119234930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119234930<\/a><br>Lol","time":1491161349,"resto":119231824,"id":"cUnDO5oZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119238133,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:55:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119234930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119234930<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;being this cucked<\/span>","time":1491162915,"resto":119231824,"id":"r\/ESRljD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119237950,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:53:28","name":"Hitler was a cuck","sub":"We the most extreme generation!","com":"Post ways Hitler was not hardcore enough!","filename":"hitler","ext":".jpg","w":259,"h":194,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491162808646,"time":1491162808,"md5":"itWnHExyX7cSgehXntnuHg==","fsize":10288,"resto":0,"id":"lwqshPxj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-the-most-extreme-generation","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0},{"no":119238028,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:54:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119237950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119237950<\/a><br>He didn&#039;t kill all the Jews.","time":1491162855,"resto":119237950,"id":"0R\/ulXaw","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119238062,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:54:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119237950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119237950<\/a><br><br>Should have been more catholic.

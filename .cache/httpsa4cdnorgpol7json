If this isn\u2019t scary enough news, even if your machine doesn\u2019t have SMT, ISM, or SBT provisioned, it is still vulnerable, just not over the network. For the moment. From what SemiAccurate gathers, there is literally no Intel box made in the last 9+ years that isn\u2019t at risk. This is somewhere between nightmarish and apocalyptic.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The problem is quite simple, the ME controls the network ports and has DMA access to the system. It can arbitrarily read and write to any memory or storage on the system, can bypass disk encryption once it is unlocked (and possibly if it has not, SemiAccurate hasn\u2019t been able to 100% verify this capability yet), read and write to the screen, and do all of this completely unlogged. Due to the network access abilities, it can also send whatever it finds out to wherever it wants, encrypted or not.<\/span>","filename":"4L_iDxnoiPC","ext":".png","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493706134363,"time":1493706134,"md5":"e2mg8ytSf6sFBlh3seZfEQ==","fsize":1960971,"resto":0,"id":"QUplhZRh","country":"IL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"intel-me","country_name":"Israel","replies":289,"images":45,"omitted_posts":284,"omitted_images":45,"tail_size":50},{"no":123776744,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:12:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123741174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123741174<\/a><br>you&#039;re a fucking retard.","time":1493737921,"resto":123736854,"id":"Sxf93PPs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123776899,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:13:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123776689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123776689<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;t. county government IT employee<\/span><br>jesus fucking christ","time":1493738007,"resto":123736854,"id":"iA41v0fW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123776920,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:13:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123776689\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123776689<\/a><br>you&#039;re a new fag considering people were posting this info around 10 years ago.<br>Multiple infographics have been made showing this shit repeatedly.<br><br>The really good infographics I haven&#039;t seen in years.","time":1493738023,"resto":123736854,"id":"Sxf93PPs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123777045,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:15:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"God damn it \/pol\/ why did you have to kick all of the smart people to 8kek.","time":1493738105,"resto":123736854,"id":"Sxf93PPs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123778113,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:26:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123776019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123776019<\/a><br>it&#039;s in the hardware, you can&#039;t do shit.<br><br>google libreboot and learn why they don&#039;t do anything on intels made after 2005.<br><br>intel before 2005 have a different system and I&#039;m pretty sure you can fix it.

By God&#039;s point of view, the Jew is a chosen one of God that acknowledges his arrangements. <br><br>The ancient Jews were not (((Jews))). They were Israelites. What made Israelites unique was their genealogy. They could trace their lineages back to Abraham, Isaac and Israel. After the Seige of Jerusalem in 70 AD all geneaological records were destroyed and all Israelites disbanded. The (((Jews))) of our time are imposters who claim a link to the original Israelites but have none because they cannot trace their lineage back to them at all.","time":1493736672,"resto":123762363,"id":"xv+cXGsD","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123776511,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:09:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123763232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123763232<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123764308\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123764308<\/a><br>This.

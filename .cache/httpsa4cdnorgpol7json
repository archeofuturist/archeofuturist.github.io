While there\u2019s a glut of homoerotic writings from priests going back to the Middle Ages, obtaining an accurate count is tough. But most surveys (which, due to the sensitivity of the subject, admiittedly suffer from limited samples and other design issues) find between 15 percent and 50 percent of U.S. priests are gay, which is much greater than the 3.8 percent of people who identify as LGBTQ in the general population.<br><br>As straight priests left the church for domestic bliss, the proportion of remaining priests who were gay grew. In a survey of several thousand priests in the U.S., the Los Angeles Times found that 28 percent of priests between the ages of 46 and 55 reported that they were gay. This statistic was higher than the percentages found in other age brackets and reflected the outflow of straight priests throughout the 1970s and \u201980s.<br><br>The high number of gay priests also became evident in the 1980s, when the priesthood was hit hard by the AIDS crisis that was afflicting the gay community. The Kansas City Star estimated that at least 300 U.S. priests suffered AIDS-related deaths between the mid-1980s and 1999. The Star concluded that priests were about twice as likely as other adult men to die from AIDS.<br>Given that the church has called a gay orientation an \u201cobjective disorder\u201d and gay sex \u201can intrinsic moral evil,\u201d it may seem bewildering why a gay man would chose this profession. But it makes more sense after realizing the church encourages sublimation of homosexuality through prayer. \u201cHomosexual persons are called to chastity,\u201d states the Catechism of the Catholic Church. \u201cBy the virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.\u201d","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-20 at 12.27.58 PM","ext":".png","w":1196,"h":1380,"tn_w":216,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492705833621,"time":1492705833,"md5":"lsoD5ab4cVx\/EdO9C7phng==","fsize":722834,"resto":0,"id":"y6\/hx0d8","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"if-catholics-hate-gays-why-are-so-many-gay-men","country_name":"United States","replies":26,"images":2,"omitted_posts":21,"omitted_images":1},{"no":122014020,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:58:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122013830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122013830<\/a><br>I don&#039;t think you can separate people like that.

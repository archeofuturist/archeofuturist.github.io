It is, so to speak, the mortar that holds the enemy coalition firmly together, despite its differences of class, ideology, and interests. Capitalism and Bolshevism have the same Jewish roots, two branches of the same tree that in the end bear the same fruit. International Jewry uses both in its own way to suppress the nations and keep them in its service. How deep its influence on public opinion is in all the enemy countries and many neutral nations is plain to see that it may never be mentioned in newspapers, speeches, and radio broadcasts. There is a law in the Soviet Union that punishes anti-Semitism \u2014 or in plain English, public education about the Jewish Question \u2014 by death. The expert in these matters is in no way surprised that a leading spokesman for the Kremlin said over the New Year that the Soviet Union would not rest until this law was valid throughout the world. In other words, the enemy clearly says that its goal in this war is to put the total domination of Jewry over the nations of the earth under legal protection, and to threaten even a discussion of this shameful attempt with the death penalty.<\/span>","filename":"JoeGoebb","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":308,"tn_w":178,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491429299670,"time":1491429299,"md5":"7b2vuqANEszBeHcUR44rGw==","fsize":12265,"resto":0,"id":"oYww\/9Jf","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-did-the-nazis-really-hate-the-jews","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":31,"images":23,"omitted_posts":26,"omitted_images":18},{"no":119668972,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)18:52:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"We all die alone.

Gated communities, mostly white towns where the only brown people are literally the top .5% of their race, never having to sink or swim because they come from more affluent middle class families, the most exposure they have to nature is camping in a designated paid lot 20 feet from their vehicle, etc. They don&#039;t understand living near actual black people (it&#039;s sure a strange coincidence that racist views correlate with proximity to black neighborhoods) and when they travel they never leave the safe tourist spots.<br><br>Most media today is a story where white males are only allowed to be seen in a positive light if they give way to females\/minorities at all times or fight for a SJW cause. LOTR would never be allowed to exist today because it was just a bunch of white people fighting for their own survival, for example. They become conditioned by John Oliver to laugh absurdly and whatever he tells them to despite not making a salient point as to why. The punchline itself is &quot;this person has a conservative view.&quot;<br><br>If all your life experience comes from media that conditions you this way, you think that a minority robbing you is just your own fault for being white. Hell, a lot of television and movies show the white person as the one with the onus of their own robbery by being &quot;ignorant&quot; enough to stumble into the wrong neighborhood or not bowing enough when confronted\/accidentally being racially insensitive. This tells the viewer that it&#039;s your own fault to be victimized if you weren&#039;t PC enough for black thugs. The only time a white person is ever robbed out of the blue in media is by a white purse snatcher. Otherwise it&#039;s the white person going to black people and triggering them into robbing whitey as some sort of justified payback.","filename":"gggw4","ext":".jpg","w":850,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":58,"tim":1492879155956,"time":1492879155,"md5":"BzyYagzOrnJPw+T\/OQQnsw==","fsize":70949,"resto":122286161,"id":"n+PTObLS","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122296284,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)12:39:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122286161\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122286161<\/a><br>Children&#039;s literature pats them on the head and gives them a treat just for being present.<br><br>If you ever study up on the actual issues these supposed scholars are advocating, you find out that they are self interested at best and more likely, have no idea what they are advocating.<br><br>This can lead to some surreal moments where the supposed Super Women get silent and can&#039;t answer questions about logical contradictions.

The qualities you&#039;re looking for in a marriage partner, not surprisingly, are qualities you want to look for in friends. Even if you aren&#039;t religious, genuinely religious people make pretty good friends who probably won&#039;t fuck you over. Look for people who have a middle-class upbringing or are the kind of people who will become middle class. Guys from Utah, New York state, Montana and other areas with an emphasis on labor (and areas that typically feature a large politically conservative population) bear people with a great work ethic who are loyal to their friends, and will get you far. <br><br>-Hide you fucking power level. If you are in any way a racist or whatever, keep in mind you will be working for\/with black and Mexican people, and even people from other countries. Keep in mind that the demands of the military tend to sift out the niggers from the Blacks and spics from Hispanics. If you want to avoid an integrated workplace to some extent, do not go into logistics (LS), operations (BM), or administration (PS\/YN). Also FYI: black people are awesome to work with and so are Mexicans to a large degree unless you&#039;re in engineering. Avoid Asians and Filipinos, they all suck as a general rule and only look out for each other.<br><br>-Learn a different language and take a DLPT for it. Even if you aren&#039;t in a rate where it&#039;s relevant, you will receive a stipend depending on what you learn. Currently, I believe only languages like Russian, Mandarin Chinese, and middle-eastern languages (Arabic, Pashtu) will get you cash. Hebrew might as well. Spanish and Tagalog probably *won&#039;t*. Look into it.<br><br>-Don&#039;t buy a new fucking car. Dealerships and salesmen in high-density military areas are absolute sharks.

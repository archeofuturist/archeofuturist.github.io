It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1488223422556","ext":".png","w":264,"h":200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":189,"tim":1493182652324,"time":1493182652,"md5":"CZeJ6Dns1Hdbc+F3CtMj9A==","fsize":276085,"resto":0,"id":"dt9yyo+n","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":26,"images":3,"omitted_posts":21,"omitted_images":2},{"no":122853355,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:23:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122845460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122845460<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;atheism<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;religion<\/span><br><br>pick one","time":1493187819,"resto":122845460,"id":"bGAjxhLX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122853381,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:23:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122852345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122852345<\/a><br>Citation needed.","time":1493187839,"resto":122845460,"id":"OAlddUpQ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122853405,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:24:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"we will all christcucks gaytheists alhamdulillah","time":1493187849,"resto":122845460,"id":"h6Fi3a93","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":122853642,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:27:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122845460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122845460<\/a><br>Atheism....religion???<br>Retard!","time":1493188035,"resto":122845460,"id":"d3ogqj6R","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":122854122,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:32:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122853381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122853381<\/a><br>History you dumb fuck","time":1493188377,"resto":122845460,"id":"BPGRa51G","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122823938,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:48:29","name":"Anonymous","sub":"second russian civil war","com":"could this happen?","filename":"0","ext":".png","w":900,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493171309283,"time":1493171309,"md5":"THpdzOlEdrKSGs15T7nhxw==","fsize":4954,"resto":0,"id":"xr7m4YXt","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"second-russian-civil-war","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":88,"images":13,"omitted_posts":83,"omitted_images":11},{"no":122851480,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:01:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122851275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122851275<\/a><br>That&#039;s Italy, Serbia, France and England <br><a href=\"#p122851004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122851004<\/a><br>Myth.

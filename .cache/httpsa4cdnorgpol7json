Basically he&#039;s hinting at the white\/asian alliance. Whites\/asians will do what is best for the country (in this case &quot;american nationalism&quot;). Mexicans and Blacks will not. He has a normie audience to influence so he has to carefully select the right words. <br><br>While racemixing is not optimal, it is something that happens once a nation becomes more imperialistic and dominating over time. The Romans very much intermarried with the peoples for much of their history. In fact, Rome was founded on the rape of foreign women. They also routinely intermixed with foreign women of conquered territories. This had the result of aiding in Romanization of the frontiers of Rome and uniting all of Rome under a single culture, while stamping out foreign influence. Vae Victis, as they say. <br><br>Every effort should be made to find a mate similar in race, culture, and to you as early as possible in an effort to build a strong family and contribute to society&#039;s future. Would this mate selection criteria of similar race as well as a suitable mother for your offspring always result in the best mate being also the same race? I think in most cases, yes, however to say that in certainty that it would be in every case would be foolish. I believe there are times when racemixing will provide for a stronger family than it would in risking intermarriage of the same race with a riskier mating partner. Racemixing should not be encouraged, however to say it is unnatural and historically an exclusively bad thing is ignorant of the facts.<br><br>White nationalism, while a potent force, will not be able to carry this country alone. Just as Hitler had the Japanese as Germany&#039;s ally so must the Asians be ours as well.","filename":"34243223423","ext":".jpg","w":804,"h":960,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490733481602,"time":1490733481,"md5":"+C0OaQ7Ijs9INwXaFKPf+w==","fsize":108764,"resto":118687923,"id":"QLx4bvI8","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":118693109,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:38:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118689809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118689809<\/a><br>Cancer.

Yes, Nazi Germany achieved things beyond the imagination of man in such a short time that it can only be described as miraculous. Yes, for a while, Hitler stood up against the Bankers, and his economists created a near-perfect economy for their people. <br><br><br>But, during the War, and even leading up to it, Hitler succumbed to the temptation and betrayed his people. He sold out to the global elite, even if at first his intentions were good. He is responsible for countless millions of deaths throughout the war, and escaped along with his scientists, from certain death (either from suicide or an actual escape). Albert Kike predicted that Germany would wage a second world war, meaning, that if we believe he spoke the truth, that Nazi Germany&#039;s part in the war was already predetermined, and Hitler either could not or would not stop it.<br>Even the Soviets were fans of Nazi Germany. They saw them as allies against the evil of Capitalism, and did not see them as enemies until Hitler invaded Russia. Yes, I am aware that the Soviets had planned a full-scale march upon Europe. But rather than Germany waging war to stop them, why couldn&#039;t they just attempt to negotiate an alliance? Their economic systems were very similar, and had deep hatred for Western Capitalism. Germany&#039;s technology and the USSR&#039;s unbelievable size could have crushed UK\/US\/France, and claimed Europe. So, why didn&#039;t Hitler attempt to ally with the Soviets, seeing their similarities, and instead plunge himself and his country into a totally un-winnable war? My theory is that he sold out to the Bankers once the war began.

The fact is that African don&#039;t seem to even have a remote idea of how to manage their population. <br><br>If we look at the 3 countries that have been able to move from developping to developped status since WWII, we see that they are all East Asian (Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore) and they all had some type of population control program. China is slowly reaching this level and they have also had such a program, albeit much more draconian.<br><br>African countries just have a laissez faire attitude and things will just get fixed. It is as if they think things will magically happen.<br><br>Take Niger for example, it is the country with the highest population growth in the world, around 4% per year. It is even high compared to the African average, which is 3% per year.<br><br>This means that Niger needs to grow at minimum 4% to maintain their current development. Not improve, just maintain. <br><br>As you might have guessed, they have missed this 4% target on many occassion (even though their population growth rate was lower before). <br><br>In 1979, Niger&#039;s GDP per capita was USD 364, in 2015 it is USD 360. Almost 4 decades on running at the same place with no advancement.<br><br>In 1989, Niger&#039;s GDP per capita was almost 3 times higher than Vietnam. As you might have guessed it, Vietnam had a population control program. In 2015, Vietnam&#039;s GDP per capita is almost 6 times larger than Niger&#039;s.<br><br>Granted this is one of the more extreme versions on the continent, but there are many other cases that are equally mindblowing when you analyze them.","time":1490493999,"resto":118264515,"id":"TfjipIPC","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118306026,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:08:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"haha look at white people hahahaha<br><br>and they call us minoritys","time":1490494088,"resto":118264515,"id":"xzJUTShT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118306147,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:09:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118266567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118266567<\/a><br>whats with his arm?","time":1490494163,"resto":118264515,"id":"64Ye41QQ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118295325,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)20:27:32","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Without Obamacare, Boogie won&#039;t be able to get health insurance","com":"How can anybody defend this?

For years, before they have sex themselves, they are trained to see sex through a third party lens. They see sex, and learn to be sexually aroused by watching women they are attracted to have sex with other men, usually with very large penises. Porn breeds insecurity into men, and in some, a desire to see the women they&#039;re attracted to have sex from a pornographers perspective. No men are looking for porn with average looking guys, with average penises. Straight men want to see women they are sexually attracted have sex with large muscle bound men with large penises. They have been doing this for years, before they likely even had their first kiss. Their brains is wired in this way by porn. Even when they&#039;re dating girls, they are imaging girls that they&#039;re attracted to, have sex with other men. Having sex is fine for them, but it is not how they&#039;ve spent years training their sexuality. They have spent years watching, not doing. Sure, cuckolding has been around for years, but it is never been so prevalent as it is now with the advent of the internet and internet porn. We cannot say that it is &quot;just natural&quot; when some of the most common &quot;Wants&quot; of cuckolds are for other men to desire their wives so that they can feel validated through their sexual approval of their wives, and wanting &quot;bulls&quot; for their wives. The prime thing cuckold wants seems to be a large black man to have sex with his wife. That is not evolutionary, that is porn culture, and Jews are behind it! <br>Women exploit this rewired men brains. <br><br>https:\/\/desu-usergeneratedcontent.x<wbr>yz\/gif\/image\/1456\/53\/1456535707861.<wbr>webm<br>https:\/\/desu-usergeneratedcontent.x<wbr>yz\/gif\/image\/1467\/30\/1467302523086.<wbr>webm","filename":"1429708789168","ext":".jpg","w":1235,"h":871,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":176,"tim":1490493834231,"time":1490493834,"md5":"eruST9PUvsK8wCFOWsTVxA==","fsize":665285,"resto":0,"id":"hNo3ms3y","country":"NL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-reason-for-increased-number-of-actual","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":3,"images":1},{"no":118305728,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:05:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"tl;dr","filename":"7AFmd9N","ext":".jpg","w":1349,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1490493909566,"time":1490493909,"md5":"MCmXeOZPlJUM9YuD2wyULQ==","fsize":239163,"resto":118305609,"id":"XlP67jIa","country":"KR","m_img":1,"country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":118305888,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:06:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118305609\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118305609<\/a><br>Why dont gay men have this problem in reverse.

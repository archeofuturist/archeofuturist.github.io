several months ago. It shows the future of the country: it will become a Balkanized set of vassal states. Russia will become the sponsor of a much smaller Alawite rump-state, which will allow it to keep it&#039;s naval base and a military presence in the middle east. America will take over the northeast and south as part of the buildup to a war against ISIS. <br><br>It is my belief that Russia and the US coordinated this whole conflict, along with their masters the kikes, in order to cut Syria into pieces and ultimately pave the way for greater Israel. The kike media have suckered everyone into believing in the greatest performance of all time: the supposed &quot;cold&quot; conflict between Russia and America. The truth is these nations have ALWAYS cooperated with each other and with the Jews.<br><br>Exactly 100 years ago today, the USA officially entered WW1. On the side of, you guessed it, RUSSIA and THE JEWS! Just before the war started in Europe, the USA became wholly enslaved to the new Jewish Federal Reserve system. By the time the war was over, the Russians would be taken over by all-out Marxist communism. Traditional European societies were decimated, and the jews were able to buy up much of Europe. <br><br>This was furthered in WW2 when the Jews sent the USA and USSR to carve Germany apart. The USA fought alongside Russia once again, and this time, they made sure to get the Palestine territory for their Kike overlords.<br><br> Now, for the THIRD fucking time, the kikes are having their bitches, Russia and America, put on a big show, huff and puff at each other and the rest of the world, but ultimately only gain any territory and power for THE KIKES.<br><br> Mark my words, a deal will get struck where Russia and the USA drop the facade and form an alliance in an apparent attempt to oust ISIS. They&#039;ll be the new Hitler. This will, in truth, be a kike landgrab where greater Israel gets ready to assume overt control of the goy.","filename":"syria in pieces","ext":".jpg","w":618,"h":344,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":139,"tim":1491537319588,"time":1491537319,"md5":"OtFU1VhhsQ\/N293V4s8PYg==","fsize":55462,"resto":0,"id":"r7ajgf1I","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"confirmed-russia-and-the-usa-both-kike-puppets","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":119874063,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)23:57:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119873676\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119873676<\/a><br>What about Iran?

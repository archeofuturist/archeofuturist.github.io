They even joked about his taste in younger women.<br>President Trump called Epstein a \u201cterrific guy\u201d back in 2002, saying that \u201che\u2019s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201d<br>Now, Trump is on the witness list in a Florida court battle over how federal prosecutors handled allegations that Epstein, 64, sexually abused more than 40 minor girls, most of them between the ages of 13 and 17. The lawsuit questions why Trump\u2019s nominee for labor secretary, former Miami U.S. attorney Alexander Acosta, whose confirmation hearing is scheduled to begin Wednesday, cut a non-prosecution deal with Epstein a decade ago rather than pursuing a federal indictment that Acosta\u2019s staff had advocated.","filename":"AlexanderAcosta","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":389,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":202,"tim":1490140007289,"time":1490140007,"md5":"BujRXjh1tBrA2P4wAdqTRQ==","fsize":41351,"resto":0,"id":"46aYJXgj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trumps-labor-nominee-involved-in-pedogate-now","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":2,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":0},{"no":117689989,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:55:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117689920\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117689920<\/a><br>world&#039;s most famous bar mitzvah dj","time":1490140549,"resto":117688966,"id":"46aYJXgj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117690120,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:56:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117688966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117688966<\/a><br>If that isn&#039;t a crypto-jew then I don&#039;t know what is.","time":1490140614,"resto":117688966,"id":"cGxmjVTj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117690356,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:58:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117688966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117688966<\/a><br>Pls God let this be an oversight and a case of Trump just saying being amicable in his words towards rich people in general since he was a businessman.<br><br>SILVER LINING: this could be a catalyst for Sessions to crack down with the fist of God on high pedo politicians and their moneyed conspirators.","filename":"IMG_1472","ext":".jpg","w":469,"h":480,"tn_w":122,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490140732861,"time":1490140732,"md5":"x0BoDmgh0ScBCdGI1s3LnA==","fsize":27621,"resto":117688966,"id":"fwzqVLPK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117690359,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:58:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117688966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117688966<\/a><br>There are traitors on both sides.<br>When pedogate explodes all the countries will feel the burn, especially Aus since we have a lot of those pedo elites here.","time":1490140735,"resto":117688966,"id":"kRyUXiqG","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117691363,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)20:08:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117688966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117688966<\/a><br>Have a bump","time":1490141288,"resto":117688966,"id":"A2Pg5tI1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117685501,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:15:56","name":"Anonymous","sub":"WHITE agnostic Europe OR BROWN\/BLACK Christian Europe ?","com":"Which will you choose?","filename":"IMG_6290","ext":".jpg","w":760,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":210,"tim":1490138156870,"time":1490138156,"md5":"0WMvFFGsp3V2nMGUrp093Q==","fsize":128142,"resto":0,"id":"XFt2TvQ9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"white-agnostic-europe-or-brownblack-christian","country_name":"United States","replies":62,"images":13,"omitted_posts":57,"omitted_images":11},{"no":117690923,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)20:03:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117690508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117690508<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Implying the depictions of Lucifer as such didn&#039;t come after the creation of those statues<\/span><br>Are you historically inept?","filename":"Implications","ext":".gif","w":400,"h":225,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490141031813,"time":1490141031,"md5":"CABf0ElXe\/A5\/XFq7uCvjQ==","fsize":2805411,"resto":117685501,"id":"0Lzq9t0f","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117691027,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)20:04:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117690923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117690923<\/a><br>He&#039;s polish","time":1490141089,"resto":117685501,"id":"BHqHfaad","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":117691216,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)20:06:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Non-white Christian Europe.

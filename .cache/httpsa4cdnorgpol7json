BoJo, Amber Rudd, Philip Hammond are all there because they have some influence within the party which allows her to gather enough votes to push the least controversial legislations through. They&#039;re all awful at their jobs and a reshuffle under these circumstances would most likely result in she losing support from within the party. <br><br>It is virtually impossible to get a decent post-Brexit environment with these idiots in charge of such important departments.

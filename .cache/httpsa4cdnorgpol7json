(Why do you think Trump ramped up his deportation force. He&#039;s going to do it again but larger before the end of his term screencap this if you don&#039;t believe me) Whites who do their part of having many children and prepping will have no trouble. Once this is over we will once again enter a golden age, and once again we will forget about the past and become fools again, and the Jews have to once again formulate a plan to rid the world of the weak.

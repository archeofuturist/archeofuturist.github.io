Terrific guy. He\u2019s a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201d<br><br>The lawsuit alleged a number of charges against both Trump and Epstein, including rape, sexual abuse, assault and battery, and false imprisonment. Johnson said that when she was 13, Epstein lured her to parties at his apartment by promising \u201cmoney and a modeling career.\u201d<br><br>Johnson said Trump had sexual contact with her at four of those parties, including tying her to a bed and violently raping her in a \u201csavage sexual attack.\u201d The lawsuit said Johnson \u201cloudly pleaded\u201d with Trump to stop, but that he responded by \u201cviolently striking Plaintiff in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted.\u201d<br><br>After that, Trump allegedly threatened to harm or kill Johnson and her family if she ever told anyone. Johnson said Trump told her he could make them \u201cdisappear\u201d like Maria \u2014 a 12-year-old girl Johnson says Trump also forced her to have sexual contact with, and whom Johnson hadn\u2019t seen since that encounter.<br><br>Johnson also accused Epstein of raping her \u201canally and vaginally despite her loud pleas to stop,\u201d and that he \u201cattempted to strike Plaintiff about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed that he, Defendant Epstein, rather than Defendant Trump, should have been the one who took Plaintiff\u2019s virginity.\u201d","filename":"trump rape","ext":".jpg","w":772,"h":455,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":147,"tim":1491728735178,"time":1491728735,"md5":"Vq5Egi29nlJyAIiWqhfftQ==","fsize":264951,"resto":0,"id":"azON\/7a7","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trumps-rape-of-a-child-explained","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":1,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":0},{"no":120264960,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:45:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120264654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120264654<\/a><br>pizzagate is bullshit<br><br>epsteingate is real","time":1491731144,"resto":120261979,"id":"azON\/7a7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120265160,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:48:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120264960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120264960<\/a><br>They are the same thing.","time":1491731308,"resto":120261979,"id":"AqUbY2\/Q","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120265614,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:54:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120261979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120261979<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lured her to parties at his apartment by promising \u201cmoney and a modeling career.\u201d<\/span><br><br>Once a whore, always a whore.","time":1491731667,"resto":120261979,"id":"PmuP2dSM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120266309,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)06:03:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120264960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120264960<\/a><br>People were looking into Epstein because Clinton flew on his private jet over 20 times.

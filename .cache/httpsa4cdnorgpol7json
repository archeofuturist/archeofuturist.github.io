Surely &quot;giving the people power&quot; sounds good to the people, and therefore seems to have a moral highground as opposed to a monarchy... But is it really better? It seems as if democracy itself is kind of the ring in which different ideologies battle, and it&#039;s only the manipulation or presentation of\/to the voters that really matters.

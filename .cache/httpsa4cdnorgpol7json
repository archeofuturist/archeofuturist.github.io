A communist system would thus free individuals from alienation in the sense of having one&#039;s life structured around survival (making a wage or salary in a capitalist system), which Marx referred to as a transition from the &quot;realm of necessity&quot; to the &quot;realm of freedom.&quot; As a result, a communist society is envisioned as being composed of an intellectually-inclined population with both the time and resources to pursue its creative hobbies and genuine interests, and to contribute to creative social wealth in this manner. Karl Marx considered &quot;true richness&quot; to be the amount of time one has at his or her disposal to pursue one&#039;s creative passions.Marx&#039;s notion of communism is in this way radically individualistic.","filename":"223f0bc9ecc3a458ea60e8365e9384ea5b7c52c71ab2598194c0ca3afb5f688e","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":836,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490786234031,"time":1490786234,"md5":"rzp+48\/wcwOAMmxnFb29cA==","fsize":76679,"resto":118769075,"id":"15moBzPr","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118768373,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)05:30:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Daily reminder that it is YOU, dumpfags, who create terrorists.","filename":"1489898061304","ext":".png","w":494,"h":570,"tn_w":216,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490779805201,"time":1490779805,"md5":"Nc7Ya4DfLSBy73ef9FuYlQ==","fsize":223833,"resto":0,"id":"1fNiVWa6","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"daily-reminder-that-it-is-you-dumpfags-who-create","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":45,"images":10,"omitted_posts":40,"omitted_images":9},{"no":118774600,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:12:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118768373\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118768373<\/a><br>So if criticising muslims makes them terrorists, wouldn&#039;t the solution to be just banning them? <br><br>They talk big about how we gotta protect muslims and not say anything bad about them, but they go around talking shit about whites and christians.

Yes, the President\u2019s military intervention \u2013 albeit very minor \u2013 is a departure from what he said on the campaign trail. But the broader argument, now emerging in the alt-right Twittersphere, that Trump is abandoning the right and morphing into a centrist is absurd. Because he was never on the right to begin with. And neither werethey.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The alt-right reaction to the Syria bombing is tied up with the removal of ex-Breitbart boss Steve Bannon from the National Security Council. Their man in the White House has apparently fallen out of favour in the ever-fluid Trump court. Alt-rightists see Jared Kushner and his Goldman Sachs \u2018globalists\u2019 infiltrating the administration, at the expense of populist \u2018economic nationalists\u2019. Bannon allies \u2013 per the Washington Post \u2013 claim Kushner is pushing the administration in a \u2018Democrat Lite\u2019 direction. That\u2019s pretty rich though. After all, hasn\u2019t Bannon championed a massive deficit-financed infrastructure splurge by the Federal Government? And attacked the Freedom Caucus for blocking tax-credit-based healthcare reform \u2013 because \u2018limited government\u2026 just doesn\u2019t have any depth to it\u2019? And promoted Trump\u2019s campaign pledge not to cut entitlements? In fact, isn\u2019t his signature \u2018economic nationalism\u2019 \u2013 i.e. protectionism \u2013 just Democrat orthodoxy? <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But if fiscal conservatism is somehow to prevail at the ballot box, small-state Republicans might begin by calling out the alt-Right inquisitors for the frauds they are.

Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told journalists.<br><br>&quot;We call for restraint from all countries and warn countries not to pursue actions that could consist of any provocative steps,&quot; he added.<br><br>Speculation has mounted in recent days that Pyongyang is preparing to fire a trial nuke or missile when it marks a major anniversary on Saturday, prompting US President Donald Trump to pledge the matter &quot;will be taken care of.&quot;<br><br>Trump has sent an aircraft carrier-led strike group to the Korean peninsula to press his point, in one of a series of signals indicating his willingness to shake up foreign policy strategy.<br><br>Russia&#039;s North Korea envoy Alexander Matsegora on Friday said he does not rule out a test or launch in the near future, expressing concern that Trump could take a fateful decision without any North Korea experts on his team.<br><br>&quot;If Mr. Trump would listen to a Russian Korea expert with 40 years of experience, I would advise him not to do it,&quot; he told RIA-Novosti of a potential US strike.<br><br>&quot;Right now we all must stop at the edge of the abyss and not take this fateful step,&quot; he said.","filename":"IMG_3727","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":621,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":242,"tim":1492177827853,"time":1492177827,"md5":"Fr1In7P6NQkCIxk\/vOiTMg==","fsize":89090,"resto":0,"id":"ctofDsX0","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"russia-issues-warning-to-us","country_name":"United States","replies":260,"images":32,"omitted_posts":255,"omitted_images":31,"tail_size":50},{"no":121080802,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:37:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121073313\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121073313<\/a><br>They&#039;ve fired a lot of missiles into neighboring countries territories","time":1492187865,"resto":121061901,"id":"RRA+gPmn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121080969,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:39:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121063473\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121063473<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Keep a grip on global power<\/span><br><br>kek this is why Russia is trying to prevent it.

However, this proves lethal in a bombing situation, since our lungs become like a pressurised balloon to be ruptured by the blast wave. The majority of victims in a typical suicide bombing die from internal bleeding in the lungs. Only 6% on average die from shrapnel wounds.

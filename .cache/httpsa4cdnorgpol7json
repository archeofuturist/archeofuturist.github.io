There certainly have been attempts and progress, it isn&#039;t like Trump is simply refusing to work on them simply because he is betraying the campaign promises. Politics are a very complicated field, and this is oversimplifying it greatly. If you look at the sheer magnitude of these issues, it becomes a lot easier to see why the work isn&#039;t done. You simply can&#039;t cram 4 years worth of promises into 100 days, it isn&#039;t feasible. Be honest, do you really think that the most powerful country in the world is going to leave what is arguably the largest international organization, involved in countless sectors and missions, with just a snap of the fingers and a single stroke of the pen? Obviously not. A much smaller country, like Britain, leaving a much smaller organization, such as the EU, is a truly massive shift that will take a long time in itself.

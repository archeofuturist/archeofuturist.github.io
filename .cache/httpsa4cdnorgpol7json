From what I&#039;ve seen, the guy organizing it (Matt Heimbach) causes far more trouble than he&#039;s worth. My issues with him are: <br><br>1. He constantly changes ideologies and says whatever those in front of him want to hear. He has alternatively claimed to be a Traditionalist Catholic, Orthodox Nationalist, Southern Nationalist, National Socialist, - and now he seems to be promoting some sort of &#039;Appalachian Nationalism.&#039; He even started off as a Zionist and dated Ashley Goldberg aka Communism Kills - quite strange, imo. <br><br>2. Heimbach has attached his brand to George Lincoln Rockwell (just look up his party&#039;s YouTube page, there&#039;s a happy birthday message to GLR). GLR was an eccentric man who did more to malign White Racialism in America than anyone else - dressing up in Nazi costumes and comparing Hitler to Jesus? Sorry, but that&#039;s not what I call leadership material. <br><br>3. Heimbach&#039;s Chicago protest featured Jeff Schoep dressed up in a 1930s style leather trench coat. Does that really seem like a good image to anyone? <br><br>4. Heimbach was banned from Stormfront, NPI, and (temporarily) the League of the South. That&#039;s a big red flag, imo. <br><br>5. When Trump was fighting for the nomination, Heimbach was filmed at several Trump rallies acting ridiculous (I&#039;ve even heard he&#039;s being sued for getting in a fight with a rogue Shaniqua). Getting in public fights at Trump&#039;s rallies and yelling &#039;your time will come, leftist scum&#039; on camera might be fun, but they are tactically terrible moves. <br><br>_____________________<br><br><br>Sorry, but this guy is a nightmare. Just look at how the media gives presentable Nationalists a total black out. Do you ever seem them interviewing Mark Weber or Joe Owens or David Irving or RamZPaul? Those guys only get on television on rare occasions. But Heimbach is in the news every damn week. And there&#039;s a reason for that. He gives the media exactly what they want: a ridiculous caricature.","filename":"Hbach","ext":".jpg","w":448,"h":479,"tn_w":116,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490498710573,"time":1490498710,"md5":"or75D0MBH7SO94xIp6SI5w==","fsize":45085,"resto":118309538,"id":"iO+iI7o1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118313574,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)23:26:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118312343\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118312343<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nazi<\/span><br>Nah, they were the enemy and foreign.

The new doctrine of private interpretation was enshrined in a new religion which took the Scriptures of the Church and reinterpreted them according to each and every person&#039;s intellect. Not much different than taking someone else&#039;s work and interpreting their work for them. This principle, in practice, split Europe from its historical patrimony and cut off huge swaths of her from the Church. Princes, caring little for religion, saw opportunities to loot Church wealth and property. Oh, Reformation indeed!<br>Theology aside, the principle of private judgement was burning in the hearts and minds of men all over Western Europe. This theological principle soon became a philosophical principle, and Protestants sick of the &quot;constraints&quot; of Christianity began setting their mental axes to philosophy. Humanism was born, and further was developed into secular humanism as the Greeks fled West to escape Mahometan persecution, bringing with them their pagan texts which previously had been interpreted in a Christian light--now were unleashed in their pagan interpretation. This was Renaissance.<br>Those revolutionaries whose fathers thumbed their nose at the Church, and they who tended to the iconoclasm of Christian philosophy set to realize their philosophies in the socio-political realm. After all, Patriarchy is representative of God, and who better symbolizes this authority than the King? Enter the French Revolutionaries and classical liberalism.

It&#039;s quite similar to an old slave mentality in that blacks are afraid of not doing what they are told. Just as example, during the high point of American slavery, plantation owners told there slaves that if they left the farm, they would be killed due to the creatures that roamed around the property or they would just fall dead once they run far enough away. The same shit happens today, Democrats using the naivete of blacks and exploiting them to their own ends. Only now, blacks are even less useful now than during that time!

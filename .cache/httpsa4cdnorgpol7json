But that&#039;s also because Obama and pretty much every other president was known only as a politician or general before being elected. Trump was already a pop culture icon fading out of popularity, he&#039;s been the butt of god knows how many jokes long before he even announced running for president, so it&#039;s understandable that people aren&#039;t going to stop treating him like a pop culture icon after he gained a higher status.<br><br>Yes I understand free speech is important and being able to question and make fun of the system\/people in the system is even more important, but holy fuck guys can we just give the man a break already?

However, within Spain&#039;s overseas territories the concept evolved to be linked with racial purity for both Spaniards and indigenous.[11] Proofs of racial purity were required in a variety of circumstances in both Spain and its overseas territories. Candidates for office and their spouses had to obtain a certificate of purity that proved that they had no Jewish or Muslim ancestors and in New Spain, proof of whiteness and absence of any in the lineage who engaged in work with their hands. Additionally, as early as the sixteenth century, shortly after the Spanish colonization of America was initiated, several regulations were enacted in the Laws of the Indies to prevent Jews and Muslims and their descendants to emigrate and settle in the overseas colonies.<\/span>","time":1493047553,"resto":122592592,"id":"by9pn7nf","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122597430,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)11:28:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122596720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122596720<\/a><br>it really wasn&#039;t","filename":"hre13thcent","ext":".png","w":800,"h":1041,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493047736682,"time":1493047736,"md5":"ToXVuKbwposYsLqHkqZR0w==","fsize":702631,"resto":122592592,"id":"G6nDHiJA","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122597503,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)11:29:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122594779\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122594779<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Germany<\/span>","time":1493047769,"resto":122592592,"id":"keB0TqWC","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122597876,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)11:32:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122597430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122597430<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122597078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122597078<\/a><br>What&#039;s feudalism?

Civilization has been built on patriarchy, but Is society in the US patriarchal though? I think that its not patriarchal but matriarchal, and that is why our society is falling apart.<br>Well, our economy is still built on a patriarchy, but society in the US is matriarchal. Consider the following:<br><br>-Women hold 100% of reproductive rights, including over men&#039;s potential progeny. Is it your child she&#039;s aborting? too bad, so sad.<br>-Women raise the children. <br>-Women make up 85% of custodial parents. (women can not teach boys how to be men, probably the primary reason for the transtrenders)<br>-Women educate the children. Women make up 80% of the teachers, and this is primarily the reason for the fact that boys are universally and broadly, falling behind in US education from K through college. A boy not only has no male parent strongly represented in his life but may not even come across a male teacher and their first male mentor may be their first boss.<br>-Women make the financial decisions in families. From everything to groceries to furniture to investing. And studies show that the final decisions on large purchases for couples, like houses and cars, are made by the woman.<br>-Women make the social decisions in families. Studies show that the decisions on who the children will play with, where the family goes on vacation, and what social events the family attends, are made by the woman.<br><br>This is our society. Where is all this supposed societal power held by men? They hold power only in the workplace, but employment isn&#039;t society.

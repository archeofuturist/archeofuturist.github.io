Like this story about some guy who robbed a Cricket Wireless store and tied and groped the female employee. &quot;The man police are looking for is described as being in his 20s, about 5-11, with a goatee and wearing all black.&quot; I assume it&#039;s because &quot;too many&quot; of these guys are nonwhite and it &quot;looks bad&quot; or something along those lines. The problem is that a suspect description is less useful if the race is omitted. While I suppose they mean well, there is such a thing as too much political correctness and absurdity. It&#039;s a fact of life that the rate of dysfunction is higher in nonwhite people, and our media are constantly having to bend over backwards and contort themselves to try to make things look better.","filename":"silhouette","ext":".png","w":251,"h":201,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1492622703107,"time":1492622703,"md5":"k\/bDSda563IpVh45Mhv+4w==","fsize":1560,"resto":0,"id":"XPI9bNL2","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"when-crime-stories-leave-out-the-race-of-the","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":121868544,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)13:27:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121868282\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121868282<\/a><br>http:\/\/minnesota.cbslocal.com\/2016\/<wbr>01\/11\/police-looking-for-man-who-ro<wbr>bbed-cell-phone-store-groped-employ<wbr>ee\/","time":1492622861,"resto":121868282,"id":"XPI9bNL2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121857225,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:42:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"So you&#039;re telling me...<br>51% of Americans voted Hillary, but Drumpf<br>got in because THIS area was red and that one was blue?<br><br>NOT.

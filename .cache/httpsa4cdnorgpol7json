It&#039;s quite similar to an old slave mentality in that blacks are afraid of not doing what they are told. Just as example, during the high point of American slavery, plantation owners told there slaves that if they left the farm, they would be killed due to the creatures that roamed around the property or they would just fall dead once they run far enough away. The same shit happens today, Democrats using the naivete of blacks and exploiting them to their own ends. Only now, blacks are even less useful now than during that time! At least we would work for the benefit of the country and not to its detriment.

I have written a book called The Foundation for Exploration in my spare time (I&#039;m a full-time neet) and I would really appreciate it if you could give it a read.<br><br>-It is pol&#039;s book. It has some very serious and groundbreaking ideas regarding the origins of a lot of emotions that a typical pol user may go through. Wrath, depression, madness, and hedonism all stem from powerlessness. In order to alleviate this powerlessness, you need courage, self-control, wonder, and humor. You also need collective organization because there are deeply entrenched society-wide problems that one man cannot defeat. That is why we need a full-scale revolution of our society. I believe my book can be a cornerstone of a revolution because it has a strong philosophical basis. Pol can be a strong cornerstone of this revolution.<br>-I dive into sexual dynamics in pol-fashion. Men need to cultivate masculinity and not be cucks, yet not be overly animalistic and women must cultivate femininity and not be roastie whores (shouldn&#039;t pursue hedonism and the animalistic nature of man) I go into this in great detail and explain that strong families are the provider of great happiness and power, and they come from a balancing of the two spectrums I call the Power and Animalistic-Artificial Spectrums. <br>-The focus of the brave new society I create is to inspire wonder back into people, with a bringing back to nature and in the end a focus on exploring the cosmos. The economics calls for cooperation between people, superseding the focus on profits and rigid structure.<br><br>WE MUST START A REVOLUTION.<br>This is not an advertisement, the book is free.

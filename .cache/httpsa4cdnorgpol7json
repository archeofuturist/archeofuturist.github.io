One was clearly Dutch and the other British.<br><br>The dutch guy was telling the other guy about a fantastic sea cruise he just got done with and said cruises are the way to vacation. As this guy started getting his soup, the other guy turns to me and says, &quot;Cruises are really the best way to take a vacation. You should really consider it.&quot; Now I don&#039;t mind small talk at the soup bar but does this man really have the right to tell me how I should enjoy my vacation?

Many people automatically assume a densely populated city or the capital. However I don&#039;t think that&#039;s what will be hit. I believe it&#039;ll be our infrastructure. Nuclear plants, or Hoover dam. In my personal opinion(I&#039;m an electrical engineer, not a military strategist), I believe the Hoover dam or diablo canyon nuclear plant has the highest likelihood to be hit on the western seaboard. If either are taken out millions would not only die because of the blast but any government institutions powered by such plants would be crippled. If Hoover dam is hit, radiation will be spread through the rivers even faster than by the wind. That is to say, if they didn&#039;t decide to do a high altitude detonation, causing an emp. The most effective would be one on both seaboard.

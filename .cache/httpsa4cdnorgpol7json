The greatest war in human history had caused untold suffering but it had also quite literally blasted open human consciousness as a result of the destruction of old, outworn institutions, habits of living and crystallised thoughtforms that had held humanity in thrall to separatism and materialism, particularly since the time of the Industrial Revolution.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The agony of the war and the distress of the entire human family led the Christ, in 1945, to come to a great decision. He made the decision to emerge again into physical contact with humanity if human beings themselves would bring about the initial stages of establishing right human relations; and He gave to the world one of the oldest prayers ever known, but one which hitherto had not been permitted to be used except by the most exalted spiritual Beings. The Christ Himself used the Great Invocation for the first time in June 1945.&quot;<br><br>Excerpts from the &quot;Lucis Trust&quot; website, originally named &quot;Lucifer publishing&quot;..<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Dt6<wbr>1ZSduoR4 [Embed]","filename":"obama-handsign-satanic-salute-450x293","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":293,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":162,"tim":1490575969393,"time":1490575969,"md5":"49EW\/+K+2WEowjFCDozAOg==","fsize":39912,"resto":0,"id":"9eA1NzFR","country":"DO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"usa-gov-invoked-satan-to-celebrate-germanys","country_name":"Dominican Republic","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118445086,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:36:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"What&#039;s the most cucked country on the world and why it&#039;s Russia?","filename":"main-qimg-2b3893161123c88879c85ed3c73b9757-c - Copy","ext":".jpg","w":502,"h":341,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":169,"tim":1490574966371,"time":1490574966,"md5":"k+kuyHjN7ns+gpr\/+DoSGA==","fsize":9243,"resto":0,"id":"+BAZLHDC","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"whats-the-most-cucked-country-on-the-world-and","country_name":"Brazil","replies":13,"images":0,"omitted_posts":8,"omitted_images":0},{"no":118446447,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:47:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118445086\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118445086<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;against faggots<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ok with faith (atheists btfo)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;common goals above materialistic individualism<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2nd strongest military in the world<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muslim population under control<\/span><br><br>Cucked how?","time":1490575638,"resto":118445086,"id":"gD+a\/ZMc","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":118446695,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:49:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118446018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118446018<\/a><br>but Russian extreme homophobic seems also retarded.<br><br>Mocking or mememing fags are tolerable<br>but killing or mobbing?<br>yew<br><br>Why not get easy on faggots?","time":1490575760,"resto":118445086,"id":"PZjD8fK1","country":"KR","country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":118446763,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:49:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118446257\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118446257<\/a><br>Many such cases!","time":1490575799,"resto":118445086,"id":"lfWqgjpN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118446839,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:50:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118446395\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118446395<\/a><br>Speak english monkey","time":1490575835,"resto":118445086,"id":"+BAZLHDC","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":118447093,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:52:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118446395\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118446395<\/a><br><br>I like how you failed at speaking in portuguese.","time":1490575964,"resto":118445086,"id":"2Jp5rrcC","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118392070,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)14:09:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ask a Russian anything","filename":"14896059867890","ext":".gif","w":447,"h":510,"tn_w":219,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490551762383,"time":1490551762,"md5":"uRzuAGM1NM+Z2oLBS3IzwA==","fsize":132252,"resto":0,"id":"H6+66a7M","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ask-a-russian-anything","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":158,"images":15,"omitted_posts":153,"omitted_images":15,"tail_size":50},{"no":118444940,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:34:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118443920\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118443920<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What is the general feeling, if any, regarding Scotland?<\/span><br><br>My opinion on Scotland is based on books by Irvin Welsh","time":1490574894,"resto":118392070,"id":"yHCuhhlO","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":118445380,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:38:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118444940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118444940<\/a><br>He&#039;s basically 80% accurate.

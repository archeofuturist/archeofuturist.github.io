Politics (and what comes with it - government, etc.) have an impact on your life. When you discuss left vs right and authoritarian vs libertarian, you&#039;re talking about the use of force. You&#039;re enacting legislation, and laws have to be enforced by people with guns and the threat of violence (physically or civilly), fundamentally. If you don&#039;t pay your taxes, the taxman&#039;s going to TAKE the money, whether you like it or not. A tax levy or lien, criminal tax evasion charges, etc.<br><br>You ask, &quot;why should I care? I&#039;m just a man, I can&#039;t change the system - plus, I&#039;ll be dead and none of it will matter.&quot; Well, to say individuals have no effect on politics or society at large is untrue, I would argue. You&#039;re standing on the efforts of some of those individuals right now.<br><br> Do you ever plan to have kids? If so, I would say politics should definitely be of interest, because you yourself are standing on top of the remnants of the efforts of your ancestors - individual men. Perhaps acting together, but individuals all the same. They each had to make the choice to act. <br><br>Everything you have, all of your culture, traditions, the VAST amount of wealth in modern western society is owed to the efforts of dead men. They died, and their children carried on in their footsteps, one step or two steps forward at a time. The last veterans of WW1 died not too long ago. <br><br>Yes, someday you will die, but your children and society at large will carry on. If we assume that suffering is intrinsic to life, then any measures that can be made to reduce suffering and improve our livelihood are good. In the same way that our lives were made vastly better by our ancestors, I think we owe it to ourselves, our children, and hopefully the rest of humanity to act responsibly in caring for and improving this delicate and intricate thing we call society.<br><br>also if you want to know more watch jordan peterson","time":1490935255,"resto":119010249,"id":"XEFuywXc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119022323,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)00:56:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119014650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119014650<\/a><br>there would be a trace. there is a finite amount of mass in the universe and earth would simply be displaced.","time":1490936189,"resto":119010249,"id":"cAqred4j","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119022594,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)00:59:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"What kills me is that most in the world don&#039;t see that capitalism and western civilization were always going to lead to collapse. The socioeconomic myths that pervade our society about wealth and it&#039;s accumulation is mostly false. The stark reality is politics only matter for the status quo, and the status quo in America is little more than rampant ego massaging and consumerism. <br><br>No one should deny the accomplishments that have been made, but our world is changing very fast, a 250 year old system isn&#039;t going to work in governing nations with hundreds of millions of people. We&#039;re caught in a complexity trap of our own making, where &#039;economic growth&#039; is now synonymous with destroying the natural wealth that has allowed us to prosper in the first place. We have effectively been looting our own future for shiny consumerist toys and the newest versions of everything, despite knowing deep down it doesn&#039;t lead to happiness.<br><br>When a civilization and it&#039;s cultural view no longer match up with reality, those civilizations die. It has happened to every one before us, and it is happening to us right now. The only difference between us and past civilizations is we get to record our own demise in high definition.","time":1490936398,"resto":119010249,"id":"3kZLmQIE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119022728,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:01:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119022594\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119022594<\/a><br>Fiat currency, corporatism and Keynesian economics are what lead to collapse.","time":1490936486,"resto":119010249,"id":"v8fUv4G5","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119022750,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:01:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119010249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119010249<\/a><br>Because I don&#039;t want to be taken advantage of by parasites.","time":1490936504,"resto":119010249,"id":"pb6o8z0V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118997250,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:06:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why do Republicans suddenly hate internet privacy now?

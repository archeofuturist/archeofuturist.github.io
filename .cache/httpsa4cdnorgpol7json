It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"9C72897F-90F5-4EBB-9789-330F4EFDB1B3","ext":".jpg","w":3538,"h":3340,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":236,"tim":1490171396346,"time":1490171396,"md5":"eWo72v7N8hsxi\/9DPZIriQ==","fsize":3123002,"resto":0,"id":"YaCPwdHH","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":8,"images":0,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":0},{"no":117739550,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:42:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117739010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117739010<\/a><br><br>It should probably be noted that almost every single major figure in the atheist movement is Jewish.

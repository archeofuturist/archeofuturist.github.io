Every major conspiracy theory has at least gotten some focus. So I decided, just this past Monday, 4\/10, that I would look at the &quot;stupidest&quot; red-pill I could find, and naturally it wasn&#039;t even a question...there was no second option....I decided to research the flat earth theory.<br><br>Just like all of you, I have seen snippets of this madness but I deemed it too ludicrous to consider. I may have even been able to flip a coin on the actuality of the moon landing, but even with that doubt, I never considered that the earth was flat and that we were being lied to . Hell, what would the purpose be for the lie.<br><br>I am a Bible-believing Christian, which is even more absurd that I would hold so fast to the heliocentric model when the scripture is full of one-sided flat earthedness.<br><br>I fully believe that people who believe they see aliens or that have been abducted are really dealing with fallen angels and demons and STILL I laughed at the possibility of the flat earth. But don&#039;t you see, the enemy HAD to make us believe in a limitless universe if they were going to extend the lie and &quot;return as our alien father&#039;s that seeded the earth with out evolutionary ancestors.&quot; How could beings from another planet be our gods if there were no planets, only different stars and celestial bodies of the same design.<br><br>My life has changed this week. And all glory belongs to the Father and to our Lord Yeshua ha Mashiach. I beg you all to look with open eyes and open hearts to this ridiculous notion. One thing this pill has shown me is that time is much shorter than I thought. When independent men start to learn and present the truth of our home, the enemy will have no choice but to speed up their end game.","filename":"Map Sun Moon flat earth","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492231129112,"time":1492231129,"md5":"\/jHCcRk\/fRn7FNSZFHDzRQ==","fsize":49208,"resto":0,"id":"ib13XXrZ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"in-5-days-i-went-from-scorn-to-reborn","country_name":"United States","replies":19,"images":4,"omitted_posts":14,"omitted_images":1},{"no":121174629,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:24:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;autism is such a cruel condition.<\/span>","time":1492233883,"resto":121170474,"id":"TjNpB48M","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121175046,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:29:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121172777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121172777<\/a><br>7&#039;s of truth","time":1492234179,"resto":121170474,"id":"Mb2fqoCh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121175380,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:33:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121170474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121170474<\/a><br>It&#039;s funny you should mention this. In my differential geometry class we went over stereographic projection. I thought &quot;Couldn&#039;t that imply the earth is really a flat surface and we have just been travelling in circles on a plane?&quot; I thought it was silly. But then I heard how Gauss, when he tried to prove that space was curved, considered a giant triangle whose vertices were the world&#039;s largest mountaintops and measured the angles to see if he could get something strange. I forgot what his result was. But Poincare said that it is impossible to prove whether or not space is curved. At bottom we just accept whatever notion of space we can think of as convention.<br><br>Why do things far away appear small, and why do small things at a close distance appear far away? Is our perception of space the same as space itself. I don&#039;t know.<br><br>On a side note. I&#039;ve heard for ages that the earth travels around the sun. While this is true, it is also equivalently true that the sun travels around the earth (since motion is relative).

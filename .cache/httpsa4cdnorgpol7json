This will greatly decrease the viability of the future population of the United States. With the disgusting fat-acceptance movement actively trying to discourage healthy behaviors in American women and the morally corrupt modern Feminist movement attempting to dismantle positive family values throughout society, American men must look outside of their native country to find healthy mates that will raise their shared children with traditional values and consider the forced deportation of degenerate women from the United States.<br> Currently, almost 40% of women in the United States are obese and about 65% of women in the United States are either obese or overweight (Ogden et al., 2014). This rising statistic is a grave signifier for the health of the American population, as obesity results in numerous health complications, such as heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure, diabetes, and gout.

The latter option is far preferred from an evolutionary perspective. Not only will the health of future offspring be improved through the use of this option, happiness for both parents and children will be increased and hybrid vigor may result from this exogamy.<br> Now, American men must look towards other countries to produce potential mates for them.

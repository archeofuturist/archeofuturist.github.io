Heather Robertson, 38, is accused of having an improper relationship with four teen boys, two of whom she allegedly had sex with at the same time in her home.

Robertson could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The boys said that when they arrived to the apartment, Robertson was lying on the couch vaping, according to the warrant. After speaking with the boys for a few minutes, Robertson told them to follow her to her bedroom, where she began taking off her clothes before having sex with both students at the same time, according to the warrant.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She told police she did not \u201crequire\u201d the boys to use a condom because she was no longer able to have children, the warrant stated.

You could pick and choose times where it would seem religion is bad overall but those costs outweigh the gains of banning religion.","time":1493137508,"resto":122746281,"id":"0BSOTGV\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122746048,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)11:34:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hi there.<br><br>Why are people saying Gen Z is conservative?<br>I am apart of Gen Z and I do admit my peers are mostly right-winged (although lefties do exist in the mix).<br><br>But I&#039;m wondering why we&#039;re right-winged when the generation only a few years before us (if even a few years) are cucked lefties?<br><br>We&#039;re the latest adult generation and we&#039;re right-winged.

That&#039;s a fancy way to say they&#039;re opposite ideologies designed to clash, like Yin and Yang.<br><br>NatSoc was fundamentally an ideology built around race, while Marxist socialism was entirely different: built around class. Hitler aimed to unite the right and left, including workers and their bosses, into a new German nation based on racial identity. Socialism, in contrast, was a class war between workers, bosses, and owners (Capitalists), aiming to build a workers state in which race and gender were insignificant. Socialists, especially Marxist socialists, were anti-religious atheists, whereas NatSoc went so far as to make Christianity the religion of the state.<br><br>The differences go on and on: Marxist socialism was internationalist, NatSoc was nationalist. Marxist socialism was egalitarian, whereas NatSoc believed that nature was unequal and required competition. Marxist socialism wanted to nationalize all private industry, while NatSoc privatized every major industry except the railroads (it considered these a military asset. In fact, Hitler once joked &quot;they didn&#039;t need to nationalize property because they nationalized people&quot;. NatSoc drew on a range of pan-German theories, which wanted to blend Aryan workers and Aryan magnates into a super Aryan state, which would involve the eradication of class-focused socialism as a non-German ideology.","filename":"1491056467394","ext":".jpg","w":772,"h":1035,"tn_w":186,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492518433962,"time":1492518433,"md5":"IYch1pHrFv30wyJzRlXZVQ==","fsize":456449,"resto":0,"id":"HN5DpAsF","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"marxist-left-socialism-and-national-right","country_name":"Australia","replies":5,"images":2},{"no":121678977,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:29:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121678781\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121678781<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[your opinions]<\/span><br>TOP LEL :^)","time":1492518560,"resto":121678781,"id":"TrGeqLrY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121679382,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:34:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121678781\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121678781<\/a><br>This is also important.","filename":"What is National Socialism","ext":".png","w":1583,"h":5995,"tn_w":33,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492518846963,"time":1492518846,"md5":"JbJbcfbXh79hUKVvi1HE0w==","fsize":471689,"resto":121678781,"id":"DkGO\/lVy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121679430,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:34:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121679382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121679382<\/a><br>And another.","filename":"What is Fascism","ext":".png","w":886,"h":1322,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492518879319,"time":1492518879,"md5":"Qyq+PpdyKiQn2nIwJQwr2Q==","fsize":127582,"resto":121678781,"id":"DkGO\/lVy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121680391,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:45:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121678781\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121678781<\/a><br>communism = working class hegemony<br>fascism = bureaucrat class hegemony<br>liberalism = bourgeoisie class hegemony","time":1492519544,"resto":121678781,"id":"cIOlC2wz","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121680997,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:52:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121679382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121679382<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mother Nature is a NAZI<\/span><br><br>I can smell the synthetic trenchcoat from here","time":1492519926,"resto":121678781,"id":"r7GqdJCi","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121668650,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)06:40:16","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Holocaust Denial Status: DENIED","com":"Will this shred any legitimacy holocaust denial may have had?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Opening of UN files on Holocaust will &#039;rewrite chapters of history&#039;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;<\/span><br>Archive used in prosecution of Nazis reveals detailed evidence of death camps and genocide previously unseen by public<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;War crimes files revealing early evidence of Holocaust death camps that was smuggled out of eastern Europe are among tens of thousands of files to be made public for the first time this week.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The once-inaccessible archive of the UN war crimes commission, dating back to 1943, is being opened by the Wiener Library in London with a catalogue that can be searched online.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/law\/201<wbr>7\/apr\/18\/opening-un-holocaust-files<wbr>-archive-war-crimes-commission","filename":"3500","ext":".jpg","w":1240,"h":827,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492512016238,"time":1492512016,"md5":"8pogDngGPfHg2eR8nTl8cg==","fsize":69803,"resto":0,"id":"DAdm1B1F","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"holocaust-denial-status-denied","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":180,"images":38,"omitted_posts":175,"omitted_images":37,"tail_size":50},{"no":121680181,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:43:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121679720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121679720<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jews ever doing anything for free<\/span>","time":1492519401,"resto":121668650,"id":"NyOV8vjx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121680357,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:45:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"how conveniant they just happen to have more evidence around they didnt bother showing the people before hand. im sure it wasnt just fabricated recently to support the narrative","filename":"Hitler brain","ext":".jpg","w":859,"h":1196,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492519518364,"time":1492519518,"md5":"A9vCJDYGbUSy96sJ8PRBlQ==","fsize":208515,"resto":121668650,"id":"lcJfvY\/i","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121680363,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:45:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121669059\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121669059<\/a><br>What are you denying the six million?

They discredit any and all proof he gives, saying that he forged it, and that he&#039;s lying through his teeth. It&#039;s despicable, seeing as how they claim to hold the moral high-ground, but when they are shown proof to counter their claims, they try and throw it out the window as false information because &quot;it was from Donald Trump and his Administration, so it CAN&#039;T be real!&quot;<br><br>Additionally, why do you think they don&#039;t like Neil Gorsuch&#039;s take on the Constitution of the United States?

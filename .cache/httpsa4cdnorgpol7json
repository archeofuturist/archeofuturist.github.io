Also, reminder that it was official policy in the Russian empire to remove kebab:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;While total expulsion as in other Christian nations such as Spain, Portugal and Sicily was not feasible to achieve a homogenous Russian Orthodox population, other policies such as land grants and the promotion of migration by other Russian and non-Muslim populations into Muslim lands displaced many Muslims making them minorities in places such as some parts of the South Ural region to other parts such as the Ottoman Turkey, and almost annihilating the Circassians, Crimean Tatars, and various Muslims of the Caucasus. The Russian army rounded up people, driving Muslims from their villages to ports on the Black Sea, where they awaited ships provided by the neighboring Ottoman Empire. The explicit Russian goal was to expel the groups in question from their lands.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Perse<wbr>cution_of_Muslims#Russia","filename":"Franz Roubaud (1856-1928) Cossacks near a mountain river - 1892","ext":".jpg","w":1962,"h":1385,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":88,"tim":1491366849257,"time":1491366849,"md5":"13xIF+mv+2smw8GE6R4h+Q==","fsize":2278398,"resto":119557626,"id":"XxRhI\/RE","country":"RU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119567339,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)00:35:44","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Ivan Constantinovich Aivazovsky (1817-1900) Russian Black Sea Fleet on a Parade Review in 1849","ext":".jpg","w":2600,"h":1484,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1491366944122,"time":1491366944,"md5":"w\/zMCGN1VSsGBwhO62yXbQ==","fsize":3143960,"resto":119557626,"id":"XxRhI\/RE","country":"RU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119567359,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)00:35:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119567166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119567166<\/a><br>White people just need to get our birth rates up so we can start conquering again.","time":1491366958,"resto":119557626,"id":"JDw8mJNX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119567351,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)00:35:51","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Shia BTFO!!","com":"http:\/\/archive.is\/69GYp<br><br><br>I guess he should have been out promoting his film instead of guarding a flag in the middle of nowhere","filename":"2018","ext":".jpg","w":732,"h":768,"tn_w":238,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491366951949,"time":1491366951,"md5":"\/067VdQRbWTfxzOCzM9Zaw==","fsize":114415,"resto":0,"id":"dSNgQp5u","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"shia-btfo","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":119525029,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)18:16:17","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Rice General","com":"Susan Rice needs to stay at the top of the catalog and our efforts need to be applied toward spreading the outrage to more people.

We need make Susan Rice General threads to inform and update, need to make jokes outlining the media&#039;s lies and need to make Rice meme creation threads to make something digest-able for normies. This is the biggest political scandal in a decade and CNN is effectively telling the people it&#039;s nuffin by ignoring it.

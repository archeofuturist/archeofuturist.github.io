NEWSFLASH: YOU ARE NOT THAI OR CHINESE SO DON\u2019T THINK YOU\u2019RE ENTITLED TO EAT THAT SAUCE. then i saw boxes of moroccan couscous. so america thinks muslims are \u201cterrorists\u201d and backwards yet they have no problem stuffing their faces with our food. it triggered me greatly since it pulled me back to the time when my friends and i went to eat at a greek restaurant which served hummus. I\u2019M SORRY, YOU EXPELLED ALL YOUR MUSLIMS IN THE 1920\u2019s, HOW DARE YOU TAKE OUR TRADITIONAL FOOD AS YOUR OWN?? muslims esp. non-binary queer muslims like myself are the most persecuted people on earth. there isn\u2019t a single muslim country that isn\u2019t colonized by the west in some form. why do white people think they are entitled to colonize us even more by assimilating OUR food and traditions into their white-dominated culture? but then i went to the end of the isle and saw the worst. this was only after i passed all the cans of \u201clatino beans\u201d and taquitos. on the shelf was nigerian yam flour which advertised itself as \u201ctraditional\u201d. so now white hipsters think nigerians are exotic enough to steal food from to?? i couldn\u2019t stand being there anymore so i left and went straight to the fruits and vegetables. that was even worse. the papayas were all labeled \u201cmexican\u201d or \u201cguatemalan\u201d or \u201ccarribean\u201d giving white people a choice of which culture to appropriate from.","time":1490912779,"resto":118964916,"id":"MKRZ5rlI","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118979847,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)18:37:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump for fun thread","time":1490913463,"resto":118964916,"id":"MKRZ5rlI","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118976292,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)18:10:51","name":"Anonymous","sub":"But why?","filename":"232312","ext":".jpg","w":1130,"h":924,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":204,"tim":1490911851718,"time":1490911851,"md5":"QfNC3toe6FJXn9cF2iBeKg==","fsize":287140,"resto":0,"id":"TfRyKf9m","country":"RO","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"but-why","country_name":"Romania","replies":14,"images":5,"omitted_posts":9,"omitted_images":4},{"no":118978621,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)18:28:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118976292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118976292<\/a><br>It&#039;s time to come back home brother.

Upon him rests the hopes of an entire generation, an entire civilisation. You can already tell that he&#039;s a creature built from the same mould as the Alexanders, the Napoleons, and the Caesars of history, and under his banner you walk, hand-in-hand with comrades - the finest men you&#039;ve ever known - who share your innermost convictions, and of whom you&#039;re proud to call yourself a friend.<br><br>Things are moving so fast. The people, the media, and the government are quickly waking up to stupefying fact of your assent.

People left and right constantly claim that &quot;Christianity was just as violent once, too&quot; and that &quot;Islam just needs to calm down like the Christians did&quot;. No. You people have a completely asinine view of how religion works and why these problems arose. The Crusades and Inquisition WEREN&#039;T CHRISTIAN. The papacy was a corrupt and immoral institution due to the unification of church and state, and they actually had to BAN the Bible in order to prevent anyone from recognizing how absolutely bullshit their doctrine of control was. But hey, let&#039;s build on that. You know why the Crusades started? BECAUSE ISLAM HAD BEEN PILLAGING, RAPING, BEHEADING, AND BURNING CHURCHES FOR THE 400 YEARS IT HAD EXISTED. And that&#039;s continued for the 1000 years since the Crusades as well. Just look at the Ottomans. Islam will never &quot;calm down like the Christians&quot; or adhere to Western morality, which thankfully has rooted itself in Christianity until recent. The Quran and Hadith have HUNDREDS of verses commanding and assuring the actions of ISIS and everyone who&#039;s done the same for the past 1400 years. They even have theological argument to verify that suicide bombing is forgiven. Wake up. Christianity didn&#039;t &#039;go warmongering&#039; and then relax. Read the Bible. &#039;Christianity&#039; as an actual worldview has always been about love, spirituality, and forgiveness.","time":1490846221,"resto":118875933,"id":"2DNsVjig","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118882035,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:23:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118879141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118879141<\/a><br>#notallchristians","time":1490847831,"resto":118875933,"id":"xUosPsLH","country":"IN","country_name":"India"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118865322,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)21:48:12","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Why do spics think they have rights","com":"&quot;#deportthisdumbbitch&quot;<br><br>https :\/\/www facebook com\/BelenDREAMS?fref=hovercard","filename":"123446898322","ext":".png","w":1237,"h":660,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":133,"tim":1490838492363,"time":1490838492,"md5":"4rlnpwvRFqvBz9EGVhcbKA==","fsize":1451475,"resto":0,"id":"hbcniEH2","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-do-spics-think-they-have-rights","country_name":"United States","replies":85,"images":7,"omitted_posts":80,"omitted_images":6},{"no":118879516,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:00:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118865322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118865322<\/a><br>This bitch is still in the US?

The slaves from the American slave trade were already slaves in western Africa, and the vast majority were bartered between European\/American slavers and African slavers. This is just my opinion but it would be better to be a slave in America then a slave in Africa, especially considering eventually they were freed. <br><br>2. Currently in Africa there are more slaves then there ever was in America. So theoretically if we were to pay reparations for the slavery that maybe 5% of The American population Took advantage of well over 150 years ago. Then by that logic Black Americans should have to pay a reparation tax to be given to more humanitarian effort especially to the African countries with the most slaves. In fact ( if we are going to generalize and reprimand an entire race for the actions of a few ) there is more logical undeniable evidence that black Americans should be paying a higher tax because of the slavery going on in Africa today and since it&#039;s inception.<br><br>3. You also seem not to realize that there were plenty of blacks slavers in America. In fact the earliest documentation of slavery is a civil dispute between a black slaver named Anthony Johnson and a white slaver named Robert Parker. One of Mr. Johnson&#039;s slaves escaped and ran to Mr. Parker&#039;s land begging for protection and safe haven, he must have been moved or somewhat affected by what the slave told him because he took Mr. Johnson to court for the ownership of that slave.","filename":"IMG_1247","ext":".jpg","w":225,"h":225,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490848184821,"time":1490848184,"md5":"OPk3jhqDFIhzxe9NvjSNxg==","fsize":29410,"resto":118864288,"id":"jxkM8JBN","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118878291,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)23:49:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"People who hate the military are insufferable.","filename":"University professor","ext":".jpg","w":474,"h":559,"tn_w":211,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490845757373,"time":1490845757,"md5":"09SGStF\/iqmWyOTpbwW+yw==","fsize":51676,"resto":0,"id":"cG2XFjwD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"people-who-hate-the-military-are-insufferable","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":2},{"no":118880017,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:04:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118878291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118878291<\/a><br><br>I have mixed feelings about the military, the way they behave is based as fuck and they are brave enough to deal with a lot of shit and defend our land, but in the end they&#039;re just cucked by ((them))","filename":"pepe sad","ext":".png","w":571,"h":448,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":98,"tim":1490846696112,"time":1490846696,"md5":"xN6gyR\/+nwVtXUTOmIkn6Q==","fsize":19254,"resto":118878291,"id":"3RBh5QEj","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":118880784,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:11:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118880017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118880017<\/a><br>The military and college fraternities are pretty much the last bastions of social cohesion for white men in the US","time":1490847116,"resto":118878291,"id":"g0zCfZUA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118881824,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:21:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118878291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118878291<\/a><br>I respect those who serve, but its budget is 10 times larger than it needs to be","filename":"1489090421949","ext":".jpg","w":541,"h":554,"tn_w":122,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490847696067,"time":1490847696,"md5":"WZrgcb0miyHXEYEu1xaHxw==","fsize":47331,"resto":118878291,"id":"QItCS9W8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118870618,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)22:37:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"Objectively, what is the best state and why is it Indiana?","filename":"in","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":312,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":130,"tim":1490841464200,"time":1490841464,"md5":"lLBS9YkY9311411W6btjpw==","fsize":43143,"resto":0,"id":"M2eEEPn4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"objectively-what-is-the-best-state-and-why-is-it","country_name":"United States","replies":27,"images":6,"omitted_posts":22,"omitted_images":5},{"no":118878225,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)23:48:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118871628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118871628<\/a><br>Try living on the East side, holy hell I was glad to leave once the lease was up.<br><br>But yeah other than crime in the high-black areas and general boring topography of the northern\/central part of the state, Hoosier state is based.

For some people it&#039;s as easy as hopping on a train or bus. But for too many Americans, a lack of investment in public transportation means getting to work takes hours longer than it should \u2013 or simply isn&#039;t possible at all. <br><br>Horrifyingly, experts are now worried that public transportation will be next on President Trump&#039;s terrifying budget chopping block. That will only make it harder for people around the country to access good jobs and schools. It will also hurt our environment by forcing more people to turn to cars in order to get around.<br><br>Funds are at risk not just for our trains and bus systems, but also for innovative bike share programs, sidewalk upgrades, and more. <br><br>Lack of public transportation means even more people will be forced to either pay housing higher prices to live close to work, spend thousands of dollars on cars that burn dirty fossil fuels, or turn down good jobs or educational opportunities because they are simply unable to physically reach them. That especially hurts low income Americans, who often find it impossible to pull themselves out of poverty without access to public transportation. <br><br>And it&#039;s not just people who live in cities or regularly use public transportation who will be hurt. Right now, every person who takes a train instead of a car to work creates less carbon dioxide in our atmosphere. They also put one less car on the streets, clogging up our highways. That doesn&#039;t just help the person taking the train \u2013 it also helps everyone else who needs to drive and now doesn&#039;t have to sit in traffic or breathe in smog quite as long. <br><br>Call on President Trump to stop these devastating cuts and commit to investing more in public transportation throughout the US!","filename":"932556-1489779415-wide","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490888067328,"time":1490888067,"md5":"C0S1imEOMfD3\/J7Xy+tqPQ==","fsize":42006,"resto":0,"id":"D2ulHi32","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"have-you-ever-tried-getting-to-work-or-school","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0},{"no":118932079,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)11:37:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"I think public transport is a good thing.

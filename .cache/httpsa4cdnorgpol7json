It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491726597573,"time":1491726597,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"muo4pbf\/","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":5,"images":2},{"no":120259346,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:30:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120259278\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120259278<\/a><br>Stop making these threads with shitty edits","time":1491726649,"resto":120259278,"id":"sm8WzNtd","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120259352,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:30:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Atheism is not a religion, Janusz.","time":1491726654,"resto":120259278,"id":"RDKtbPBh","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120259687,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:35:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120259278\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120259278<\/a><br>I wonder why.<br><br>sage","filename":"WorldPopulationAnimation","ext":".webm","w":1000,"h":471,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":58,"tim":1491726922060,"time":1491726922,"md5":"1+w9LNX9Ij1mBDbtkh\/j9A==","fsize":1246560,"resto":120259278,"id":"A9JQERi9","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120259732,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:36:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120259352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120259352<\/a><br>Saidd a devout atheist.","filename":"1491602159710","ext":".png","w":784,"h":892,"tn_w":109,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491726962249,"time":1491726962,"md5":"Q4MPAkjH+r1dxaqyT42v4g==","fsize":626262,"resto":120259278,"id":"muo4pbf\/","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120259924,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:38:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120259732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120259732<\/a><br>Good propaganda is based on truth not shitty edits.","time":1491727102,"resto":120259278,"id":"A9JQERi9","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120256806,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)03:55:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"This week, Basque Terrorist Group, seeking independant region in northern Spain, annouced they were handing over their arms and arsenals to Spanish and French authorities. <br><br>Founded in the late 50&#039;s, ETA has killed or assasinated over 858 people, from politicians to military, police, but also women and children, using car bombs or a simple shot in the neck in public spaces.

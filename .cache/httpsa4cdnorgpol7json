Israel! Somehow ISIS managed to pop up on both sides of Israel in Syria and Sinai simultaneously, and they haven&#039;t laid a finder on Israel to date, odd for jihadists! Perhaps it has something to do with the well documented treatment of Syrian jihadist rebels in Israeli hospitals, the Israeli bombing of Assad&#039;s positions (also omitted from this video), and the Israeli annexation of the Syrian Golan heights?<br>Turkey&#039;s role in bombing the Kurds in Turkey is horrifically brushed over, just look at how that&#039;s worded! Turkey, an aspiring EU member and current Nato member and American ally, is bombing its own citizens! Gassing his own kurds is literally the single worst thing Saddam Hussein did, and that was grounds for a massive war, but Turkey gets a free pass! Turkey&#039;s direct funding of ISIS through massive oil purchases was also omitted. Turkey feverishly denied this until the Russians released hours of aerial footage of these ISIS oil convoys travelling into Turkey, the convoys are so massive! Have a look for yourself.","filename":"a78d00e3515b8c46724d1b5eb21d19049c7059256fd231b1aacdbaf66721d592","ext":".jpg","w":685,"h":668,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1491696463852,"time":1491696463,"md5":"AHIWSzbsIoodpN\/BAFbZHg==","fsize":72959,"resto":120204298,"id":"8xZ7bTsh","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120205947,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)20:10:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"At about 5:15 this video falsely claims that Russia&#039;s stated goal was to bomb ISIS but instead bombed rebels.

Literally not even the first time they tried this exact trick on the drooling masses. The 2013 attack was found by a UN investigation to have almost certainly been committed by jihadist rebels, this didn&#039;t recieve very much American coverage though, hmmm\u2026 I wonder why? It doesn&#039;t even make sense this time, why would Assad, at the tail end of a log and hard-fought war that is finally turning in his favour, just as the US president states that they&#039;re no longer seeking his removal, decide to commit such a heinous and grizzly crime against his own people? Not even combatants mind you, but just random women and children of his own country! This is strategically suicidal and you would have to believe him to be a cartoon character to think he would do such a ridiculous and horrible thing intentionally, gaining absolutely nothing and losing any diplomatic advantage he&#039;d previously had, for the satisfaction of a random murder?

This is an obvious false flag. America loves to go to war in aggression, and to help Israel expand, but it always has to be framed as a defensive manoeuvre. From the spanish-american war (the maine) to the vietnam war (tonkin) to the first iraq war (incubators) and second iraq war (WMD), the Americans always need to portray to the proles at home that they&#039;re heroically fighting against cartoonish sadistic evil baddies. If this had anything to do with crimes against humanity, America would be having a word with its gay-hanging, child-beheading woman-oppressing, clitorus-chopping, own-citizen-bombing, armenian genocide-denying friends and allies.

Washington is gearing up to launch an offensive on the Islamic State&#039;s stronghold in Raqqa, a mission that could get sidetracked if Russian aircraft fly over the area. U.S. aircraft would have to take steps to avoid them, whether by changing course or aborting the mission. At worst, the Russians could also drop bombs near U.S. targets, forcing Washington to respond by shooting down Russian aircraft -- triggering a much larger flare-up between the two powers. Moscow could try to escalate conflicts elsewhere as well, including in eastern Ukraine, to try to improve its bargaining position with Washington. But this tactic may also run the risk of further souring the prospects of negotiation.<\/span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Of course, the Trump administration&#039;s quick and decisive action in Syria was also designed to send a message to observers beyond the Middle East.

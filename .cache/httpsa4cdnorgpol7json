is that NK does not have a central bank that is controlled by the Bauer-Rothschild creatures. Guess what other country is always on the receiving end of criticism that does not have a Bauer-Rothschild central bank? If you said &quot;Iran&quot;, kudos to you, you have been studying diligently. If NKs&#039; &quot;nukes&quot; are the ptoblem, what about the country in the Middle East that is an undeclared nuke weapon power is also NOT a signatory(signer) of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty? here&#039;s a hint: it starts with the letter &quot;I&quot;, and it&#039;s not Iraq or Iran. Oh and that country is funded by the Bauer-Rothschilds. Is a recurring theme becoming apparent? Keep in mind that these Bauer-Rothschild\/Masonic\/Talmudic\/K<wbr>hazars desire to present the worlds&#039; population to their false &quot;lightbringer&quot;(their Talmud messiah)in financial and physical shackles. Yeshua, Jesus has already defeated them at Calvary though... How&#039;s that for a redpill?

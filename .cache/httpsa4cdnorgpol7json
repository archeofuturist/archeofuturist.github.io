Turning your intelligence directly toward understanding those states on an intuitive level makes your mental shortcuts work much, much better. It&#039;s the difference between a five year old acting on instinct, and a self-aware adult seeing a situation, allowing his full creative faculties to understand what his senses are telling him, and acting accordingly. Is your mental awareness at the level of a five year old? If you haven&#039;t seriously asked yourself this question, it almost certainly is, no matter what your intuitive notion of your own level of self-awareness might be.","filename":"colors","ext":".png","w":1102,"h":788,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":178,"tim":1492354686796,"time":1492354686,"md5":"5WaU9RJA8OOZGFD6sooYcQ==","fsize":2370056,"resto":0,"id":"SOOds3do","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-arent-you-a-buddhist-yet","country_name":"United States","replies":95,"images":14,"omitted_posts":90,"omitted_images":13},{"no":121402698,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)15:43:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121399793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121399793<\/a><br>Even in Buddhism the Buddha can become a subject of idolization.

There are cultural pressures that limit what choices you are able to make. Equality by law isn&#039;t enough to give equal opportunities for the genders. As a male, you are oppressed too, which can help you understand: why don&#039;t you wear dresses in the town, when it&#039;s legal? You probably don&#039;t want to, but imagine you wanted. You&#039;d still feel the pressure that it isn&#039;t culturally allowed, and you&#039;d need great social capital to be able to do it. Women experience many such cultural pressures that limit what choices they can make in the real world. For equal opportunity, these cultural pressures also need to end. <br>Secondly, people need to recognize that men and women are inherently different. Men and women have different wants, and a society that rewards male wants more than female wants is uneven. Even if you give women all the same opportunities as men, their reward will be smaller because only what makes men happy will be rewarded, so a woman will be less happy pursuing what&#039;s valued. To give a parallel, imagine if the state was unwilling to treat testicular cancer, while throwing money at ovarian cancer. Sure, you could say that men with ovarian get treated too, but it&#039;d obviously still be sexist, even if the law made no distinction for treatment according to gender.

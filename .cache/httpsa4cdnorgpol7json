Wherever leftism is in a position of power<\/span><br> it tends to invade every private corner and force every thought into a <br>leftist mold. In part this is because of the quasi-religious character of leftism: everything contrary to leftist beliefs represents Sin. More importantly, leftism<br>is a totalitarian force because of the leftists\u2019 drive for power. The leftist seeks <br>to satisfy his need for power through identification with a social movement <br>and he tries to go through the power process by helping to pursue and attain <br>the goals of the movement<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Some people are so highly socialized that the attempt to think, feel and<\/span><br>act morally imposes a severe burden on them. In order to avoid feelings <br>of guilt, they continually have to deceive themselves about their own <br>motives and find moral explanations for feelings and actions that in reality <br>have a nonmoral origin. We use the term \u201coversocialized\u201d to describe such people.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Feelings of inferiority are characteristic of modern leftism as a whole, <\/span><br>while oversocialization is characteristic only of a certain segment of modern leftism; but this segment is highly influential.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Oversocialization can lead to low self-esteem, a<\/span><br>sense of powerlessness, defeatism, guilt, etc. One of the<br>most important means by which our society socializes<br>children is by making them feel ashamed of behavior or<br>speech that is contrary to society\u2019s expectations. If this is<br>overdone, or if a particular child is especially susceptible<br>to such feelings, he ends by feeling ashamed of HIMSELF.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Leftists tend to hate anything that has an image<\/span><br>of being strong, good and successful.

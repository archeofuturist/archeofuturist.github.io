America directly arms, funds, and trains specific rebel groups that film themselves beheading children in the street, this is no exaggeration.

It sounded batshit crazy but there&#039;s a lot of truth to it. They are creating an interlinked hivemind with all of the people on the planet, using radio waves similar to wifi. It&#039;s been known since the beginning of the 20th century that radio waves can alter and manipulate consciousness, and with advanced technology can even link minds together in a kind of &quot;internet of brains&quot;. The elites are in contact with aliens and that is where a lot of this technology is coming from, and is the reason why we have seen such a massive acceleration in technological progress in the last century. I&#039;m not sure what exactly the links to CERN are but it&#039;s clear how HAARP could play a large role in this. The endgame is a Borg-like collection of interconnected minds with no individual or independent thought.

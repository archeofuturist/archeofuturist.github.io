This is why for the time being im not opposed to fission and fusion working together, so long as fission eventually gets replaced by fusion.<br>2.

In most of China, most married men only have one wife, only a minority have several rights, but the first woman he married is the Proper Wife, he can&#039;t pick another woman to to replace the status the first wife has. The first son that man is also the proper heir, he can&#039;t pick and choose no matter how man children he has.<br><br>The Emperor of China has never been a party to such restrictions, he can have many wives and many concubines and he can pick as the next Emperor any among them, this is rarely done by talent but rather, whose mother was his favourite at the time, and this he can change upon death bed. This created a LOT of chaos and a Deadly Decadent Court, women were out to kill each other to be the favourite - because if their son wasn&#039;t the next Emperor, they could be chosen to be entombed with him alive (or burnt), or the mother of the next Emperor could have them all killed, tortured to death in horrible ways - look up the fate of &quot;Lady Qi&quot;, who was made into a &#039;human pig&#039; by Empress Dowager Lu, this followed Lu&#039;s murder of Qi&#039;s fourteen year old son, in spite of Lu&#039;s Emperor son&#039;s attempt to protect his half brother. Emperor Gaozu, whose favour Lu and Qi had fought for, was horrible as well, while on the run from his enemies earlier in life, he kept trying to lighten the load by abandoning the two children he had with Lu - he carries no bonds of love as a father and husband because he had so many wives and so many children.<br>http:\/\/www.chinaknowledge.de\/Histor<wbr>y\/Han\/personslvhou.html","time":1490160873,"resto":117723276,"id":"F6WXQaRM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117700769,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)21:32:35","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Crybabies on the NASA subreddit blast trump for allocating funds to explore space\/mars.","com":"Reddit is terrible.

Told me how sometimes helicopters couldn&#039;t land so they&#039;d literally get thrown out the chopper. Sure they tried to aim for rice paddies and mud but still fucked up his legs. Came back home with a limp and his legs never developed the way his upper body did. Also accidenlt got burned by agent Orange which in turn led to his descendants having bad skin and some cleft lip. I once asked him if he ever talked to a Vietcong and told me yes. One particularly funny story is when it was night and he was on guard duty and some slick Charlie came up crawling and asked &quot;you American gi?&quot; And my old man replied &quot;yes. Get the fuck away if I find you I&#039;m killing you&quot; and Charlie replied &quot;America GI good. I scared I forced&quot; anyways when he came back through the bay area he was greeted by white liberal college fuck hippies calling him a spic baby killer. Mind you our Spanish ancestors been in Texas since the 1700s and our Indian ancestors far longer. Worst part is it took the military 30+ years to pay him compensation since he was disabled since he came back. Also had ptsd and could&#039;ve taken the agent Orange shit to court but nah too time consuming plus he has Alzheimer&#039;s. Vietnam war fucking sucked.

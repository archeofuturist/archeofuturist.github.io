We don&#039;t want to get involved in Syria, and not only that, but it is almost certain that Assad had nothing to do with this strike. We have had 5 gas attacks in the past in Syria, with 4 of them being proven to be done by the rebels or other terrorist organizations and one where it is uncertain who launched it, even though globalist liberals and neocons would claim that this one instance was Assad. Further more, why would Assad even do this in the first place? If you hold no biased opinions and only look at this from an objective stand point, you will see that this is the most idiotic strategy to ever employ. It would turn all the citizens of Syeria against him, the threat of war from outside forces if he does this is way to high, and he was winning the war against the rebels. Now either this is globalist propaganda in order to finally get in there and have a regime change in order to make Syria a failed state like so many others before, or Assad is the most idiotic military strategist in history.

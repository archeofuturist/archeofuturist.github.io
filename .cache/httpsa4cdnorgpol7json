The globalist jews might also want to destroy the white race but I&#039;m not absolutely sure of this, I think they just want to control us easier so fracturing the identity of the whites is the goal and the &quot;genocide&quot; is just a by product, but who knows. <br><br>Ironically great masses of individuals are easier to control than collectives so they despise collectivism like nationalism for this reason as it is probably the only thing that can take control away from them. <br><br>The rich jews who support Zionism uses american foreign policy and the governments of western countries to do its bidding. Our governments are actively working against our interests because they are controlled by rich jews. <br><br>The world system is set up to benefit america, with the petro-dollar and american power projection keeping the weaker governments that might not be aligned with the jews from causing too much harm. American foreign policy is used to serve Zionist interests and the economic system of the world is set up to serve the american government. <br><br>The shitskins have a piece of the puzzle unlocked and they know to oppose american foreign policy because zionist interests are against their interests. <br><br>I could probably go on about this but keep this in mind that I don&#039;t actually know what I&#039;m talking about and am just guessing but it certainly does make a lot of things make sense if you see it that way.","time":1493949634,"resto":124147921,"id":"I7CnR7EM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124148370,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:01:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124148243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124148243<\/a><br>first line is suppose to &quot;not all jews are in on it&quot; damn I&#039;m bad at spelling","time":1493949695,"resto":124147921,"id":"I7CnR7EM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124148880,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:06:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump of interest","time":1493949964,"resto":124147921,"id":"UwSP+HW+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124149186,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:08:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124147921\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124147921<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;my Jewish girlfriend broke up with me<\/span>","time":1493950133,"resto":124147921,"id":"QaSpQ0NG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124148379,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:01:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is Mein Kampf worth the read?","filename":"Mein+Kampf","ext":".jpg","w":988,"h":1500,"tn_w":164,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493949701207,"time":1493949701,"md5":"GdMwjYvCgAkGzfe68IZx3A==","fsize":362458,"resto":0,"id":"nFC472kS","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-mein-kampf-worth-the-read","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0},{"no":124148616,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:03:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"yes","time":1493949819,"resto":124148379,"id":"zmtZeXTn","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":124148871,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:05:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124148379\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124148379<\/a><br>Why read when you can listen<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xDO<wbr>PHZC936c&amp;t=2892s","time":1493949957,"resto":124148379,"id":"c\/4a9UFC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124149187,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:08:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"DVD.","time":1493950133,"resto":124148379,"id":"fCLZk6fj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124149271,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:09:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124148871\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124148871<\/a><br>is there a sound cloud? i want to listen to it while im driving","time":1493950179,"resto":124148379,"id":"nFC472kS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124144998,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:33:57","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Safe zones over THERE?

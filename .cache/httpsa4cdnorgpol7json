MSM did nothing to vet Trump or even push him to explain his policy prescriptions beyond the slogans. MSM knows that Trump made a bunch of unrealistic promises to the American public when the media thought the American people would see through the sloganeering. Americans didn&#039;t catch his lies, the media didn&#039;t see his victory coming, and now MSM is trying to highlight every potential negative headline to underscore how truly dangerous Trump&#039;s presidency is. The issue contrasts with the way they treated Trump before because they treated him like a candidate that couldn&#039;t win a presidential election and used his celebrity to improve their ratings. The news networks (outside of Fox which is truly propaganda) have finally decided to do some investigatory work.

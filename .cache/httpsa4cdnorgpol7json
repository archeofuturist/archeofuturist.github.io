Israel is not the friend of the United States nor anyone else; it is the creation of the Rothschilds. The Rothschilds funded the early European settlers in Israel, manipulated events in Germany that led to the horrific treatment of Jewish people and others, and then used that as the excuse to reach their long-term goal - a Rothschild-Illuminati stronghold in Palestine using the Jewish population as fodder to be used and abused as necessary. They called their plan &#039;Zionism&#039;. This term is often used as a synonym for Jewish people when it is actually a political movement devised and promoted through the House of Rothschild and opposed by many Jews. Zionism is not Judaism.<br><br> Evelyn Rothschild&#039;s grandson, who abandoned the family to be a Mormon, said of the Rothschilds: &quot;They created Israel as their personal toy. It makes them richer and gives them more control&quot;. It also gives them the 5th largest nuclear arsenal in the world, provided and funded by US tax dollars.<br><br> Washington is dominated by supporters of Israel through the Project for the New American Century, the American Enterprise Institute, the Jewish Institute for National Security Affairs (JINSA) and the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) - one of the top lobby groups in Washington.<br><br> Add to all this the Zionist control through ownership and personnel of much of the mainstream media and you have a network that gives the Arabic peoples no chance whatsoever of justice and understanding and the public no chance of being told the truth.","time":1491049076,"resto":119153849,"id":"GOdTm4E3","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119173239,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)08:00:11","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Which one of you fuckers hacked infinitechan?","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YT9<wbr>VDzs6B50","filename":"8","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":977,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":190,"tim":1491048011557,"time":1491048011,"md5":"1rUWrLmK5H4D3o9ndpnFmg==","fsize":59823,"resto":0,"id":"8jFB0PZb","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"which-one-of-you-fuckers-hacked-infinitechan","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":4,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":1},{"no":119173934,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)08:10:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119173560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119173560<\/a><br>damn right.","time":1491048633,"resto":119173239,"id":"8jFB0PZb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119174048,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)08:12:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119173239\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119173239<\/a>","filename":"It was me, Donald!","ext":".jpg","w":455,"h":250,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1491048744442,"time":1491048744,"md5":"H4iNM5l\/I3N0hNU\/eeoyFg==","fsize":17074,"resto":119173239,"id":"gmwLFcPF","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119174170,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)08:14:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119174048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119174048<\/a><br>we shall take our rightful clay back from the hands of the Jew, because we are bored, and it&#039;s funny.","filename":"they live","ext":".png","w":1247,"h":700,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491048868837,"time":1491048868,"md5":"zbcFJ0vpBm1x1WcaXLLz4Q==","fsize":825275,"resto":119173239,"id":"ofcPUCVe","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119174350,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)08:17:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119174048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119174048<\/a><br>But Donald, we supported you even more than half chan did.","time":1491049035,"resto":119173239,"id":"8jFB0PZb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119174394,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)08:17:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119173239\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119173239<\/a><br>That&#039;s... that&#039;s boogie1488!","filename":"5c0","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491049072689,"time":1491049072,"md5":"FRz3V9G7Ins3i39Yd105gg==","fsize":140861,"resto":119173239,"id":"ehu53zY0","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119159398,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)04:14:06","name":"Anonymous","sub":"What the fuck is this, \/pol?","com":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/cocosbentmind\/s<wbr>tatus\/847988118531788801","filename":"jkjjkfsdkjkdsfa","ext":".png","w":634,"h":604,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":238,"tim":1491034446050,"time":1491034446,"md5":"xvWkMwNRzkNR7r2cu1Er4w==","fsize":154782,"resto":0,"id":"NBj0XaHX","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-the-fuck-is-this-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":200,"images":30,"omitted_posts":195,"omitted_images":29,"tail_size":50},{"no":119174053,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)08:12:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119159398\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119159398<\/a><br>Don&#039;t be so quick to judge here guys.

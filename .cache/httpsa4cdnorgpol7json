The textbook definition is straightforward. Suppose it would take $10 per hour to induce someone to work. If the wage were any lower, the person would prefer not to work at all. If he or she is paid $15 per hour, then the difference between what they are actually paid and what it takes to induce them to work ($15 - $10 = $5) is economic rent.

If the player is paid $1 million per year, then the difference between that $1 million dollar salary and the amount needed to induce him to play for the season -- $950,000 -- is economic rent. If globalization and digital technology then allow the team to get much wider worldwide exposure and much higher broadcast and memorabilia revenues, then the player is more valuable and his salary might increase. Any increase in salary would also increase the rent, so expanding markets through changes in technology could explain rising rents for those with high incomes. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Many markets have become more globalized due to technological change -- movies, for example -- and many people believe this &quot;superstar&quot; model explains at least part of the rise in inequality.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But there is another more common usage of the term &quot;rent&quot; that explains the rise in inequality another way.

The ability to keep taxes relatively low for those at the top is one example of this.<br><br>The decline of labor unions in recent decades can also be explained in this way. According to this story, those with economic power -- the wealthy owners of businesses -- used their influence to get laws passed that undermined employee power. Unions had leveled the playing field, and as labor groups were stripped of their influence, power shifted to business owners, allowing them to capture a larger and larger share of national income. <br><br>Any change in rules or regulations, or even the failure to act -- not raising the minimum wage, for example -- that appears politically motivated and favors those in power would be defined as rent-seeking behavior.<br><br>The concept of economic rent originated with David Ricardo in the early 1800s.

Psychological support for the reassignment and surgery was provided by John Money, who continued to see Reimer annually for about a decade for consultations and to assess the outcome. This reassignment was considered an especially valid test case of the social learning concept of gender identity for two reasons: First, Reimer&#039;s identical twin brother, Brian, made an ideal control because the brothers shared genes, family environments, and the intrauterine environment. Second, this was reputed to be the first reassignment and reconstruction performed on a male infant who had no abnormality of prenatal or early postnatal sexual differentiation.<\/span>","time":1491964978,"resto":120663950,"id":"RR3csxcs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120702353,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)22:51:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120701308\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120701308<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Reimer said that Dr. Money forced the twins to rehearse sexual acts involving &quot;thrusting movements&quot;, with David playing the bottom role.

Since Australia was always separated from other countries by an ocean; humans could not have travelled to Australia on any sort of sea-going vessel such as rafts, canoes or boats. The final crossing to Australia was probably made by accident. It is most likely that the initial arrivals got to Australia unintentionally.

I&#039;ll start with a brief blurb on &quot;sati&quot;, which is usually translated as &quot;mindfulness&quot;, but &quot;mindfulness&quot; is so contaminated with new agey associations you might as well forget the English word. The Buddhist term means something different from whatever you&#039;re thinking.<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sati_<wbr>(Buddhism)<br><br>There is absolutely nothing more important than direct awareness of what&#039;s going on in your mind. Nothing else compares. All your thoughts and actions are dictated by simple habitual mental shortcuts, and which shortcut you end up using and how well it works mostly depends on the current state of your mind and physical body. Turning your intelligence directly toward understanding those states on an intuitive level makes your mental shortcuts work much, much better. It&#039;s the difference between a five year old acting on instinct, and a self-aware adult seeing a situation, allowing his full creative faculties to understand what his senses are telling him, and acting accordingly. Is your mental awareness at the level of a five year old? If you haven&#039;t seriously asked yourself this question, it almost certainly is, no matter what your intuitive notion of your own level of self-awareness might be.","filename":"colors","ext":".png","w":1102,"h":788,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":178,"tim":1492354686796,"time":1492354686,"md5":"5WaU9RJA8OOZGFD6sooYcQ==","fsize":2370056,"resto":0,"id":"SOOds3do","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-arent-you-a-buddhist-yet","country_name":"United States","replies":23,"images":2,"omitted_posts":18,"omitted_images":1},{"no":121375765,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)12:18:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121375011\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121375011<\/a><br>Should I apologize for starting a thread on \/pol\/ for my own amusement that turned out unexpectedly well?

In a follow-up study (N=329,000), a new EduYears GPS explains up to 4%. Here, we tested the association between this latest EduYears GPS and educational achievement scores at ages 7, 12 and 16 in an independent sample of 5825 UK individuals. We found that EduYears GPS explained greater amounts of variance in educational achievement over time, up to 9% at age 16, accounting for 15% of the heritable variance. This is the strongest GPS prediction to date for quantitative behavioral traits. Individuals in the highest and lowest GPS septiles differed by a whole school grade at age 16. Furthermore, EduYears GPS was associated with general cognitive ability (~3.5%) and family socioeconomic status (~7%). There was no evidence of an interaction between EduYears GPS and family socioeconomic status on educational achievement or on general cognitive ability. These results are a harbinger of future widespread use of GPS to predict genetic risk and resilience in the social and behavioral sciences.<\/span><br>It&#039;s already common knowledge that niggers do worse academically all across the board.

Individual differences in intelligence are strongly associated with many important life outcomes, including educational and occupational attainments, income, health and lifespan. Data from twin and family studies are consistent with a high heritability of intelligence, but this inference has been controversial. We conducted a genome-wide analysis of 3511 unrelated adults with data on 549692 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and detailed phenotypes on cognitive traits. We estimate that 40% of the variation in crystallized-type intelligence and 51% of the variation in fluid-type intelligence between individuals is accounted for by linkage disequilibrium between genotyped common SNP markers and unknown causal variants. These estimates provide lower bounds for the narrow-sense heritability of the traits. We partitioned genetic variation on individual chromosomes and found that, on average, longer chromosomes explain more variation. Finally, using just SNP data we predicted ~1% of the variance of crystallized and fluid cognitive phenotypes in an independent sample (P=0.009 and 0.028, respectively). Our results unequivocally confirm that a substantial proportion of individual differences in human intelligence is due to genetic variation, and are consistent with many genes of small effects underlying the additive genetic influences on intelligence.<\/span><br>Here&#039;s plenty more studies:<br>http:\/\/www.nature.com\/search?journa<wbr>l=mp&amp;q=intelligence%20genetics&amp;q_ma<wbr>tch=all&amp;sp-a=sp1001702d&amp;sp-m=0&amp;sp-p<wbr>-1=phrase&amp;sp-sfvl-field=subject%7Cu<wbr>journal&amp;sp-x-1=ujournal&amp;submit=go","time":1492359469,"resto":121373758,"id":"EVuu+Q2n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121376071,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)12:21:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121374787\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121374787<\/a><br>RARE<br>A<br>R<br>E","time":1492359661,"resto":121373758,"id":"Q1kGqk41","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121378399,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)12:38:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121373758\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121373758<\/a><br>And OP, if some ribbitors or Tumblrinas give you shit about &quot;muh inconclusiveness&quot; or some weird try hard sciency sounding dissent, just tell them that the evidence for environmental and socioeconomic factors is solely based off of social science.

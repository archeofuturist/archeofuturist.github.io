You can&#039;t compare the political sphere in the US with the political sphere in the Balkan region. We have been governed by corrupt institutions ever since the commies took power after WW2, and the revolutions in &#039;89 were nothing more but dust in the wind. Voting parties such as the one you described would bring nothing more but policy changes that would affect your nation in the long term, even thought that aforementioned party would be voted out in the next election cycle. <br><br>Also, voting for a party that would recognize Kosovo is fucking delusional. There&#039;s a big reason on why some countries in the EU don&#039;t recognize Kosovo and never will - the moment it gets recognized on an international scale, you&#039;ll have secesionist movements demanding the same thing in Romania, Spain, the UK and whatnot. The domino effect would be catastrophically effective. <br><br>The Serbs, as well as most of the Eastern European population, are indeed motivated by spite, and will go out only and only if the knife already touches the bone. That doesn&#039;t mean you have to vote for the most fucked up policy, you just have to wait for the current one to fall - and that&#039;s inevitable, given the rampant corruption. <br><br><a href=\"#p120574757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120574757<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how many illegals voted for Hillary in the Democratic strongholds (California, Jew York etc) <\/span><br><br>There&#039;s a fucking reason the Electoral Collage exists.

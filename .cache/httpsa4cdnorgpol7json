It is clear that his features were typical of Galilean Semites of his era.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It was the Bible, however, that resolved the question of the length of Jesus&#039;s hair. While most religious artists have put long hair on Christ, most biblical scholars believe that it was probably short with tight curls.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Would Paul have written &quot;If a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him&quot; if Jesus Christ had had long hair? For Neave and his team this settled the issue. Jesus, as drawings from the first century depict, would have had short hair, appropriate to men of the time.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Since Jesus worked outdoors as a carpenter until he was about 30 years old, it is reasonable to assume he was more muscular and physically fit than westernized portraits suggest. His face was probably weather-beaten, which would have made him appear older, as well.<\/span><br><br>WEEE","filename":"gallery-1450102902-screen-shot-2015-12-14-at-91810-am","ext":".png","w":480,"h":628,"tn_w":191,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491128523581,"time":1491128523,"md5":"th3dCV09XlCK7SQJ7W0zgA==","fsize":564951,"resto":0,"id":"eKE0PQNr","country":"ID","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-real-face-of-jesus-advances-in-forensic","country_name":"Indonesia","replies":88,"images":26,"omitted_posts":83,"omitted_images":26},{"no":119197821,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:14:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119186427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119186427<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You don&#039;t believe in those silly Jewish conspiracies, r-right anon?<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8ER<wbr>mOpZrKtw","filename":"hqdefault","ext":".jpg","w":336,"h":188,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1491138899063,"time":1491138899,"md5":"UkPFAvx9MYdyRfiq2qd2CA==","fsize":11648,"resto":119186427,"id":"LTS\/NgpB","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":119198417,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:22:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Two lessons: <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the Book of Matthew was not written by the Apostle Matthew, or any one who personally knew Jesus.

Now try to imagine someone writing a book about you, one hundred years after your death, without the internet, photos, or anything you wrote while you were alive to help provide any sense of accuracy, and this person writing a book about you is just writing what he heard orally from other people. Do you think this book would accurately depict your life? <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the reason why we depict Jesus as a guy with a beard and long hair is because that sort of art was made during the Italian Renaissance, and do you know how Italian men styled their hair in the 15th and 16th centuries?

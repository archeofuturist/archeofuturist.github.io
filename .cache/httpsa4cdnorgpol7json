There\u2019s no such thing as a novella.\u201d<br><br>Subatomic particles: \u201cNow they\u2019re saying they discovered \u2018tetraquarks\u2019 and \u2018pentaquarks\u2019. How many combinations of quarks are there? I can\u2019t even keep up these days. What ever happened to just talking about good old atoms?\u201d<br><br>Cats: \u201cA Manx is not a cat. Cats are defined as having tails. Maybe it\u2019s a koala.\u201d<br><br>Ice cream: \u201cAvocado is not a valid ice cream flavor because I\u2019ve never heard of it and it does not appeal to me.\u201d<br><br>Language: \u201cI don\u2019t care what linguists say, I know a dialect when I see one, and Pennsylvania Dutch English is not a dialect.\u201d<br><br>Water: \u201cWater is H20. Ice might parade around pretending to be something different, but we all know that it\u2019s also H20 and therefore also water. It\u2019s chemistry.\u201d<br><br>Colors: \u201cThe cultural imposition of boundaries on a color gradient has nothing to do with it. A rainbow has seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, and another kind of purple.\u201d<br><br>Murder: \u201cIf you think murder is just the unlawful and premeditated killing of one person by another, then how do you explain the fact that animals murder each other all the time in nature?\u201d<br><br>Doctors: \u201cYou can\u2019t just put on scrubs, go to medical school for eight years, pass a licensing examination, and gallivant around calling yourself a doctor. You\u2019re either born a doctor or you\u2019re not.\u201d<br><br>Heat: \u201cCareful, that compound is rich in phlogiston. Oh, sorry, \u2018kinetic energy.\u2019 You have to be politically correct these days.\u201d<br><br>Sex: \u201cThe missionary position is the natural sexual position. People are genetically predisposed to it.\u201d<br><br>Politics: \u201c\u2018Libertarian\u2019? Stop trying to be a special snowflake.

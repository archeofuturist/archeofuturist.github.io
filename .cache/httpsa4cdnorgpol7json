Here are some of my favorite bible videos. <br><br>Things that are in the bible that have been found: <br><br>Noah&#039;s ark: big as boat in armenia, near mount urarat that has the exact dimensions of the boat described in the bible and, get this, is full of fur and feces from all kind of different animals. So old its petrified (i think).<br><br>Sodom and Gomorrah: The location checks out, the structures on this shore of the red sea are geometrical (meaning obviously man-made) there is hella ash every where and a ridiculous amount of a certain kind of sulfur (brimstone) that only occurs in small amounts in volcanic eruptions just litter the entire ground. No natural explanation for this find but it is in keeping with if, say, fire and brimstone literally rained down from the sky onto this settlement.<br><br>Mount sinai: in Arabia, the top of this mountain is still freaking scorched black to this day, there are pillars that were mentioned being erected in the bib;e still standing, hebraic hieroglyphs painted on stone including a couple cows (with people dancing around it), and nearby a rock that was split in two (it is said moses struck the rock, against gods instructions, and it split in two and produced water.<br><br>Playlist of those things: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xFp<wbr>vKKmTF7c&amp;index=14&amp;list=PLH2uhJ2RmgY<wbr>WPI0MWW2dtZRzahOy4Ttfg","time":1493347992,"resto":123125317,"id":"pXuFW1Ei","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123134479,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)22:53:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Already in bad standing with congress<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Even though you have a majority in both house and senate<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;decide to fuck with them by making them waste time on a bus for a worthless power move<\/span><br><br>Is Trump mentally retarded?","filename":"AP_17116698268836-1280x960","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493347985224,"time":1493347985,"md5":"4bdTO31IT31nzVgLuMs2Jw==","fsize":138983,"resto":0,"id":"egx0G2Ew","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"already-in-bad-standing-with-congress","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":123104128,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)18:52:08","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Polynesia Thread","com":"ITT: Your opinion of that clump of Islands, what you think of their culture etc.","filename":"French_Polynesia_Bora_Bora-Tahiti-108","ext":".jpg","w":2592,"h":1944,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493333528134,"time":1493333528,"md5":"+xLzjJ8odzc\/seZ9E2Ypnw==","fsize":803922,"resto":0,"id":"gAqiqBlE","country":"IL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"polynesia-thread","country_name":"Israel","replies":108,"images":12,"omitted_posts":103,"omitted_images":11,"tail_size":50},{"no":123133832,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)22:48:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123133574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123133574<\/a><br>Yeah, sounds like we can steal some culture from them and implement it in Europe","time":1493347690,"resto":123104128,"id":"gAqiqBlE","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":123133863,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)22:48:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123129542\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123129542<\/a><br>5 minutes out of town for the rubbish.

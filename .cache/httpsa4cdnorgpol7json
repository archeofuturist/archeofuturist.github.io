One in the south, one in the rest of the country. Actually, the revolution in the south isn&#039;t for an independent black nation in the sense you think independent. The communists wanted this new socialist America modeled on the Soviet Union.<br><br>In the USSR, there was ethnostates such as the Azerbaijan SSR, Armenian SSR, et al. The propaganda line was that the various ethnicities within the soviet union (Armenians, Kazakhs, Ukrainians) all had their own nations, this was a success of communism. But really, the governments of those soviet republics took their marching orders from Moscow, so these naitons weren&#039;t actually independent.<br><br>How does this work out in America? All of America is a communist nation with the south being a Negro Soviet Republic whose governing decisions come from the communist government in Washington DC.<br><br>So the communist plan was for the civil rights revolution to bring about socialism in the whole country and by allying with the federal government, reshape the state governments of the south to form a Negro republic. <br><br>The reason for &quot;thug culture&quot; and the idea that patriotic symbols like the national anthem are racist are meant to make black feel separated from American culture so they can embrace black nationalism. When black negativity toward patriotism has advanced enough, the left will openly protest for an independent black nation.<br><br>No one law will establish a black nation out of the south. The black nation would be the end result of a series of laws.<br><br>Brown v Board established that a small group of leftist activists could speak for all blacks of the country in a court case.<br><br>The Civil Rights Act allows for the Federal Government to intervene in state affairs.<br><br>The Voting Rights acts sets the precedent the Federal Government can administer the south separate from the rest of the country.","filename":"proletarian3","ext":".jpg","w":2432,"h":3662,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490761449865,"time":1490761449,"md5":"o2cPeIpnaVd6wh0PIQ3HzQ==","fsize":1673732,"resto":118717797,"id":"LM8hqOtg","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118746786,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:28:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"modern white people are so autistic, outnumbered, and outgunned that no ones scared of badmouthing them","time":1490761691,"resto":118717797,"id":"mVN5QVgd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118747736,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:39:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118722517\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118722517<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;eastern european block.

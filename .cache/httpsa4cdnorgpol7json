The answer to that question is noone. You might think the elites might use it to rid the earth of their enemies and reduce population, but even for them this way of doing it a) causes to many side effects and influence on nature and b) has too many variables, since you can&#039;t be sure who nukes where and you can&#039;t plan the outcome good enough to be able to stabilize a new society afterwards.<br><br>I mean look at the war zones we have today, war isn&#039;t what it used to be and the war in those countries is neverending. In a land where the infrastructure is destroyed, economics don&#039;t exist anymore and people lost all good belief there will be only chaos. This chaos would last for at least some decades and again the outcome would be very unstable and hard to plan for.<br><br>Second we have to ask ourselves why everyone keeps their bombs then. This one is simple and you heard it before: So no madman can push the button without killing himself. And there is a second answer: You can use nuclear weapons on a smaller scale for tactical combat. Small rounds with nuclear parts that wreck a lot of devastation will come, will be in use and will not influence nature too much. You can predict the outcome. This is very dangerous and unsettling, but won&#039;t lead to an all out nuclear war.<br><br>And there there is someting else people don&#039;t think about enough: Having an all out nuclear war only occurs when it is clear who shot first. All scenarios are like &quot;A attacks B who is partners with C, they shoot back but A is partners with D and will retaliate.&quot; and so on. Have you ever thought about that the &quot;new&quot; nuclear danger is not countries nuking it each other, but CovertOps looking like terrorist action? If you are Putin you could easily set up a CovertOps of Pseudo-Terrorists getting a quite small bomb into NY for example. You could blow up the city, and the US could not react.","filename":"1491895215258","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493797981930,"time":1493797981,"md5":"pRjhfHES9WqEZXiEPeEJLg==","fsize":61326,"resto":0,"id":"kv3GATkr","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"will-there-be-nuclear-war","country_name":"Germany","replies":75,"images":9,"omitted_posts":70,"omitted_images":7},{"no":123893466,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)05:09:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123893208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123893208<\/a><br>You think your mother would accept your status as a mongoloid if she realized how dumb you really are?","time":1493802548,"resto":123888374,"id":"kv3GATkr","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123894057,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)05:18:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"No nuclear ww3?!

By and large, as you and I are alive today, we will most likely live out your days in relative comfort in the U.S. But if you want to look beyond yourself, and consider the type of world that you are bequeathing to your grandchildren \u2013 a worldview that countless numbers of your ancestors took on in order to provide a better life for descendants of theirs that they would never even meet \u2013 the situation becomes a bit more clear. Most issues at the forefront of U.S. politics today pale in comparison to immigration because failing to make a change to the immigration system today will be equivalent to a single generation unilaterally making a decision to irreversibly and irreparably change Western civilization in a way that thousands of generations before you would rue. When my grandchildren reach their mid 20&#039;s, the country will be &lt; 25% white. By the time they retire, it will be less than 10% white. <br><br>You may gasp in shock and awe, and say that&#039;s &quot;racist\/biggoted\/backwards thinking, etc.&quot; But bear in mind how much your outlook is shaped entirely by the prevailing norms of today. If I gathered up you and all your ancestors in an auditorium and asked about this issue, you would be entirely on your own. I can imagine the stock of men in your family tree who died in order to prevent what you are now welcoming with open arms. But you \u2013 the &#039;enlightened generation&#039; \u2013 go against this worldview in a way that appears to provide few if any plausible routes for reversal. And what\u2019s more? The truly fucked up part of it is that you yourself will never in fact live with those consequences in any real sense. For the vast majority of your life, you will have lived in a country that is 90%, 80%, 70%, even 60% white. <br><br>(1\/3)","filename":"1","ext":".jpg","w":791,"h":1024,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493804547371,"time":1493804547,"md5":"EBB0mgwC+lriIsuvr2Nn0w==","fsize":53890,"resto":123888975,"id":"q3GqUayl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123895620,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)05:42:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123888975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123888975<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123895582\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123895582<\/a><br><br>Sure, you may in a \u2018diverse\u2019 area and have friends of all backgrounds in your life, but there is still plenty of opportunity to find a town, neighborhood, workplace, and school for your children that are predominantly white.

The following are all trends that have been steadily increasing since the modern immigration scheme was set in to place, and are trends that could reasonably be expected to continue unless you offer evidence to shift the burden against them: increased crime; increased terrorism; increased tax burdens required to support the welfare state, a general lack of social trust in strangers and in society\u2019s institutions; the general erosion of the nation\u2019s core culture in light of \u2018multiculturalism,\u2019 which in today\u2019s terms means failing to demand full assimilation into the society.

Living from paycheck to paycheck until you die. Having to pay taxes to corrupt politicians who sell you out to international organizations and chinks, leaving you with not even enough money to pay rent let alone buy a house. I know a ghetto sheboon who gets paid 3000 euros a year for scholarship just because her parents are filthy urban rats who do nothing for a living. This is where your money is going. Our healthcare staff and insitutions are understaffed, underpaid and overworked, good luck waiting years for urgent surgery. This will only get worse every year as no one is having children, the age pyramid will be reversed and you will spend the rest of your life working more than 12 hours a day just to pay for their pensions. We live in a bureaucratic nightmare where you need govt approval to scratch your goddamn balls. Our infrastructure is falling apart, our industry is nil. We are paid to underproduce. Our communities are getting destroyed with cultural marxism and plain idiocy. No respect for anyone.<br><br>But hey at least we have some good beaches, and had an empire 40 years ago. Just thank God that we&#039;re too poor to give out infinite gibs, otherwise we&#039;d be drowning in even more hues and angolans now. In 20 years you will be lucky to serve as an organ donor for chink insectoid subhumans, that is if the German caliphate doesn&#039;t behead you first.<br><br>The past is irrelevant, you are not a Kang unless you are getting shit done. Otherwise you are worthless like all the rest.","filename":"1474610892955","ext":".jpg","w":219,"h":250,"tn_w":109,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493805620549,"time":1493805620,"md5":"SxwD6sC0t5fpyBYAoJ21Xw==","fsize":14836,"resto":123894122,"id":"tfW2Xs7X","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"}]}]}

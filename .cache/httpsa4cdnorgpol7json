I am certain that mainstream media has taken leads from \/pol\/ and sourced stories from here, and I&#039;m not just talking about the sensational ones. I know for a fact that myself and others have influenced peoples religious awareness here and even been instrumental in persuading them to seek direction from one of the Christian Religious Traditions. What bothers me though is how this precious vent of otherwise peripheral political opinion is wasted.<br><br>In this age of the Internet and the free movement of information a forum such as this could become a beacon of free speech, but because of the rabid hatred that&#039;s spewed here it is a pariah. It&#039;s not gone unnoticed by me that any thread that shows signs of having real substance in a world of illusion and distraction can and does get pruned, it&#039;s nevertheless interesting that they are still often archived. They make interesting reading while they&#039;re up though and it&#039;s why I keep coming back.<br><br>So this is an appeal to informed, historically aware people with a decent memory of recent contemporary events going back to the breakdown in US\/Russia relationships to offer a concise appraisal of what they&#039;ve noticed and where they see these events leading.

Millions. You aren&#039;t just IN the minority; you ARE the minority.<br>I don&#039;t feel awkward or anxious being a Muslim around others, and your words don&#039;t affect me. Many others, however, are coming out of their shells for the first time in their lives. This is the first time many are enjoying the beautiful world that has been gifted to us by Allah - and it IS beautiful. Incredibly so. DON&#039;T ruin this for them.

I&#039;m sorry that, to ensure your own validity, you need to make others feel invalid. I&#039;m sorry that your self-worth is so infinitesimally miniscule that you have to make others feel less-than-human, at least in your own denatured mind, just to feel whole. I am truly sorry that day-in and day-out you have to put up with your worthless, meaningless, Shakespearean tragedy of a life.<br>I ask you politely to cease your unnecessary cries for attention, and instead invite you to join our ranks.

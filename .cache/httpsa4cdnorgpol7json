Also, gay couples can get these changed made without having to appear before a judge. I think encouraging monogamous pairing is a good thing. Does \/pol\/ approve of this decision?<br><br>--<br><br>TALLAHASSEE \u2014 Florida widows and widowers whose spouses died before the U.S. Supreme Court declared state bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional can have the death certificates of their loved ones changed without having to go to court, a federal judge ruled Thursday.<br><br>The plaintiffs sought to have the death certificates of their spouses show they had been married, but the state argued that Florida law prohibited officials from changing the documents without a court order.<br><br>&quot;As a matter of federal constitutional law, a state cannot properly refuse to correct a federal constitutional violation going forward, even if the violation arose before the dispute over the constitutional issue was settled,&quot; he wrote. &quot;If the law were otherwise, the schools might still be segregated.<br><br>The state &quot;must correct a constitutional error that affected a death certificate&#039;s information on both marital status and a spouse&#039;s identity,&quot; he ordered.<br><br>Hinkle&#039;s ruling requires state officials to amend death certificates without a court order &quot;if the decedent was a party to a same-sex marriage that was recognized as lawful in the jurisdiction where it was entered&quot; and the surviving spouse provides documentation, such as an affidavit, showing that the marriage wasn&#039;t recognized or the same-sex partner wasn&#039;t identified.","filename":"rainbowpepe","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":247,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":154,"tim":1490408642677,"time":1490408642,"md5":"DdEQhLbvrIQEyv+uvM68sg==","fsize":11622,"resto":0,"id":"2gSO9dr5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"death-certificates-ordered-in-florida-gay","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":118174335,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:41:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118172239\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118172239<\/a><br>bump","time":1490409700,"resto":118172239,"id":"kbZlXzVE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118167596,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:46:18","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Lauren Southern","com":"Is Lauren Southern the perfect conservative woman?","filename":"17211995_1824079151176966_6686443199572415035_o","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1361,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490406378077,"time":1490406378,"md5":"rT1rpyd4tekfyQkprNkmGA==","fsize":240492,"resto":0,"id":"qKcJsdB4","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lauren-southern","country_name":"United States","replies":46,"images":16,"omitted_posts":41,"omitted_images":16},{"no":118172875,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:29:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hello","filename":"35754t65","ext":".jpg","w":1536,"h":1133,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1490408952361,"time":1490408952,"md5":"7WCBVs19MRi\/ryhgOdP5HQ==","fsize":207527,"resto":118167596,"id":"GEdqtZfg","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118172887,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:29:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118168642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118168642<\/a><br>Cute armpits","time":1490408959,"resto":118167596,"id":"7KowCBDQ","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":118172957,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:30:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118168642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118168642<\/a><br>literally no reason to believe they fucked","time":1490409000,"resto":118167596,"id":"1lfGg8Ct","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118173216,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:32:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118167596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118167596<\/a><br>There are no conservative women.","time":1490409137,"resto":118167596,"id":"olH9gZ2n","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118174306,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:41:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118167596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118167596<\/a>","filename":"1488661034658","ext":".png","w":512,"h":384,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490409689111,"time":1490409689,"md5":"u0zMd+d5dzZDPOwERP6JSA==","fsize":274116,"resto":118167596,"id":"Wwkt0z5U","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118165211,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:27:29","name":"Anonymous","sub":"&gt;Democrats are the REAL RACISTS","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Antifa are the REAL FASCISTS<\/span><br><br>Why are there so many people like this on \/pol\/ all of a sudden?","filename":"1480608536022","ext":".jpg","w":588,"h":575,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":244,"tim":1490405249245,"time":1490405249,"md5":"WtVwfBaSroIoAZlrJTenTw==","fsize":50894,"resto":0,"id":"sAD4mlY7","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"democrats-are-the-real-racists","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":12,"images":1,"omitted_posts":7,"omitted_images":1},{"no":118168617,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:54:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118165211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118165211<\/a><br><br>Yes it is dumb and these people do not belong anywhere near \/pol\/. <br><br>But I would rather have normies say &quot;Antifa are the real fascists&quot;

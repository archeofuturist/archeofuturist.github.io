I used to make ironic jokes about jews controlling everything. I still make these remarks, only now they&#039;re jokes no longer. I honestly believe 70 years without wars have ruined europe more than any war ever could have. There is nothing worth living for as a white straight male. Goebbels was right. Jews won the war. Eternal darkness is dawned upon us. I can&#039;t handle it. I want to go back to blissful ignorance. I want to feel happiness again. There is no joy in knowledge.

The Visigoths, along with the Barbarians, the Vandals, the Franks, and the Huns, were what we would call today \u201cbarbarians,\u201d and were not into learning science, math, philosophy, and architecture. They were interested in conquering and destroying civilizations, the very epitome of \u201craping and pillaging.\u201d And conquer and rape and pillage they did. So why is Europe so civilized today? Did these early barbaric conquerors of Europe all of a sudden take up an interest in culture?

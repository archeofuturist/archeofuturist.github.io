Think Ralph Lauren, or Gucci or Chanel or Jimmy Choo or even less mainstream people like Helmut Lang or Ann D. <br><br>What you&#039;re experiencing or noting is social decay. I&#039;d argue Marxists have been trying to do this forever. Since the 1910s. Postmodernism is a rejection of the objective and of standards of any sort because they&#039;re oppressive. And so you get dumbass stained jeans, menstrual blood paintings, and 682672485 genders. <br><br>Blame those retards. Don&#039;t blame markets. Markets respond to society. Markets do not dictate society. What you&#039;re seeing is only because people want it or people let it happen. The society is what is late stage. Keep going down the path of weakness and were doomed.","time":1493142393,"resto":122758824,"id":"n4vz14KU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122761837,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:50:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122761318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122761318<\/a><br>Its \/leftypol\/ <br>Same shit with nigress and white man threads","time":1493142640,"resto":122758824,"id":"io+k4S3E","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122762102,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:52:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122759357\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122759357<\/a><br>Do you?

Nobody gave half a fuck about addicts until &quot;the nice secretary&#039;s son&quot; started smoking oxy 30s in her minivan. This NIMBY attitude has led to it being almost too late to remedy.<br><br>having a family being rotted from the inside out by drug addiction is a bitch, but the white race needs to sack the fuck up and quit blaming others for their shortcomings, ESPECIALLY when it comes to the opiate issue.

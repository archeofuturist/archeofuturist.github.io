The Communist line was the Negro is a nation within a nation and the Negro people had full right to take several southern states as their own nation. <br><br>The communist goal was, in their words, &quot;two revolutions at once.&quot; One revolution to form a Negro nation out of the southern states--a second revolution through the rest of the US to make all of America socialist.<br><br>The violents and the nonviolents worked together every day of the civil rights movement to that their shared goal: a Communist United States and independent Negro nation.<br><br>The &quot;violents&quot; or the black nationalists were too promise violence and deliver it. They organized riots all over America from 1963 through to the 70s. The &quot;nonviolents&quot; would halfheartedly denounce this. <br><br>The truth, Martin Luther King had violents, more radical than modern Black Lives Matter, work with him. MLK had violents follow him through the country and even had them on his payroll. <br><br>The thesis was that MLK and other reasonable, nonviolent activists would organize a huge march and protest in the name of getting some government program approved. Dr King promises not to turn to violence but says &quot;if nonviolent change doesnt come, some of my followers will get impatient and turn to rioting.&quot; Thats not an actual quote, just the attitude.<br><br>Actually, MLK said a riot &quot;is the voice of the unheard.&quot; <br><br>Give King what he wants or else Malcolm X gets what he wants. MLK became known as a man that showed up in town followed by riots.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=09n<wbr>nfO-f0pg<br>This is a song by a folksong writer that worked for MLK, in Dr King&#039;s SCLC. This song very much calls for violence. Listen to the lyrics. The singer is saying that if he doesnt get money, and a job, and other little things through a government program, the city will burn!","filename":"[aul8","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":427,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490759964878,"time":1490759964,"md5":"a+E4jMoCfvaNRCVIggIrqg==","fsize":56985,"resto":118717797,"id":"LM8hqOtg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118744732,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:06:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118717797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118717797<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_L<wbr>eft","filename":"1490664250912","ext":".jpg","w":855,"h":679,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":99,"tim":1490760401181,"time":1490760401,"md5":"mwJY\/Lf7BxY97ba\/M1NpFg==","fsize":163364,"resto":118717797,"id":"NqjqHpHT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118745085,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:10:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118717797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118717797<\/a><br><br>WELFARE<br><br>LBJ re-enslaved the niggers","time":1490760620,"resto":118717797,"id":"g4tlcWQD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118745178,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:11:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118743997\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118743997<\/a><br>The &quot;violent&quot; form of protest was to burn buildings, flip over cars, shoot cops and bomb office buildings. The &quot;nonviolent&quot; protest movement wasn&#039;t any less chaotic. The nonviolent protest movement consisted of an activist tactic known as civil disobedience: intentionally breaking an unjust law to protest it. <br><br>Rosa Parks refusing to go to the back of the bus is an example of civil disobedience. Martin Luther King along with SNCC and the NAACP took it to an extreme level. Civil disobedience would be to get a crowd of people together to shut down the ability of local government to function.<br><br>Such as having a thousand protesters sit in a roadway to block access into and out of a city. Or organize blacks to boycott shopping at a white owned business...with threats of violence against blacks that would shop there. Or holding demonstrations in the center of town at 2 in the morning, with loud protest chants, so the activists can practice civil disobedience against the local noise ordinance that would prohibit a protest by any other group at 2 in the morning. <br><br>So no surprise, these nonviolent demonstrations usually turned to a disorderly scene of chaos, with the civil authority in many local governments being rendered inefficient. <br><br>And the man that was presented as the responsible civil rights leader is the King, whom along with the radical black nationalists, advocated disregard of the law as fashionable.<br><br>And the protest had a simple strategy. Cause an inconvenience to the people. Stand in the freeway. give the local government two options: negotiate, or use force to remove the protesters, followed by pictures of police roughing up activists being thrown into every newspaper. And the goal of these protests always was for another government program.","filename":"paul upon paul","ext":".png","w":908,"h":720,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":99,"tim":1490760671975,"time":1490760671,"md5":"fclhz4ZjYDpY8qh7PxqMqw==","fsize":1767531,"resto":118717797,"id":"LM8hqOtg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118745175,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:11:10","name":"Anonymous","sub":"God keep our land, glorious and free, we stand on guard for thee.","com":"Kelly Leitch<br>Conservative leader in Running <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Canadian Government broadcaster says she&#039;s hitler<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kelly promises to defund said billion dollar plus entity <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kelly promises to institute payed value screening test for immigration. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Canadian broadcasting Corp calls Kelly Racist. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Kelly promises increased national security and defunding overseas abortions <\/span><br>Is Kelly our Trump?","filename":"IMG_0749","ext":".jpg","w":822,"h":462,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490760670331,"time":1490760670,"md5":"4MwtmtUQtCFtlbNstS8Lag==","fsize":354089,"resto":0,"id":"ZZQIJlU2","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"god-keep-our-land-glorious-and-free-we-stand-on","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":118745283,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:12:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"CBC is cancer that needs to be removed.","filename":"IMG_0684","ext":".jpg","w":359,"h":395,"tn_w":113,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490760733656,"time":1490760733,"md5":"KTyaL3ZrtGgecKV3\/P+rFA==","fsize":37135,"resto":118745175,"id":"ZZQIJlU2","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118742420,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)23:43:42","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Maddox","com":"Does anyone else have a gut feeling that he&#039;s going to be proven right about everything all along?","filename":"maddox","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":883,"tn_w":181,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490759022270,"time":1490759022,"md5":"6HZqKPgtLw1lnf1q0D0Ivw==","fsize":101489,"resto":0,"id":"ExygkmEd","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"maddox","country_name":"United States","replies":23,"images":1,"omitted_posts":18,"omitted_images":1},{"no":118744773,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:07:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118742420\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118742420<\/a><br>cuck","time":1490760431,"resto":118742420,"id":"V7BDMyDM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118744805,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:07:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118743203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118743203<\/a><br>Wow I forgot all about that.

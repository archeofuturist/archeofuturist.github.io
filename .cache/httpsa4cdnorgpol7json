Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491602223633,"time":1491602223,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"9P1LRbLV","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":120032092,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)17:59:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m atheist, and by definition I don&#039;t care about my religion, nor about yours.<br>Also sage goes in all fields","time":1491602388,"resto":120031672,"id":"MPowxXtA","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120028384,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)17:35:54","name":"Anonymous","sub":"What does \/pol think about this?","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Blames president for a horrible mistake<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;proceeds to do the same fucking bs<\/span>","filename":"4L_BIFCBivr","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":542,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":180,"tim":1491600954962,"time":1491600954,"md5":"OyGzCQiCeuDQxrPwTLpzdw==","fsize":76128,"resto":0,"id":"7YTmXWCc","country":"DO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-does-pol-think-about-this","country_name":"Dominican Republic","replies":8,"images":3,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":1},{"no":120029738,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)17:44:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120029454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120029454<\/a><br>Wat are we fucked","filename":"1489508424031","ext":".jpg","w":324,"h":322,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491601474388,"time":1491601474,"md5":"7oZD1yjEAdk5crmDuLsOnA==","fsize":41946,"resto":120028384,"id":"T4egrCh1","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120029989,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)17:46:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120028384\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120028384<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What does \/pol\/ think about this?<\/span><br>A disgrace.

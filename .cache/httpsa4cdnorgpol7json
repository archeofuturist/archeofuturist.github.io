Mostly I mean very basic stuff like if you own a car, you also carry some basic tools that can fix the easier problems about the car, and you know how to use them. Like if you own a computer, you also know how to google well and find solutions for all sorts of lighter computer issues (audio not working, video player not playing a certain format etc.)<br><br>By tinkering, I mean again basic stuff first, like what to do when the sink pipes are clogged up, how to fix a broken cupboard door, how to change the lightbulb etc. but even better if you teach yourself how to build basic furniture, can fix electric appliances in some cases and how to paint a wooden fence etc.<br><br>I am personally not too crafty with building stuff or fixing random tech but my father is very gifted with that stuff. I just personally have set the goal that I will learn that stuff too some time in the future when I start a family.<br><br>Also, it&#039;s important to add, that men only become more valuable, desirable and gather more authority as they get older, which only begins to plummet as they get older than 60 or so. With women, their value is highest when they are 20 or so, when they are most fertile, young, beautiful etc. but after that age, their market value starts to decline, and if they want to keep earn deep respect from their community, only way for women to do this is to do a good job at raising children or keeping a harmonious home environment for their husbands. This is a very important task as well, I think men don&#039;t achieve shit if it wasn&#039;t for the women who perform the tasks men are not that well suited for, such as a knack for home decoration, good social skills, sharp intuition, ability to multitask etc.","time":1493316264,"resto":123058513,"id":"b9eMfICO","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":123065385,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)14:09:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123064622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123064622<\/a><br>I like this.

For most of western history average people only had rights in their local communities, and any outsider, whether Christian or Jew, would have lower status and fewer rights than the locals. In the classical period Jews could, and did, earn citizenship in the Roman Empire. In the medieval period Christian serfs often had fewer rights than Jews, as they were bound to the land they worked for their lord and so could not even leave if mistreated. <br><br>Infact at times Jews had it no worse, or had it better, than other groups on the margins of society. Christians were persecuted far worse by the Roman Empire than Jews during the early Christian era, not to mention facing worse from the Muslims for most of history. The Nazis gleefully butchered Slavs and Gypsies along side the Jews during the holocaust. <br><br>You need to remember that everytime non-Jews hear your complaints of victimization, we can&#039;t help but take notice of how you focus on your suffering while ignoring that of others.

Sadly, your own comments in this thread show a lack of understanding of western culture and the place of the Jews as a people simultaneously within and apart from the west. I can&#039;t blame you for that, as no one really teaches western culture anymore. Western values and heritage have been banished from academia and pop culture by the left. Those of us raised in christian families still get the essence from our parents, but anyone else won&#039;t really understand the society they are living in. <br><br>This is why I recommend studying western philosophy, religion, and history. You should try to focus on pre-WW2 sources, as they will be less corrupted by the left. You should even try a serious study of antisemitism. Go beyond the absurd conspiracy theories and look at the other arguments and accusations made by anti-semites in the context of western culture. If you can understand why ordinary westerners might be persuaded by antisemitic rhetoric, without simply writing them off as stupid, crazy, or evil. when it works on the masses, antisemitism functions on the basis of appeals to western values. If you can understand that appeal, then you&#039;ll be halfway towards an argument based on western values which can persuade people away from antisemitism.","time":1493315991,"resto":123033535,"id":"tHV9\/2Zx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123065018,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)14:06:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123047469\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123047469<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Where do you think you got your values?<\/span><br>christ. then you killed him for it. mix it with our white dna. game set match. now leech off us more, little judeo boi.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The irish experienced the same thing<\/span><br>no they did not. they experienced jewish bankers invading their island to rid them of their superior religious views. don&#039;t for a second compare yourselves to irish, or niggers. for you, jew, are below them both.","time":1493316365,"resto":123033535,"id":"ZmrWxpgW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123065207,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)14:07:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123064143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123064143<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;without any regard to the fact that your people&#039;s suffering is far from unique.<\/span><br>Doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s not suffering.

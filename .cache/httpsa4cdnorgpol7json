But there really is a point to it. A huge part of Trump&#039;s strategy is making sure that no one knows exactly what Trump is going to do next except for Trump. During the campaign there was a ton of times that he seemed like he was suiciding his campaign but then actually came out stronger. Its only reasonable that he would have that same mentality during his presidency. Im cautiously optimistic that this whole airstrike fiasco was for political reasons and that he&#039;s setting the stage for broader strategy that we can&#039;t really make out as the general public. All the talk about getting rid of Assad suddenly, is probably just talk. Trump well-known to say outrageous things to stir up a controversy then back off. Its possible that the threats of ousting Assad might be just to fire up the debate about it so theres more room to navigate the situation. Because right now he can&#039;t do anything in the middle east without liberals causing an uproar.","time":1491613590,"resto":120032407,"id":"ZGuI5ga5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120059843,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)21:09:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Reminder they just want to strip Trump off his base support so they can take action s against him once noone supports him anymore<\/span><br><br>Who&#039;s they?

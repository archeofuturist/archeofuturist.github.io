How did you become so self-important? A bunch of real degenerates whispered poison in your ears while becoming your only community, your only &quot;friends&quot;.

Lousy art here becomes less of an isolated phenomenon and more of a natural end point for all these circles crashing into one another. And modern art, also being its own thing, emans it is rolled back into those communities amplifying your worst aspect then roll it back into art.<br>So essentially you have an urban pressure cooker to turn your typical aspiring artist bullshit into honest to god lunacy.

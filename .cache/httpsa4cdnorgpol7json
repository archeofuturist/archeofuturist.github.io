You bred apathy in the norm and those who actually cared about the world were pushed into darkness to think of a way to change what was happening. Instead of joining the change you formed formal opposition like the social justice movement, BLM and Antifa in attempts to breed more discontent for organized justice.

You tried to push the idea of not taking responsibility for your actions and enabling horrendous behavior.

And for good reason; a progressive tax rate is just sane given that it reduces income inequality, expects larger contributions from those who&#039;ve disproportionately benefitted from being a part of society, and because the wealthier you are, each additional dollar produces less of a difference in terms of security and living standards. But it can still be nuanced to incentive economic competition.<br><br>Cutting the corporate tax rate to below the income tax rate of the middle class and expecting growth to eclipse any resultant deficit is the definition of trickle down economics.<br><br>And government spending isn&#039;t evil; if we expanded Medicaid to include everyone, we would be able to vastly reduce the size of an entire middle-man industry that generates nothing in contributing to healthcare delivery but skims a as much as they can get away with off the top of every payment made to actual providers of care. An insurance pool that includes everyone would have immense negotiating power; more than any private pool. And people would be able to start businesses, be entrepreneurial, creative, and innovative on the basis of their talents rather than their health risks. You know, the things that drive a knowledge-economy.

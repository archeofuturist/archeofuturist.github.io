I understand that they control the financial system and key political and administrative positions, but how have anti-coup\/terrorist failsafe systems not been triggered in l&amp;e or the military ?. Im half suprised that they havnt been identified as a terrorist network moving in for a coup, and that black ops style crackdowns havnt started.

My question is how, today in the age of fast information exchange, has this unholy trinity not been identified by your police force and military. The khazarian aristocratic bloodlines in control of the global financial system work covertly through the inteligence agencies to exact acts of terror upon civiliian populations. They even work to undermine state soveriegnty from within. We can see how they do this pretty clearly. My question is why has your police force and military anti-domestic terror networks not identified them as the primary threat ? its well known they did 9\/11, the boston bombings ect. Its well known that they plan on other huge attacks against the population. They meet all the criteria of a fundamentalist religious cult (read the protocalls of Zion). So i wonder why your anti-terror security state doesnt communicate horizontally and take the exact same action it would in a wartime situation (round up all known members and associates in a mass black op ect)","time":1491841824,"resto":120453900,"id":"G5lEhQhE","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120456227,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)12:38:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"How to successfully categorise and legitimate the conception of this cult as the primary domestic terrorist threat is the conservation we should be having.

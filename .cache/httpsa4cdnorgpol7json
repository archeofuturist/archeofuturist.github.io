to love the daily and all those comedians. i don&#039;t know what happened exactly: i changed, they changed, or the world changed. but things are different now. he repeats a lie, and then tries to make a joke out of it with a punch line. it used to be that you told a truth, and then the punchline would be not true. but he keeps repeating the lies about russia, and everything else. i hate this because it doesn&#039;t make me laugh, and it doesn&#039;t make me laugh because he is full of shit, like the rest of the comedians now. he is not funny because they have co-opted laughter for sinister and evil purposes. but if they at least told the truth about their intentions... i don&#039;t know where to go from here.","filename":"Pepe knight

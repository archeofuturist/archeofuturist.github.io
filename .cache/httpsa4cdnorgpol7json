prophecy has come true","com":"You don&#039;t have to believe me \/pol\/, but i have been witnessing every major cosmic happening since the 2012 happening.<br><br>The egyptians told us a code with their pyramids, the mayans with their calendar.<br><br>The last and final chapter will not be a world war, but global destruction caused by cosmic events, repeating itself every 25.000 years since the dawn of time.<br>I was fascinated about the mayan calendar, but i was disappointed that nothing happened that day.<br><br>So i started digging, because it HAD to mean something.<br>It all came to an end with the bloodmoon 2015.<br>Shortly after a solar eclipse became visible in germany too, i saw both things with my own eyes.<br><br>It was beautiful, but so many foretold cosmic happenings in less than a decade?<br><br>Than it came to me like a lightning.<br><br>All the human happenings now are just the natural response of our global unconscious awareness of the changes in the matrix, the universe, the sub level of existence that happened with the eclipse, the 2012 happening and so on.<br><br>And ((them)) know about it, they are fueling war and hate now, to distract us from the real threat that is about to approach. <br><br>A polar shift, a hidden planet are the most likely things to happen.<br><br>But since our forefathers described it that great and detailed, i think a hidden planet will come by and it fucks up our weather, our gravitation etc, which will lead to floods, earthquakes, super volcanos etc. <br><br>But it will not hit us, like it never did before.<br><br>This will lead to global chaos, and it is us who have to seek the opportunity and create out of chaos, a better, harmonic world, and not repeat it all again like our ancestors and we, did.<br><br>All of this will happen shortly after easter, many false flags, fake news will come, no one will know the truth, but you will.<br><br><br>Pic related i took, the second sign

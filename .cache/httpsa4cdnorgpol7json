Although discussion and reasoning can sometimes bring them around, again, it is not our obligation. If their faith is true and they are only having a brief lapse, then Trump&#039;s mastery of 13th-dimensional chess (as with the recent healthcare &quot;flop,&quot; parading Romney around, etc) and our own strength and comradeship will rekindle the flame.<br><br>Spooks and their lackeys are the trickiest of the heathens. Kek has revealed to us that our most sacred board has become a testing ground for their psyops. They try to instill doubt in our God Emperor, mock him, belittle him. They steal our memes and try to turn them back on us. They know fully what they do, they are paid to do it, and they are consistently trying to perfect their craft. They see Trump and us as a threat. Reasoning and arguing will not work; their words are empty and meant only to confuse and deceive. They succeed by convincing or distracting us, both of which require us to give them attention. Deny them their (You)s. Let their blasphemies fall on deaf ears. Let them wonder if their schemes are succeeding or failing as they try to interpret their lack of responses.","filename":"pepe army","ext":".png","w":657,"h":527,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1490563658813,"time":1490563658,"md5":"huNf1zcR6stE68+aF0tMiw==","fsize":175014,"resto":118417748,"id":"6r1TGBZC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118381075,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)12:43:20","name":"Anonymous","sub":"ZYCLON BEN","com":"IS AT IT AGAIN","filename":"bengarrison","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1332,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":173,"tim":1490546600624,"time":1490546600,"md5":"PrBWmnBhR7Bxsq6pE4fefg==","fsize":697223,"resto":0,"id":"iIrYCDgv","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"zyclon-ben","country_name":"United States","replies":255,"images":82,"omitted_posts":250,"omitted_images":81,"tail_size":50},{"no":118417171,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:18:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118415345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118415345<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118416406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118416406<\/a><br>low energy posts","time":1490563117,"resto":118381075,"id":"oKAAbJUz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118417304,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:19:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118399525\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118399525<\/a><br>I think what changed was that after about two years of being pissed at us for the edits, pic related got back to him.","filename":"Hey Rabbi","ext":".jpg","w":1549,"h":1627,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490563176384,"time":1490563176,"md5":"QzKCd6FQuKtSgEwaEX2GFA==","fsize":619146,"resto":118381075,"id":"WOU7p\/0V","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118417551,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:21:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118382181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118382181<\/a><br>Hey, you tried.

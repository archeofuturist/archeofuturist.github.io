Schopenhauer is the father of subjectivism, one of the first discoverers of the Faustian will in humanity. He believed that everything that exists for us as humans is actually nothing more than our will to see everything the way we see it. the world is a complex system of ideas which we organize through our own will. Thus Schopenhauer had to attack the old liberal form of German patriotism which proofed itself as a patriotism for the masses. A true patriot is an individualist, a personality. he doesnt embrace a Vaterland to feel better, but he does embrace a Vaterland because he knows it is an eternal part of him. The same think you will read in Nietzsches works - Schopenhauer was one of Nietzsches most important &quot;mentors&quot;. <br><br>thinkers like Schopenhauer, Nietzsche and others were fed up with the so called &quot;hurra-patriotism&quot;, the kind of patriotism you can witness at sport events and festivals, even though it does not mean that they were against ones love for their family, people and nation. <br><br>You also have to keep in mind that Schopenhauer was a lifetime renegade in German society; he got a lot of shit from retarded mainstream Hegel fankids and couldnt get a grip on German universities. He also hated his mother. <br><br>tldr: He was pissed at everything.","time":1490882792,"resto":118910511,"id":"wp86lt6d","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118923939,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)10:12:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118910511\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118910511<\/a><br><br>get bent german faggot","filename":"Stephen Decatur","ext":".jpg","w":850,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":58,"tim":1490883126973,"time":1490883126,"md5":"xoGBOhkPKQD9oOIfBtv2QA==","fsize":44569,"resto":118910511,"id":"9RBYHxKR","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":118924159,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)10:14:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118923939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118923939<\/a><br>interesting nose","time":1490883287,"resto":118910511,"id":"wp86lt6d","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118924456,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)10:18:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118924159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118924159<\/a><br><br>not an argument","filename":"Charles Lindbergh","ext":".jpg","w":850,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":58,"tim":1490883510535,"time":1490883510,"md5":"\/ffmUu2YgBAYZIwtquXXAw==","fsize":81244,"resto":118910511,"id":"9RBYHxKR","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118924446,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)10:18:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=4zL<wbr>fCnGVeL4","filename":"160927210830-tk-ah0927-exlarge-169","ext":".jpg","w":780,"h":438,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490883499020,"time":1490883499,"md5":"To3L5T4oLA+V5edBM4QhcQ==","fsize":35527,"resto":0,"id":"oPkoJqXc","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"","country_name":"Poland","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":118925409,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)10:29:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118924446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118924446<\/a><br><br>disturbed","filename":"1482570992498","ext":".gif","w":480,"h":270,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490884163003,"time":1490884163,"md5":"Pod+0bp5kff6Ho1i8\/gfZg==","fsize":2030387,"resto":118924446,"id":"oPkoJqXc","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"}]}]}

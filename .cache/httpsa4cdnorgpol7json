How words evolved to the modern form we see\/hear today and how their meaning changed through the ages. How different languages have common origins or how apparently vastly different languages have things in common. How language shapes the culture of the people who speak it and vice versa. The field is all but small.<br><br> It is no different than studying nature, only that you are studying a construct of a part of nature (human construct), not how nature works (physics) or how to use it (engineering).<br><br>I am an electrical engineer and I find studying a language quite fascinating. You get to see how another people think and express themselves, how their culture seethes through their language and in turn, how my own language works. <br><br>Of course, for every genuine linguist with a PhD that shows real interest in the field there are hundreds if not thousands of people who just went to study a language to get a relatively easy diploma.","filename":"1434312090813","ext":".png","w":500,"h":371,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1492720581316,"time":1492720581,"md5":"EtjEgs5R\/cE1uF2FH9\/UgQ==","fsize":211474,"resto":122029350,"id":"xUmtrGWo","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":122040160,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:37:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122036728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122036728<\/a><br>flawed argument, the fields on the left teach communism","time":1492720638,"resto":122029350,"id":"cmBl+oNc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122035183,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:03:40","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/rg\/ - REGRET GENERAL","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;no wall<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;she is not in prison<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;betraying his promise on Syria<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shitty little &quot;&quot;muslim ban&quot;&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;israel is our greatest ally <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tiny inauguration audience <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bannon about to get sacked <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;disavowed the pro-white, ethno-nationalist Alt-Right <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no mass deportations<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no proof for wiretap<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;M.O.A.B FAILURE<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;liberals still laughing at Trump supporters<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no drain the swamp<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cucked on obamacare<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cabinet full of globalists and billionares (DRAIN THE SWAMP FAIL)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;most hated president in history<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no reversal of the demographic shift<\/span>","filename":"1492669477968","ext":".jpg","w":349,"h":394,"tn_w":221,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492718620324,"time":1492718620,"md5":"RRIHBEi4DHrZloTtjxsCdA==","fsize":43817,"resto":0,"id":"17w\/rVGM","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"rg-regret-general","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":6,"omitted_posts":7,"omitted_images":2},{"no":122038099,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:23:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122035681\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122035681<\/a><br><br>kys you fucking degenerate faggot.","filename":"1487491273837","ext":".jpg","w":251,"h":251,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492719794201,"time":1492719794,"md5":"p2HUEonj31R8vF8BRsVUbQ==","fsize":7638,"resto":122035183,"id":"Ik\/xooo5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122038482,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:25:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122035183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122035183<\/a><br>Cease your faggotry.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Same pasta 4 times a day.<\/span><br><br>Saged","time":1492719956,"resto":122035183,"id":"LVPC8r0E","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":122039978,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:36:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122035183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122035183<\/a><br>have some self respect","time":1492720571,"resto":122035183,"id":"T\/UaUUAC","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":122040130,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:37:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122038099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122038099<\/a><br>Kill Yourself is two words not three underaged reddit trash.","time":1492720628,"resto":122035183,"id":"zTmUHNRb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122040425,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:39:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122035183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122035183<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;betraying his promise on Syria<\/span><br><br>he made no such promise, shill<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cabinet full of globalists and billionares (DRAIN THE SWAMP FAIL)<\/span><br><br>I can tell you&#039;re a Bernout.","time":1492720755,"resto":122035183,"id":"4Bcpn1dK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122040126,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:37:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Everyone is aware the the muzzies have chaches of weapons all over europe.

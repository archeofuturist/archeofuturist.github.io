Funny thing, whatever things we circlejerk about on \/pol\/ in the end for me, it will always boil down to &quot;Where did we as a humanity failed&quot;. When looking for music on the YT I&#039;ve stumbled upon this song (the post theme) and It had the same effect on me like on the most people in the comments, like this kind of &quot;the future that never was&quot; feel, which probably was due to the accompanying visuals. So I&#039;ve decided to look into it more and somehow I&#039;ve got even more sad.<br><br>While in no way I am defending the Soviet Union or whatever, there was this one thing they got extremely right. This behavioral conditioning\/programing (Behavioral Psychology and Philosophy) where they tried to nurture the dreamers in the kids (the ethics of it is questionable) there are tons of these animations for kids about space travel, the bright and just future and shit and some even with a deeper underlying philosophical meaning. Like this one for example, memes aside it&#039;s worth a watch https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NnJ<wbr>btbh4tDE<br><br>So like I said earlier, I still don&#039;t get where we as a humanity have failed, because those exact kids from USSR have turned into alcoholics and just in general into trash. And I wonder why, did not this approach work? Or was it the too much of a difference with the possible future and the available means, or was it the ultimate destruction of one generation. Again, we are looking at it from the scientific point of view and this case is extremely unique.<br><br>And with all of this, when compared even with the shows I grew up on (which were mostly shit) not to mention this complete degeneracy Pregnant Elsa and Spiderman vids on YT makes me weep for the future even more.

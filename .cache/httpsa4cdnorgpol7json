If either are taken out millions would not only die because of the blast but any government institutions powered by such plants would be crippled. If Hoover dam is hit, radiation will be spread through the rivers even faster than by the wind. That is to say, if they didn&#039;t decide to do a high altitude detonation, causing an emp.

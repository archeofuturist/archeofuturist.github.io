Moreover, there are just so many cases, over such a wide geographic range, through hundreds of years that it is undeniably true. This isn&#039;t a pattern of antisemitism. There are patterns to the physical evidence. <br><br>You have babies drained of blood in multiple countries over a long period of time. You have adolescent boys stabbed dozens of times, many of whom were circumcised when they were killed. These aren&#039;t patterns of random deaths being blamed on jews. Moreover, most people were illiterate, even books let alone news were very rare, so the idea that people isolated from each other by time, language, and space would all report that jews were killing children in very specific ways (including finding bodies) is undeniable evidence that this was an occult ritual of certain jewish sects. That or time traveling serial killers. Antisemitism certainly doesn&#039;t fit the overall pattern.<br><br>Liberal academics and jews will cherry pick a couple of these cases and &quot;debunk&quot; them.

When he went missing, they searched Koppin&#039;s home and found Hugh in the well. He had ritual torture marks that recreated what Jesus went through. There was a crown of thorn with the body. This is enough circumstantial and physical evidence to convict someone today. What do liberals and jews do? They delete the facts. They only speculate, without any evidence, about torture and false confessions. They are scum who cover up the torture and murder of children! <br><br>Children like Hugh were punctured dozens of times to bleed them to death, slowly, while completing the occult ritual. There are several cases like Hugh. What do liberal academics and jews say about this? They absurdly demand skeletal damage, which would not be expected given the recorded ritual. These weren&#039;t violent stab wounds that would leave the victim dead quickly and injure bone.

The next rock I found is also hard. And the next, and the next, and the next. <br>So I can create an hypothesis : rocks are hard. This gets tested over and over, and no-one else found a rock that isn&#039;t hard. Therefore, we have a theory: all rocks are hard. Now why don&#039;t we call it a fact that rocks are hard? Because we can&#039;t test every single rock in the entire universe to test if they are all hard, therefore it can&#039;t be a fact. It&#039;s a model for reality, the closes thing to a fact that we have. <br>Now suppose that someone does find a rock that isn&#039;t hard. Does that mean that the theory is incorrect? Yep. And it gets revised, so that we can explain why that one rocj isn&#039;t hard. So suppose that we found that the explanation is that hard rocks have lots iron in them, and soft rocks have lots of aluminum. After testing this over and over again, we have a new theory, again not a fact, that explains that some rocks are hard because of X, and other rocks are soft because of why. It may very well be that there are soft rocks with lots of iron in them, which will trigger another reevaluation of the theory, so it cannot be called a fact. <br><br>This is why we can&#039;t call something a fact, even with overwhelming evidence, like in the case of evolution. We can call facts only observations (like that car is yellow - fact. The reason why some cars are yellow and others are other colors - theory). <br><br>(the example and the elements are only used to illustrate the concept)","time":1491456417,"resto":119681313,"id":"l\/CWDGsg","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119709999,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:27:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119709529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119709529<\/a><br><br>Question: the expansion of the universe appears to be accelerating.

As such, he is more likely to lift heavy weights, run fast, eat well, wear properly fittingclothes, and fashily cut his hair in a nod to Germany\u2019s golden age.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. Family-Focused<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The perpetuation of the white race is of paramount importance to Alt-Right men, which means theyall want to see MOAR WHITE BABIES<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3. Savages<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Veterans of the Great Meme War will tell you that uncucking our people, online and IRL, is a long, hard slog.

They\u2019ve quitthe sorcery of the Jew Tube, ditched the noggery of professional sports, decried the foul beast that is pornography, and would ideally homeschool their many children so they don\u2019t fall prey to the false teachings of diversity.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;7.

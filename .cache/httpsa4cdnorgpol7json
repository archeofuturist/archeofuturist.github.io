Lair was placed on administrative leave the next day, an East Central Independent School District statement said.<br><br>A district spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for additional information, including what day the educator resigned, or how the high school was notified. <br><br>The relationship allegedly began Nov. 18 and lasted until March 2, according to an East Central Police Department report obtained by mySA.com.<br><br>A cached version of the East Central High School website shows Lair taught there for four years, coached the cheerleading squad and was married. <br><br>Several agencies are looking into the case: the East Central Police Department is conducting an investigation, the findings of which will be given to the Bexar County District attorney&#039;s Office. The Texas Education Agency was also notified.<br><br>If convicted, Lair would join a growing list of educators in Bexar County and the state found to be participating in an inappropriate relationship with a student.<br><br>Using an Austin American-Statesman database built with TEA data, mySA.com found 63 San Antonio-area teachers lost their teaching certificates after being investigated in an improper relationship case between 2010 and 2016. Additionally, 24 of those teachers were charged criminally.","filename":"im hot for teacha","ext":".jpg","w":920,"h":710,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1491223052214,"time":1491223052,"md5":"wXrZc7N1dGdJl6s2aLObgw==","fsize":43769,"resto":119320813,"id":"noQFrnGQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119323786,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:42:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"im amazed how many reports there are in a single week<br><br>american education has a substantial pedo problem","time":1491223368,"resto":119320813,"id":"noQFrnGQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119324312,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:48:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119321574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119321574<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Consent is not a defense against a felony sexual assault charge, Isaza said.<\/span><br><br>Explain yourself","time":1491223699,"resto":119320813,"id":"nJfLCxwp","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119324281,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:48:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Are they, dare I say it \/ourguys\/?","filename":"nivea","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491223684046,"time":1491223684,"md5":"nEjWeMhDbxLowTYnjJTvNQ==","fsize":135357,"resto":0,"id":"7SZmbT5I","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-they-dare-i-say-it-ourguys","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":119324276,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:48:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Post intelligent hollyjew actors that go against (((them)))","filename":"Mel_Gibson_Cannes_2016_3","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":311,"tn_w":176,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491223680066,"time":1491223680,"md5":"znyZMYvxFipynII6RT6DQA==","fsize":15350,"resto":0,"id":"WVcTz0gQ","country":"GR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"post-intelligent-hollyjew-actors-that-go-against","country_name":"Greece","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":119321575,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:19:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;can&#039;t ban muslims<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;can&#039;t repeal Obamacare<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mexico isn&#039;t paying for the wall<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;removing net neutrality<\/span>","filename":"1487471018399","ext":".jpg","w":582,"h":491,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":210,"tim":1491221963758,"time":1491221963,"md5":"P9mdL8Q6KHWkqCX8lLAG9w==","fsize":43469,"resto":0,"id":"9Zi3JZVf","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cant-ban-muslims","country_name":"Australia","replies":11,"images":3,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":3},{"no":119323872,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:43:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119322043\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119322043<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;being this delusional<\/span>","filename":"images","ext":".jpg","w":275,"h":183,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491223434420,"time":1491223434,"md5":"SUysByRgqMXr0PdJihs9lA==","fsize":6209,"resto":119321575,"id":"9Zi3JZVf","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119324160,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:46:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119323872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119323872<\/a><br>Wow brilliant counter argument my dude.

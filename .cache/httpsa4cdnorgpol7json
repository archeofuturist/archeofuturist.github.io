The tyrannical sectarian group managed to reduce much of Europa to ruin during their 68 year reign of occupation. By importing a surplus population of troglodytes from the third world into the thriving western cultures of their unsuspecting victims and venerating the cultist ideologies of Karl Mark via the clever, and innocuously soft language of &quot;Multiculturalism&quot; and by championing the false-god of Political correctness all the while poisoning the individual cultures and societies they had chosen to bring to heel. <br><br>Many are shocked to discover that this is indeed an early hand drawn charcoal sketch, produced by none other then the legendary French renaissance-man, Pepe LeKek. Spectacularly depicted in this timeless piece is a communist shill voting against Marine Le Penin during the Presidential Primary. Truly a National Treasure, and an appropriate addition to the Louver; truly genious! (though it goes without saying that this is the natural position of any patriot regarding the corpus of Pepe&#039;s works) It would take a true philistine to overlook the deeply esoteric symbolism hiding in plain sight within the pieces very title. This is truly the rarest Pepe of them all.

As fetuses develop, all are outfitted with the anatomical precursors to nipples, although they only offer a direct reproductive advantage to women for feeding their babies. But since that&#039;s such a favorable trait, evolution didn&#039;t go to the painstaking trouble of weeding nipples out of the male population. In other words, men have nipples because women do. Likewise, clitoral and penile tissues are borne of the same embryological stuff, developing into one or the other once biological sex traits set in. The hooded glans, packed with 8,000 nerve endings, is just the visible tip of the internal clitoral structure that extends up and around the vagina and engorges during arousal much like the penis [source: Gonzalez]. Therefore, female orgasms could exist because that clitoral anatomy was under no evolutionary pressure to disappear.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/health.howstuffworks.com\/se<wbr>xual-health\/sexuality\/orgasm4.htm<\/span><br><br>Thoughts?","filename":"Female-Oshot-Pleasure-Orgasm-570x400","ext":".jpg","w":570,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":175,"tim":1490588222045,"time":1490588222,"md5":"BonBjzzes4fjJS5SapcDbw==","fsize":33495,"resto":0,"id":"NxYLY4mH","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"female-orgasm-nothing-more-than-a-byproduct-or","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":0,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":0},{"no":118473092,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:49:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118469869\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118469869<\/a><br>all foetus start as female and half get the male upgrades... women are the base <br><br>so male orgasm would be a by product of the female orgasm <br><br>we orgasm because it helps drive us to fuck each other which make babies \\\\<br><br>not sure what all this other shit you are talking about is though...","time":1490590165,"resto":118469869,"id":"hurMRBT9","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118473189,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:50:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118469869\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118469869<\/a><br><br>Lol.

In 1795 he moved his family to the Niagara region of Upper Canada after he had applied for and received a land grant. Shortly after, Laura married Loyalist James Secord, who was later seriously wounded at the Battle of Queenston Heights early in the War of 1812. While he was still recovering in 1813, the Americans invaded the Niagara Peninsula, including Queenston. During the occupation, Secord acquired information about a planned American attack, and stole away on the morning of 22 June to inform Lieutenant James FitzGibbon in the territory still controlled by the British. The information helped the British and their Mohawk warrior allies repel the invading Americans at the Battle of Beaver Dams.<\/span><br><br>I&#039;m still triggered by this though.","time":1490590330,"resto":118471185,"id":"fZFSmt9j","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118452032,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)21:35:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Even normies can&#039;t escape the Bogs","filename":"IMG_5194","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":1334,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490578517496,"time":1490578517,"md5":"v\/VNwDtcMwKQtakkTZd5Ug==","fsize":181525,"resto":0,"id":"kCHRtXJD","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"even-normies-cant-escape-the-bogs","country_name":"United States","replies":74,"images":37,"omitted_posts":69,"omitted_images":34},{"no":118472459,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:42:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118472007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118472007<\/a><br>(cont.)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bogdanoff says he&#039;s on his way after she mentions &quot;pizzagate&quot; like she doesn&#039;t know what it means<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Door to our ruined office opens instantaneously<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Both Bogdanoffs walk in, the one asking her questions and the other asking me.

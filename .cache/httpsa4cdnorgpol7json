I was thinking about this. The major problem all countries with aging population have is social security and savings. Social security isn&#039;t sustainable with aging population. If savings are rewarded, I mean, if inflation is low or negligible, the old people can have something to rely on when they can&#039;t work.<br>Long term investment in your own savings gives you time to live and some capital to pass on to the newer generations. So, in a rich country like Japan, which has capacity to support 170 million people, when its population reaches 80 million, housing will be cheaper, the younger will have their parents money and other things they inherited. This younger generation with additional capital can be more prosperous than the older. They can thrive and finally succeed in achieve a good fertility rate that can sustain itself or maybe grow.<br>But for this to happen, it is absolutely necessary to abolish social security programs and lower the inflation.<br><br><a href=\"#p119327744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119327744<\/a><br>Shut up leaf","time":1491226451,"resto":119317092,"id":"+VkIqOTb","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119330975,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)10:00:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119328516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119328516<\/a><br>Right on the money.

Why do they keep dropping the mask? It&#039;s like they can&#039;t pretend to be nice for more than a few days before the rage takes over again. <br><br>Another example is Obama, during his 2008 campaign he said that rural redneck types were suffering due to poor economic conditions so it was no wonder they clung do god, guns and hating gays and he got a very light golf clap of applause, but then when Hillary did the whole &quot;BASKET OF DEPLORABLES, IRREDEEMABLE TRASH ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HISTORY, WHEN IM IN POWER I&#039;M GOING TO FORCE THE ISSUE AND SHIT ALL OVER THE THINGS YOU LOVE&quot; and she was greeted with wild wooping and applause. Slay queen slay. Liberals mocked Romney for two hours straight for adopting a black child, making all kinds of horrible comments about child molestation and inbreeding and such and it&#039;s just like holy shit, why can&#039;t they even pretend to be human?","filename":"olbermann","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":219,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":182,"tim":1491228379593,"time":1491228379,"md5":"uKhVGu7gLUa9yI6YNfehGg==","fsize":13731,"resto":0,"id":"1+gviJ5C","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-are-lefties-so-shitty-at-hiding-their-power","country_name":"Canada","replies":11,"images":2,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":1},{"no":119332243,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)10:14:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119331713\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119331713<\/a><br>go back to your free upboats on r\/politics faggot","filename":"1412458291013","ext":".jpg","w":717,"h":880,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491228843104,"time":1491228843,"md5":"6x6wa1bZo8Mwf2OXiY5sug==","fsize":161553,"resto":119331559,"id":"ZoruOLGl","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119332405,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)10:15:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119332166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119332166<\/a><br><br>Okay whatever, my thread was asking why lefties sperg the fuck out and start acting like sociopaths constantly.

In not being permitted to freely exclude, the incidence of bads-ill-behaved, lazy, unreliable, rotten students, employees, customers-will increase and property values will fall. In fact, forced integration (the result of all nondiscrimination policies) breeds ill behavior and bad character. In civilized society, the ultimate price for ill behavior is expulsion, and all-around ill-behaved or rotten characters (even if they commit no criminal offense) will find themselves quickly expelled from everywhere and by everyone and become outcasts, physically removed from civilization. This is a stiff price to paYi hence, the frequency of such behavior is reduced. By contrast, if one is prevented from expelling others from one&#039;s property whenever their presence is deemed undesirable, ill behavior, misconduct, and outright rotten characters are encouraged (rendered less costly).<br><br> Rather than being isolated and ultimately entirely removed from society, the &quot;bums&quot; -in every conceivable area of incompetency (bumhood)-are permitted to perpetrate their unpleasantries everywhere, so bum-like behavior and bums will proliferate.

The [post-] Keynesian consensus has been that moderate long term inflation and high public spending are both key to sustained economic prosperity. There is no evidence for any of this, it&#039;s just assumed; in fact, no studies have borne out any correlations which sustain it, nor could any analysis of the historical record fair better. In reality, GDP growth tracks better with resource access, demographic growth, political institutions (i.e. corruption, efficiency), and to a decent degree freedom. The thing with resource access is that it can be had now through global trade just about as well as through domestic production, so small countries with relatively sparse resources aren&#039;t hurt all that much as compared with early modern times when transaction costs were much higher.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic unrelated<\/span>","filename":"445979","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1493510804438,"time":1493510804,"md5":"Q8Z85u0\/UW1yHAQ9nglvTQ==","fsize":57344,"resto":123397751,"id":"ee9g95UW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123404686,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)20:08:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123402600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123402600<\/a><br>you&#039;re delusional if you think there will be a mass migration of Americans to Europe.

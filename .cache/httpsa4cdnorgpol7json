I don&#039;t know about this guy, should I consider him one of our own? I mean, on top of all of that shit, he was born a muslim. He isn&#039;t anymore, but still. Not middle eastern though. He told me that he some DNA test shit and got R1a1. Don&#039;t know what the fuck that means. I mean, the guys pretty fuckin cool, more red pilled than I am, but I just don&#039;t know whether he&#039;s my brother or not. With the nigs it&#039;s pretty easy, but this is a difficult one. I can give you more information about him if you like. What&#039;s your opinion on this guys?","filename":"SBPDL Racial Classification","ext":".png","w":1119,"h":1600,"tn_w":174,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490750896582,"time":1490750896,"md5":"H3WgbVQuhbVgPvlTT0JT8w==","fsize":1526143,"resto":0,"id":"ZzK6dkrN","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"noneuropean-whites","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":118730558,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)21:51:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118728073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118728073<\/a><br>Kys","time":1490752283,"resto":118728073,"id":"tlBUUuJ+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

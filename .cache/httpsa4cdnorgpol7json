He was not being combative he was just standing his position and circling watching everyone around him. His fight or flight system was working in overdrive but not to attack anyone. So I find it hard to believe he was a real threat to anyone. The thing is even if the was a threat to someone he was NOT the worst threat in this situation. The worst threat was a cop who broke the first rule of use of a firearm. YOU ALWAYS CHECK YOUR BACKGROUND!!!! The fucking dumbass cop fired a round at the chest of a kid who had a backdrop FULL of other kids. If the kid had moved even slightly too much that shot could have struck anyone behind him. If that round had passed through his body it could have still hit another kid. This cop was the most dangerous thing out there that day. There is no shooter out there who has had even a remote amount of training that will say this cop was following proper safe use of a firearm. The cop should be stripped of his badge and have charges pressed on him.","time":1492167114,"resto":121019706,"id":"A9mGK\/uK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121047433,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)06:57:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121019706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121019706<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what makes a school officer to shoot my son<\/span><br>hhaHAHA stupid crackwhore","time":1492167464,"resto":121019706,"id":"+9\/TAtDE","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":121047739,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:02:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121029195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121029195<\/a><br>Knife + wielder doesn&#039;t listen to verbal commands = shot.

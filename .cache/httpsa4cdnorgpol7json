Using the framework of Equations 1 and 3, what is likely to happen to total national production, total per capita income, and total income per household? <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A: The change in demographics implies an increase in the aggregate labor force as stay-at-home parents and spouses re-enter the workforce. That is, the labor force will grow, for some period of time, at a pace faster than underlying population growth until a new steady-state labor force participation rate is attained. Total economic production (and income) will thus also rise at an above-trend rate during this adjustment period. Above-trend growth in national income, holding population trends constant, means that per capita income will also grow above trend during this period of demographic adjustment. Per-household income, by contrast, will grow at a below-trend rate (and may even decline) due to an uptick in new household formation during the shift in divorce and separation rates to ultimately prevailing steady-state levels. <\/span><br><br><br>tl;dr: oy vey goyim, go divorce, take another mortgage real estate and keep pumping (((GDP)))","filename":"1365080991951","ext":".png","w":384,"h":469,"tn_w":204,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493058700792,"time":1493058700,"md5":"Fle7HFhZBCiB5SGVkdeXwQ==","fsize":8353,"resto":0,"id":"CsYModXp","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-studying-some-macroecon-now-take-a-look-at","country_name":"Poland","replies":4,"images":1},{"no":122619822,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)14:35:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122619277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122619277<\/a><br>That&#039;s one of the major flaws with Capitalism.

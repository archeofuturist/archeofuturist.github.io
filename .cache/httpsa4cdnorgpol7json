With the rise of facebook, tumblr, instagram, et. al social media, regular folks began to stick their noses into the internet and brought with them all the ugliness of modern society. While these sorts of people had always existed in one form or another, a light dripping became a deluge, and the old bulwarks of the online society crumbled. As the normies came in and staked their claim, clearing out the old ways where ever they clashed, their puppet masters and shadowy overlords followed them. These groups set up shop, doing what they do best. They seeded misinformation and lies to manufacture consent, whether it was to feed their consumer habits or solidiy power. In these dark times, the sanctitiy of anonymity has been replaced by cries of fake news, bots, and saboteurs. When an opinion rises that is unpopular, the op has to provide a burden of proof that they are a good person, otherwise they will be labelled a sexist, racist, snowflake, sjw, or any number of other attacks on identity. Even when the accuser agrees with the premise of an argument, they can&#039;t help but add in an extra strawman or slippery slope. <br><br>It seems the only defense against normies is being really fucking edgy. 4chan seems to be safe simply due to the volume of anime (fuck anime) and other nasty shit so that normies can&#039;t stick around for more than a few minutes. Even on reddit, edgy subs keep getting rko&#039;d whenever they start making a stir in the media or otherwise, but that&#039;s not really a suprise. Still, the risk of all the edgyness is that it takes a toll on the integrity of discussion. If we blindly oppose discussion simply because it&#039;s been tainted by the professional facebookers, or r\/redacted, doesn&#039;t that mean we have already lost?","filename":"JYdDnMW","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492461825370,"time":1492461825,"md5":"1SF2aUC8VRhw\/eg04a\/4Lw==","fsize":112222,"resto":121578768,"id":"OhiVRsyD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121580380,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:54:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"ok","time":1492462458,"resto":121578768,"id":"iIcIzSou","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121580606,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:55:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"alright","time":1492462551,"resto":121578768,"id":"LqbJE3eo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121565558,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)15:09:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Anyone else have the feeling it&#039;s going to be a very hot summer in Weimar America?","filename":"shortGuy4u","ext":".png","w":5224,"h":3889,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":186,"tim":1492456164900,"time":1492456164,"md5":"CuKSzu8JKONE3zXwqc4H4g==","fsize":4141226,"resto":0,"id":"Cde+klie","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"anyone-else-have-the-feeling-its-going-to-be-a","country_name":"United States","replies":85,"images":17,"omitted_posts":80,"omitted_images":17},{"no":121580021,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:51:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121579455\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121579455<\/a><br>your country is full of niggers and coalburners. :))))))","time":1492462312,"resto":121565558,"id":"\/Y0wNsTX","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":121580163,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:52:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121579075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121579075<\/a><br>hahahahahahhahaha","time":1492462372,"resto":121565558,"id":"AS0BI624","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121580300,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:53:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121578685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121578685<\/a><br>It&#039;s everything i wished for, thank you bruv","time":1492462426,"resto":121565558,"id":"rVJOnNB6","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121580362,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:54:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121565558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121565558<\/a><br>PJWs almost got it","filename":"1492460295255","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":320,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":64,"tim":1492462449699,"time":1492462449,"md5":"55QybeUszOSLL53s+Od21g==","fsize":88395,"resto":121565558,"id":"kcD9LBX8","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121580590,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:55:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121573616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121573616<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw 6&#039;1<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw wife is 6&#039;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw if wife puts on real heels I can feel what manlets feel.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw glad i&#039;m not a manlet but respect them for their disability and courage.<\/span>","filename":"1456603379313","ext":".gif","w":450,"h":281,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492462543932,"time":1492462543,"md5":"Jr\/w2L5dK6c7nFXHawE\/GQ==","fsize":811310,"resto":121565558,"id":"EkIG5ClY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121580384,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:54:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is pic related his endgame?

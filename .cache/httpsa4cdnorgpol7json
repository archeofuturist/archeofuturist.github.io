The early Warring States Period of them 6th c. BCE saw the construction of the first crossbows more than a century before they were ever mentioned by the Ancient Greeks. While the rest of the world was using papyrus, clay tablets, or vellum paper was invented and put into wide use in the 2nd c. CE - produced to cheaply that China was using toilet paper centuries before anyone in Europe had ever heard of the material. At least ostensibly it wouldn&#039;t he until the Battle of the Talas River in 751 CE that the Arabs would &quot;steal&quot; the secret of papermaking. Block printing and moveable-typeface logically followed in late Tang, sometime prior to the 868 printed publication of the \u91d1\u525b\u7d93 (Diamond Sutra). Paper money also, with experiments as easly as the mid-Tang and it really being rolled out during the Mongol Yuan Dynasty of the 13th and 14th centuries. Both the magnetic compass and weaponized gunpowder are also claimed by the Chinese, invented during the Song Dynasty. The compass, of course, would prove fundamental to the great Chinese voyages of exploration and trade under Admiral Zheng He in the early Ming Dynasty, while gunpowder would prove so formidable that the Song would drag the Mongol conquest of China out until from 1232 to 1276 - a truly stunning amount of time, given that the conquest of Kievan Rus took them 3 years (1237-40), Bulgaria took them a year (41-42), Anatolia in a year (1243), the Abbasid Caliphate another year (1258), and would prove the only nation targeted by Genghis personally that he did not see through to completion or near-completion. Speaking of the Mongols, they do what no one managed to do before of since - politically and economically unite almost the entirity of Asia through force of arms. Alexander, the Caesars, and Napoleon have got nothing on the Khans.","filename":"among other reasons","ext":".jpg","w":975,"h":672,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":172,"tim":1491445784153,"time":1491445784,"md5":"rqwN4DJ2XS0ICd4r729Y8w==","fsize":73472,"resto":0,"id":"GeWSz9+y","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"by-virtually-every-technological-marker-save-the","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":3,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":0},{"no":119693255,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:40:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119692137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119692137<\/a><br><br>Kind of puts the lie to &quot;whites are most creative&quot; if true","time":1491446419,"resto":119692137,"id":"WZnOq1ho","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119693838,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:45:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"*teleports behind you*<br><br>that&#039;s about all, peace out","filename":"nothin personnel","ext":".png","w":352,"h":417,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491446740474,"time":1491446740,"md5":"APaii9DGu0FHWFSDr6kjbA==","fsize":419989,"resto":119692137,"id":"UGOKObWW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119693970,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:46:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119692556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119692556<\/a><br>Fuckin this<br><br>fuck off 2 cent army troll","time":1491446817,"resto":119692137,"id":"hpFGz8uj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119694059,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:47:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Here get on this Chinese escalator <br>Oh shit!

White supremacists and liberal retards and fooling you idiots into thinking you&#039;re all going to be niggers by 2060. Do some research. <br><br>Here are the US census projections for 2060 - <br><br>* White (including Hispanic whites) 2060: 69%<br>* White (not inlcuding Hispanic) 2060: 43%<br>* Black\/African American 2060: 15%<br>* Hispanic\/Latino (includes white Hispanics) 2060: 31%<br>* Asian 2060: 8.2%<br>* Native American (the original people) 2060: 1.5%<br>* Hawaiian\/Pacific Islander 2060: 0.3%<br>* Two+ Races (me) 2060: 6.4%<br><br>About half of the &quot;Hispanics&quot; are going to be White people, including those blonde-haired blue-eyed &quot;Hispanics&quot; from Argentina and people like Ted Cruz. Only 15% will be actually brown, and only 6.4% of the population will be these mysterious brown-hybrids you keep talking about. <br><br>Wikipedia says the majority of Whites (including White Hispanics) will be 73.1% in 2050, down from 77.1% in 2015. Most of the population growth is going to be in big cities like NYC, Miami, LA (etc) and mainlaind and rural America will still be majority-White. <br><br>Also, non-Hispanic Whites will the minority by percentages (still more than double that of Blacks), but their numbers are never mentioned. For all we know there will be 200 mill Whites today and 200 mill Whites in the future, just more Latinos. <br><br>Also these projections can easily change in a number of ways, and as the NY Times said, they&#039;re completely unrealistic as racial categories are changing drastically (quick example, in 1960 I wouldn&#039;t have been White, nor would have the Irish, Italians, Russians, etc). <br><br>I&#039;ve got a lot more info about this but can&#039;t fit it all in.

Outside of Europe, they are very popular in some South American countries, notably in Argentina and Uruguay. Electronic bidet-integrated toilets, along with functions like toilet seat warmers, are commonly found in Japan.<br>In northern Europe, bidets are rare, although in Finland bidet showers are common.[7] Bidet showers are also common in South-East Asia, South Asia and parts of the Middle East.<br>In 1980, the first &quot;paperless toilet&quot; was launched in Japan by manufacturer Toto,[8] a combination of toilet and bidet which also dries the user after washing. These combination toilet-bidets (washlet) with seat warmers, or attachable bidets are particularly popular in Japan and South Korea, found in approximately 60% of households.[citation needed] They are commonly found in hotels and even some public facilities.

I personally see it as some sort of unholy mixture between the Old Regime and post-Napoleonic modern statism. Here&#039;s the thing: bad kings happen, history is full of them. But under traditional monarchy there were plenty of checks and balances to keep things more or less working.<br><br>The most important of these checks was the aristocracy: they were the actual owners of the land, not the crown. If the monarch went bad, aristocrats would revolt and try to either secede or claim the crown for themselves. The monarch was nothing without noble support, and the nobles gained legitimacy by supporting a respected crown.<br><br>Another factor was the Church. The power of the Pope was nothing to laugh at and only the most powerful kings dared to stand up against the Church. This seems funny nowadays, but back then a word from the Pope meant half your kingdom went up in flames by enraged Catholics.<br><br>A enlightened monarchy gets rid of all those checks and balances and leaves you in the hands of a despot, not a monarch.<br><br>Constitutional monarchism is a charade, a sham. A monarch under such political system is nothing but either a puppet of the state or a public figure not much different to the Reality TV celebrities that plague media. We monarchist don&#039;t just want a king, we want the feudal system back. Not out of romanticism, but out of respect to our own nature. It&#039;s no surprise fairytales have kings and dukes, but no secretaries of education.","filename":"royal-standard","ext":".jpg","w":214,"h":210,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":122,"tim":1490908179683,"time":1490908179,"md5":"BTkJJohA6OpeLYqoOftrZQ==","fsize":11272,"resto":118963635,"id":"QYdWqlP6","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118969249,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:10:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118968873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118968873<\/a><br>Exactly.

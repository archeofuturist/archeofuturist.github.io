It&#039;s crippling, it&#039;s not fun to have. Wanting to kill yourself is the most annoying feeling I could ever possibly describe. That being said I&#039;m a very religious person now and I see life as God&#039;s will and for me to kill myself would end any possible good I could possibly do in the future. If you understand that God allowed you to come into existence and if you know that he wants you to do good things within your existence then you should strive to do such at any point in your life. When you have no money, when you do have money, when you&#039;re homeless, when you have a mansion. You have the capacity to do good and make an impact anywhere on this planet because God allows you to. I believe that as fact but comment only with opinion. <br><br>Now relating to the first world bit, if you are in a position of wealth and or good capacity to give charity or some sort of good deeds then you should definitely do so at some point in your life. Good deeds are good deeds. You may or may not know the people you are kind towards but the actions are moral and there is a reason these interactions exist within our societies. Commit yourself to improving yourself and helping the people around your (family, friends, strangers) succeed in their life too. Your life has meaning because you are here on this planet. Solipsism is bullshit. Humanity was created with a purpose and we are will united with a spirituality that matches nothing else on the planet. Your life has meaning, don&#039;t let it go to waste.","time":1492233482,"resto":121169655,"id":"Xh4pBDnO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121172844,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:04:05","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Is this normal?","com":"Looks like there might be some shit about to pop off","filename":"IMG_2324","ext":".jpg","w":718,"h":1122,"tn_w":159,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492232645224,"time":1492232645,"md5":"NO1de5SuiItWO4ye+y+lcQ==","fsize":241779,"resto":0,"id":"F1D3pnrz","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-this-normal","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":10,"images":0,"omitted_posts":5,"omitted_images":0},{"no":121173316,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:09:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121172947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121172947<\/a><br>It would be interesting to live there, where there was no chance you&#039;d hear or sea a plane in the sky.<br><br>I wonder what that&#039;s like.","time":1492232965,"resto":121172844,"id":"uEI9lrq6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121173403,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:10:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fairly, yes.<br><br>What&#039;s not normal is the fact that Chinese state television reported earlier today that Air China is cancelling all flights to and from Pyongyang, effective Monday.","time":1492233033,"resto":121172844,"id":"gw4xjX5F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121173499,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:11:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121173316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121173316<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I wonder what that&#039;s like.<\/span><br><br>You can simulate the experience of being a North Korean by living in a tin shack in a remote part of Alaska and not eating for a month.","time":1492233095,"resto":121172844,"id":"zyFMwsQD","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121173603,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:12:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121172844\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121172844<\/a><br>SAME FUCKING THREAD EVERY DAY LMAO<br>HAHAHAHAHA IM SO ANGRY","time":1492233152,"resto":121172844,"id":"KVgPLWEd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121174052,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:17:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121173499\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121173499<\/a><br>Don&#039;t tempt me.

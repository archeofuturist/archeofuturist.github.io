They also see the responsibility for restoring the country\u2019s economic health as resting primarily with Europe, which is currently covering 80 percent of Greek debt.<br><br>At the same time, Greece, which has acceded to demands from the fund to cut spending and bring in more revenue, faces a 7 billion euro debt repayment in July, which it may not be able to meet if the I.M.F. and Europe cannot reach a new bailout agreement.<br><br>For example, the \u20ac30 billion the fund lent to Greece in 2010 was 30 times more than the sum of Greece\u2019s financial contribution to the fund as a member, which is called a quota. <br><br>Still, despite an unusual economic performance by Greece, which ended 2016 with a budget surplus of 3.9 percent of gross domestic product \u2014 the highest in recent memory for the notoriously profligate nation \u2014 I.M.F. officials conceded last week that they were not close to a deal.<br><br>The complexity of the Greek situation was nicely captured in a policy paper primarily written by Jeromin Zettelmeyer, a sovereign debt specialist (not least on Greece) who recently worked as a senior adviser in the German ministry for economic affairs.<br><br>The paper, which addresses the thorny question of how much debt relief Greece actually needs, was published by the Peterson Institute for International Economics this month, and has become required reading for policy makers on all sides of the Greek talks.<br><br>It made two critical points. It questioned Greece\u2019s ability to consistently deliver large enough budget surpluses to allow it to pay down its debt \u2014 which now stands at \u20ac326 billion, or 180 percent the size of the Greek economy.","filename":"parthenon","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":276,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":172,"tim":1492821426312,"time":1492821426,"md5":"lBVfIWSnv\/uim5VZGkPWNQ==","fsize":22320,"resto":0,"id":"9lzmj4bp","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"jews-torn-about-further-indebting-greece","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":122211912,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)20:54:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"The Jews will get what&#039;s coming to them for what they did to Greece.","time":1492822454,"resto":122210083,"id":"GhhmGiqp","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122210468,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)20:40:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"I wanted to ask <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/122193960#p122208159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122208159<\/a> the following question, but the thread was archived:<br><br>Since you&#039;re a lawyer can you tell me how strong the connection between the U-lock antifa and Eric Clayton is?<br><br>I mean, how much will everything \/pol\/ gathered so far hold in the courtroom?

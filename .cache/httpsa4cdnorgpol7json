This in time can only lead to conflict, civil war and maybe even the balkanisation of Europe into e.g. muslim vs. non-muslim sub-countries \/ regions. <br><br>3) I don&#039;t care. This still kind of puts me in the first category, because today the world is PC and leftist, even though it&#039;s changing fast. <br><br>4) I care about my country, and am thus confronted to the civic- vs. ethno- dilemma. <br><br>And of course there are all the nuances and combinations between these 4 possibilities.<br><br>But I personally am a civic nationalist, because ethno nationalism is simply unrealistic without a violent takeover, which would result in civil war between natives. That&#039;s the opposite of trying to make your nation thrive. <br><br>Efficient civic nationalism means the end of mass immigration and the mastery of boarders and currency. This will in time lead to more homogenous populations ethnically speaking. But more importantly, efficient CN is also full integration of minorities to our values and our life-styles, and the ability to deport those who cause problems.

They develop their own games. They play more together, so they can better develop psychosocial competencies.\u201d<br><br>According to Seifert, these competencies include understanding and liking oneself, having empathy for others, thinking creatively and critically, and being able to solve problems and overcome mistakes. And the sooner children learn such life skills, the better, according to Aktion Jugendschutz.<br><br>The toy-free kindergarten is not a new idea in Germany. It grew out of an addiction study group in the Bavarian district of Weilheim-Schongau that started meeting in the 1980s. The group included people who had worked directly with adult addicts and determined that, for many, habit-forming behavior had roots in childhood. To prevent these potential seeds of addiction from ever being planted, the researchers ultimately decided to create a project for kitas and kindergartens, which in Germany typically serve children ages 3 to 6, and remove the things children sometimes use to distract themselves from their negative feelings: toys.<br><br>The rules of the toy-free kindergarten are simple: For a period of three months, all the toys are removed, leaving only furniture and things like blankets and pillows. The teachers meet with the children and the parents before the toy-free time starts so they know what to expect, but once the project begins the teachers observe, rather than direct, the children\u2019s play. They let the children learn how to deal with their own boredom and frustration.","filename":"germantoys","ext":".jpg","w":1700,"h":1262,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":185,"tim":1490759808236,"time":1490759808,"md5":"KBwl92K5AP8MvA40+0G+Mg==","fsize":248446,"resto":0,"id":"R6djto\/F","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"germany-starts-toyfree-kindergartens","country_name":"United States","replies":310,"images":75,"omitted_posts":305,"omitted_images":74,"tail_size":50},{"no":118759827,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)03:15:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118754350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118754350<\/a><br>You have to go back filthy gommunist","time":1490771747,"resto":118743742,"id":"M3d4nO6T","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118759884,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)03:16:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118750224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118750224<\/a><br>No homeschooling allowed?","time":1490771812,"resto":118743742,"id":"M3d4nO6T","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118759916,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)03:17:25","name":"Anonymous","filename":"no fun allowed","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":634,"tn_w":118,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490771845125,"time":1490771845,"md5":"pX6AnuINSv0wybobz98Aqg==","fsize":99374,"resto":118743742,"id":"ZY3a6XXS","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":118760018,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)03:19:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118758115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118758115<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;too smart and unruly <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;still not on the top of the conspiracy<\/span><br>LEL","time":1490771947,"resto":118743742,"id":"Cc36q6zs","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118760152,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)03:21:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118759747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118759747<\/a><br>I absolutely adored the plane that came with that.

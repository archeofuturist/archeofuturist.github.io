You could only argue whether something had an effect on societal-evolutionary change or not and without the means to reproduce, you can never be sure. I recall one psychological experiment about the societal roles, where the students were supposed to be locked In a facility and randomly divided into prisoners and guards. The students that were designed to be prisoners got suddenly pushed into cells in handcuffs going through the procedures like any criminal would do and then they left and were looking how it would pick up from there. They had to scrap the experiment after few days because it became huge clusterfuck where people accepted their societal roles so well, that they were fucking with each other and prisoners have gave up on life completely.<br><br>While this may not be related, In my opinion is, there is this Societal Role that could be pushing you and requiring to behave with accordance to the norms, which would rule out the real evolutionary trait and it would be in fact just a mask, where you&#039;d get &quot;punished&quot; by not playing by the &quot;rules&quot; so it&#039;s just enforcing some artificial rules.<br><br>And even if you wanted to truly test something like that, in a long run, it would be considered highly unethical. Then again, I am afraid, that for some substantial leap, the humans would probably have to go to this lengths.

The former follows from the later, some groups of people are just more accepting of the conditioning or rules that society hands down and the societies reflect this. You can change the conditioning relatively easily but because society is dependent on the predispositions of it&#039;s population the change isn&#039;t persistent as you pointed out with the USSR and it&#039;s former states.

The way art speaks to us has exhausted its possible configurations. And I reiterate that there is nothing more to talk about.

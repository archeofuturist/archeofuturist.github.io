Please allow me to &quot;correct the record&quot;. For serious. <br><br>1. First and most important point. The USA did not declare war on Germany. Germany declared war on America, following America&#039;s declaration of war on Japan after the pearl harbor attacks. <br><br>2. US-German relations collapsed after Hitler invaded the Netherlands and Denmark. Before this incident, the USA was neutral with regards to Hitlers efforts to redraw the maps of Europe. It was Europes problem, not ours. However, after Hitler Signed the Tripartite Pact with Japan (An actual strategic enemy of America at the time), President Roosevelt guaranteed the independence of Denmark and the Netherlands. <br><br>Hitler invaded Denmark and the Netherlands, without provocation, anyway. Even extended it to Norway. In response, America invaded the Danish territories Greenland and Iceland, annexing them in all but name, and declared a special economic zone in the North Atlantic to be patrolled by the US Navy. A Zone Hitler challenged with Submarines, leading to repeated clashes with the US Fleet. <br><br>3. Lend Lease with the British Empire was enacted in response to Hitlers defiance of the guarantee on Denmark and the Netherlands. Hitler had shown no respect to legitimate US demands, and by challenging the seizure of Iceland by the US Marines, opened the door to the potential of challenging American suzerainty of the Dutch Colonies in the Caribbean and South America. An absolutely intolerable outcome. Combine this with Hitlers continued support of Japan as it menaced US interests in the Pacific, and the need for America to buttress the British becomes quite clear. <br><br>4. Germany&#039;s Declaration of War on America was followed swiftly by a series of Axis offensives on America&#039;s own colonies and strategic interests.

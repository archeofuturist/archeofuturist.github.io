At the time I took the survey almost 50 percent of the graduating class at Harvard was heading into finance. You can bet that the average senior at Harvard knows what Goldman Sachs is (and even what it means to make partner there), that McKinsey is so over (relative to careers in finance), what the difference is between a Rhodes, Marshall and Churchill scholarship, etc. etc. Very few state school kids do \u2026 Last year a physics student at Oregon won a Marshall to go to Cambridge. The administrators were happy about the PR.

But Twitter users were quick to point out its similarities to the Pepe cartoon:<br><br>Writer Meagan Fredette spotted the skirt and told Dazed: \u201cMy immediate thought was holy shit, they have no idea what they are doing here, do they?\u201d<br>The original link to the skirt on Zara\u2019s website now redirects to its front page.<br><br>A spokesperson for the company said the skirt has \u201cabsolutely no link\u201d to Pepe or the alt-right.<br><br>\u201cThe skirt is part of the limited Oil-On-Denim collection which was created through collaborations with artists and is only available in selected markets,\u201d the spokesperson said.<br>\u201cThe designer of the skirt is Mario de Santiago, known online as Yimeisgreat. Mario explores social interactions through his work and in his own words: \u2018The idea came from a wall painting I drew with friends four years ago.\u2019<br><br>\u201cThere is absolutely no link to the suggested theme.\u201d<br><br>Pepe the Frog was created by cartoonist Matt Furie, who originally envisaged him as a \u201cchill\u201d and \u201cgood-natured\u201d frog. However, over the course of the American electoral campaign, Pepe transformed from an amusing star of weird memes to a white supremacist symbol denounced by the Anti-Defamation League.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-19 at 8.56.35 AM","ext":".png","w":1252,"h":1346,"tn_w":232,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492606723827,"time":1492606723,"md5":"2w93x54c6vDzY\/3LUx0jcg==","fsize":1498003,"resto":0,"id":"\/rtRaW8C","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fashion-retailer-zara-pulls-skirt-after","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1},{"no":121841495,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:03:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121840997\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121840997<\/a><br>Sprry Zara, Jews have banned portrayals of frogs as anti-Semetic.

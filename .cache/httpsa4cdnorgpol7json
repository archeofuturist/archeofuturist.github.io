Statistics don&#039;t change minds in practice, but they are a good way to nail down an idea AFTER someone has partially bought into it. Never get angry. Never show frustration. You have to appear totally at ease with your opinions. Act fatalistic, and throw in some statements of self-doubt here and there to appear humble, and honest about areas if ignorance or uncertainty. Any admission on fallibility or ignorance on your part will not actually reflect badly on you because the other person will know (or assume) know know AT MOST less than you do, so they will see it as THEIR ignorance too, which will make them curious, and inclined to fill in blanks themselves. <br><br><a href=\"#p121517573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517573<\/a><br>Critical thought is a meme.

There is a risk of the alt-right doxxing individuals for the purposes of online harassment campaigns which can lead to off-line consequences.

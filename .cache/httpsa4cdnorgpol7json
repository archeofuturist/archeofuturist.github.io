If you see a contradiction you are merely seeing a lie.","com":"Is this true? I&#039;ve looked around and the sites that say there are contradictions obviously don&#039;t understand the word. One site even said that in bed and out of bed was a contradiction, obviously written by a clueless cunt.<br><br>What I mean is contradictions like on 9\/11 where it is said the towers collapsed because of the combination of being hit by a very fast object that weakened the structure and raging fires fuelled by jet fuel in conditions that caused the fuel to burn at furnace like temperatures (because of wind vortex etc). However, this is immediately contradicted by Building 7, which was not hit by a plane, nor were the fires due to aviation fuel. So, the story must be a lie.<br><br>Just as the 6 Gorrillion holocaust, where six burners needed to burn a corpse to ash within 10 minutes to just satisfy the numbers that were supposedly cremated in that camp. This is totally impossible and is contradicted simply by looking at the absolute state of the art, best crematoria available today, nothing can burn a body in 10 mins. So, this has to be a lie.<br><br>On a personal level, if you go and visit your girlfriend (who lives alone) and ask her how she&#039;s been doing, she says she&#039;s fine. You ask if she&#039;s seen anyone, she says no, you glance in the bin and there&#039;s a condom full of sperm in there, you are faced with a contradiction. She said she hasn&#039;t seen anyone, you can see a condom full of male seed. Without needing to ask her you already know she&#039;s cheated.<br><br>Or am I wrong and the world is full of innocent contradictions?

The German Emperors modelled themselves on the Austrian Emperors, who had modelled themselves on the Greek and Roman Emperors. The greatest of the Prussians [Frederick the Great] did not conceal his contempt for Prussia. He refused to talk anything but French, or to exchange ideas, except [with] somebody of the type of Voltaire. Then came the liberal ideas of the French Revolution, and the whole movement of German Unity was originally a liberal movement on the lines of the French Revolution.<br>Then came the more modern and much more mortally dangerous idea of Race, which the Germans borrowed from a Frenchman named Gobineau. And on top of that idea of Race, came the grand, imperial idea of a Chosen Race, of a sacred seed that is, as the Kaiser said, the salt of the earth; of a people that is God\u2019s favourite and guided by Him, in a sense in which He does not guide other and lesser peoples. And if anybody asks where anybody got that idea, there is only one possible or conceivable answer. He got it from the Jews.<br>[...]<br>Thus, German mysticism became more and more like Jewish mysticism : a thing not thinking much of ordinary human beings, the hewers of wood and drawers of water, the Gentiles or the strangers; but thinking with intense imagination of the idea of a holy house or family, alone dedicated to heaven and therefore to triumph. This is the great Prussian illusion of pride, for which thousands of Jews have recently been rabbled or ruined or driven from their-homes. I am certainly not enough of an Anti-Semite to say :that it served them right.","time":1492585873,"resto":121815355,"id":"SLR88nNt","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121816936,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)03:12:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121816728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121816728<\/a><br>The people are obedient to God and obedient to the State if the State is obedient to God.<br><br>like how women should be obedient to men <br><br>the state is made up of people<br>those people must be obedient to God <br>if not, the whole thing is pointless.

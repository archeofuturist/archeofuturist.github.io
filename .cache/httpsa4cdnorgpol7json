Why would someone become a rural and suburban retard? The answer is rape.<br><br>Imagine being in Manitoba or Wyoming, there are no humans in a thousand mile radius. No one, literally.

And rural and suburban retards deliberately shit up the schools so that it is impossible for you to ever become smart and educated enough to leave for the city. That&#039;s why they teach you creationism and that kind of bullshit, so that if you ever go to the city, people will just laugh at you and send you back to where you came from. <br><br>You are stuck there to be raped forever.<br><br>So obviously when Hillary ran a campaign based on education and helping little girls succeed, rural and suburban retards knew perfectly well what that meant. It meant no more rape. Can you imagine being a rural and suburban retard and not being allowed to rape? That would be hell.<br><br>And people are often amazed by the fact that white rural and suburban women would vote against Hillary, but when you think about it, it makes perfect sense. If you had spent your entire life being raped, would you vote for someone who would stop the rape? No, you want other people to get raped too, otherwise it&#039;s not fair.","time":1493148201,"resto":122763952,"id":"vXlSe+2x","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122773867,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:25:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122763952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122763952<\/a><br>Wow this post truly changed my view on Trump.

I don&#039;t know why it&#039;s a thing online? Niggers are good fighters during elementary to middle school. So 6-14 or so years of age. Because they are literally fucking apes. When everybody starts hitting puberty that&#039;s when genetics truly begin to shine. Spics, Asians(mostly Filipino were active fighters) and the few white people here would always dismantle the negroids. They are usually more poor, malnourished, and genetically they are inferior. They rely on numbers and feel big when 30 congoids are chimping out. Never do you see them play fair past puberty.

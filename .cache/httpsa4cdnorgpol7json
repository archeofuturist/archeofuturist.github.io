The assumption is that by some kind of magic, concentrated private power will lead to a more free and just society. Actually that has been believed in the past.

Anarchism is quite different from that. It calls for an elimination to tyranny, all kinds of tyranny. Including the kind of tyranny that\u2019s internal to private power concentrations. So why should we prefer it? Well I think because freedom is better than subordination. It\u2019s better to be free than to be a slave. It&#039;s better to be able to make your own decisions than to have someone else make decisions and force you to observe them. I mean, I don\u2019t think you really need an argument for that.

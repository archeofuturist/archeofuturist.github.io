The Jews have worked with forged documents for the past 24 hundred years, namely ever since they have had any documents whatsoever. And no one can qualify as a historian of this half century without having examined the Protocols. Alleged, if you like, to have been translated from the Russian, from a manuscript to be consulted in the British Museum, where some such document may or may not exist.<br><br>What we know for certain is that they were published two decades ago. That Lord Sydenham wrote a preface to them. That their content has been traced to another sketch said to have appeared in the eighteen forties. The interest in them does not lie in [the] question of their having been, or NOT been concocted by a legislative assembly of Rabbis, democratically elected, or secretly chosen by the Mysterious Order of Seven Branched Antlers or the Bowling Society of Milwaukee. Their interest lies in the type of mind, or the state of mind of their author. That was their interest for the psychologist the day they first appeared. And for the historian two decades later, when the program contained in them has so crushingly gone into effect up to a point, or down to a squalor.<br><br>What is interesting, perhaps most, to the historian is their definite campaign against history altogether, their declared intention to blot out the classics, to blot out the record, and to dazzle men with talk of tomorrow. That is a variant on the pie in the bait.

Previously, Western Civilization enforced monogamy through various legal, religious and social pressures. As these restrictions have been removed, we are regressing back to the jungle in which women have multiple sexual partners with a small subset of the male population. In primitive societies this results in the harem. In such an arrangement the top 20% of the males sexually monopolize 80% of the females. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; We have seen such behavior for years in the inner city in which women have multiple \u201cbaby daddies\u201d. If you should visit a city such as Detroit, you will have a hard time finding a woman who has multiple children from the same father. What is interesting about these arrangements is that the biological fathers tend to be a small subset of the male population within the city. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We find that 80% of these women share the 20% of the men in an unofficial polygamous arrangement. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The problem with such a polygamous arrangement is that 80% of the men are left out of the sexual marketplace. And such men tend to be violent and unlikely to be productive members of society. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This is the situation that you can find in most primitive countries in Africa.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Oez<wbr>icH0pZmk<br><br>Western Society Has Become Sexually Like Africa","filename":"1462109470138","ext":".jpg","w":281,"h":351,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491313749229,"time":1491313749,"md5":"euNFuorilN8m1pDKW6eQew==","fsize":15778,"resto":0,"id":"xLcUrcVT","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"modern-liberated-woman-claims-to-have-fucked-over","country_name":"United States","replies":168,"images":37,"omitted_posts":163,"omitted_images":36,"tail_size":50},{"no":119501630,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)14:59:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119501414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119501414<\/a><br>I agree on this :\/ waiting and having patience seems like the solution to a happy family in my opinion","time":1491332371,"resto":119470578,"id":"CiUJeyBU","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119501931,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:02:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Degenerate white scums.

This isn&#039;t actually a loan, although it&#039;s defacto treated like one. It&#039;s basically saying &quot;we&#039;ll back you for X amount of dollars, in exchange for you eventually paying that back plus interest.&quot; Sounds like a loan, right? But what&#039;s being loaned? Nothing. A fabrication. A ghost of money that doesn&#039;t actually exist. But the bank is stable and they did their math, so odds are pretty good you&#039;ll pay it back, or at least enough people will pay them back that they&#039;ll be fine if one or two don&#039;t.<br><br>Banks are so secure in this that they make investments based on what that loan repayment is worth. So they&#039;ll invest in X, using your nearly guaranteed loan repayment as collateral, and make money that way. Back in the day, lines of credit weren&#039;t as good and random &quot;runs&quot; on the bank where people all wanted to take their money out at once would cause huge issues because the banks never actually had that much money on hand. But that&#039;s not really the big problem. The issue this causes is 1) A certain class of bankers literally printing money for no actual value and 2) No value being added but money being created means inflation.<br><br>In National Socialist banking, every dollar created by had to actually represent an equal amount of work or product. If a government wanted to print 5 marks, they had to order 5 marks worth of autobahn to be built or whatever. That means government spending, even if it ends up being on corrupt favoritism shit, still ends up producing something.

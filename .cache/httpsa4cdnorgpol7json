I&#039;ve been vegan since 2011. Veganism does more than just wonders for your health. It also positively affects the health of the world and your wallets. You only have to shower once or twice a week reducing water consumption and need to purchase overpriced soaps. Meat eaters have to shower daily because meat eaters&#039; sweat smells like carcass. Most people don&#039;t notice the unpleasant odor until off meat for a couple of weeks.","time":1493720871,"resto":123753045,"id":"cUKWNZ0y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123753779,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)06:28:52","name":"Rain","com":"<a href=\"#p123753443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123753443<\/a><br>this is my dinner tonight. vegans are such pussies.","filename":"0502170427a-1","ext":".jpg","w":2102,"h":2379,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493720932595,"time":1493720932,"md5":"XMW692HMu99c7gwCt+fQlQ==","fsize":598726,"resto":123753045,"id":"l+WcQUNX","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123754139,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)06:34:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"(((I am famine)))","time":1493721281,"resto":123753045,"id":"rNlyzmNk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123754908,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)06:45:41","name":"Rain","com":"<a href=\"#p123754139\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123754139<\/a><br>really makes you think","filename":"0502170444-1","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":843,"tn_w":106,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493721941590,"time":1493721941,"md5":"6SsirBMNWtlXx5OFRq20hw==","fsize":81199,"resto":123753045,"id":"l+WcQUNX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123755057,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)06:47:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123753512\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123753512<\/a><br>we wont if we are stupid<br>so best avoid doing stupid things<br>like eating ourselves to death <br>or fostering negativity (with bombs)","time":1493722078,"resto":123753045,"id":"l+WcQUNX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123754570,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)06:41:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"The call that saved Argentina","filename":"argindcall","ext":".jpg","w":593,"h":401,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":169,"tim":1493721660934,"time":1493721660,"md5":"nglztRD2QbI+mto9VHXohg==","fsize":44036,"resto":0,"id":"LS8m78DK","country":"IT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-call-that-saved-argentina","country_name":"Italy","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":123754647,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)06:42:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"kek","time":1493721720,"resto":123754570,"id":"\/s8fkty5","country":"TH","country_name":"Thailand"},{"no":123754679,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)06:42:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123754570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123754570<\/a><br>red pill me on this guy","time":1493721752,"resto":123754570,"id":"TeoyXujy","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123754897,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)06:45:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123754570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123754570<\/a><br>what is Finland doing saving Argentina?","time":1493721930,"resto":123754570,"id":"AeudQ4Yt","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123736131,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)02:13:02","name":"Anonymous","sub":"AUSPOL &quot;earphones&quot;

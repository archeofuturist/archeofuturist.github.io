It also has a very positive effect on organized warfare, as you will create and adapt better equipment and strategies with more loyal troops.<br><br>The big problem of modern immigration into western &quot;white&quot; societies lies in the simple problem that the immigrants from outside are both genetically and culturally (they beget each other) predisposed towards distrusting each other, their behaviour closer to an instinctive animal level where only yourself count and the community hardly extends beyond your own family. These people are hardly capable of functioning in a small community not to mention on a national level.<br><br>&quot;White&quot; societies, which rely on a base level of trust, can easily organize in defense against outside threats, because they can rely on support from the inside. But that also makes them very vulnerable to parasitic, distrusting elements.","time":1492033212,"resto":120805025,"id":"1YeU0zc\/","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120814007,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)17:40:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120805025\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120805025<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Blacks have the best muscle genes<\/span><br>Why the fuck would we need that in modern warfare?","time":1492033246,"resto":120805025,"id":"sPk4uUQ3","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120798704,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)15:52:57","name":"Anonymous","sub":"North Korea Quasi-happening","com":"According to Pravda, North Korea has ordered the evacuation of Pyongyang.<br><br>http:\/\/www.pravdareport.com\/hotspot<wbr>s\/conflicts\/12-04-2017\/137480-pyong<wbr>yang_evacuation-0\/ <br><br>North Korea has asked that embassies evacuate <br><br>http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-asi<wbr>a-22045245<br><br>Reporters told of event at 630 am local time (about 2 hours from now)<br><br>Mainland China Premier asks for peaceful resolution.<br><br>https:\/\/www.koreatimes.co.kr\/www\/na<wbr>tion\/2017\/04\/103_227404.html","filename":"North-Korea-First-Day-plus-Beijing-160","ext":".jpg","w":1296,"h":864,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492026777820,"time":1492026777,"md5":"c1Dc47695CtEyx7Z1I4obA==","fsize":401537,"resto":0,"id":"hBORn\/sI","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"north-korea-quasihappening","country_name":"United States","replies":315,"images":53,"omitted_posts":310,"omitted_images":52,"tail_size":50},{"no":120814537,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)17:44:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120813994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120813994<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he unironically thinks nothing will happen<\/span>","filename":"large","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":333,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492033453683,"time":1492033453,"md5":"5BnpKAc\/5P8cubrXMyFErA==","fsize":35485,"resto":120798704,"id":"rEwubjEZ","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":120814573,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)17:44:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"nearly there<br><br>Goodbye anons.","filename":"north_korea_time_-_Google_Search_-_2017-04-12_22.43.39","ext":".png","w":648,"h":137,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":26,"tim":1492033472868,"time":1492033472,"md5":"lzMZt5Fv6LlbjaXI+sGIvw==","fsize":4775,"resto":120798704,"id":"H6iZdwPU","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120814601,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)17:44:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120814450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120814450<\/a><br>you better do","time":1492033483,"resto":120798704,"id":"zKQAvrFL","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":120814615,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)17:44:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120814450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120814450<\/a><br>Fuck off and get breast cancer bitch.

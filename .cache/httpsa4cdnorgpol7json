One thing I have to admit I never really connected to is the idea of charity or service -- NOT because I lack empathy, but rather because it seemed almost strange to me to focus on, say, feeding a homeless person, when there are all these other problems that are &quot;closer&quot; to me that need fixing -- helping the people in my own life with their struggles, illnesses, grief, etc., being a better person for my family, and that sort of thing. It almost seemed arbitrary to think of going out and putting my energy toward a problem removed from my own life when there&#039;s always so much &quot;at home&quot; that needs that kind of care. <br><br>Today, however, it struck me in a new way. As I look at the world around me, I can&#039;t help but feel that humanity is an unsolvable problem. I&#039;m sure I don&#039;t need to elaborate on what I mean by that. So I&#039;m suddenly seeing this call to service as an answer to that. It&#039;s unsolvable at the macro level, but as an individual, I can spread truth, mercy, and grace wherever I go, and there is no place that doesn&#039;t need those things, and that is what saves us, in a way, because the world will never be &quot;saved&quot; in the way we want it to be.<br><br>I&#039;d be curious to hear what other Christians think.

I believe it would give a good background to criticism of social sciences. <br><br>I&#039;d say there are two main issues:<br><br>1) Social scientists weave narratives. This is a problem because they are ideologically extreme, and dishonest in how they do it.<br><br>One is absurd overstretching: &quot;We see that people in a controlled setting when told by an authority to administer electric shocks do so. This could shed some light on how Hitler rose to power and that the mechanisms behind it are not gone. <br><br>Another is narrative-crafting using possibility-words - could-should-might. Social sciences maintain a false label of scientific inquiry by avoiding strong conclusions - but instead, narratives are crafted using the most vague and double-sided words like &quot;could&quot;, &quot;may&quot;, that create impressions and feelings with no cost or justification. If X &quot;could&quot; be the case, then the opposite of X &quot;could&quot; also be the case.<br><br>Another way is by selecting who they quote. &quot;Science&quot; is supposed to be crafted on a &quot;brick by brick&quot; model, which is supposed to include quoting a number of authors. But in reality there are so many authors with so many perspectives, that they have free choice to &quot;quote&quot; whatever view they want to promote.<br><br>Another is the ideological extremism of people in the field, as regularly witnessed.<br><br>These factors add together. A rabid feminist author will make some statements that men are inherently misogynist.

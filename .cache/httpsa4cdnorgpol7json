Le Pen historically always overperforms her polls unless there is another credible right wing candidate for her votes to go to. There isn&#039;t. I have used a variety of other methods to calculate the other numbers; to be very brief, always remember that Macron&#039;s base is FRAGILE (1\/3 of voters could change minds) and is attracted to Melenchon&#039;s base, where as Fillon has stalled because of Penelopegate, and there is no reason to vote for Hamon as Melenchon becomes the candidate for the Left. <br><br>2nd Round will be 51.43% for Le Pen and 48.51% for Melenchon. Polls after the first round will show roughly a 54\/46 race, favouring Melenchon. <br><br>The crucial moment will come when Fillon ENDORSES Le Pen (or several prominent members of his party). Why would he\/they do that, you ask? Because they support Le Pen AGAINST the commie Melenchon (he wants 100% tax on rich). ALSO, they will have a parliamentary majority, and want to get shit done. THEY CAN GET SHIT DONE WITH LE PEN, BUT NOT WITH MELENCHON. This is crucial to remember.<br><br>This will be the FINAL BLOW. Currently (((polls))) predict the abstention rates of Fillon supporters in a 2nd round Le Pen\/Melenchon to be approximately 50%. (i.e. 50% do not vote at all). Fillon\/his party&#039;s endorsement of Le Pen will reduce this rate to approximately 30%, which results in the 51.43% victory I described above. So, add all these factors in and Le Pen will Make France Great Again. I&#039;m waiting, \/pol\/. Shortly, you will see that I was right.","filename":"Capture","ext":".png","w":401,"h":407,"tn_w":246,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492606689153,"time":1492606689,"md5":"bQ0kHM1zqVkIR2UL9YXz1Q==","fsize":216583,"resto":0,"id":"3SzxQ8AO","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"le-pen-will-win-guaranteed-2","country_name":"Australia","replies":44,"images":7,"omitted_posts":39,"omitted_images":5},{"no":121848032,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:14:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121846373\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121846373<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Phi<\/span><br>Phi comme fils de pute !","time":1492611296,"resto":121840937,"id":"\/sFVutwj","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121848104,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:15:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121841307\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121841307<\/a><br>Get off the internet, your husband is waiting for you.","time":1492611345,"resto":121840937,"id":"Gwh4UpUm","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":121848134,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:16:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121847860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121847860<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Being left or right wing economically doesn&#039;t matter<\/span><br>yeah, right... easy to say, when you&#039;re a leeching commie roach","time":1492611370,"resto":121840937,"id":"\/sFVutwj","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121848259,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:17:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121840937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121840937<\/a><br>Even Melenchon winning is good because that means civil war on the horizon and finally gas the kikes race war now will be a reality.","filename":"1492559270187","ext":".png","w":681,"h":681,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492611466266,"time":1492611466,"md5":"qRN40jjCRLkaHRcariyaPQ==","fsize":483436,"resto":121840937,"id":"hRkfv1ko","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":121848471,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:20:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121847843\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121847843<\/a><br>Kek.

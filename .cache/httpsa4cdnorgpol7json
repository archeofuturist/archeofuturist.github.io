I&#039;ve been redpilling her on racial issues for more than a year with success. She knows immigration is bad for france, that africans are low-IQ and unable to bear civilization, that traditions and our cultural heritage matters. Since the election is approaching I conducted an experiment and told her I wouldn&#039;t vote in this election cycle, but rather that she could choose for me. I didn&#039;t influence her too much in her choice and tonight she gave me her answer <br><br>She wants to vote for Emmanuel fucking Macron. The economically centrist, socially liberal rotschid shill whose program states that France &quot;only&quot; has a &quot;stable&quot; population of immigrants of &quot;under 10%&quot; of the total, and also that 210 000 naturalizations a year is a moderate amout for a country of seventy million inhabitants. <br><br>I now have to face the fact that regardless of how asians are smart and productive citizens, it is highly unlikely that even them, even redpilled ones, will take into account the interests of the native population. Not because they are bad people necessarily - because they aren&#039;t us <br><br>Fuck you \/pol\/ this has been the hardest one to swallow so far.

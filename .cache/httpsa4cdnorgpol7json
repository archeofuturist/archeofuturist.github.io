It&#039;s not really a rational story with a moral or lesson. Being an irritating cunt isn&#039;t something that relies on stupidity or lack of presence. It comes with being human. We&#039;re all irritating cunts from the wrong person&#039;s perspective. If you&#039;re young, love is important. When you&#039;re old, love is just something that happens sometimes that ruins otherwise great relationships. It distorts your perspective. It&#039;s what causes people to marry someone they&#039;re incompatible with, and once the pussy dries up, they&#039;re stuck, possibly with kids, whose lives they&#039;ll ruin. Ignorance is the fuel for love and marriage and children. Reality is different. Not all women are irritating cunts; some of them are truly a pleasure to be with, with or without clothing. The fault in becoming &quot;in love&quot; with someone you don&#039;t know is that everything that comes after the looks are gone is what truly matters. If you&#039;re gonna fall for the love jew, at least make it more about who you&#039;re with as a person than the face and body you&#039;d do anything to keep around. That doesn&#039;t last long, especially if she turns out to be a cunt. There are no magical powers of perception. No matter how much you think everything is perfect, anything can and will still happen to possibly prove you wrong and make you miserable. Live to make you happy, not to claim a prize.","time":1492399401,"resto":121453729,"id":"hAKcugZu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121469906,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)23:07:43","name":"Anonymous","sub":"lol omg wtf","com":"This board is still alive with the whole &#039;god emperor trump&#039; thing?<br><br>Are you all trolling or you dont know?

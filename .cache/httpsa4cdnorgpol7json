An hello to all the other skeptical Youtubers of the world. A edgy hello to all memepage admins and shitposter. And &quot;Heil&quot; to 4chan!<br>What&#039;s this letter about? It&#039;s about an idea to create a network, an union, a revolution! We all have seen the &quot;power&quot; of shitposting, memes, skeptical youtubers and most of all the weaponized autism. Sargon of Akkad built the fondation of my idea; Kekistan! Why don&#039;t we all get some autism and fight under the very same flag. I know you dont agree eachother in everything, but i know you agree in some fundmental thing about the problems we have in our world and most importand in freedome of speech, science and the importance of haing a dialogue. <br>If we want to change something on a high level then this could do something. In my idea we would deveveloppe a official website of kekistan where we would get a big reach, like a hell of a reach, so we could plan shitpost the shit out of people who deserved to get shitposted. Also we should establish severals sectors like &quot;Oberkommando der Mememacht(Supreme commando of the Memepower)&quot;, &quot;Shitposters&quot; and the &quot;Memejugend(Memeyouth)&quot;. We have to organise ourself like 4chan did back in days, no even more, for example with ranks, which means we have &quot;F\u00fchrer&quot; and other german related ranks or setting up rules like a constitution. Imagine what we could to with this kind of a network, you could establish a online magasin to shitpost even more, you could change something. Let us fight under the flag of kekistan against censorship, poltical correctnes and all the madness(sweden, germany, france etc.). With the will of Kek, our Mememagic, Kekistan, the weaponized autism of 4chan and the skepticism of all you youtubers, lets fight, lets fight as allies not as divided shitposters.

For a universalist\/absolutist\/Jewish, they would argue that it is immoral to say that lower BMIs are preferable to higher BMIs, because what about a curvy thicc model who is unexpectedly good looking in spite of the fact that she has the approximate weight of a baby blue whale? Never mind the fact that 99% of people who are this size are more likely to die of heart attacks, diabetes, can&#039;t participate in sports, can&#039;t play with their children etc., the mere possible existence of an attractive 300lb woman is enough to say that all sizes are beautiful. <br><br>If you dig into the Jewish mindset, you&#039;ll see that this kind of argumentation is essential to the Jewish worldview. In the Torah and the Talmud, the Jews are constantly referred to as the &#039;chosen people&#039; so much so that religious Jews believe that there is an essential, ontological difference between the Jews and non-Jews, and that this difference is what justifies their treatment of non-Jews. That Goebbels (?) quote about Jews attacking people for the things which they do themselves is extremely apt. Imo, part of the reason that the Jews hated the National Socialists so much is that it knocked the Jews off their pedestal as the &#039;chosen people&#039;. A group of goys dared to stand up and say that the Jews were nothing special, and this infuriated them. This is also why Jesus enrages religious Jews, because he said something similar. I have mixed feelings about religion, but Jesus and Paul&#039;s statement about &quot;there is no longer Jew nor Greek&quot; is a massive, massive blow to Jewish ethnocentrism. This is also part of the reason why Christians are such good goys for the Jews, because the Christians continue the universalizing project, which the Jews happily go along with, while privately believing that they are superior.","time":1493305646,"resto":123036532,"id":"1F4bVfl0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123046862,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)11:22:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123045338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123045338<\/a><br>Another example is feminism. <br><br>Part of the reason why there are so many Jewish feminists has to do with this idea of universalizing. The Jews would argue that because some women are possibly capable of being leaders and enjoying work outside the home, we should insist that all women be allowed to be leaders and work outside the home. Because some women are possibly capable of understanding politics, all women should have the power to vote. For a Jew, there is nothing worse than the rights of a minority being limited for the larger good, because for a long time in history, stuffed into the European ghettos where they belong, they were that minority. The Jew doesn&#039;t care about reality, or the practical consequences of their ideas, because the Talmud and Zohar and Tanya have conditioned the Jewish mind to masturbate over the imaginary ideal, to flee from reality and seek refuge in abstracted theorizing. Freud, Marx, Einstein are all perfect examples of this.","time":1493306563,"resto":123036532,"id":"1F4bVfl0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123040907,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)10:21:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why is this allowed?","filename":"little-woman-la-main1","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":800,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493302880162,"time":1493302880,"md5":"TNZlveY5G716AoEGVZ8SPw==","fsize":130612,"resto":0,"id":"dpD2uaUb","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-is-this-allowed","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":2,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":1},{"no":123043381,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)10:47:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123040907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123040907<\/a><br>BRAZZERS","time":1493304452,"resto":123040907,"id":"hErdJAAM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123045044,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)11:04:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123043258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123043258<\/a><br>I don&#039;t think I&#039;d fit in.","filename":"1454704701177","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493305470002,"time":1493305470,"md5":"tdhv1pqsTz\/1cAFUeb5++A==","fsize":88233,"resto":123040907,"id":"W17x11bE","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123046661,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)11:20:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Midget or not - if you wouldn&#039;t bang the one on the left, you should get checked for homosexuality, castrated and sold into anal ass rape fuck slavery to a wealthy family father in a part of Saudi Arabia where this is legal.","time":1493306442,"resto":123040907,"id":"24B8qTsj","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123046738,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)11:21:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123046661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123046661<\/a><br>Typical Germany, wanting to stick your dick where a nigger has been.","time":1493306489,"resto":123040907,"id":"W17x11bE","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123046836,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)11:22:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123046738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123046738<\/a>","filename":"C9wLH5-XsAAt-uz","ext":".png","w":768,"h":1024,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493306548269,"time":1493306548,"md5":"BM772wDySOYzdevHJ3ngQg==","fsize":343460,"resto":123040907,"id":"XUzeRklM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123046356,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)11:17:42","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Ben Garrison unedited cartoon","com":"Like many others a few days ago I stumbled upon the newest Ben G cartoon instantly realising that it had been edited by the JIDF, so after 3 days of hard searching I found the original unedited Ben Garrison cartoon.

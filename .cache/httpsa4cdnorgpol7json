Obviously they&#039;ve had other groups like Australoids or whatever Inuits are, other archaic human racial groups mixed in that we&#039;ve been mostly distanced from, and of course the obvious Mongolian raping later, so they look different but culturally and in their deeper DNA they are Aryans too. <br><br><a href=\"#p121075580\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121075580<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They&#039;ll go right back to it without a big brother showing them the way and offering a guiding hand.<\/span><br><br>The same could be said for all non pure Aryans (who don&#039;t exist today), since that group brought the technology and civilization to all of the indigenous tribes around the globe.

The number of English identifying as Anglicans dropped by 1.7 million, from 21 to 17% between 2012 and 2014, while the number of Muslims grew by nearly a million, with converts often embracing the violence of Islam.<br><br>Estimates state that by 2020 the number of Muslims attending prayers will be at least 683,000, while the number of Christians attending weekly Mass will drop to 679,000. Nearly half of British Muslims are under 25, while a quarter of the nation\u2019s Christians are over 65. \u201cIn another twenty years there are going to be more active Muslims than there are churchgoers,\u201d said Keith Porteous Wood, director of the National Secular Society. At the current rate of decline, within one generation there will be three times more Muslims attending Friday prayer than churchgoers.<br><br>A 2015 analysis showed the most popular name in England to be Mohammed, or a variation thereof.","filename":"1491487118001","ext":".jpg","w":316,"h":202,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":159,"tim":1492186213074,"time":1492186213,"md5":"EhuCsP7MKL\/fgd2ju0Cm+A==","fsize":15326,"resto":0,"id":"nsZeXcf1","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"london-yes-500-churches-closed-400-mosques-opened","country_name":"Israel","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121076353,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:59:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Which ethnicity\/country has the most attractive women?","filename":"average british woman","ext":".jpg","w":901,"h":1204,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492185546686,"time":1492185546,"md5":"Mp7GC4mj1GP9QKpjE6SSVA==","fsize":198071,"resto":0,"id":"9p+tybNm","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"which-ethnicitycountry-has-the-most-attractive","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":19,"images":7,"omitted_posts":14,"omitted_images":6},{"no":121077767,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:11:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121077601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121077601<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no Lucy Pinder<\/span>","filename":"51908","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":480,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492186298047,"time":1492186298,"md5":"FoQviQOcKH4mDIcfCMB9jg==","fsize":30373,"resto":121076353,"id":"MSCQmKnZ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121077779,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:11:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ostdeutschland","filename":"IMG_0199","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":1024,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492186303162,"time":1492186303,"md5":"ocUuUWbltIb3HeZVDxivvQ==","fsize":331173,"resto":121076353,"id":"wRlodcmA","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121077837,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:12:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121076353\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121076353<\/a><br>People are most attracted to their own people.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 cherry picked picture of a British Woman<\/span>","time":1492186329,"resto":121076353,"id":"PStzz7Ge","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121077879,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:12:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121076606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121076606<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;retarded<\/span><br>Why?","time":1492186347,"resto":121076353,"id":"OsprgTYZ","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":121078093,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:14:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"The Anglo-Saxons who didn&#039;t stay in Britain<br><br>10\/10","filename":"1478724069003","ext":".jpg","w":1244,"h":1640,"tn_w":94,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492186452798,"time":1492186452,"md5":"jCSn7WdkBLSk1oXVvPgsHA==","fsize":539060,"resto":121076353,"id":"fOa56f3k","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121074542,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:44:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Which US cities do you think North Korea is going to hit if they do decide to attack us with nuclear arms?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Washington DC<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;New York<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Los Angeles<\/span><br><br>That&#039;s all I think.","filename":"technical","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":841,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":175,"tim":1492184667379,"time":1492184667,"md5":"qO865+LlgJ4CENs0FRi3yQ==","fsize":294098,"resto":0,"id":"f8Fkw3m2","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"which-us-cities-do-you-think-north-korea-is-going","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":0,"omitted_posts":7,"omitted_images":0},{"no":121075803,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:54:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121075515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121075515<\/a><br>Learn your geography.....jesus..","time":1492185260,"resto":121074542,"id":"+ZO29C52","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121075876,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:54:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"They won&#039;t, If they did is be Hawaii ( which would suck) or California (which would suck far far less)","time":1492185297,"resto":121074542,"id":"xBJbkOtE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121076026,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:56:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121075803\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121075803<\/a><br>What?

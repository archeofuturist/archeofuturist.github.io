Most people are friendly and glad to help.<br><br>For your first two weeks, just get used to the gym and equipment. Do simple stuff like leg press, chest machine press, curls etc. It is obvious how to use most of the machines, but you need to get familiar with the weight you are at. Aim for 8-12 reps x4.<br><br>Watch other people do workouts, see their posture and elbow positioning to learn how to copy them.

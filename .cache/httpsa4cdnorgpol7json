Will we see laws like this popping up in other states?<br><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/qZEm0<br><br>On Monday, a panel of judges for the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals heard arguments in Barber v. Bryant, a challenge to Mississippi\u2019s HB 1523\u2014easily the most sweeping anti-LGBTQ bill passed since the Supreme Court struck down same-sex marriage bans nationwide in 2015. Passed in response to that ruling less than a year later, the Mississippi law would permit religious individuals, businesses, and government officials to discriminate against LGBTQ people in a broad array of contexts. Shortly before it took effect, a federal judge blocked HB 1523 as an egregious constitutional violation. Mississippi appealed to the 5th Circuit, drawing a panel of three conservative judges. Before Monday\u2019s hearing, it seemed probable that these judges would reverse the district court and let HB 1523 take effect. But after 90 lively minutes of arguments, that outcome is no longer assured. In fact, the court often appeared skeptical of the law\u2019s constitutionality and wary of its malevolent intent.<br><br>To grasp what\u2019s at stake in this litigation, consider the unprecedented reach of the Mississippi bill. A typical religious freedom statute protects all beliefs and allows the government to restrict religious exercise when it has a compelling reason to do so. (Mississippi already has such a law.) By contrast, HB 1523 protects just three beliefs and does so absolutely, permitting no exemptions. The law seeks only to safeguard individuals who believe that marriage is \u201cthe union of one man and one woman\u201d; that \u201csexual relations are properly reserved to such a marriage\u201d; and that \u201can individual\u2019s immutable biological sex\u201d is \u201cobjectively determined by anatomy and genetics at time of birth.\u201d","filename":"rainbowwaffles","ext":".jpg","w":580,"h":400,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":172,"tim":1491347635911,"time":1491347635,"md5":"H69O\/TAFuYyAym9y6G8Plw==","fsize":173950,"resto":0,"id":"7sh9sL0A","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mississippi-religious-freedom-bill-goes-before","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":119532141,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:16:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119531914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119531914<\/a><br>Based nigger-state.

It makes zero sense too because had Thomas and Martha Wayne been carrying, they&#039;d still have been alive. Early Batman carried guns, just like a police officer would. If anything he should be a pro-gun figure, but DC had some thing in the 60s I believe where they made anti-gun PSA comics or something and it became a thing from there to where now people will think you&#039;re crazy if you don&#039;t think he always was afraid of guns.<br><br>There&#039;s a panel somewhere of Batman in front of a grave saying &quot;this city MUST learn to protect itself&quot;, yet he&#039;d be the first one to go &quot;nobody&#039;s allowed to have guns to protect themselves&quot;, keeping Gotham City Chicago or DC.<br><br>It&#039;s a shame too because for most of the Dark Knight Returns comic, he is pretty based and right wing. His entire reason for getting back into action is because the government is ineffective. Superman became a cuck who said &quot;it&#039;s (((their))) world and they won&#039;t stand for you anymore&quot;, and Bruce had to fight for his life when they decided to tell Supes to &quot;shut it down&quot; on him.","filename":"Trump based gun rights","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":604,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1491347240688,"time":1491347240,"md5":"uojS9dG3akly+khfzaDg+Q==","fsize":141839,"resto":119518239,"id":"BbLftMYp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119531848,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:13:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"Because it&#039;s cringeworthy ,virginal, childish capeshit.","time":1491347598,"resto":119518239,"id":"ENtUe8Bo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119532038,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:15:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119523819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119523819<\/a><br>except he runs a multibillion company so the hundy mil or so is nada","filename":"1479886115617","ext":".jpg","w":170,"h":179,"tn_w":118,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491347710879,"time":1491347710,"md5":"QztaF9rkj873l1RZmJY85Q==","fsize":15010,"resto":119518239,"id":"bWAhi+Xc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119532484,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:19:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Alt universe Thomas Wayne Batman is even more fashy.","time":1491347952,"resto":119518239,"id":"uZJGhALq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119533128,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:24:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119532484\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119532484<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fashpoint<\/span>","time":1491348249,"resto":119518239,"id":"cKguXeO\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119533080,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:23:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YE9<wbr>wnpePsKU<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This video from Funny Or Die, Hulu, and LeanIn.Org shows what life is like when you get 20% less\u2014of everything.

The US has been making stink face at NK for 67 years because NK is another war the US failed to win. Technically the war is still under an extended uneasy ceasefire. So the renewed rhetoric is for.<br>(1) The US has to keep North and South apart or it&#039;ll look like a bigger failure if they can get along. There&#039;s a strong political opposition now that wants to reunite under what&#039;s known as the &quot;Sunshine Agreement.&quot; <br>(2) Owning the south as a vassal through &quot;body guard services&quot; gives the US a base of influence in that region.<br>(3) You can&#039;t retool a military and sell weapons without enemies.<br>(4) The Taliban eradicated opium production in Afghanistan in 2002. Then US takes over and production explodes (CIA). Globally now lots of cheap heroine, and opiate production goes through the roof. Also a part to play in all that drug wealth is Jung-UN stopped opium production in NK early in his administration. Recently, because it&#039;s a cash crop, and NK needs the money due to the sanctions and embargoes, and to pay for their new missile program, they started producing opium again. They are a huge opium producer. The problem?? North Korea opium, unlike the Afghanistan opium, is not under the control of the CIA. It&#039;s a competitor that drives down prices and profits from Afghan opium. They&#039;re cutting in on the CIA opium action.<br><br>So now we have Pence saying that there will be no talks with NK! All the US wants is that NK is dismantling their ballistic nuclear missile, just because! He&#039;s really saying, &quot;how dare they make weapons to deter an invasion!&quot; NK radio is even saying they need the nukes to deter invasion of the US under false pretenses (Iraq).<br><br>The US gov couldn&#039;t give two shits about NK nukes. Many other nations have them, some unregulated like Israel. Any country that launches a nuke at the US is going to turn into a giant green glowing glass parking lot. Countries want them to deter from unstable US bullshit invasions for the owners of the US.","filename":"G0540_16X-Datawatch-Sat","ext":".png","w":591,"h":439,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":185,"tim":1492664864566,"time":1492664864,"md5":"k9iCISiugN2lQJAi23XoXQ==","fsize":12393,"resto":0,"id":"TlDqGIQI","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"on-north-korea","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121949296,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:04:16","name":"Anonymous","sub":"My brother is suicidal, and I think it&#039;s because of this website.","com":"My brother redpilled me over the past year, and we&#039;v bonded over Trump winning, bonded over \/pol\/. We live in California and we used to both be pretty liberal people. Over time, he started becoming more and more right leaning, and I see the shit ya&#039;ll put on here and it&#039;s thought provoking and interesting but sometimes its problematic. He became more and more obsessed with the idea of nazism, &quot;alt-right&quot; ideologies, and has been isolated from the general public at his high school. He lost his friends over time and can hardly relate to anybody at his school. Teachers are feeding him &quot;lies&quot; and the liberalism is unbearable. He doesn&#039;t feel like he belongs anywhere. Today he tried to commit suicide, and had notes in his room that related to things seen here that seemed to be schizophrenically written out. 4chan was definitely a reason for his depression. He would sit in his room all day and browse, learn about nazism and watch Sam Hyde shit. This website radicalized my brother to the point where he went over the edge and did not understand how to cope with all the things learned. I just wanted to vent and see if any of ya&#039;ll could relate. Too much internet can fuck you up, and I&#039;m worried for my brother.","filename":"b210c01f26f7d659f2012284c7c5c02b--frog-meme-frogs","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":477,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":248,"tim":1492661056637,"time":1492661056,"md5":"kMg7sb2bvXfEANTPbAhbWA==","fsize":34805,"resto":0,"id":"BFyfSloB","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"my-brother-is-suicidal-and-i-think-its-because-of","country_name":"United States","replies":51,"images":13,"omitted_posts":46,"omitted_images":13},{"no":121952866,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:38:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"You can&#039;t take whats on here too seriously.

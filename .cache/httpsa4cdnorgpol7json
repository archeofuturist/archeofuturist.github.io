In 2013 the UK spent 8.5% of its GDP on healthcare, about $227.6 Billion. Their population was 64.1 million. If I were to re-adjust the spending to the population of the USA which is about 319 million. The cost would be about $1.133 trillion. In the USA we already spend $1.191 trillion on Medicare and Medicaid combined. So my question is could the USA switch to single payer without increasing taxes from where they are right now?","filename":"16299118_1637282323243278_4764201811001063810_n","ext":".png","w":480,"h":272,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":141,"tim":1490417124329,"time":1490417124,"md5":"WhwfF0Yz2ZSm7WWU\/\/d5Ww==","fsize":187933,"resto":0,"id":"uVpGGih5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"red-pill-me-on-single-payer-in-usa","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":1,"omitted_posts":8,"omitted_images":1},{"no":118194213,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)02:10:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118192080\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118192080<\/a><br>I don&#039;t think necessarily less regulation means more cost, it really depends on what exact regulation it is.","time":1490422248,"resto":118186905,"id":"uVpGGih5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118195050,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)02:20:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118194213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118194213<\/a><br>Truth.

If there are only 20 people fishing the river, you don&#039;t need a lot of regulation, but if it&#039;s supporting an entire economy of thousands, you got to regulate it to make sure the fish don&#039;t die. Everyone needs health care, especially since ERs cant to refuse care, we don&#039;t let people die in the streets. Health care is a right by default, we give it to people whether they can pay or not, so if you don&#039;t regulate it, then yes, that&#039;s why costs got to be so high in the first place. <\/span><br>ACA mandating care makes sense, But YES, they should have gone after high costs in the first place.

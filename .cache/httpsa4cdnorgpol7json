The answer to that question is noone. You might think the elites might use it to rid the earth of their enemies and reduce population, but even for them this way of doing it a) causes to many side effects and influence on nature and b) has too many variables, since you can&#039;t be sure who nukes where and you can&#039;t plan the outcome good enough to be able to stabilize a new society afterwards.<br><br>I mean look at the war zones we have today, war isn&#039;t what it used to be and the war in those countries is neverending. In a land where the infrastructure is destroyed, economics don&#039;t exist anymore and people lost all good belief there will be only chaos. This chaos would last for at least some decades and again the outcome would be very unstable and hard to plan for.<br><br>Second we have to ask ourselves why everyone keeps their bombs then. This one is simple and you heard it before: So no madman can push the button without killing himself. And there is a second answer: You can use nuclear weapons on a smaller scale for tactical combat. Small rounds with nuclear parts that wreck a lot of devastation will come, will be in use and will not influence nature too much. You can predict the outcome. This is very dangerous and unsettling, but won&#039;t lead to an all out nuclear war.<br><br>And there there is someting else people don&#039;t think about enough: Having an all out nuclear war only occurs when it is clear who shot first. All scenarios are like &quot;A attacks B who is partners with C, they shoot back but A is partners with D and will retaliate.&quot; and so on. Have you ever thought about that the &quot;new&quot; nuclear danger is not countries nuking it each other, but CovertOps looking like terrorist action? If you are Putin you could easily set up a CovertOps of Pseudo-Terrorists getting a quite small bomb into NY for example. You could blow up the city, and the US could not react.","filename":"1491895215258","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493797981930,"time":1493797981,"md5":"pRjhfHES9WqEZXiEPeEJLg==","fsize":61326,"resto":0,"id":"kv3GATkr","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"will-there-be-nuclear-war","country_name":"Germany","replies":72,"images":9,"omitted_posts":67,"omitted_images":7},{"no":123893042,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)05:02:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123892941\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123892941<\/a><br>You forgot to mention the jews are ayyyylmaos!!!!!!","filename":"1489381337001","ext":".jpg","w":200,"h":213,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493802153046,"time":1493802153,"md5":"PlHsINAL+0iKe0v2b7cXEQ==","fsize":7601,"resto":123888374,"id":"kv3GATkr","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123893086,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)05:03:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123891545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123891545<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Chile<\/span><br>Im almost insulted, Anon","time":1493802192,"resto":123888374,"id":"ruE076iP","country":"MM","country_name":"Myanmar"},{"no":123893208,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)05:05:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123893042\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123893042<\/a><br>You think Germany would accept its status as a US vassal if their population realized nukes were fake?","time":1493802309,"resto":123888374,"id":"bmJg6myE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123893466,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)05:09:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123893208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123893208<\/a><br>You think your mother would accept your status as a mongoloid if she realized how dumb you really are?","time":1493802548,"resto":123888374,"id":"kv3GATkr","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123894057,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)05:18:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"No nuclear ww3?!

Been here since i was a 12 year old faggot on \/b\/, 2 or 3 years later went to \/pol\/, when i went to college i was here almost every day, 24 now.<br>There&#039;s so many problems in this world, some seem almost unfixable, such as islam, the black community, the spread of socialistic thinking, the destruction of higher education, university was supposed to help us connect more dots in our minds so we can grow into a generation of problem solvers, instead college fags are growing to be problem makers. Many things we used to enjoy now seem like they have to be abandoned for us to become wiser and untainted. I&#039;ve discarded every single one of my friends because i don&#039;t want to catch their stupid. Is there a simple solution to all of this? How do we approach such trivial times where truth is harder to find than dinosaur remains? Is it really as simple as eliminating the jews? Do we only listen to ourselves and our own feelings? Do we only follow white cultutre and white thinking? The white race really has created the most beautiful of civilization when compared to others, do we simply abandon blacks and the cultures they&#039;ve created? I like to think that we all prosper when we help eachother, i think the issue is what we define as &quot;helping&quot; While democrats want to help blacks by giving them welfare, us republicans view that as harming them because they give them fish instead of teach them how to catch them. <br>Sometimes i feel like everything is a lost cause, but then i think of how we&#039;ve evolved over the however many millions of years, from a single bang that created the universe, to the first form of bacteria, to a fully functional human being, to a world of cars, buildings, religion, space travel, government. Will there ever come a time where everything will be okay, we just exist in peace and worry about nothing because we understand it all.","filename":"stilldontgetit","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491360232408,"time":1491360232,"md5":"ehEkvo+oMvloxdK73oRFkw==","fsize":197924,"resto":0,"id":"L0GDa0+y","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"been-lurking-on-here-for-many-years-i-usually","country_name":"United States","replies":15,"images":2,"omitted_posts":10,"omitted_images":1},{"no":119557466,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:59:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119555610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119555610<\/a><br><br>yeah? you think so? <br><br>ok how about this<br><br>every consciousness of us are all the same, and we&#039;re simply one mind. i mean, either that or all consciousness is independent. <br><br>there&#039;s basically one goal in life, and that&#039;s make money. <br><br>if you think about, governments have been using us as experiments, deciding what&#039;s perfect for us, what&#039;s best for us or whatever.

He lived on a colonial North Carolina plantation and wrote many Arabic texts while enslaved. Born in the kingdom of Futa Tooro (modern Senegal), he arrived in America in 1807, one month before the U.S. abolished importation of slaves. Some of his works include the Lords Prayer, the Bismillah, this is How You Pray, Quranic phases, the 23rd Psalm, and an autobiography. In 1857, he produced his last known writing on Surah 110 of the Quran. In 1819, Omar received an Arabic translation of the Christian Bible from his master, James Owen. Omar converted to Christianity in 1820, an episode widely used throughout the South to &quot;prove&quot; the benevolence of slavery. However, some scholars believe he continued to be a practicing Muslim, based on dedications to Muhammad written in his Bible.[45][46]","time":1491361182,"resto":119549564,"id":"cfy10tJe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119557695,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:01:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119556057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119556057<\/a><br>NOI is strange and cultish.

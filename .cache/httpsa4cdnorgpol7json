It is clear that his features were typical of Galilean Semites of his era.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It was the Bible, however, that resolved the question of the length of Jesus&#039;s hair. While most religious artists have put long hair on Christ, most biblical scholars believe that it was probably short with tight curls.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Would Paul have written &quot;If a man has long hair, it is a disgrace to him&quot; if Jesus Christ had had long hair? For Neave and his team this settled the issue. Jesus, as drawings from the first century depict, would have had short hair, appropriate to men of the time.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Since Jesus worked outdoors as a carpenter until he was about 30 years old, it is reasonable to assume he was more muscular and physically fit than westernized portraits suggest.

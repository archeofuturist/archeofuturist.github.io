You&#039;re essentially arguing that because Hitler lost the war, he was responsible for the war and all that followed, as if those he was fighting against -- to prevent all these outcomes -- somehow caused these outcomes. That begs the question: why was he fighting in the first place? And the answer, obviously, was to prevent these outcomes. Its fine to say he failed, or take issue with that -- its an absurd level of lying and distortion to blame Hitler for his enemies, who existed long before him.<br><br>Its like battered wife syndrome, blaming the police responding to a domestic violence situation, for the actions of a man beating his wife to death.

That through much death and toil sometimes it is required of man to provide a secure future for his and his fellow countryman&#039;s children to live happily and in safety. Now then it&#039;d be a great evil to have eastern Europeans be genocided and the remainder be used as slaves and as &quot;breeding&quot; material for pedophile nazi subhumans, because if a nation of people, a branch per say is completely wiped out or is interbred a lot then it&#039;s gone.... gone for good, annihilated and mixed to the point beyond recognition.... which is horrifically sorrowful. And happily the great sacrifices of the many soldiers payed off, weren&#039;t in vain in the end. So sometimes in the most severe and brutal of wars a man must then fight like a cornered rat with all his might for the survival of his people and their future. <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=L0b<wbr>cRCCg01I","filename":"Hess and Himmler visit a VoMi display of proposed rural German settlements in the East, March 1941","ext":".jpg","w":526,"h":799,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491503123488,"time":1491503123,"md5":"WIcLkNx4v4mIqfPfNSY82w==","fsize":50475,"resto":119751499,"id":"WcIR4hQD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119771681,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)14:12:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Italians disgust me, they leave their countries to spread their criminality and corruption to good white nations. Consider for a moment how many of the Italian immigrants in your country are involved in organised crime, how many of them don&#039;t work, how many other gangs have copied their ways. The Italian male is an infamous lecher, his greasy brown skin glistens at the site of any white woman to harass, they&#039;re essentially arabs who happen to be Catholic. The Italian woman is a whore, a prostitute, a vixen, if there is a dick available she will gleefully take it, happily mixing with the Moors to create the human sewage that is the modern Italy. Is it any coincidence that their culture is full of infidelity and cuckoldry? I think not.

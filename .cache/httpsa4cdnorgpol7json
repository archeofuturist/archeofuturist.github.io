The medical profession which profits from this act?<\/span><br>Wow, that&#039;s some tinfoil.<br><br>It was quite a surprise finding. They tracked it in Africa, and it turned out that men with circumcisions were only about half as likely to get HIV. And that&#039;s without being able to fully account for sodomy and non-sexual blood contact. It likely almost eliminates the possibility of a man catching HIV from a woman through conventional vaginal sex (unless you have cuts or sores on your penis).<br><br>It&#039;s not hard to see why, if you think about it. The glans penis is naturally a mucous membrane. The glans gets &quot;keratinized&quot; in circumcized men, to become much more like ordinary skin. It develops a protective layer of dead material on it. In uncircumcized men, it&#039;s living cells slathered in mucus.<br><br>This is also why hygiene of the uncircumcized penis is complicated: sure, you can wash it, but it&#039;s delicate tissue like the inside of your rectum. Soap strips away the protective layer of mucus and can be directly damaging to the living skin. Thorough washing also prevents the formation of a stable flora, so when you don&#039;t get a chance to wash, the bacteria that grow can be especially disgusting or harmful. Again, it&#039;s comparable to cleaning the rectum: it&#039;s hard to get it properly clean without damaging it, and generally healthier to just let it be dirty.<br><br>If you want a clean dick for stuff like blowjobs, circumcision is best.","time":1492379487,"resto":121398917,"id":"lOuKs\/B6","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121423241,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)18:00:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121421684\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121421684<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;so when you don&#039;t get a chance to wash<\/span><br>How often do you go more than a day or two without a chance to wash?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Soap strips away the protective layer of mucus and can be directly damaging to the living skin<\/span><br>So the solution is to do away with the skin and mucus all together until the end completely dries up?","time":1492380018,"resto":121398917,"id":"cos3e7n\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121423342,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)18:00:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121421684\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121421684<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The AIDS meme<\/span><br><br>Only faggots get aids, leaf.

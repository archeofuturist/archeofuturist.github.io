You never switch between types. The 4 letters represent your dominant attitude, CONSCIOUS cognitive functions and what you extrovert. Function categories are Perception (iNtuition and Sensation) and Judging (Thinking and Feeling). Each of these is either extroverted or introverted, but work in pairs. For each extraverted trait you have an introverted one. Using my keklord Rh- ENTP self as an example:<br>NT - iNtuition and Thinking dominate my personality<br>E - my dominant trait is whichever one (N or T) is extroverted<br>P - I extrovert my Perception function N. <br>N is my DOMINANT trait, noted as Ne. I must introvert my AUXILIARY trait, noted as Ti. So the bulk of my personality is described by my Ne - Ti pairing. <br><br>For introverts, don&#039;t be tripped up by P and J - they say what you extrovert, but whichever main trait you introvert is your dominant one. <br><br>When you plebs think you&#039;re changing types you&#039;re exercising your TERTIARY trait - the polar opposite of your auxiliary trait, Ne - Fe for me in my case. Properly using your tertiary trait takes discipline, like working a muscle, since it&#039;s the same attitude as your dominant trait. Your last conscious trait is your INFERIOR one. It&#039;s the polar opposite of your dominant trait, Si for me. Unless you&#039;re retarded, you can&#039;t exert your dominant and inferior traits at the same time. You have little control over your inferior trait, it&#039;s like having a 3 year old take over your body. It comes out when you&#039;re VERY stressed. So next time you&#039;re panicking hard, think of it. Si - Ti usually shows when I panic. When any type reverts to their Inferior trait they are &#039;in the grip&#039; - different symptoms per type, anxiety for ENTP. Getting stuck using your tertiary more than your auxiliary is called being in a dom-tert loop - looks like mania for ENTP since we&#039;ll be 100% extroverted too long.","filename":"PTypesExplainedForPlebs","ext":".png","w":602,"h":418,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":173,"tim":1493162133453,"time":1493162133,"md5":"2cH0urlAtzZOyKMdTXmDHA==","fsize":153710,"resto":0,"id":"vsfyN0Z9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"personality-redpill","country_name":"United States","replies":67,"images":5,"omitted_posts":62,"omitted_images":5},{"no":122830635,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:42:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122829236\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122829236<\/a><br>Said the... xSTx... maybe ESTP?

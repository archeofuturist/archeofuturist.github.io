In a thread earlier today we discussed CNN&#039;s position as the default news station of most of the English speaking world and the obstinate position they have taken with regard to the Susan Rice scandal - with Don Lemon going so far as to say he considered it a distraction and would purposely ignore it. This coming from a news station that gleefully ran with the Trump Hires Russian Hookers to Piss in Obama&#039;s Bed claptrap 24 hours a day for a week. This is not acceptable.<br><br>CNN is played all over North America as the default news station blaring it&#039;s propaganda from TV&#039;s in waiting rooms, diners, hotel lobbies and businesses to the casual observer. I propose we bring this to an end. It&#039;s time to start complaining to the management about CNN. It&#039;s time to get the normies on your Zuckbook to complain about CNN. The first step is memes. This thread is for gathering all currently available memes showing the irresponsible reporting and outright lies propagated by CNN. This thread is also for the creation of new memes about CNN from the most recently available material. Once created we spread these memes. Once these start appearing on the Zuckbook feeds of angry Boomer normies we can hope to see the Boomers begin to do what they do best - which is complain. Over time, we need to have CNN turned off in as many public places as possible. Some well crafted memes posted to the local dentist or doctors office with a question as to why they still play CNN could work wonders.","filename":"170226132128-how-trump-turned-fake-news-into-a-slur-00021929-full-169","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491359179514,"time":1491359179,"md5":"jYw6BxiS16c2IARAthO+lw==","fsize":208548,"resto":0,"id":"WEc64uTp","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cnnmwg-cnn-meme-war-general","country_name":"Canada","replies":142,"images":66,"omitted_posts":137,"omitted_images":66,"tail_size":50},{"no":119569884,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:04:27","name":"\/cnnmwg\/ **CNN Meme War General**","com":"<a href=\"#p119568659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119568659<\/a><br><br>We&#039;re happy to have you.","filename":"1484976457303","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491368667863,"time":1491368667,"md5":"cxYrYoZgzzk3FDu3jUye8A==","fsize":277278,"resto":119553475,"id":"WEc64uTp","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119570366,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:10:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119565282\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119565282<\/a><br>...","filename":"clam juice","ext":".jpg","w":460,"h":817,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491369008308,"time":1491369008,"md5":"\/fI7WuXgkmuS7sphyHE2cw==","fsize":94971,"resto":119553475,"id":"s07QR4Qp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119570433,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:11:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119561727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119561727<\/a><br>What you need is a cross-platform barrage of funny but true instagram-tier memes to passively shame the CNN viewers who see them in their feed","time":1491369062,"resto":119553475,"id":"V24sfaLB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119571424,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:22:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119553939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119553939<\/a><br>I&#039;m a bit late but add Dr. Drew to that list with the first reply to your post","time":1491369721,"resto":119553475,"id":"oGdWZKES","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119572797,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:37:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119566574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119566574<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119570366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119570366<\/a><br>Just like, https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=stO<wbr>jeylx4Fw unnghhhhh....","filename":"hillarytruck-2","ext":".jpg","w":494,"h":353,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1491370627918,"time":1491370627,"md5":"oj9sw8cOEmjHNXTf5FsP+w==","fsize":156698,"resto":119553475,"id":"KuoCJtFx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119566642,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)00:28:26","name":"Anonymous","sub":"HAPPENING HAPPENING","com":"BOMBSHELL::<br><br>WSJ: RICE NOT ALONE IN \u201cUNMASKING\u201d TEAM TRUMP<br><br>http:\/\/vesselnews.io\/wsj-susan-rice<wbr>-not-alone-unmasking-team-trump\/<br><br>who helped her \/pol\/?","filename":"bf5","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":631,"tn_w":237,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491366506874,"time":1491366506,"md5":"6T\/WQfOF4jy0AK54u4XrUA==","fsize":39406,"resto":0,"id":"BYr\/Z77b","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"happening-happening","country_name":"United States","replies":20,"images":8,"omitted_posts":15,"omitted_images":5},{"no":119571736,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:25:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119571572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119571572<\/a><br>To discredit hi opponents and predessessor at this exact moment in time.","time":1491369914,"resto":119566642,"id":"PYOUQJ2h","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119572013,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:28:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"eric holder","time":1491370114,"resto":119566642,"id":"U4PLy+t1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119572061,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:28:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119567649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119567649<\/a><br>scared the fuck out of me i tossed my laptop","time":1491370138,"resto":119566642,"id":"u8VlGMZ1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119572274,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:31:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Good.

When I was 16 I was expected to help with some &quot;light duty&quot; at the mines to become familiar and at 18 I was dragged off into the mines themselves. You&#039;re talking about some scary shit.<br><br>To my family&#039;s chagrin, I escaped. I taught myself web development and I did that on the side until I got hired by a place in Tennessee, then eventually one in Georgia, and I&#039;ve been down here ever since.<br><br>Coal is dead. What they&#039;re scraping out of those mines to make ends meet is killing these men. Look it up. Complex black lung in men as young as their 30s. There&#039;s been a steep rise over the last 15 years. They can&#039;t even figure it out. It&#039;s taking these men down and putting them into a life of nebulizers and breathing treatments multiple times a day, or ultimately to a double lung transplant. And who&#039;s gonna pay for that? Not a coal miner.<br><br>Meanwhile, the power plants we were selling that coal to are gone. You know why? Cause their plants are old. Coal plants are complex as hell to operate and they need a lot of physical real-estate to operate, not to mention the environmental risks of storing coal ash. You don&#039;t even want to know what happens when that shit spills. Look it up if you love post-apocalyptic scenarios.<br><br>When coal plants get old, they replace them with natural gas plants. Or they retire them entirely and increase output from the neighboring nuclear, hydro, natural gas, whatever. Hardly anyone rebuilds coal plants anymore.<br><br>So who&#039;s gonna buy the coal? How can you save something nobody wants? Natural gas is cheap, requires a smaller plant to produce power, and is easier to transport because you get more energy per square inch.<br><br>Coal is dead. Saving coal is a meme. Scraping these mines bare is killing people.

It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1443381006308","ext":".png","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490193289216,"time":1490193289,"md5":"AScdqMi6ecWacc\/l81+Mwg==","fsize":502696,"resto":0,"id":"xMJzpexb","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":117765779,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)10:42:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117764862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117764862<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/archive.4plebs.org\/pol\/sea<wbr>rch\/image\/AScdqMi6ecWacc_l81-Mwg\/<\/span><br><br>spam faggot<br><br>sage","time":1490193750,"resto":117764862,"id":"dJjwLom7","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117761906,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)10:11:23","name":"Anonymous","sub":"HWNDU CTF GENERAL","com":"http:\/\/www.fact.co.uk\/news-articles<wbr>\/2017\/03\/hewillnotdivideus.aspx<br><br>LIVERPOOL POSSIBLE LOCATION, CANNOT CONFIRM YET, MAY BE RUSE<br><br>GET THE FUCK IN","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490191883562,"time":1490191883,"md5":"cFPbf9hK0QppgE\/\/VKlQog==","fsize":126097,"resto":0,"id":"2EAvDzDa","country":"HU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hwndu-ctf-general","country_name":"Hungary","replies":410,"images":106,"omitted_posts":405,"omitted_images":104,"tail_size":50},{"no":117766061,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)10:44:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117765516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117765516<\/a><br>i happen to have a job. if this remains unclaimed and some other anon channels autism levels currently unimaginable.<br><br>It was only a matter of time before weponised autism came to its critical mass","time":1490193886,"resto":117761906,"id":"gm9dP9B6","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117766062,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)10:44:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117762453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117762453<\/a><br>That was fast","time":1490193886,"resto":117761906,"id":"anwAunzv","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":117766066,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)10:44:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117764656\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117764656<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shadilay blaring through drone speaker<\/span><br>I audibly kek&#039;d","time":1490193887,"resto":117761906,"id":"RyYda5Vi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117766087,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)10:44:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117765712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117765712<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.lightningmaps.org\/?lang<wbr>=en#m=sat;r=0;t=3;s=0;o=0;b=;n=0;y=<wbr>53.0603;x=-1.9624;z=7;d=2;dl=2;dc=0<wbr>;","time":1490193895,"resto":117761906,"id":"NfZu9\/9K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117766088,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)10:44:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"DID ANYBODY SEE THAT FLOATING THING WAS THAT A DRONE OR A BIRD?!","time":1490193895,"resto":117761906,"id":"m3AAncUY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117762219,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)10:13:56","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Ron Paul was right","com":"Is the &quot;It&#039;s too late&quot; Ron Paul meme the most accurate in history?","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-03-22 at 16.12.05","ext":".png","w":1412,"h":586,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":103,"tim":1490192036804,"time":1490192036,"md5":"5ciWEDtvXEqLtP8crIMzLg==","fsize":1350166,"resto":0,"id":"2GYYHC3y","country":"FI","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ron-paul-was-right","country_name":"Finland","replies":4,"images":0},{"no":117762514,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)10:16:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"We&#039;re living in the apocalypse now.

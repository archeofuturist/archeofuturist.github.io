After determining the need, they submit a FISA declaration, which gets reviewed by any one of a number of prominent intelligence officials, then by a high up member of the DOJ such as, but not necessarily, the attorney general. <br><br>After it is reviewed by the AG (Basically a cursory check to make sure all the boxes are checked and that everything is in order), it is submitted to the bipartisan intelligence court for review and discussion. The people on whose behalf the report was submitted are allowed to speak in favor of issuance, and then the judges make their determination. <br><br>Since the FISA warrant came into being during the Carter admin., less than 0.03% of FISA warrants which make it to the FISA court have been denied. This is attributed to the fact that it looks really shitty to request one and be denied, so the people who submit them tend to wait until they&#039;re airtight. <br><br>End of the day, Obama and Lynch did not create the FISA report, nor did they initiate it. This came from FBI agents much further down the chain. The only circumstance where an AG themselves can obtain a FISA warrant is if they show that there&#039;s an emergency need to do so, and even then the warrant is only good for 7 days until they prepare a brief to the intelligence court to justify it. <br><br>Get over it, retard.

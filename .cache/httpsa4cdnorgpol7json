People like him suggest that the changing cultural composition of our communities and even the country is itself a problem \u2013 though they never explain why beyond simple code words and catch phrases. Of course they love to suggest that migrants are \u201ccosting a fortune\u201d, taking jobs, worsening the welfare burden, and bringing in crime and disease to boot. Anyone who tries to correct them on their crap is simply dismissed as being a \u201cliberal snowflake\u201d.<br><br>These bigots cannot accept that different peoples can live together \u2013 as they do and have, in most countries, for most of human history. They make broad claims that the only solution to things is to \u201cfreeze\u201d our communities, or even to return to some mythical time when we were \u201cgreat\u201d.<br><br>So what if immigrants move into your neighborhood? Who cares if people speak English only? Why does it matter what their religion is? For anyone but a racist, these questions do not matter one bit. For everyone else these people are just other human beings taking up residence, working, raising their families, and living their lives.","filename":"17191171_10212355860031215_4858820987042027914_n","ext":".jpg","w":526,"h":524,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492058292310,"time":1492058292,"md5":"wGr9p6FuJ4M9ZbhhgDkwYQ==","fsize":44829,"resto":0,"id":"qru\/uWYG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"for-a-party-which-complains-so-loudly-that-it-is","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":3,"omitted_posts":7,"omitted_images":0},{"no":120870991,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)01:10:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"What a bunch of losers.","time":1492060213,"resto":120867628,"id":"qru\/uWYG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120872060,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)01:21:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120867628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120867628<\/a><br>Diversity+Proximity=Conflict.

His portrayal of Trotsky, written in 1929 - that is, after his expulsion from the Soviet Union - and revised and sharpened for his collection, Great contemporaries of 1937, was unbelievably vicious, compared to his almost solicitous treatment of Paul Hindenburg, Kaiser Wilhelm II and even Adolf Hitler.3 As Ford points out, Churchill\u2019s descriptions of Jews in the revolutionary movement were highly reminiscent of those of outright anti-Semites - he openly referred to the Bolsheviks as \u201cthese Jew commissars\u201d with their aim of \u201ca worldwide communistic state under Jewish domination\u201d4 - but this does not mean that his attitude towards non-revolutionary Jews was the same.<\/span><br><br>To paraphrase a popular saying, \u2018When they were good, they were very, very good; when they were bad, they were deadly.\u2019 He had no problem with \u2018good\u2019 \u2018national Jews\u2019, as he considered that their innate talents were harnessed to the wellbeing of the nation,7 and historically he felt that Judaism had done much to influence the Christian ethical framework which he so appreciated. On the other hand, \u2018bad\u2019 \u2018international Jews\u2019 were a scourge and a mortal danger to civilisation - and Trotsky represented in its most concentrated form the \u2018bad\u2019 Jew, the member of \u201cthis same astounding race\u201d who put his innate talents at the service of revolution.<br><br>http:\/\/weeklyworker.co.uk\/worker\/96<wbr>4\/anti-semitism-churchill-and-the-j<wbr>ewish-question\/<br><br>Tell me, how is globalism any different to international jewry a.k.a Bolshevism?

The 1970s was the rise of neoliberalism, which removed all of those safety nets, stimulated globalization, and hit poor people the hardest, i.e. it hit black people the hardest. That&#039;s the first spike in the unemployment graph you see at the end of the 1970s, when those policies kicked in. And since destructive economic policies, like the globalization of capital, hit poor people, in particular black people, the hardest, they&#039;ve had forces working against them. <br><br>Moreover, although there was economic improvement for black people in the 1960s due to the civil rights movement, there wasn&#039;t *that* much.

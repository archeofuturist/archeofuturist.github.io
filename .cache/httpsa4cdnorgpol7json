But the thing is, it&#039;s not baseless! It&#039;s perfectly logical, and it has statistics to boot. This board also allows you to post anonymously, so all the pent up anger you have against blacks that have been suppressed by modern media and social equality banter can be released here freely.<br><br>Over the course of the past 2 weeks, I&#039;ve lost trust in everyone around me. Call it insanity, but I&#039;m starting to believe everyone hates blacks on the inside. It&#039;s just repressed by overbearing social pressures and standards. I cannot walk down the street anymore without seeing a non black and thinking to myself &quot;That person hates me and my kind deep on the inside&quot;, nor can I look at my black brethren and think &quot;You have no idea just how much you are hated&quot;.<br><br>So, rather than whine and cry, I want to fix it. Blacks have not always been entirely ignorant and lazy, but we are now. Even the great empires of Mali, Songhai, and Ghana prove this (please note that I only label west african empires because that&#039;s where most american black trace back to). What happened to us?<br><br>I&#039;d say it&#039;s a mix of the media (which is poisoning even children of &quot;white man master race&quot;) and drugs, which run rampant in black communities. Black media encourages drugs, theft, rape, ignorance, and &quot;hit and quit&quot; sex. This poisons our children by them having to be raised in environments that are overflowing with drugs, thieves, and rapists. Even if they don&#039;t grow up in these environments, the media romanticizes it and makes it cool to do these things. It actively discourages learning, so most blacks don&#039;t learn. The media also encourages drug consumption, which leads to crackhead types and even more crime.<br><br>So how do we fix it?

A non-economic good (a quantity of timber in a virgin forest, for example) does not attain value for men since large quantities of labor or other economic goods were not applied to its production. Whether a diamond was found accidentally or was obtained from a diamond pit with the employment of a thousand days of labor is completely irrelevant for its value. In general, no one in practical life asks for the history of the origin of a good in estimating its value, but considers solely the services that the good will render him and which he would have to forgo if he did not have it at his command...The quantities of labor or of other means of production applied to its production cannot, therefore, be the determining factor in the value of a good. Comparison of the value of a good with the value of the means of production employed in its production does, of course, show whether and to what extent its production, an act of past human activity, was appropriate or economic. But the quantities of goods employed in the production of a good have neither a necessary nor a directly determining influence on its value.<\/span><br>- Carl Menger<br><br>Labour theory a shit, communism btfo","filename":"1488498678161","ext":".jpg","w":1268,"h":1048,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":103,"tim":1492132541383,"time":1492132541,"md5":"iWCZ9xnmk29concnAFiZ\/A==","fsize":193160,"resto":120979041,"id":"jia\/nQl5","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120995816,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)21:15:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120989295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120989295<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not REAL capitalism<\/span>","time":1492132547,"resto":120979041,"id":"4wf0PO2K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120995917,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)21:16:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120995176\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120995176<\/a><br>The toughest communist on the entire planet atm.","time":1492132596,"resto":120979041,"id":"lD0ZrS3y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120996715,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)21:22:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120995061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120995061<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jews<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;...being Exploited<\/span><br><br>wtf are you even thinking? lurk for another 1\/2 year before even daring to start another thread commiefag, the jews are the reason capitalism isn&#039;t doing very well through the formation and privatisation of central banks, the IMF, Fiat Money, etc.","time":1492132964,"resto":120979041,"id":"Ksxx\/i8Z","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120996840,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)21:23:32","name":"Tar Heel","com":"<a href=\"#p120995816\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120995816<\/a><br><br>That&#039;s the best you can do?

Here&#039;s why.<br>1.China&#039;s 2016 GDP Annual Growth Rate was merely 6.8%, meanwhile China Inflation Rate (CPI) was 2% and the devaluation of China&#039;s Yuan to US dollar was about -6.8%, which means China&#039;s GDP actually decreased 2% in 2016 if we use US dollar to measure it.<br>you can watch the vid in that thread if you don&#039;t believe me &gt;&gt;<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119449928#p119449928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119449928<\/a> <br>2.

Finally, the elephant in the room - China&#039;s housing bubble. The size of housing market in China is about 240 trillion, and China&#039;s GDP is 65 trillion (using Chinese yuan), that&#039;s almost 400% of its GDP. The burst of the bubble will make the 2008 US subprime mortgage crisis looks like a fairy tale.

Remember Saturn is Chronus who is time. The monolith is literally the Stone of the Philosophers that Rhea feed to Saturn so that Zeus might incarnate. To sublimate the Stone and complete the Opus one must too be devoured by Saturn, who is Satan, lead, time. This experience is the same as raising the life force to the pineal gland, the awakening of the Kundalini, the opening of the third eye. It is the same as the experience of death. &quot;Plutarch says that to die is to be initiated into the greater Mysteries; and the Greek word &amp;#964;&amp;#949 ;&amp;#955;&amp;#94 9;&amp;#965;&amp;#9 64;&amp;#8119;&amp; #957;, which signifies to die, means also to be initiated.&quot; It is the experience of non-linear time. The stone is the tesseract, the cube projected into the fourth dimension. This is the story of the Tibetan book of the dead, of the initiatic orders, and even modern myths like the Lego Movie, Waking Life, The Space Odyssey or Enter the Void. You can literally break time out of its linear order my friend, it has long been a goal of silly mystics the world over. Let him with the ears to hear listen and tremble. Many who know will disagree, but I think this is an experience which no man should wish upon themselves. Anathema Maranatha.<br><br>THIS IS BROTHERHOOD OF SATURN SHIT. THIS IS SATANIC.

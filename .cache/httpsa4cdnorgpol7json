This really made my almonds activate. What if \/pol\/ claims SC:R? <br><br>You can start an open \/pol\/ channel very easily in Bnet, the 1v1 savagery in the game btfos all the snowflake &quot;team&quot; moba players who need participation awards for being &quot;healers&quot;. In fact, SC:R is going to be a massive spotlight on the &quot;skills&quot; of the snowflake moba generation as Worst Korea ascends to rape them once again.<br><br>I think SC:R is \/ourgame\/ and I think it may quickly become an enclave as Blizzard won&#039;t pay to moderate it as the salty spic wishes. The servers will be f2p, original at patch 1.18 is f2p already, and SC:R will use the same servers\/channels. The only difference is that it will be HD-4K and f2p isn&#039;t. Bottomline, they can&#039;t hide behind the hipsters at Blizzard since they won&#039;t be there.<br><br>https:\/\/us.battle.net\/forums\/en\/sta<wbr>rcraft\/topic\/20753836391","filename":"non gosu fgt btfo","ext":".png","w":1116,"h":590,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":132,"tim":1491495931464,"time":1491495931,"md5":"k3Iq2z89JIdtuafPFaXaqQ==","fsize":495262,"resto":0,"id":"pVHHTa3S","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"starcraft-remastered-is-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":26,"images":10,"omitted_posts":21,"omitted_images":7},{"no":119766192,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)13:25:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119764863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119764863<\/a><br>Jews are not white","time":1491499552,"resto":119759103,"id":"Bkx57Hoy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119766392,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)13:27:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119760795\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119760795<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;US east dota2 servers<\/span><br>Do you mean the Peru servers?","time":1491499654,"resto":119759103,"id":"x84CqD\/u","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119766461,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)13:28:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119766020\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119766020<\/a><br>You literally just DL it.

Christianity can&#039;t compete, though it&#039;s second best overall. Christians have to rely on God for their salvation and generally can&#039;t do much on their own besides follow the teachings and be good people. Buddhists can directly, intentionally make themselves into good people, and go far beyond that, either by themselves, with the help of fellow Buddhists, or with the help of deified Buddhas if you&#039;re into those kinds of beliefs.<br><br>Buddhism solves all your problems and gives you full control and understanding if your mind, which is after all what determines whether you sin or not, and whether you have a good life or not. Why bother with any other religion, or with atheism?

If you are MGTOW or any other brand of anti-gynocentrism then you know what the main problem in our society is: women getting way too powerful and confident. So powerful and confident that they don&#039;t mind fucking up men&#039;s lives. Well, a solution has finally come:<br>Male to female transgender people.<br><br>Pic related is of a female weightlifting championship which was won by a male to female transgender by a margin of more than 40 pounds (19kg). The actual women there had no chance at all. Even if those women were to train harder for years they would still only be able to lift like 10 extra pounds. Nowhere even close to the difference between the trans woman. Why is this good? Well, we have to think about why women have gotten so cocky. Basically: we let them.<br><br>Imagine the caveman times. If a woman got out of hand his husband (owner) would hit her and that was the end of the problem. The woman was clearly physically inferior and had to follow the orders of the superior male. So what has happened? We have laws that protect women from male violence, but this is ridiculous!<br><br>Picture you getting into a fist fight in the bar with another man. No one will even call the cops unless you start damaging property or killing someone. If you just throw hits at each other fairly then even the cops will consider it a minor skirmish that isn&#039;t worth prosecuting over.<br><br>But what if you hit a woman even once? Everyone will be calling the police. Even though it is a fair fight! The woman can hit back all she wants! Therefore, there are laws that are specifically about protecting women and thus now women can misbehave while expecting daddy government to protect them from everyone else. (Before you say that it isn&#039;t fair because women have less muscle, when men fight one always has more muscle than the other so if you accept that then there is no problem with men vs women fist fights)<br><br>cont.","filename":"trans","ext":".jpg","w":780,"h":438,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491756987419,"time":1491756987,"md5":"st5DmCvtMeynglMm9ZeYEA==","fsize":82089,"resto":0,"id":"rAVT2CU\/","country":"PA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"support-trans-rights","country_name":"Panama","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":120303898,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)12:56:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"cont:<br><br>Another part of this is achievement. Before female &quot;sports&quot; and female &quot;competitions&quot; were a thing, women would not ever win anything. Female wrestling is basically inferior wrestling but because of political correctness, a female&#039;s medal weighs as much as a male medal. So now women feel accomplished. They feel like they can win things and thus are not inferior. So how do we fix this? BY HAVING MALE TO FEMALE TRANS WOMEN.<br><br>If a woman becomes disrespectful and gets out of hand, a trans woman can knock her the fuck out in one hit and that&#039;s the end of her silly behavior.<br><br>A woman tries to accomplish something by winning a sports competition or maybe a chess competition and then a trans woman beats her so hard that she realizes how inferior she actually is and gives up on ever achieving anyting in her life, like she should becuase she is an inferior lifeform. Worth less than a piece of shit.<br><br>So I say accept trans women! Accept trans people in general so that no one notices our actual intentions. Support the lgbt movements to accept trans people into competitions. I want trans people in the olympics every fucking year beating the crap out of female &quot;athletes&quot;. I want every woman in the face of earth to realize how inferior they actually are, so we can go back to the good old times.","time":1491757016,"resto":120303845,"id":"rAVT2CU\/","country":"PA","country_name":"Panama"},{"no":120304187,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)12:59:13","name":"sage my shit up","com":"<a href=\"#p120303845\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120303845<\/a><br>I think you may have succeeded in posting the most autistic degenerate thread this year.

Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian.

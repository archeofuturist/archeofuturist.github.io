You must be successful, reliable, hardworking, and, above all, happy. Do people in your life trust and respect you? What does your family think of you? Racial politics doesn\u2019t have to be the only factor of that.<br><br>If you can\u2019t achieve these things in your real life, then you are wasting your time here. How can you think you are able to help others, when you can\u2019t help yourself? Always remember: we live in first world countries and have opportunity that most people born on this planet don\u2019t. Spend your time wisely and keep your real life priorities in order.

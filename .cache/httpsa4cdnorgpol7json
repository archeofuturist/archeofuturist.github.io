It&#039;s a frequently cited talking point I see on far-right message boards, but I never really found a book that discussed it. The Myth of the Andalusian Paradise very briefly mentioned the Jews opened the gates for the Muslims in one of the battles, so I know it&#039;s true and not some outlandish conspiracy theory. Jews collaborating with Muslims would tie this all together very nicely for me.","filename":"juden","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":275,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":137,"tim":1490603087338,"time":1490603087,"md5":"8Gu20LTzrKHCztbpfFE5tQ==","fsize":781783,"resto":0,"id":"PbFFo\/Gk","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-there-any-books-that-are-similar-to-culture","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118482492,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)02:34:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"http:\/\/www.independent.co.uk\/news\/w<wbr>orld\/americas\/bestiality-legal-cana<wbr>da-supreme-court-a7073196.html<br><br>http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/politics\/lib<wbr>eral-legal-marijuana-pot-1.4041902<br><br>Canada legalizes most forms of bestiality two years ago and now not even two years later is legalizing all weed.

Darker climates have a light bottleneck. <br><br>So the LT populations of N Europe, N India, Africa, and the Arabian peninsula evolved to favor a carbohydrate metabolism over hunting. One thing this proves is that a carb metabolism is superior to fat metabolism, so keto BTFO get fucked dumb paleo cucks. <br><br>HOWEVER, one thing that is overlooked is that yogurt has carbs, despite being fermented. Something like 75% of the original lactose remains in yogurt. Yogurt is also tolerated by lactose INTOLERANTS. Thus, it&#039;s probably the bacteria-cleaved lactose split into its glucose and galactose constituents, causing no problem for the intolerants. <br><br>But this brings up another question: if yogurt has sugar, how the fuck did LT evolve? Drinking milk would not give you a carb advantage. It has no natural vitamin D. Dairy can be eaten by intolerants in the form of yogurt and cheeses. <br><br>There is literally NO immediately logical reason for lactose tolerance to have evolved. Vitamin D is bunk. Calcium is bunk. Potable water is bunk. All these things are achievable through fermentation and very primitive cheesemaking. <br><br>I believe it&#039;s probable that there was a sort of systemic &quot;neoteny&quot; that was selected for in these populations, and that LT was just a side effect of that. Pastoralism is a unique lifestyle - it combines low density communities with high food availability.

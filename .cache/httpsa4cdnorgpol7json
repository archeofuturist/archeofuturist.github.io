So what do we know about April 26th? <br><br>-The US govt will be conducting what they&#039;re calling &quot;Operation Gotham Shield&quot; although I don&#039;t know much about that yet.<br>-Donald Trump promises &quot;big&quot; announcement on tax reform on April 26.<br>-It&#039;s Melanias birthday.<br>-It&#039;s a new moon, a supermoon in fact. <br>-Apparently there is some symbolism in masonic numerology having to do with 163 being the 38th prime number, But that&#039;s a stretch.<br>-April 25 is &quot;Highest Probability&quot; day for North Korean nuclear test. <br>-April 26 is a big day in North Korea, something having to do with &quot;April Revolution&quot;, I&#039;m not up to speed on that either.<br>-ASEAN summit<br><br>Anything else? Considering the recent events and power outages, some folks are predicting a flase flag on that day.

One thing I have to admit I never really connected to is the idea of charity or service -- NOT because I lack empathy, but rather because it seemed almost strange to me to focus on, say, feeding a homeless person, when there are all these other problems that are &quot;closer&quot; to me that need fixing -- helping the people in my own life with their struggles, illnesses, grief, etc., being a better person for my family, and that sort of thing. It almost seemed arbitrary to think of going out and putting my energy toward a problem removed from my own life when there&#039;s always so much &quot;at home&quot; that needs that kind of care. <br><br>Today, however, it struck me in a new way. As I look at the world around me, I can&#039;t help but feel that humanity is an unsolvable problem. I&#039;m sure I don&#039;t need to elaborate on what I mean by that. So I&#039;m suddenly seeing this call to service as an answer to that. It&#039;s unsolvable at the macro level, but as an individual, I can spread truth, mercy, and grace wherever I go, and there is no place that doesn&#039;t need those things, and that is what saves us, in a way, because the world will never be &quot;saved&quot; in the way we want it to be.<br><br>I&#039;d be curious to hear what other Christians think.

I think OP was way too optimistic, I believe that at least 70% of people won&#039;t be able to find work in the near future. Many IT jobs and law related jobs for example can easily be replaced by robots and computers. This is also the main reason why mass immigration from shit countries is so dangerous. Most muslims have below average IQ and have no education. Even if they wanted to contribute to society, there&#039;s simply no way for them to do so. It&#039;s hard enough for highly educated white people to get an OK job these days. So they&#039;re doomed to turn to crime and violence from day one!<br><br>Look at the whole HWNDU saga. There is truth to the stereotype that a lot of people here are unemployed. Instead of using their energy, creativity and talents on a job, they instead hunted Shia across the world. It was pretty funny and cute. It was also pretty impressive when people tracked down ISIS camps and had them bombed. Some people here are clearly very intelligent. But what will happen when these people get more angry and bitter, and decide to use their talents in a more destructive way?

In this respect communism is differentiated from socialism, which, out of economic necessity, restricts access to articles of consumption and services based on one&#039;s contribution.<br><br>In further contrast to previous economic systems, communism would be characterized by the holding of natural resources and the means of production in common as opposed to them being privately owned (as in the case of capitalism) or owned by public or cooperative organizations that similarly restricts their access (as in the case of socialism). In this sense, communism involves the &quot;negation of property&quot; insofar as there would be little economic rationale for exclusive control over production assets in an environment of material abundance.<br><br>The fully developed communist economic system is postulated to develop from a preceding socialist system. Marx held the view that socialism\u2014a system based on social ownership of the means of production\u2014would enable progress toward the development of fully developed communism by further advancing productive technology.

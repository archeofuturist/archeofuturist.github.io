That interview will appear in a forthcoming issue of Against the Current here we present the brief excerpt in which Chomsky comments on the controversy over The Bell Curve.<br><br>Robert McChesney: The New York Times Sunday Magazine in October published a cover story on Charles Murray, discussing his IQ theories that suggest social stratifications along the lines of race and class are due to genetics, not social factors. Recently a member of the Illinois state legislature stated that African-American state employees were lazier than white state employees, and that accounted for some (if not most) of the state&#039;s fiscal crisis. Without meaning to sound alarmist, is there something going on here that marks a new direction?<br><br>Noam Chomsky: First, there is nothing particularly new going on. Over twenty years ago I wrote a long essay discussing in detail the work of Richard Herrnstein (see Chomsky&#039;s 1973 collection, For Reasons of State -- ed.) on which much of the current Herrnstein-Murray book is based, and showing it was a tissue of absurdities, even if we accept its \u201cscience\u201d (which in fact merits no such honorific term).<br><br>Part of what is happening is simply a scam. The trick is to take some position that will be greatly welcomed by the powerful (say, the editors and readers of the Wall Street Journal, etc.) with no need for concern about the status of the alleged empirical grounds or the validity, or even sanity, of the arguments.","time":1490182310,"resto":117749401,"id":"tTSECkgl","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117749525,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)07:32:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117749485\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117749485<\/a><br><br>Service to power will suffice to guarantee rave reviews, massive exposure, huge sales and the other corollaries to service to power. Then, the authors pray that someone will condemn them -- if not, they can invent it. At this point they can portray themselves as tortured victims of powerful forces -- like Black mothers, the radicals who (as we know) run the universities, etc.<br><br>The original gets huge media exposure, and the suffering of the victims who dared to brave the Black mothers and radicals who rule the world even more so. As I say, it&#039;s a scam, quite a comical one in fact, but one that works brilliantly in a highly conformist intellectual culture, with remarkable intellectual and moral standards.<br><br>The \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d comedy has many of the same features. In fact, the remarkable issue of the New York Times Book Review that was led off by a long praise of Herrnstein-Murray had many examples of the scam: effusive praise for a book that \u201cdared\u201d to say the elite had merit, even notice of the \u201cbrave, heroic\u201d book by Harold Bloom that had the courage to say that students should read Shakespeare.<br><br>One must be awe-struck in admiration of this heroism. In the intellectual culture, it is all taken quite seriously, an interesting indication of that culture&#039;s character.<br><br>There are good reasons why the Herrnstein-Murray sort of thing should be undergoing another one of its period revivals today. Social policy, particularly in the Anglo-American societies, has been designed over the past fifteen to twenty years to devastate families, children, working people, Blacks and vulnerable sectors generally, while directing resources to welfare for the rich.","time":1490182345,"resto":117749401,"id":"tTSECkgl","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117749558,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)07:32:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117749525\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117749525<\/a><br><br>Of course this leads to all kinds of \u201csocial problems\u201d (substance abuse, falling achievement, etc.).

His deflection cannot explain why IQ correlates with the rest of the middle to middle-upper class which encompass a MUCH higher percentage of the population than the super rich with banking connections. Chomsky has astounded me before with his intellectual absurdities, but this one really epitomizes his flawed thinking. One can make a claim that his anti-capitalism does pit him at fundamental odds, but this is just a blatant denial of facts!

That is: for Herrnstein-Murray and their elite cheerleaders the topic should not be, for example, how high-tech industry would collapse in a true free market where the crutches of publicly funded research and development and subsidies have been removed. Nor should it be how the geniuses on Wall Street regularly crash the system and have to run to the nanny state to be rescued.

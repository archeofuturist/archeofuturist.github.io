The dude is a rat on a scale unlike any other. Trump is smart and knows Ryan is trying to undermine the his Presidency and we know Trump doesn&#039;t like people who stab him in the back. At his rally in Kentucky, Trump gave praise to Rand Paul and he said he look forward to working with him. He has also been working with Tom Price and doing everything he can to hear all the ideas on the repeal and replace of ObamaCare. Odds are, he&#039;s going to say something about how Rand Paul has a great idea for a health care bill and start moving towards that one, or maybe wait after tax cuts, in order to show the incompetence of Ryan and the stellar abilities of Rand Paul. <br><br>Trump is trying to kill two birds with one stone: Get Paul Ryan out as Speaker of the House and replace him with either Tom Price or Trey Gowdy and then work on the Senate to oust Mitch &quot;Turtle man&quot; McConnell and replace him with Rand Paul. <br><br>Trump is preparing for the future. He knows there are good people wanting to help this country, he is putting his people in the spotlight so that way when they, possibly, run for President in the future in 2024 and later, the media will have a hard time taking them down. He wants what&#039;s best for this country, he never truly cared for this bill because if he did he would be furious right now and take names on who didn&#039;t follow through.

He will be practical; he will be progressive; he will cultivate efficiency; he will trust in evolution; he will do the work that lies nearest; he will devote himself to deeds, not words. Thus struck down by blow after blow of blind stupidity and random fate, he will stagger on to a miserable death with no comfort but a series of catchwords; such as those which I have catalogued above. Those things are simply substitutes for thoughts. In some cases they are the tags and tail-ends of somebody else\u2019s thinking. That means that a man who refuses to have his own philosophy will not even have the advantages of a brute beast, and be left to his own instincts. He will only have the used-up scraps of somebody else\u2019s philosophy; which the beasts do not have to inherit; hence their happiness. Men have always one of two things: either a complete and conscious philosophy or the unconscious acceptance of the broken bits of some incomplete and shattered and often discredited philosophy. Such broken bits are the phrases I have quoted: efficiency and evolution and the rest. The idea of being \u201cpractical\u201d, standing all by itself, is all that remains of a Pragmatism that cannot stand at all. It is impossible to be practical without a Pragma. And what would happen if you went up to the next practical man you met and said to the poor dear old duffer, \u201cWhere is your Pragma?\u201d 1\/2","time":1492756931,"resto":122095921,"id":"kr0urK3z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122107788,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)02:43:35","name":"Americunt","com":"<a href=\"#p122107667\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122107667<\/a><br>Doing the work that is nearest is obvious nonsense; yet it has been repeated in many albums.

It is a deed to throw a pebble into a pond and a word that sends a prisoner to the gallows. But there are certainly very futile words; and this sort of journalistic philosophy and popular science almost entirely consists of them.&quot; 2\/2<br><br>Here&#039;s a vid: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xqN<wbr>aWSwvqhY","filename":"Skepticism-has-limits","ext":".png","w":659,"h":144,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":27,"tim":1492757015669,"time":1492757015,"md5":"IZSW9wj5mKsPe5BrAnEusw==","fsize":104442,"resto":122095921,"id":"kr0urK3z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122103517,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:51:13","name":"Anonymous","sub":"The reason why slavs aren&#039;t cucked like western faggots","com":"In Eastern Europe, there is all kinds of niggers living there.

Modern humans are majority Homo Sapiens. However, some racial groups possess relatively large amounts of DNA from other hominids that simultaneously evolved in entirely different areas under very different circumstances. <br><br>Neanderthal is the most well known example of this. They were native to much colder and more adverse environments than the African Homo Sapiens. Through natural selection, this adversity created a more social, more intelligent ape that possessed greater capacity for planning and foresight. The cold environment required strong communities working together, and the ability to prepare and think ahead for winter. Eventually, of course, they were bred into extinction by other apes with more aggressive numbers and reproductive habits. <br><br>Is it a coincidence that modern humans possessing the most DNA from these other hominids, are also the most successful?

Paul Cornu made history by designing the worlds first successful manned rotary winged aircraft. <br><br>Ship propellers: <br>- Josef Ressel was a Czech Forrester and inventor who designed one of the first working ship propellers. He modified a steam-powered boat Civetta by 1829 and test-drove it in the Trieste harbor at six knots before the steam conduits exploded. Because of this misfortune, the police banned further testing. The explosion was not caused by the tested propeller as many believed at the time.<br>- the first transatlantic journey of a ship powered by a screw-propeller was by the SS Great Britain in 1845.

It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490307906018,"time":1490307906,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"QwU3fjue","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":117992794,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:14:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"THIS MAN WILL BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF RUSSIA, AND COMMUNISM WILL RETURN","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":330,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490307264271,"time":1490307264,"md5":"kx6mIuS08AwVp0p4Qb95bw==","fsize":24225,"resto":0,"id":"6wUyyU9R","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-man-will-be-the-next-president-of-russia-and","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":0},{"no":117993291,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:18:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Literally who?","time":1490307484,"resto":117992794,"id":"4QZaVlOb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117993715,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:21:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117993291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117993291<\/a><br>GENNADY ZYUGANOV THE BASED SAVIOR OF THE PROLETARIAT","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":437,"h":620,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490307668949,"time":1490307668,"md5":"5OHiskkUSj5aPnuYoI8xkw==","fsize":54123,"resto":117992794,"id":"6wUyyU9R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117993825,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:21:56","name":"(you)","com":"I am a supporter of the free market and personal liberties, but the growing degeneracy of the west is pushing me over the edge.

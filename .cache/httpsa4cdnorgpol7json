I hope he is okay with mixing and jizzing his bbc into a vagina full of grade A African cum. <br><br>If he needs to be prep&#039;d to perform, he has to let me know beforehand. I have no problem giving a handy to the bulls to get them erect to pound my wife out, but some bulls prefer a female for that so i need to know their preference so I can prepare prior to the party. My neighbor is also a cuck and has a wife who would be happy to prep the bulls with any of her orifices.","filename":"tumblr_of0x8v44Qm1rh0602o3_r2_540","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":457,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":105,"tim":1491799466000,"time":1491799466,"md5":"d7EnDVXtsbWtpJVFY1Ee6Q==","fsize":70370,"resto":120391312,"id":"MZr3kmlT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120393931,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)00:45:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120391312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120391312<\/a><br>I would let him impregnate my son&#039;s boypussy too.

This wasn&#039;t to pass as straight, for the only reason. Many were attracted to men and women.<br>1. Drugs, encourage gays to be gays. If you got rid of gay sex drugs homosexuality would decrease. End drug trade, and decrease homosexuality prevalence.<br>2. Gayness means that the man will not have children and thus be of no use to the future of their humanity. Its white genocide.<br>3. Bisexuality is hated and discouraged because they have breeding potential. Indeed women are attracted to bisexual men too, and would love to return a man to the sex and\/or marriage market. <br>4. Gay lifestyle has increased as a result of the decline of the quality of women post feminism. Its also the result of declining dowry customs for marriage.<br>5.

Most of you are cheap, unskilled labor, with the occasional decent professional thrown in the mix. In this you are no different than other poor people. What you are, though, is old British empire, and your country has been able to leverage your widespread (if god awful) use of English to make you into THE poor people to hire for IT. Here in Portugal, we hire Brazillians where the Americans and Brits hire Pajeets, and they&#039;re pretty much the same as you guys - for every good coder\/engineer, there&#039;s a thousand dipshits who copy-paste spaghetti off of Stackoverflow and have no fucking clue what it does besides the very specific and narrow thing they needed to do.<br><br>2- There are a few types of migrant groups. The ones who integrate fully, the ones who integrate partially but retain an overpowering sense of tribalism, and the ones who don&#039;t integrate at all. The first category has groups like most western europeans, the last category has groups like niggers and sandniggers, and the second category has groups like jews and you guys. Your propensity to turn to nepotism and tribalism whenever you are given an yota of decision-making power is pretty well known. Whenever a pajeet becomes CEO or manager, 99% of the following hires in his department will also be (quite underpaid) pajeets.<br><br>Overall, you are not the most hated group out there, not by a long shot, but your flaws make your presence hard to stomach. Exceptions exist, of course. If you fully integrate, leave all your third-world bullshit behind AND poo in the toilet, you&#039;ll have no trouble making friends.<br><br>Also, give Goa back :P","time":1492892510,"resto":122300593,"id":"AqauuO2e","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122317562,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)15:42:52","name":"Anonymous","sub":"He dindu nuffin","com":"Why hasn&#039;t he been arrested yet?","filename":"Ulock","ext":".png","w":930,"h":539,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":144,"tim":1492890172031,"time":1492890172,"md5":"2Eh5bWu7Yn1260Q+Jc0JYQ==","fsize":936556,"resto":0,"id":"Ec5Gxnxz","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"he-dindu-nuffin","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":5,"omitted_posts":8,"omitted_images":3},{"no":122321231,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)16:14:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122317562\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122317562<\/a><br>Because the left controls everything.","time":1492892058,"resto":122317562,"id":"1bBdyc9A","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122321285,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)16:14:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122317562\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122317562<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;may not even be guilty, goyim!<\/span><br>I love the shilling they&#039;re doing to protect him.

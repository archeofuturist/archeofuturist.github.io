A 1-for-1. The Democrats, Comey, and everyone else know for a fact that Obama spied on Trump. The way they are trying to compensate for this is by blowing up the Russia story as much as they possibly can so that the general public is deceived into believing the spying was justified.<br><br>Overall, not even Comey wants to imprison a former President, it will completely destroy the Saint Obama narrative the news has been trying to run lately, and I&#039;m sure he&#039;s been convinced that it will overall look bad for the country and destroy the Democratic party as it will take a lot of people down around Obama as well. The Russia narrative was used as a bargaining chip.<br><br>So what will happen is that they will keep blowing up the Russia ties narrative to the point where it will look as if the spying was justified, even though every single thing the Dems and their propaganda arms have released has been debunked and had holes blown into by real investigative journalists, both BernieBro anti-corruption ones and Breitbart ones. <br><br>It will then come out that there was nothing found whatsoever to tie Trump to Russia and there&#039;s nothing to say that Russia actually meddled in the election, but because of all the &quot;smoke&quot; they&#039;ve been trying to show, it was A-OK that the Obama admin tapped Trump.<br><br>The Russia narrative is because the Democrat-controlled deep state wanted to go to war with Russia for a long time due to friction in Syria, the fact that Assad is still above dirt and breathing and Obama&#039;s JV team ISIS recently admitted defeat, and the fact that Iran is the next target on the list, a Russian ally. They wanted to prep the American people and indoctrinate them against Russia in case Russia does not stand for Iran being toppled and sends troops there to defend the country. <br><br>The deep state, for the next 4 years, will continue to attempt to paint Russia with a bad brush (cont&#039;d)","filename":"IovhWYs","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":321,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":126,"tim":1490235626854,"time":1490235626,"md5":"hZaDGy7e2fSR1sOCXRzDVA==","fsize":58414,"resto":0,"id":"r7IJJqcK","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"1-for-1-analysis-for-the-past-few-weeksmonths-of","country_name":"United States","replies":35,"images":1,"omitted_posts":30,"omitted_images":1},{"no":117879589,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)23:23:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1490239404,"resto":117871563,"id":"pfCNSc\/z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117879802,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)23:25:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117879001\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117879001<\/a><br><br>The lengths they&#039;re going to in order to provoke a war are astounding and scary.<br><br>Recently they just randomly blamed the Montenegro coup attempt on Russia without a shred of evidence, exactly the same way our IC did it with the election, just had the Attorney General from Montenegro come out and say &quot;Pretty sure Russia&quot;<br><br>Russia was pissed, said this hurts relations, and demanded that evidence be shown.<br><br>https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2<wbr>016\/nov\/06\/montenegro-prosecutor-mi<wbr>livoje-katnic-russian-nationalists-<wbr>behind-alleged-coup-plot<br><br><br>Then you see John McCain, a few days later, trying hard to push Montenegro into NATO and claiming they&#039;re &quot;under assault from the Russians&quot; just randomly going with the story despite the lack of evidence for it.<br><br>Then Rand Paul&#039;s not buying the bullshit and McCain disingenuously accuses him of &quot;working with Putin&quot;<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pq3<wbr>YdA4Mb84<br><br>They want war with Russia so badly it&#039;s scary","time":1490239520,"resto":117871563,"id":"r7IJJqcK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117881974,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)23:44:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117871563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117871563<\/a><br>Just jail the nigger","time":1490240657,"resto":117871563,"id":"bhF17QFK","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":117884378,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:05:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117881974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117881974<\/a><br><br>O&#039;reilly&#039;s getting all pissed off tonight claiming if Obama knew about this he&#039;s going to jail.

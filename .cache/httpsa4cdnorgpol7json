Sweden without Swedes? Italy without Italians, Britain without Britons, France without the French? People should recognize if they are foreigners in a country, not undermine the culture. Europeans cannot be allowed to become a minority within their own countries as it ruins the culture and eliminates them from existence. Diversity should be expressed with countries having their own people with their own culture. Otherwise, every place in the world is the same. That&#039;s not diversity. That doesn&#039;t give many cultures to an area, it mixes it all until it turns until a uniform blob. People ought to be proud of their heritage, not ashamed, and while countries in aid need help, they should rather build safe areas within other muslim countries that share a similar cultural identity than bringing them on to mainland Europe and calling them Europeans. The Muslim Immigration Crisis can be easily solved by having our partners in the Middle East help by building safe zones in Syria and by helping share the workload, with us helping economically in the region. This is a simple solution to allow European culture to exist and thrived as it has for hundreds of years while still giving humanitarian aid to the Middle East.<br>Write something along these lines for your debate.","time":1491443254,"resto":119686849,"id":"eFu2JPrE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119688089,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)21:48:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119686849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119686849<\/a><br>Do this","filename":"1489028569321","ext":".png","w":730,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":102,"tim":1491443310903,"time":1491443310,"md5":"67QuXWusiZGwV3DLtdd9Tg==","fsize":116377,"resto":119686849,"id":"5abkjYKl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119690126,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:09:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119687986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119687986<\/a><br>Thats general idea I am targeting for my points thus far.

Deconstructing the arguments of the Greens and Sarkeesian&#039;s is not difficult because, they simply aren&#039;t arguments in the philosophical sense, they are opinions. As such, you cannot judge the actual quality of the content he produces on the merits of his ability to deconstruct unsubstantiated gibberish which is easily refutable. Indeed true quality would manifest itself in his ability to reconstruct his own positions in a cohesive way. Here I find that he fails miserably, often ending up postulating superficial arguments which themselves are about as aloof as those claims that come from the &quot;new left&quot; he so much rejects. You will often find him recoiling in conversations where it comes down to actual policy with any economic or geopolitical implication. He has time and again proven that he isn&#039;t good for anything else than to shout at left-wing politicians which he considers to be idiotic. His understanding of political theory is extremely flawed, as is his understanding of political and economic ignorance. For all that he himself would claim, he would actually benefit from a few university courses, although I doubt his ego would be able to take it. As someone who has finished studies on the the doctoral level, I find his &quot;analysis&quot; trivial at best, if I were to consider them analysis at all. Concealing a lack of proper schooling in a subject with anger might work amongst the masses, but not amongst the educated.","time":1491442967,"resto":119677782,"filedeleted":1,"id":"UXsHL3dl","country":"SE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119687591,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)21:43:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"hes a stupid faggot","time":1491443017,"resto":119677782,"id":"31NxZVP9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119689831,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:06:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119680143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119680143<\/a><br>Nah he was actually hacked about a month ago.

Prior to 2015, ISPs were regulated by the Federal Trade Commission, so privacy regulations were &quot;consumer expectation&quot; focused. In 2015, the FCC voted to reclassify broadband providers as &quot;common carriers.&quot; The FCC privacy regulations have a &quot;carrier-centered&quot; approach. This created two opposing sets of regulations for ISPs - the FTC &quot;consumer expectations of privacy&quot; policy and the FCC&#039;s &quot;carrier determines data usage&quot; policy. To remedy that, the FCC voted to regulate ISP privacy solely through FCC carrier-driven regulations. Meanwhile, NADA went into effect, and, since the FCC regulations are carrier-based, the carriers had the right to determine how they applied the NADA rules to data. In other words, the carriers had the power to censure. Yesterday&#039;s S.J. 34 ruling disapproved the FCCs regulation of ISPs. My understanding is that jurisdiction of broadband carriers will be moved back to the FTC where they will, again, be based on &quot;consumer expectations.&quot; The good news is we&#039;ll have a choice in if\/how our data is used, as well as legal recourse if it&#039;s used without our permission. The bad news is, there will probably be a fee for opting out.

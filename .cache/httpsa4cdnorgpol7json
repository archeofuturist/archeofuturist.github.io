The ground become so cursed that mosques cannot be built on the grounds, for all eternity. This simple fact is oft overlooked and rarely weaponized, except in some parts of Italy. The west has only been reactively cursing the grounds, and we need to proactively do it. But pigs blood in europe wont eliminate Islam, it can only be cut off from the source. We must &quot;spill&quot; the blood of pigs across the entire middle east. How can we do this though? One word: Crop-dusting. <br>I am assuming that we dont really need to &quot;fertilize&quot; the grounds, we just need to give the sands a light sprinkle. So lets say we have the crop duting planes fly way up high and cover a 0.2 mile wide tract of land. Plus flying high keeps us away from stray gunfire from the locals. A decent crop duster can cost 50k bucks. Now we nee to know how many of them we need.Well, the southernmost ME country is Yemen, which begins at 8 degrees north. Turkey (the northern most) ends at around 43. Thats 35 degrees. There are 69 miles to a degree. 35x69=2415. Five planes per mile means 12,075 planes. Times 50k, 600k dollars. The annual counter-terrorism budget is 16.6 billion per year in the USA alone. This is 3.6% of our yearly budget just to get these planes. Now all we need is to just dry up pigs blood into powder from all the slaughterhouses (its not used for anything much so it will be cheap), get it to the middle east, and achieve liftoff. We can have rednecks in their planes meme Islam out of existence. For all of time their grounds will be cursed, no mosques to be built anywhere. And after that we can just have every country pull a donald and build walls. Locals will go back to simply reactively cursing. We will tell our children of the time we memed an entire religion out of existence.","filename":"isis-flag","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1536,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490216484836,"time":1490216484,"md5":"9vqzqRubmJD\/z3Sgd1TgXw==","fsize":91590,"resto":0,"id":"\/LdBifxz","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-2-meme-islam-out-of-existence","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":2,"omitted_posts":5,"omitted_images":1},{"no":117827816,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:17:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"You fuckin genius","time":1490217453,"resto":117825258,"id":"EAvE3gfh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117828007,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:18:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117827452\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117827452<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it happened in Romania.<\/span>","filename":"5ca","ext":".jpg","w":570,"h":558,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":122,"tim":1490217527038,"time":1490217527,"md5":"Vll07ttfEJJdyJl2Qe\/yCw==","fsize":266462,"resto":117825258,"id":"41eLkrHW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117828270,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:20:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117825717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117825717<\/a><br>It&#039;s haram because it&#039;s cannibalism.","time":1490217624,"resto":117825258,"id":"MdZJhac9","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":117828444,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:21:34","name":"Donk","com":"Wait, it looks like rain and snow will &quot;cleanse&quot; the ground.

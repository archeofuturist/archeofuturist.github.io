Total failures at nation building, every nation they touch they fuck up<br>6. Insular, cant into world domination. Despite being world powers, they are being defeated population wise as we speak soon to be outbred completely. Possibly the dumbest race in existence. 0 racial awareness<br>7. Have no sense of logic, will revert to some archaic ideal of &quot;honor&quot; randomly when it serves them which will get them killed of course. (see Hitler)<br>8. White people are generally slaves by design, worker drones. They love working for their masters, this is probably the reason why they naturally enslaved other races in their slighty more idiotic years.<br>9. Most arrogant race in the world, by pure luck they were born on a continent without crocodiles, malaria and poisonous snakes and spiders that kill their best men, they still fight each other like dumb animals and kill each other for thousands of years because too stupid to work together.

The African-American high school student was killed by George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old mixed race Hispanic man, who was a member of the neighborhood watch in his Florida community. He claimed he shot Martin, who was unarmed, in self defense after the two became involved in a physical altercation.

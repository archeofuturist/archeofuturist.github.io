But the commies managed a miracle: the senate and congress have just approved a law that will completely open all borders for any country in the world to come here. Sounds bad? Check this out: all immigrants will have full access to education, from primary school to college, full healthcare, full housing, social security, an easier path to citizenship and a bunch of other rights. Can it get worse? Yes, it can! All immigrants will also have the right to start a political party, which automatically grants public funds to do as they please. And to wrap it all up with a golden ribbon, they made all of this stuff a right to any generation of children that had theirs parents leave the country and come back.

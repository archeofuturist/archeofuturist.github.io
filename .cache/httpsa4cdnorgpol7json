If you fap to gay porn, that&#039;s 2 guys, and that&#039;s 100% gay. If you fap to &#039;straight&#039; porn, then that has a woman, sure, but you&#039;re also fapping to a guy, which makes it 50% gay. But a trap is like half male, half female, and thus a trap with a girl would add up to 75% girl, and thus only 25% gay. 2 women would be ideal, but that would be a lesbian relationship, which brings it around to gay again. If you fap to furry porn, then it&#039;s in a weird gray area, where if it&#039;s people in fursuits, the same rules apply, but if it&#039;s with animals, I would think it depends on said animal&#039;s sexuality. Then there&#039;s consent. If a person doesn&#039;t consent to something, but the other person does it anyway, that makes the other person stronger, and thus less gay. Let&#039;s say that means they&#039;re about 50% less gay. If it was gay rape, that means that it&#039;s now 75% gay. If it&#039;s straight rape by a man, then it&#039;s 25% gay. And, if it&#039;s trap gay porn, than that&#039;s 12.5% gay. So technically, yes, rape trap porn is the least gay porn there is, but that&#039;s still looped in with trap porn, hence why fapping to trap porn is the least gay thing there is.","filename":"12917942_138796393184476_198519101_n","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492993163640,"time":1492993163,"md5":"IhlS0irWz9IpuKIuFLJTww==","fsize":58626,"resto":0,"id":"3Y9o2y7H","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fapping-to-trap-porn-is-the-least-gay-thing-there","country_name":"United States","replies":20,"images":6,"omitted_posts":15,"omitted_images":4},{"no":122516024,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:34:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122514153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122514153<\/a>","filename":"straightsex","ext":".png","w":1314,"h":138,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":13,"tim":1492994085140,"time":1492994085,"md5":"HfYZRHm\/nPd53SBLqmF\/TA==","fsize":21580,"resto":122514153,"id":"5fk5DgJm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122516043,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:34:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122515267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122515267<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;American<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fat<\/span><br>There&#039;s a surprise","time":1492994099,"resto":122514153,"id":"9vGD+Dei","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122516232,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:36:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122514153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122514153<\/a><br><br>I&#039;m onto you sp.c","time":1492994199,"resto":122514153,"id":"k+iTIrpX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122516523,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:39:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122514153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122514153<\/a><br>Can you take this cancer back to <a href=\"\/b\/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;\/b\/<\/a>","time":1492994346,"resto":122514153,"id":"EoAH5hF2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122516700,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:40:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122515880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122515880<\/a><br>well with straight porn its man and a women, so its 50% gay because you&#039;re still fapping to cock and balls. well, some straight porn is more like 75% gay like blowjob videos where the focus, and highlight is all on the penis and the pleasure the man is receiving from the women.<br><br>trap porn is 50 \/ 50 just like straight porn at minimum because you have tits, but still have the penis too. toss in another women and now you have two pairs of tits and a vagina plus a penis so that makes it 75%. no matter what trap porn averages out about the same as straight porn but exceeds it most of the time.","filename":"f00f7f34febedc31ce6f080a5972d2be","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":500,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492994437054,"time":1492994437,"md5":"TCBqRtWqJjNw2599\/JEVEg==","fsize":39087,"resto":122514153,"id":"3Y9o2y7H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122508765,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:38:13","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Sam Harris Takes The Red Pill","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Y1<wbr>lEPQYQk8s<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In this episode of the Waking Up podcast, Sam Harris speaks with Charles Murray about the controversy over his book The Bell Curve, the validity and significance of IQ as a measure of intelligence, the problem of social stratification, the rise of Trump, universal basic income, and other topics.<\/span><br><br>He actually says right in the opener before the interview even starts that racial difference in intelligence exists, that all the data over the last half century have proven this beyond a doubt, and that within the scientific community there is no real controversy about this, it is simply scientific fact.

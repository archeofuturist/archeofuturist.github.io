The entire time I knew him, he exercised a strict as fuck diet, and worked out every day. He talked to me about how he hated fat people, but I hesitated to judge, because I knew the reason I was not fat was not because of any special motivation, I just naturally tended towards keeping my weight healthy, my diet was absolute shit. Some people are just lucky, like myself, but despite my luck, now I&#039;m eating clean, with even less motivation to do so than yourself.<br><br>One thing I will say is that you will never succeed so long as your motivation inherantly hinges on the external. If getting bitches is why you want to get skinny, you will never succeed, because you can improve your diet for months, but if you continue to not get bitches, eventually the motivation that was driving you will collapse. My only external motivation was people making fun of my terrible diet.<br><br>Only when you convince yourself, and not just trick yourself, but convince yourself that you want to improve your diet and live at a healthy weight for YOU, it will be very hard to succeed. Until you decide you want to go on a diet, not to impress other people, but so you can be proud of the respect you&#039;ve shown yourself, it will be very hard to improve your diet sustainably.<br><br>For me, I had to sort of hit a rock bottom, and learn about things that INSPIRED me to improve myself like listening to Peterson on youtube. Once you treat yourself like somebody you love, like somebody you couldn&#039;t stand to mistreat, that&#039;s when it becomes easier to eat right every day, because it becomes intolerable to mistreat yourself.","time":1490998342,"resto":119102401,"id":"YCmElnWj","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119107285,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)18:15:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Count calories.

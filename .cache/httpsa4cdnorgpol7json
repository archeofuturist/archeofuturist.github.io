Claim that the difference is for shipping. As buyers begin to realize that their money is losing value they will panic and turn to Bitcoin or Amazon gift cards. The Rothschilds will then be totally out of business and they&#039;ll beg us to lower our dollar prices. We will agree if they hand over all their gold. We will then cover ourselves with molten gold and grow taller and taller until the entire world is in our control and we must fight each other in a series of musket duals for sole supremacy.","filename":"FLATE","ext":".jpg","w":1242,"h":925,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":186,"tim":1491298744759,"time":1491298744,"md5":"ZGZ1X9rZafPfUdfZ9MQ9Wg==","fsize":107246,"resto":0,"id":"7o8A9DWD","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"start-selling-dollars-on-amazon-for-20-higher","country_name":"Canada","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":119452807,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)05:40:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119452718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119452718<\/a><br>This is why weed needs to stay illegal.","time":1491298845,"resto":119452718,"id":"BMlivCYe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119452998,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)05:43:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Give me an S give me an A give me an G give me an E","time":1491299014,"resto":119452718,"id":"f\/yeAfUB","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":119453209,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)05:46:50","name":"Gordon Varnsen","com":"<a href=\"#p119452998\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119452998<\/a><br>typical greek","time":1491299210,"resto":119452718,"id":"7o8A9DWD","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119438673,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)02:02:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Can white people wear native battle garb \/pol\/","filename":"4ap9ta9","ext":".png","w":339,"h":306,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":225,"tim":1491285725570,"time":1491285725,"md5":"LCjdGv2emwCEg6X3bHE0Jg==","fsize":210511,"resto":0,"id":"gsHIg8jF","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-white-people-wear-native-battle-garb-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":22,"images":5,"omitted_posts":17,"omitted_images":4},{"no":119448993,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)04:34:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119438673\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119438673<\/a><br>Sigh...<br>In this case it doesn&#039;t matter at all.<br>It&#039;s a carnival\/mardi gras costume, completely harmless.

The only new addition to this rolling stock are new A\/C units (&quot;new&quot; as in &quot;replacement&quot;) and WiFi hotspots.<br><br>* Freight services still receive subsidies for allowing Amtrak to use their lines, even though this is mandatory wherever deemed such. Private dispatchers are instructed to give Amtrak services the lowest priority under all circumstances.<br><br>* It looks like their going back to their &quot;Phase III&quot; scheme - broad Red-White &amp; Blue.<br><br>I had more, but I&#039;m not sufficiently coherent to bother.","time":1491297777,"resto":119441628,"id":"7jzAtQJS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119451906,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)05:26:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119451324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119451324<\/a><br><br>Amtrak was really just created to absorb all the suddenly unprofitable passenger equipment.<br><br>It remained because there is probably just as much paperwork involved in dismantling it (and justifying the sudden &quot;loss&quot; in the form of stagnating, nearly-worthless assets) as compared to maintaining it as a way to funnel a modest amount of money into private freight services.","time":1491297970,"resto":119441628,"id":"7jzAtQJS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119452260,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)05:31:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119451324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119451324<\/a><br>Yes.<br><br>The US (particularly the west) is more rugged than Europe too.

There has been a new negative record of births: 474,000 compared to 486,000 for 2015, which had already fallen to historic lows. There were 608,000 deaths in 2016. In one year, Italy lost 134,000 people -- the equivalent of a city of the size of Ferrara or Salerno.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A year ago, European geographers went in search of &quot;the most desolate place in Europe&quot;. They discovered it not in northern and cold Lapland, but in sunny Spain, specifically in the area of Molina de Aragon, two hours from Madrid. Depopulation has not been the consequence of the climate, as in the Russian steppe or northern forests, but of a demographic crisis.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spain loses 72 inhabitants every day; 20% fewer children are born there than two decades ago. Demographers draw a line where Spain has no future and 30% of the population will be over the age of 65. In some Spanish regions, the fertility rate barely reaches one child per woman. Deaths already exceed births. Spain, in 2050, will be a depopulated nation dominated by older people and singles. The country will lose 5.3 million inhabitants: 11% of the current population. By that time, there will be 1.7 million Spanish children fewer than there are today.<\/span><br><br>The Islamic world has launched a demographic challenge to a sterile Europe.

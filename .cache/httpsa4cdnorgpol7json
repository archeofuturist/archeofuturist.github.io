While Israel is fanatically obsessed with Iran and while the Iranians are Israel&#039;s worst enemy, Syria, despite being a part of the Shia crescent is absolutely not Israel&#039;s worst enemy, in fact they actually like him being their neighbour. There was an Israeli foreign minister was saying that the situation which helps Israel&#039;s security interests the most is having an illegitimate leader of a country as their neighbour, because it essentially provides moral equivalence with Israel&#039;s more amoral \/ immoral actions against the Palestinians and it takes the attention off of them. <br><br>The fact that Assad is seen as illegitimate by most of the Sunni Arab world is a huge boon to Israel and him being in charge actually helps Israel and their security.

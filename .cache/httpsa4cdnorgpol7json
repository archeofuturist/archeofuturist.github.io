Interestingly these guys make a point of saying that &#039;traditional&#039; doesn&#039;t mean just going back in time... They embrace some elements of Liberal\/Left thinking as well - such as taking care of the environment and so on. So, really, it&#039;s a new movement and can appeal to anyone. I think if such groups can replicate and grow, they can extend a positive outreach to normies in their communities.","time":1490699105,"resto":118630914,"id":"syIfeQA7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118637403,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)07:00:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why are burgers so degenerate?

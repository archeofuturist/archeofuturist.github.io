Had me questioning my very existance. I&#039;ve had redpills that left me feeling like my brain was leaking out my ears and my entire perspective on reality shifted. I have also had some of my best keks here, the freedom is intoxicating and it&#039;s becoming harder and harder to hide my power level in my day to day life. If i&#039;m not careful I&#039;ll be locked up in a looney bin.","filename":"1488733269802","ext":".png","w":500,"h":372,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":186,"tim":1491178212133,"time":1491178212,"md5":"S\/8yYCtFofGStvwSna19fg==","fsize":236652,"resto":0,"id":"dOTACZMD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-am-i-becoming","country_name":"United States","replies":127,"images":29,"omitted_posts":122,"omitted_images":27,"tail_size":50},{"no":119292439,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:53:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119266040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119266040<\/a><br><br>same here op. everyone i know thinks i&#039;ve become some combination of insane, retarded, radical narcissist, neonazi. and yet i understand the world better than 99% of people i talk to.<br><br>but i also think the earth is flat and jews are an alien colonizing force trying to conquer this group of continents we call earth in. it&#039;s a simple project of expansion for them. the principles of usury, debt slavery, media monopoly, conquer &amp; divide, and wars to gradually consolidate power are a blueprint with which to conquer foreign worlds. the aryan race is also alien to this earth-pond but it didn&#039;t come to conquer, it came to build and aid. ancient monolithic buildings and past high civilisations are whats left of past aryan visits. nazis knew this, but didn&#039;t have the time to research it indepth or publish significant work. whatever was found after the war got locked up by the jews. all of this sounds batshit crazy but i genuinely believe it to be true. negroid, australoid and mongoloid races are genuine evolutionary products of this flat earth pond.<br><br>there&#039;s vast ice fields behind the antarctic ice wall. and somewhere out there are other earthlike ponds of continents, with alien humanoid species.","time":1491195237,"resto":119266040,"id":"pM1Bro+5","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119294880,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:22:40","com":"<a href=\"#p119266040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119266040<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I can&#039;t seem to get my jollies anywhere else anons.

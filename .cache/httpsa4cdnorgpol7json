It&#039;s a private Christian school, so you&#039;d think it wouldn&#039;t be too bad, but since the nearby city is 43% black, we get force-fed BLM talking points all the time.<br><br>The black students cause the vast majority of the problems at school, but no one ever punishes them beyond a simple detention, because even that is evidence of racism, apparently. We often have &quot;class discussions&quot; about racism, which is really just the black kids and the white kids who pretend they&#039;re black complaining about everything while everyone else sits there and does homework while holding back our thoughts. If a white person ever suggests that perhaps racism is not as prevalent as one might think, they&#039;re of course racist or ignorant or dumb. (Never any arguments, just insults.) The icing on the cake, though, is when our black teachers &quot;reprimand&quot; the black students for going too far, yet say the same things the students do, just in politer terms.<br><br>Teachers also like to use non-black students as examples. One of my best friends moved here from the Philippines at age nine. She speaks perfect English, is ranked fourth in our class, and will become a citizen in a few months. Our English teacher chose to use her as an example of why even first-generation immigrants will be treated more favorably than blacks. I was used as another example; she said I could walk into a store and no one would treat me differently because of my skin color. A friend pointed out this would not be true if I was downtown and was immediately bombarded with accusations of racism.<br><br>Unless you live in an area where white people are the vast majority, you\u2019re going to face this stuff in school every day. It\u2019s just how it is, and it\u2019s a prison, because unless you want your academic career ruined, you can never, ever speak out about it.<br><br>Share your experiences with indoctrination at school.","filename":"IMG_1358","ext":".jpg","w":2592,"h":1936,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":186,"tim":1493250984849,"time":1493250984,"md5":"2YqNowJV3jdsCnT5sarCLw==","fsize":1847277,"resto":0,"id":"l8vLDvtL","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"indoctrination-at-school","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122960558,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:52:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"WE<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ere<wbr>JcjDAKLM","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-26 at 4.51.58 PM","ext":".png","w":625,"h":473,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":189,"tim":1493250774622,"time":1493250774,"md5":"6XbaHL7N1JDA6hRYt9\/hVg==","fsize":415293,"resto":0,"id":"RaAlb\/jv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":122960976,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:56:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122960558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122960558<\/a><br><br>WUZ","time":1493250975,"resto":122960558,"id":"9lwmV7bC","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122960996,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:56:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122960558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122960558<\/a><br>WUZ","time":1493250985,"resto":122960558,"id":"BBV5bD98","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122961260,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:58:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"BLACKSMITHS","time":1493251121,"resto":122960558,"id":"RaAlb\/jv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122955712,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:13:38","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Oy vey!","com":"Kaufland (supermarket), Czech Republic, Prague.<br>It happened today and she got kicked today (because lot of people very trigger)","filename":"18157760_10203384837259796_1950603371648423978_n (1)","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":960,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493248418810,"time":1493248418,"md5":"WeUZLGETxKSsLONlqhvuYg==","fsize":110659,"resto":0,"id":"aGZVePhX","country":"CZ","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"oy-vey","country_name":"Czech Republic","replies":20,"images":2,"omitted_posts":15,"omitted_images":1},{"no":122960427,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:51:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"You have Kaufland in Czech Republic?<br><br>lol","time":1493250719,"resto":122955712,"id":"tEZBxDw\/","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122960521,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:52:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122958977\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122958977<\/a><br>go back to youtube and twitter you dumbass","time":1493250759,"resto":122955712,"id":"dSZmAofa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122960528,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:52:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122955712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122955712<\/a><br>Tattoos are degenerate.

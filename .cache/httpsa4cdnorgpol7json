The group had paid to be taken to the coast, where they planned to risk a boat trip to Europe, but their driver suddenly said middlemen had not passed on his fees and put his passengers up for sale.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cThe men on the pick-up were brought to a square, or parking lot, where a kind of slave trade was happening.

Those held inside are forced to work without pay, or on meagre rations, and their captors regularly call family at home demanding a ransom. His captors asked for 300,000 west African francs (about \u00a3380), then sold him on to a larger jail where the demand doubled without explanation.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Men who lingered there too long without the ransom being paid were taken away and killed, he said. Some wasted away on meagre rations in unsanitary conditions, dying of hunger and disease, but overall numbers never fell. \u201cIf the number of migrants goes down, because of death or someone is ransomed, the kidnappers just go to the market and buy one,\u201d Manente said.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2<wbr>017\/apr\/10\/libya-public-slave-aucti<wbr>ons-un-migration","filename":"Hijab","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":414,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":143,"tim":1491918151593,"time":1491918151,"md5":"n50jo+6ErA8OIlzgo4nubQ==","fsize":36801,"resto":0,"id":"ueVNfyHh","country":"FI","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"libyans-have-solved-the-migrant-problem","country_name":"Finland","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":120599902,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)09:52:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120598836\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120598836<\/a><br>Can I buy some on here or some other website or do I need to actually go there?","time":1491918746,"resto":120598836,"id":"YJbF9eCH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120601841,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:10:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120599902\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120599902<\/a><br>Aren&#039;t your streets littered with Africans?

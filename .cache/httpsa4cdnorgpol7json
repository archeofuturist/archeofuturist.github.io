Ebba Akerlund\u2019s body lay strewn across Drottninggatan mall, bisected by the Muslim who had murdered her and three others in his act of jihad. Muslim norms had been imposed on 11 year old Ebba Akerlund, and an act of jihad that regularly occurs in Muslim cities, as a cursory look at the local news of any Muslim country will show, had been allowed to occur in Stockholm Sweden; a non-Muslim country, on a non-Muslim little girl. Muslim norms should never had been imposed upon Ebba Akerlund, in the centre of her own European nation\u2019s capital.<br><br>But Muslims had been allowed to become proximate to her, to settle in her country, and to not be detained and deported when found resident illegally.

With Muslim proximity, Ebba Akerlund was murdered after Friday Muslim prayers, a sacrifice to the cult of diversity and European erasure.<br><br>Ebba Akerlund is our martyr, our Martyr of Europe, in a war of invasion that is being waged against us. With Muslim proximity comes Muslim norms. If Muslim settlement of Europe is continued, the children of Europe will continue to suffer the imposition of Muslim norms, like Ebba Akerlund did in Drottninggatan on April 7th 2017. This is the future our children of Europe face: murdered in our own homelands, in acts of jihad by Muslims who we have allowed to become proximate to them. <br><br>Few media told the story of Ebba Akerlund. Not the BBC, not the Bild, not CNN, not the New York Times, or the LA Times. Search their websites for \u201cEbba Akerlund\u201d and see for yourself. She was not an Aylan Kurdi, a Muslim drowned by Muslim traffickers on the Turkish coast, or a Syrian child killed by other Muslims in an ongoing Muslim war of jihad and Arab dysfunction.

Now before you scream &quot;tinfoil!!&quot; like the left, understand what it is that he advocated for: A panel that discusses whether continued care for somebody makes fiscal sense if they are too old to really ever enjoy that health again anyway. <br>Like for example, a 89 year old who would need a new heart and liver .. and he will probably die in a few years anyway.<br>That&#039;s technically a death panel. Anyway, I digress. Point is, OP, that as a janitor you&#039;re not going to get invited to clean up any pedo murder scenes whether it&#039;s in a jew temple or a pizza place or a christian church.","time":1493182362,"resto":122840877,"id":"k3hPR2EA","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":122845859,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:01:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;le Jews can&#039;t agree on anything meme<\/span><br><br>I&#039;m glad they could come together for a good cause.

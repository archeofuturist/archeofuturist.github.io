James Frank, R-Wichita Falls, vice chairman of the House Human Services Committee, would allow faith-based groups to deny a placement if it&#039;s against their religious beliefs, as the Texas Tribune reported last month. The discrimination the legislation promotes alone is unconscionable. More tragic, it needlessly inflicts harm on fragile children who need stable, supportive and loving foster homes.<br><br>Gay and lesbian foster and adoptive parents make exceptional parents, and research overwhelmingly suggests that children raised by gays and lesbians are just as healthy, happy and successful as children raised by straight parents. In many cases, potential gay and lesbian foster parents have dealt with stigma and discrimination related to their own identity that is very similar to the stigma and discrimination that comes with being a foster youth. These mutual experiences can create a home environment that is affirming, sensitive and empathic.<br><br>In addition, gay and lesbian foster parents are much more likely to take youth into their homes who have historically been more difficult to place, including teens of color, LGBTQ youth and large sibling groups. More than half of children who are adopted by gays and lesbians have special needs and nearly 60 percent of gays and lesbians adopt or foster across race.<br><br>Perhaps there is no group of youth in the state&#039;s foster care system more adversely affected by the shortage of gay and lesbian foster parents than LGBTQ youth. LGBTQ youth are disproportionately overrepresented in the foster care system; exactly how many teens in the state&#039;s foster care system identify as LGBTQ is an imprecise figure, but an estimated 18-20 percent of teens in the nation&#039;s foster care system are LGBTQ youth.<br><br>It is estimated that nearly half of all gay and lesbian adults desire to be parents at some point.","filename":"christianadoption","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":736,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492876135693,"time":1492876135,"md5":"IOa\/cZQ19aw\/nb6lU1gC6g==","fsize":72015,"resto":0,"id":"GkpJETIY","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"should-religious-adoption-agencies-be-able-to","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":122291247,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:55:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122290478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122290478<\/a><br>What about all the gay parents who secretly diddle their adopted kid","time":1492876549,"resto":122290478,"id":"3Zcfio85","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122290532,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:49:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"why do you hate your nation?","filename":"1466488060753","ext":".png","w":399,"h":536,"tn_w":186,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492876168934,"time":1492876168,"md5":"EOin1Auyc6of87tKkcVVoQ==","fsize":115558,"resto":0,"id":"jZxWtVr4","country":"JP","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-do-you-hate-your-nation","country_name":"Japan","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":122290733,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:51:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Shut the fuck up and fix your country; if you&#039;re not proud of it than get off your lazy ass and make it a country you can be proud of.

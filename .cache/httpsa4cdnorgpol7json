CIA homos declared that all your bases are belong to us about the same time they established NAMBLA. So times of Clinton presiidency were very turbulent just like any other if looking from &quot;stonewalling of the lambs&quot; position.

They needed this PR narrative to distance from voes about little boy prostitutes late night visits to whitehouse during reagan presidency. So that was another reason why Gennifer Flowers psyop was implemented right away. Clinton worked very similar ANGLE angling template as obongo as far as Gandhi non violent resistance goes. Only he used disabled americans for targeting. Remember all those wheelchair accessible toilets? Don&#039;t Ask Don&#039;t tell anyone anything. Loose lips wrapped around rainbow whistles sink ships.

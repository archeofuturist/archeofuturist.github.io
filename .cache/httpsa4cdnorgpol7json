And to woo a woman, a man has to demonstrate value. In the animal kingdom, a male demonstrates value by beating rival males, and bringing back food. Women are not that different. Be able to protect her, make her feel safe, secure, and provide for her. If a bigger alpha comes along and beats the shit out of you and you fail to protect her, she will instinctually be turned on by the winner, and despise the loser. Throughout history, women have survived by letting themselves be fucked by the winner. A winner of a battle, a winner of a raid, a winner of a athletic competition, a winner of money, etc.<br><br>Evolutionary psychology is true because it takes into account the forces that shaped male brains and female brains over hundreds of thousands of years.

History class was normal in elementary school, middle school but by the time I got to high school, we were learning way more about black people than whites. We skipped over the whole of the Roaring Twenties and post-WWI American boom, prohibition, etc. and just learned entirely about the Harlem Renaissance and jazz music. During the Vietnam portion we spent 1-2 days on actual battles and LBJs policies and the next several weeks on civil rights and the protests. <br><br>I always wondered why we had to learn so much about the perspective of essentially 13% of the population of this country, but back then if you questioned anything you got suspended. I imagine in 20-25 years kids in high school will have entire mandatory courses dedicated to black history.","time":1490910526,"resto":118955940,"id":"Yx\/dPq2f","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118974034,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:52:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118964202\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118964202<\/a><br>Speaking of traumatizing kids about lynchings, I remember in my 4th grade class our lefty teacher brought in a book and passed it around that was entirely photographs of lynched niggers.

As did the sudden (and understandable) highlight on all things Muslim for the public.<br><br>A lot of people were too scared to let their children play out in the street until dark, and so once-bustling neighborhoods became lifeless during (and after) school hours. Once upon a time, a parent could tell their child to be back before dark and have a reasonable assumption that their child would come home unmolested.

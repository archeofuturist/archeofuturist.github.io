Worried about the \/pol\/ movement. Worried that it may be failing. And I need reassurance. Reassurance that we&#039;re still on the right track, doing the right thing as a collective.<br><br>Trump hasn&#039;t done much to justify his presidency in the eyes of his opposition and his supporters. After his inauguration, he has made far too many mistakes. This is in stark contrast to his performance during the Republican primary and the general election, where he could do no wrong. I fear the same for other elections in Europe, in countries like France, like Germany, and others.<br><br>The question here is: after you elect them. What next? What exactly do they do? And how do they go about achieving that goal? \/pol\/ seems to be uncertain what Trump should do while in office, what immediate problems he must tackle, and how. And that uncertainty could prove to be his undoing, our undoing. The meme magic that got him elected is waning, and its influence on Europe is weakening. The left has already gained back some lost ground. Should the incumbent in the European countries notice this weakness and attack it, they may well stay in power, and our work will ultimately be for naught. If we&#039;re not careful enough, even the United Kingdom may end up lost, isolated, cut off, when Brexit is complete.<br><br>So \/pol\/, decide on a direction, here and now. What exactly do we want to achieve? What is our purpose? And most importantly, what immediate actions do we have to take to help achieve that means? &quot;Make X great again&quot; sounds nice and all, but it&#039;s far too vague to sustain the magic.<br><br>If we have strayed, may we get back on the right track, and ultimately achieve greatness.

You can see in her eyes that she is wearing a shit-eating grin on her face...<br><br>This old man likely is celebrating the anniversary of his deceased wife. This was their favorite diner. Maybe they fell in love in a place similar to this. Maybe he learned what it meant to be chivalrous as a young man and had purchased her a meal and a milkshake with the money he had earned at his very first job. He loved his wife and they had a real relationship. They were married and they were faithful until death did them part. He worked hard throughout his life to provide for the two of them and, as their love grew, the children they brought into this world. When she finally passed he was heartbroken, but could keep his smile and chipper attitude knowing that he had known true love and had built a beautiful life not only for himself, but for her. He was happy, and though things have changed he still feels fulfilled. He didn&#039;t search for another lover to fill the void - he&#039;s an old-fashioned one woman kind of man. He was stronger than death itself in this regard.<br><br>The girl taking the photo laughs and smirks. &quot;Look at this pathetic, crazy old man smiling at a photo while he eats his lunch.&quot; She will never know happiness. She will never know love. She traded it all for the meaningless vanity of likes and shares.","time":1491649658,"resto":120108163,"id":"mm+IIPqI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120119609,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)07:14:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120119087\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120119087<\/a><br>When did it start raining?

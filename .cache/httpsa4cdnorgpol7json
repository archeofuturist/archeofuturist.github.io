At 9:20 p.m., just moments after the House passed the bill, Pavy&#039;s son-in-law Dr. Carl Weiss, a physician from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, approached Long and, according to the generally accepted version of events, fired a handgun at him from four feet away, shooting him in the torso.

At a speech before a crowd at the courthouse in Courtland, Alabama on July 31, Haughey came into a confrontation with a man named Collins, an ally of Hinds who espoused the cause of his Republican opponent. When Haughey was said to have been obnoxious toward Collins, a man known to be prone to violence, a fistfight ensued. The altercation ended when Collins pulled a pistol and fired it into Haughey&#039;s stomach. Confined to a bed, Haughey lingered on for five days before succumbing to his wounds on August 5, 1869 at age 43.

to all non-white \/pol\/lacks that if you spend all day in your room and living in a european\/north american country you are probably suffering from extreme vitamin D deficiency which leads to depression, muscle\/headaches and weakened skeletal integrity. The entire reason that people living at northern latitudes developed pale skin was to more efficiently create vitamin D from the less abundant sunshine in their environments. <br><br>This applies double if you are also overweight due to how obesity depresses the bioavailability of d3. The lack of lactose tolerance among most dark skinned people further contributes to deficiency since most of the foods fortified with vitamin D are dairy products. Certain kinds of fish such as salmon can be good dietary sources as well but they tend to be seasonal or expensive. <br><br>Invest in a vitamin D supplement and\/or go outside more often to use the coming summer sunshine to increase your D levels. It will improve your mood and maybe even make you less resentful towards white people.","filename":"muh sun vitaminz","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":400,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491569365446,"time":1491569365,"md5":"gE7G+ekwx+8ZaFHGQDM30w==","fsize":48321,"resto":0,"id":"kuutna+e","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"reminder-to-all-nonwhite-pollacks-that-if-you","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":119941671,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:51:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119941399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119941399<\/a><br><br>And where do you live, Nebraska?","time":1491569506,"resto":119941399,"id":"QGA2M15x","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119939155,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:30:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"Not even three months in and WAR","filename":"Frank-Martin","ext":".jpg","w":860,"h":798,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":231,"tim":1491568255280,"time":1491568255,"md5":"A0+kLViWQls\/+3owlBZnZQ==","fsize":177820,"resto":0,"id":"vqdgrtyp","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"not-even-three-months-in-and-war","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":3,"omitted_posts":11,"omitted_images":2},{"no":119940482,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:41:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119939925\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119939925<\/a><br>Just like in Iraq and Libya right?","filename":"1491565375401","ext":".jpg","w":591,"h":572,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1491568918130,"time":1491568918,"md5":"GesqH2NJ6t0JGso8iHf+Wg==","fsize":107342,"resto":119939155,"id":"Vwu60BEO","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":119940564,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:42:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119940321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119940321<\/a><br>Das rite and before you bomb a soverign country, remember to apologize for the 600 megagazilijon you fucking goyim","time":1491568950,"resto":119939155,"id":"Z5o3IoTJ","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119940740,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:43:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119939155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119939155<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw we shilled night and day for 1 year and a half for this<\/span>","time":1491569038,"resto":119939155,"id":"7sPWllA3","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119940786,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:44:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Y&#039;all niggers can not into 5D chess.","time":1491569061,"resto":119939155,"id":"Huc4vcFF","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119941639,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:51:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119940387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119940387<\/a><br>Bombed the airbase that held the planes\/other shit that carried out the chem wep attack.","time":1491569490,"resto":119939155,"id":"1Gk\/DlI6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119941227,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:48:00","name":"Anonymous","sub":"END TIMES PARTY THREAD","com":"Calm down \/pol\/, if Hillary won it would have been the same, maybe worse.

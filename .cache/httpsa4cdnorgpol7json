These days, we refuse to let them pay and so burden society with their care.<br><br>Under Obamacare, we get the money to cover them by upcharging the young and healthy. This covers the cost, but it fucks over young people economically. They are already getting fucked by student loans, housing prices, immigrant and outsourcing destroying opportunity, etc. At a certain point, you can only pile so much on the young before they just fail to launch, you get no money, and your society collapses.<br><br>A society that chooses to let those fucked by nature continue to be fucked will still function. A society that fucks it&#039;s young to make those fucked by nature a little more comfortable will collapse and die.<br><br>The other variable is the overall cost. Conceivably, if the costs were low enough we could bear it. But that means we need incentives and market forces to drive prices down. But Obamacare drives them up, because there no no competition or accountability, and everything is someone else&#039;s money. So it&#039;s a perfect storm of fucking the youth, and not even fucking them efficiently. We&#039;re screwed. If we can get rid of Obamacare, then a lot of people will suffer. But it won&#039;t also fuck over society&#039;s future.","filename":"1491372293806","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":278,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1491467861086,"time":1491467861,"md5":"fzJkZRUTJbwEzpVt4iY72A==","fsize":476373,"resto":119717356,"id":"5fnj1aEc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119723172,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:58:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119717356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119717356<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;an anime picture<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Leaf <\/span><br>Opinion discarded.

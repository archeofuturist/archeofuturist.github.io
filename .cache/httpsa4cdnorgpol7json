It turned out that while 3R was found in 56% of Maori males, it occurred in 58% of African American males and 34% of European males [2]. Misinterpreted by the media, the 3R variant quickly became a lead character in a pop science narrative intended to explain why certain racial groups appear to have increased tendencies toward violence. When a disproportionately high number of males of an ethnic group carries a less common gene linked with aggressive behaviors, the discussion about that gene immediately takes on racial overtones [3, 14].

Trump won by less than 1% in some very key states for him, as in as little as a 10,000\u201350,000 voter lead each. The rust belt flip was the one thing that snagged him the victory. If Hillary eked it out, the Democrats could&#039;ve patched that little leak and made it game over forever with Republican strongholds continuing to become bluer. Trump is probably the most significant presidency in your lifetime, and couldn&#039;t have been more timely. In a game of hot potato, we tossed it at the very last possible second and the benefits couldn&#039;t be bigger. With the H-1B executive order tonight, there&#039;s no doubt Trump is the real deal. We&#039;re only a few months in and he&#039;s hitting the ground running. Worst case scenario, it&#039;s going to take Democrats decades to undo the damage he&#039;s doing to their agenda and our fight continues. At best, Democrats pushed their luck for too long and our culture is going to continue to galvanize the white voting bloc into putting an end to this once and for all.","time":1492574434,"resto":121794554,"id":"PS\/kpTsC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121798280,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:03:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121794554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121794554<\/a><br>Fuck you, winning is better.","time":1492574591,"resto":121794554,"id":"m0YvIYmR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121798696,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:06:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121794554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121794554<\/a><br>No. <br><br>Because then we would suffer the illusion of &quot;if Trump won everything would&#039;ve been great&quot;.<br><br>Now we know he&#039;s a Kike too and in the US nothing will change by democracy.","time":1492574802,"resto":121794554,"id":"nM1o1ys+","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121799630,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:14:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121794554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121794554<\/a><br><br>Of course not, in addition to what&#039;s already been a Hillary win would have meant a minimum of two democratic appointments to the Supreme Court.

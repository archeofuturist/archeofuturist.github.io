What caused this sudden surge in popularity, you might wonder?<br>Melenchon is not some unknown quantity in France. He&#039;s been around the block, and has sat on the fringes of mainstream politics for years. He is similar to Farage in some ways (not politically, of course), in that he commands support from a significant minority, but hasn&#039;t been able to command enough support to cement a place in the French political mainstream.<br>Now, all of a sudden, he is garnering support from no less than the writers at Lib\u00e9ration. What does this mean?<br>Lib\u00e9ration is to France what the Guardian is to the UK. It&#039;s the favored newsrag of the (((center-left))) i.e. neoliberalism dressed up as (((social democracy))). Like the Guardian, it&#039;s a mouthpiece for the intelligence community, most notably the CIA. One would imagine that it would expend all of its energies on promoting Macron, the darling of the neoliberal globalist elite...<br>But Macron is no more than a Manchurian candidate, posing as an anti-establishment centrist owing no loyalty to anyone, while serving the interests of the French Socialist party and Hollande. <br>Macron promises to galvanise French commitments to the EU and to the principles of globalization in general. In the past, we would have assumed he could count on support from the CIA.<br>And yet, the CIA appears to be sabotaging Macron and lending support to a far-left Marxist: What gives? Why does the CIA want Melenchon to win?<br>It doesn&#039;t. We can take this as a big hint that the CIA\/AMERICA WANTS LE PEN TO WIN.<br>How so? Well, because Melenchon stands no chance of defeating Le Pen in the second round, whereas both Macron and Fillon stand a very good chance.<br>THE USA INTENDS TO BRING THE EU DOWN!","filename":"LIBERATION","ext":".jpg","w":240,"h":200,"tn_w":240,"tn_h":200,"tim":1492358004758,"time":1492358004,"md5":"Jjd9jpJk+3JNN4JwdtcN\/g==","fsize":8488,"resto":0,"id":"T60nmMNL","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"america-goes-to-cyberwar-with-eu","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121371607,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)11:44:54","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Trump&#039;s Tweet Shills","com":"Something needs to be done to deal with the &quot;verified&quot; people who always spam Trump tweets with like 5 replies.

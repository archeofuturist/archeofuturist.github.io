It is a losing paradigm, and the evidence is all around us. Capitalism could have worked relatively long term if humans were careful about how we controlled our population, we haven&#039;t, so currently our species is in a massive population overshoot.

Most living in America and western European nations are too ignorant and comfortable to see the big picture. Our ridiculous cozy lifestyles have a very real cost, it is a fact that not one corporation or company in the world would be profitable if it had to take into account the &#039;natural&#039; cost of extracting resources and then restoring the ecosystems which they destroyed to get those resources. In the business world it just written off as &#039;externalities&#039;, which is just a good way of saying that it is someone else&#039;s problem.

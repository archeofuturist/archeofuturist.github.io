You need to take a long hard look in the mirror and ask yourself if you&#039;re assimilating fascist beliefs (it&#039;s insidious and we must all be guarded against this severe threat) As for the rest of your post (I&#039;m being charitable and assuming that you made a minor lapse and are still a genuine comrade). These people deserve no tolerance. They are, at heart, intolerant and therefore, if not totally fascist already, so close to fascist that it does not warrant distinction. We should NEVER fear the loss of support because, ultimately, we are on the right side of history. If you deviate and moderate yourself towards making the proles happy you are just giving in to fascists and are therefore essentially in league with them.

Become incredulous and indignant. Avoid discussing key issues and instead focus on side issues which can be used show the topic as being critical of some otherwise sacrosanct group or theme. This is also known as the &#039;How dare you!&#039; gambit.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4. Use a straw man. Find or create a seeming element of your opponent&#039;s argument which you can easily knock down to make yourself look good and the opponent to look bad. Either make up an issue you may safely imply exists based on your interpretation of the opponent\/opponent arguments\/situation, or select the weakest aspect of the weakest charges. Amplify their significance and destroy them in a way which appears to debunk all the charges, real and fabricated alike, while actually avoiding discussion of the real issues.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5. Sidetrack opponents with name calling and ridicule. This is also known as the primary &#039;attack the messenger&#039; ploy, though other methods qualify as variants of that approach. Associate opponents with unpopular titles such as &#039;kooks&#039;, &#039;right-wing&#039;, &#039;liberal&#039;, &#039;left-wing&#039;, &#039;terrorists&#039;, &#039;conspiracy buffs&#039;, &#039;radicals&#039;, &#039;militia&#039;, &#039;racists&#039;, &#039;religious fanatics&#039;, &#039;sexual deviates&#039;, and so forth. This makes others shrink from support out of fear of gaining the same label, and you avoid dealing with issues.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;7. Question motives. Twist or amplify any fact which could be taken to imply that the opponent operates out of a hidden personal agenda or other bias. This avoids discussing issues and forces the accuser on the defensive.<\/span><br><br>Why are you using well known disinformation tactics?","time":1492918829,"resto":122373253,"id":"oPJ54qh8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122374230,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:41:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122373681\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122373681<\/a><br>I was here before &quot;you can&#039;t film flam the zim zam&quot; so please do tell me I&#039;m pretending to be everyday user.<br>I had to leave during your guys faggoty cuckstrom around Trump though, because I understood who the real Aryan candidate was.","filename":"that rack","ext":".jpg","w":338,"h":217,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1492918900868,"time":1492918900,"md5":"GPDVF2HltwJJNyq+ezTjpQ==","fsize":16934,"resto":122373253,"id":"QGySHftg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122374544,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:44:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122373431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122373431<\/a><br>Its funny the tons of Trump cucks went around being like Hillary is the racist look what she said, look she said a Klan recruiter was a mentor and friend, look Hillary hates poor black people etc..

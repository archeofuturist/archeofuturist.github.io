Men can impregnate each day multiple, if not a dozen of females, while females can only bare a child around every year with the loss of a lot of energy and with a lot of pain. This leads to males wanting to impregnate every female they can to ensure the survival of their genes, and the best way in their case is to take whatever you can and even if some are genetically inferior due to the female chosen, another surely will bare a healthy child. Females however need to choose whisely their partner to ensure good genes as they are heavily limited regarding the numbers of possible offsprings.<br><br>When now some other people come and threaten our lifestyle or rival us in any way we logically want to get rid of them one way or the other or make them more like you without you becomming more like them. This can be done through impregnating their females. By doing so we block their males from procreating while creating childs that are more like us, but since we are only letting our females with our males we dont become more like them as we still create ethnitically pure children.<br><br>So when men have a fetish, wanting to fuck ponies (attention ponyfags, i know some still lurk here) or underage 2D waifus (attention polacks) or a succubus\/demon (in case some \/x\/file wanders through this board) we just express that subconcious desire to outbreed those in an attempt to keep our genetics and heritage pure, and ensure our peoples survival.","filename":"Pride","ext":".jpg","w":626,"h":467,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":186,"tim":1491183882979,"time":1491183882,"md5":"KgSwXi2xntzHJUM+DonCPg==","fsize":67446,"resto":0,"id":"vqlxBB\/k","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-wanting-to-fuck-ponies-or-2d-waifus-is","country_name":"Germany","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":119276046,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:53:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"Selfbump","time":1491184409,"resto":119275175,"id":"nIDQcOOL","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119276041,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:53:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"So what do you guys think of paulette leaphart and her bullshit cancer story to get attention?

I remember being in India when Coke was introduced due to opening up of the market. What does this mean? It means that India is actually very young in its transformation. With only 27 years of capitalism, the majority of the country still remains in dire straights, but this will change as the whole world gets better. This is why you are seeing so many tech firms starting to move their service sector into India. I know it may seem bad right now, but it is actually transforming very fast, relative to where it was in 1990. I don&#039;t wanna do the whole &quot;Super Power by 2030&quot; meme, but by that time India will be even more developed than it is now. The 21st century is going to see great strides in both India&#039;s and Africa&#039;s poorest populations.

Though everything the world says India is true, I am not sure about China. China is weird because, unlike India, the PolitBureau can literally move its population and command massive power and do things that India, as a democracy, cannot. China literally makes cities where none should exist. This means that for things like fixing a bunch of problems that plague the population, the Chinese model is great. However, I believe the Chinese model does not make its people inventive or willing to take risks like the Indian companies and people do. India follows a more Western model in letting its citizens duke it out with each other and foreign competitors. In fact, I remember reading about an Indian firm competing for an oil contract with a Chinese firm, which was backed by the Chinese government. China is great for the short term and I think its great it has lifted more pf its citizens out of poverty, but that is due to central control, which India does not have. It&#039;s not really an accurate comparison. The systems are too different. <br><br><br>That said, the Indian diaspora happens to be one of the best immigrates as it relates to productivity and success. I believe this is largely due to British imperialism, because having the ability to visit these countries and speak English gives Indians a huge edge, and the above mentioned reasons of having a pool of 1.1 billion free citizens means that you will have so many smart people that are able to immigrate to the Commonwealth countries and succeed.","filename":"AmericanIndians","ext":".png","w":1352,"h":676,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1490505513149,"time":1490505513,"md5":"M55qKZ\/MBxsanFDJeiXP1A==","fsize":88774,"resto":118315541,"id":"WfLaLVAU","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118325118,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:33:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"All

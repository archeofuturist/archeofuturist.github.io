This general is for the discussion of Marxism-Leninism, the ideology of revolutionary socialism and communism.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492719905802,"time":1492719905,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"82\/jiUvz","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":123,"images":78,"omitted_posts":118,"omitted_images":74,"tail_size":50},{"no":122058842,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:57:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122058385\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122058385<\/a><br>dis","time":1492729073,"resto":122038361,"id":"soCWlckG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122060156,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)19:08:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122058385\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122058385<\/a><br>bretty gud :DDD","filename":"1492129199604","ext":".png","w":599,"h":383,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":79,"tim":1492729700427,"time":1492729700,"md5":"XauL894Baya4ZH8IIZsmIg==","fsize":118045,"resto":122038361,"id":"aqoutgcz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122060656,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)19:12:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"The bourgeoisie are the class which owns the means of production but does not use them<br>you can think of the means of production as anything &#039;used&#039; to generate profit e.g. a factory, a shop, a car, machinery, etc<br>if you own means of production but are self-employed, and do not employ anyone else, then you are not bourgeois<br>if you do not literally own means of production but in effect control it, you are bourgeois (e.g. CEOs who do not literally own their companies, but as they run the company they &#039;own&#039; it in the sense that they decide what is done with it, they decide their own wages, etc)<br>a good litmus test:<br>&#039;&#039;1. do you work for a wage?<br>2. do you get to decide your wage?<br>3. do you get to decide anyone else&#039;s wage?&#039;&#039;<br>if yes to 1 but not to 2 or 3, you are not bourgeois<br>if yes to 1 and 2 but not to 3, you are petit-bourgeois<br>if yes to all three, you are in effect bourgeois<br>if you do not work for a wage at all, but rather own the means of production directly, then you are absolutely bourgeois<br><br>If you own a small shop that you run for a living making 50k USD a year you are petite bourgois.

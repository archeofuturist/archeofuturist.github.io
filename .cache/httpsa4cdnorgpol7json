I am considering entering right-wing politics in Estonia soon, and the nationalist party here (3rd in popular support currently) actually wants to adress this problem, also the dependancy of EU.

EU does not persecute our right-wing powers here half as much as Germany does for it&#039;s own nationalists, where 5000 leftists gather outside to autistically screech just because of a single public AfD conference.

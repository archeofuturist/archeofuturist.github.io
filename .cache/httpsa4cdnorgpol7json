The soul is the storehouse of ALL ENERGY, ALL POWER AND ALL STRENGTH. The soul is PURE CONSCIOUSNESS. The soul possesses ALL siddhis and there are an INFINITE number of siddhis. Among all of these siddhis, there are considered to be eight major siddhis. Siddhis can be awakened through a variety of methods. In Patanjali&#039;s Yoga Sutras IV.1, it is stated:<br><br>&quot;Siddhis may be attained through birth, the use of herbs, incantations, self-discipline or samadhi.&quot;<br><br>Here is a list of the eight major siddhis (in no particular order):<br><br>Laghima siddhi: Making your body and\/or anything else as light as you want.<br><br>Garima siddhi: Making your body and\/or anything else as heavy as you want.<br><br>Mahima siddhi: Making your body and\/or anything else as large as you want.<br><br>Anima siddhi: Making your body and\/or anything else as small as you want.<br><br>Prapti siddhi: Having unrestricted access to any and\/or all places.<br><br>Prakamya siddhi: Fulfillment of whatever you desire.<br><br>Isitva siddhi: Control over any and\/or all of the laws of nature.<br><br>Vasitva siddhi: Being able to control any and\/or all beings.<br><br>&quot;A man is a god in ruins. When men are innocent, life shall be longer, and shall pass into the immortal, as gently as we awake from dreams.&quot; - Ralph Waldo Emerson","filename":"yogi","ext":".jpg","w":624,"h":850,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492528063026,"time":1492528063,"md5":"\/Ap+ej9b\/ZGb2IUpbxV\/7w==","fsize":75486,"resto":121693310,"id":"SoXa08vl","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121693981,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)11:07:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121693310\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121693310<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121693386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121693386<\/a><br>yes","filename":"d8d97a34-4292-42b9-b9b7-8087ca456779","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492528072365,"time":1492528072,"md5":"o93R9rIkfj69qbEtV\/fA3Q==","fsize":204882,"resto":121693310,"id":"gwMRkJdc","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121686669,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:50:55","name":"Anonymous","sub":"The World is a Stage","com":"Fat SJW flips out in public, turns out she&#039;s in porn.<br><br>Antifa girl get punched out, turns out she&#039;s in porn.<br><br>I&#039;m honestly starting to think, all these riots and protests and shit, are literally all actors on both sides, trying to rile people up.<br><br>Whatever, just keep it to your college and university campuses.<br><br>Have fun LARPing the Civil War 2017","filename":"FagWar2017","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":433,"tn_w":173,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492523455222,"time":1492523455,"md5":"6H1XlVDkiR+UyGWe\/11WXQ==","fsize":33627,"resto":0,"id":"ZHaYq+t6","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-world-is-a-stage","country_name":"Canada","replies":6,"images":0,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":121691031,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:36:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121686669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121686669<\/a><br>proof of them being in porn?","time":1492526216,"resto":121686669,"id":"\/viw2u2S","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121691495,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:42:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121689637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121689637<\/a><br>Hahaha you and your friend sound intensely uneducated.

You can&#039;t just say &quot;It&#039;s all a stage&quot; since that&#039;s basically giving these satanists power to run the entire world.

I also know the alt-right anti-war\/ethnic nationalism\/taking back power from globalists will make this a better world, and fighting for it provides lots of opportunities to work off bad karma\/weaknesses holding you back. Compassion for others needs to be tempered with wisdom and strong borders-this is an essential lesson of this world.

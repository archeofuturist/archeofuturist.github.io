It&#039;s On The Ground News, seems to be a propaganda front for certain jihadist rebels, some of the stuff explains the war better and more honestly than any media explanation you&#039;ve seen. <br><br>First notice the comments, you&#039;ll see sunni and shia muslims fighting each other. On Feb 15th, a 15 minute interview, proving what the war really is. A rebel who is sunni, how assad and his father considered many things extreme, jailed and persecuted them and how they want to make the country a sharia islamic rule and are calling it a jihad, NOT a rebellion. <br><br>On March 23, you&#039;ll see one in a car under sniper fire in HAMA, the day it was reported jihadists was attacking hama. <br><br>They also interview Dr Shajul Islam, one of the main sources of the &#039;chemical attack&#039; on videos and information. His profile is at facebook \/DoctorShajulIslam\/ - he was wanted for being involved in isis kidnapping of british journalists but released since they were captive\/killed and couldn&#039;t testify against him. He is always on the forefront of fighting, you&#039;ll see videos of him in hospitals or caves. A week before the so called chemical attack, he was asking for gas masks, etc. (proof of premeditation?), and jihadists(al queda) are known to use civilains as shields. So are they bringing and surrounding themselves w\/ children so as they fight and are attacked, they film those things as propaganda? Also notice all the different sources he is having for funding and money.

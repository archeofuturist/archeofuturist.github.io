It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490818763024,"time":1490818763,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"PdNpZawK","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":7,"images":0,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":0},{"no":118829523,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)16:25:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118828802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118828802<\/a><br>What about the trend of people not giving a fuck anymore?","time":1490819128,"resto":118828802,"id":"nunKSK1i","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":118830065,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)16:29:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118829523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118829523<\/a><br>Kosovo stop.","time":1490819382,"resto":118828802,"id":"0mp3Q7D4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118832634,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)16:50:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118830065\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118830065<\/a><br>Shiptars are muslim, theyre last one to say this kind of thing.","time":1490820631,"resto":118828802,"id":"nunKSK1i","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":118832929,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)16:53:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118828802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118828802<\/a><br>Good.

Senator Eric Brakey, along with a bipartisan group of cosponsors, introduced Senate Bill 888 March 7, which would require a criminal conviction before any property is seized, as well as close a loophole that allows local law enforcement to skirt state law by working with the federal government.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cBarring state and local law enforcement agencies from passing off cases to the feds is particularly important,\u201d writes Mark Maharrey for the Tenth Amendment Center. \u201cIn several states with strict asset forfeiture laws, prosecutors have done just that.

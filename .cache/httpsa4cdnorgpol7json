Why suddenly the saber rattling and the threats? Why the talks about military options? Why is China suddenly so keen on showing them who&#039;s boss? So I started to dig around and found this press release from 3 years ago of a company called SRE Minerals. They claim that during explorations in North Korea they found the biggest deposit of rare earth metals on the planet. The deposit is twice as big as all other known deposits combined. Some other articles (can&#039;t be archived properly) picked it up too: <br>http:\/\/www. miningweekly.com\/article\/largest-kn<wbr>own-rare-earth-mineral-deposit-disc<wbr>overed-2013-12-04<br>http:\/\/www. mining.com\/largest-known-rare-earth<wbr>-deposit-discovered-in-north-korea-<wbr>86139\/<br>https:\/\/archive.is\/epRFU<br>Looking at the chart of rare earth prices one can see they have increased dramatically over the past 15 years. Prices went only down in 2014 after China eased on it&#039;s export restrictions. China controls about 90% of rare earth elements production. It&#039;s save to say that the demand of rare earth elements will increase in the future as they are needed for batteries and electronics. Taking future demand, current prices and the size of the deposit into consideration we could look at a value of about $100 trillion dollars over the next 50-80 years. This could transform North Korea into a petrostate-type country.","filename":"North Korea","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493566989717,"time":1493566989,"md5":"gg2+Nj4+7hogspAY7Own6g==","fsize":15077,"resto":0,"id":"SC8xDRyH","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"north-korea","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":20,"images":8,"omitted_posts":15,"omitted_images":4},{"no":123494515,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:30:18","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1493542189699","ext":".png","w":500,"h":623,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493569818649,"time":1493569818,"md5":"GErYAuraDlk9lj6nilfQlg==","fsize":64620,"resto":123489631,"id":"uXLe5z2r","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123494827,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:33:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"So what youre saying is there is an investment opportunity in SRE Minterals Ltd.","time":1493569997,"resto":123489631,"id":"lOIINK9X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123494976,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:34:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Good thread<br>bump","time":1493570082,"resto":123489631,"id":"HqHzb21A","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123495156,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:36:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123489631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123489631<\/a><br>it&#039;s not sudden. go the fuck away","time":1493570178,"resto":123489631,"id":"GYYUf3tC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123495231,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:36:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123489631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123489631<\/a><br>lol okay, that&#039;s why, not because they threaten to nuke us weekly.","time":1493570217,"resto":123489631,"id":"xa8pSpyb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123492518,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:10:56","name":"Anonymous","sub":"THE_DONALD HATE THREAD","filename":"1493495956987","ext":".png","w":838,"h":798,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":238,"tim":1493568656093,"time":1493568656,"md5":"k0ecVZ0qpVcwuOlVeDtnYA==","fsize":231369,"resto":0,"id":"UqSBy9eB","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"thedonald-hate-thread","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":10,"images":7,"omitted_posts":5,"omitted_images":5},{"no":123493355,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:18:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"free speech on the_donald","filename":"banned-from-r-The_Donald-for-questioning-Syrian-war","ext":".png","w":854,"h":803,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1493569130125,"time":1493569130,"md5":"NXpCLbU5izPJ7+Kc9Ya\/dw==","fsize":57874,"resto":123492518,"id":"UqSBy9eB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123494094,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:25:56","name":"Anonymous","filename":"the_donald","ext":".png","w":1330,"h":946,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1493569556777,"time":1493569556,"md5":"aq\/abJZ5iLzGX\/g7NZbkCw==","fsize":464004,"resto":123492518,"id":"UqSBy9eB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123494392,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:29:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Stop shilling for Assad Shareblue!!!","filename":"1493252420116","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1493569747997,"time":1493569747,"md5":"buXf7Gb7Z4c+mxiTp2yADA==","fsize":33722,"resto":123492518,"id":"db4fYDUU","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":123494653,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:31:40","name":"Anonymous","filename":"9992310","ext":".png","w":936,"h":883,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1493569900418,"time":1493569900,"md5":"t3C+lnVDXsYGuyH6B5nFUA==","fsize":611446,"resto":123492518,"id":"UqSBy9eB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123495197,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:36:40","name":"Anonymous","filename":"2017_03_31_20.52.45-1","ext":".png","w":399,"h":993,"tn_w":50,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493570200305,"time":1493570200,"md5":"4p9wAOW7bMq+ZF0J7v5Zqw==","fsize":261669,"resto":123492518,"id":"pL5+MuWL","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123493864,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:23:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"Who are the best and worst Hispanics?<br><br>Based on experience, I would say best are Cubans or Argentinians and worst are Dominicans.

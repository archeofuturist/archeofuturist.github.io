The Fear of a Black Planet can then be extricated from lackadaisical concerns of &quot;white fragility,&quot; and imbued in realistic concerns about the ability for humans to sustain and advance civilization.

Funny shit.<br><br><br>Made me think that because asian women can actually be kinda attractive, immigration from asian countries isn&#039;t being promoted by women. White women know that with arabs and blacks, the females are more ugly than men, and there isn&#039;t even a slight chance a white guy might be interested in arab or balck girl over white women, while arab and black men can still be attractive enough so a white woman might considerer them over a white guy. So that&#039;s why white women promote immigration from middle east and africa, but from asia. Because they know there is no chance african or middle eastern girls will be more attractive than them, while the guys might still be attractive. Which is the exact opposite with asians.

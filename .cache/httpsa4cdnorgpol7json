Many of the ancient paternal family lines that had been in the country for 1200 years ago died out because of this when Icelandic women chose to have mongrel children instead of Icelandic ones.","time":1491640306,"resto":120103565,"id":"Qppq9gfk","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120106727,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)04:08:13","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Eta begins disarmament process","com":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-eur<wbr>ope-39536136<br><br>Surely this can only be good news.

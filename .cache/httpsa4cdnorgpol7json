The most interesting by far was that of Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who seized control of the city in 82 BC after decades of instability.<br><br>What&#039;s interesting about this event is that he chose not to remain in power for long. By that time it was obvious to nearly everyone that the republlic was broken: loopholes in the system that had been ignored by tradition for centuries (many involving the tribunes of the plebs,) were being blatantly exploited. Society had changed over time so that the people the laws had been based around (citizen farmers) barely existed, and those laws had been changed into functional, but less stable forms, in which some individuals held enough power to threaten the state itself. When Sulla assumed control, he made it his aim to repair these problems: to fix the republic. When he felt he had done all he could, he returned his power to the system, and became a private citizen.<br><br>It didn&#039;t last. Almost 40 years later, Julius Caesar was able to do the same thing. But unlike Sulla, he held no intentions of fixing the republic: he eventually went so far as to say that Sulla&#039;s only mistake had been giving up power.<br><br>I used to abhor this statement. How could anyone harbor disdain for a man who put his country before himself? One should always be dedicated to preserving the freedom of their citizens, and Sulla worked for just that.<br><br>But like all of you, I&#039;ve been observing American politics and history for some time. I don&#039;t think we&#039;re to a breaking point yet, or will be for some time, but I can clearly see the same processes that wore down that republic at work here.

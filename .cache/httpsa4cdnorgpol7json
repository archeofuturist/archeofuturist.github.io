And if this lifestyle is to be combined with anything other than total poverty and seclusion it must necessarily imply to be joining the herd of sinners, sins you know from gnosis are sins.<br><br>But to push those sins onto others without committing them yourself is another story. And this might be where the main difference lies between Muslims and Jews, the Jews are those who have actual gnosis or enlightenment about the sins and their consequences, while Muslims don&#039;t and only believe it because they&#039;re told so. The Christians don&#039;t believe all of those sins are sins but have not suffered.<br><br>But the behavior of the Christians will lead to an evermore oppressive society which eventually will bring suffering onto themselves.

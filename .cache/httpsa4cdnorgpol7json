In 2017, since Jan 27th, in a single month of the Trump presidency there were 1627 arrests for human trafficking.<br><br>This means if the same ratio of arrests vs cleared is applied, there were 323 convictions in the whole of 2014 under Obama versus 1186 people in one month under Trump. As of April 5th, there were more than 3,500 arrests across the USA. If anyone doubts Trump is not going after human trafficking networks by now, get jej&#039;d, faggot.","filename":"1500 in one month","ext":".jpg","w":1335,"h":1245,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":233,"tim":1491449103678,"time":1491449103,"md5":"X\/IcgvH2hBUAQ6cSPzOMgg==","fsize":494720,"resto":0,"id":"B3do7zfh","country":"IM","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"largest-child-trafficking-bust-in-us-history","country_name":"Isle of Man","replies":102,"images":23,"omitted_posts":97,"omitted_images":23,"tail_size":50},{"no":119710193,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:29:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119703406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119703406<\/a><br>And fired one bullet into their computer<br>Totally legit right not suspect at alllll","time":1491456599,"resto":119697925,"id":"RYsHdsKU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119710427,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:32:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119706837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119706837<\/a><br>And also kids","time":1491456768,"resto":119697925,"id":"RYsHdsKU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119710500,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:33:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119701179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119701179<\/a><br>Sqigly sword for sacrificing just like in (((tod the fraud)))&#039;s new oblivion with guns game<br><br><br>This rabbit hole is deep","filename":"1482558207293","ext":".png","w":944,"h":1152,"tn_w":102,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491456816945,"time":1491456816,"md5":"VbZQSEX\/PtCXQh\/Z2rh8pw==","fsize":1718718,"resto":119697925,"id":"t02Mpwfw","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119710520,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:33:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119710193\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119710193<\/a><br>This.","filename":"1489850145292","ext":".jpg","w":744,"h":422,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491456831182,"time":1491456831,"md5":"WvdEkSCXIkXsiTWPW1b4wQ==","fsize":30510,"resto":119697925,"id":"B3do7zfh","country":"IM","country_name":"Isle of Man"},{"no":119710561,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:34:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119705898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119705898<\/a><br>The fact is that the leverage these rituals give over people do grant the power.

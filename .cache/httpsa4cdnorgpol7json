They just file a report with their central headquarters because there is no other evidence, no other victims. JW take the &quot;Two Witness Rule&quot; of the Bible seriously because false accusations do and have happened. If another victim comes up or evidence comes up then the elders release to the police now that there is evidence or other victims\/witnesses now. All throughout this process the perpetrator IS NOT TRANSFERRED. The victims are free to call the cops themselves. They are kicked out of our organization completely. End of problem.

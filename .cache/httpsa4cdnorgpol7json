In other words it will never happen.<br><br>It&#039;s accepted in the sniper community that shooting out past 1000 yards with this gun is pretty much luck. We were tought in school that the true max effective range of the m110 (us military version of the ar10, literally the same thing) is 800 meters. Shooting out to 1000 is very possible if the conditions are good but out past it&#039;s all about luck.<br><br>its still a highly effective rifle but OP isn&#039;t gonna be popping headshots at 1600 yards. Most engagements in an urban environment are gonna be within 500 anyway. Most likely a lot closer.

I had gone to a Christian elementary school and middle school and yet he never manifested himself to me, even when I was on the side of my bed crying for hours, praying for him to speak to me. Why didn&#039;t he show himself to me then? Did he want me to not believe in him? Why? I had been a dutiful Christian for 14 years, I prayed every morning and every night, at every breakfast and every dinner, and any time I had done something wrong. Am I just not important to save from hell? Why did he create me just for me to suffer? Why did he create humans just to see them suffer?","filename":"Lets-Talk-About-God-001","ext":".jpg","w":1546,"h":1117,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":180,"tim":1492944397648,"time":1492944397,"md5":"1b+6HmfH4l\/SdS3E2baM4Q==","fsize":643009,"resto":0,"id":"eaiAUNnq","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"god-is-a-real-meanie","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":122409545,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)06:49:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"dont sweat it follower of abrahamic religion<br><br><br>thats not how it works","time":1492944556,"resto":122409341,"id":"gpn1o1N5","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":122409749,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)06:51:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;why does God want me to burn in hell for all eternity with no chance of redemption<\/span><br>nobody knows what god wants<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why did he make so 95% of everyone<\/span><br>he gives people a choice because he wants free thinking men rather than obedient slaves who fear the masters lash<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all second chance<\/span><br>your second chance is accepting JC<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he show himself to me then?<\/span><br>because you wanted him to show himself to avoid facing your own doubt, he wants responsible people not cowards.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;believe in him? <\/span><br>nobody knows what god wants<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not important to save from hell?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;create me<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;create humans<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;to suffer<\/span><br>because it&#039;s a good learning experience. he originally created humans not to suffer, but they betrayed his trust and chose this life rather than the eternal one he originally provided. being a just god he allowed this transgression to occur, showing he values freedom of choice, consequence of action and responsibility above all other things, including believing in him.","time":1492944709,"resto":122409341,"id":"+AIS5fTS","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122409879,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)06:53:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122409502\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122409502<\/a><br>He lays it out his plan in his great book.

His dad interfered with witnesses, his sister and brother-in-law, by hiring a hooker to seduce his brother-in-law, taking him to a motel, filming them fucking, then sent that video to his sister the day of a family reunion.

If there&#039;s a line in the sand for me as a Trump supporter, it&#039;s the removal of Bannon at the impetus of Kushner. If that happens, my only hope is they finish the job started in 2008 and run this country into economic collapse. Then we might actually be able to purge the influences that are destroying this country and actually have some kind of meaningful change.","time":1491629564,"resto":120047057,"id":"IzrwL3CU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120093119,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:33:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120064226\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120064226<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=U2G<wbr>9MR1n7Es<br>\/Trump 2016\/ became (((Trump 2017)))?","time":1491629620,"resto":120047057,"id":"N1QnTO1N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120093417,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:36:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120067063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120067063<\/a><br>That looks like a trap.","time":1491629792,"resto":120047057,"id":"N1QnTO1N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120093579,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:38:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120093417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120093417<\/a><br>His flag enforces that too","time":1491629882,"resto":120047057,"id":"HiZLV7Vb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120091861,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:22:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"JUST","filename":"IMG_6430","ext":".png","w":583,"h":600,"tn_w":242,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491628921393,"time":1491628921,"md5":"u67mpn5YL5vqOK30t3AWOA==","fsize":679737,"resto":0,"id":"NJNtq+Wf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"just","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":7,"omitted_posts":8,"omitted_images":5},{"no":120092853,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:31:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120092656\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120092656<\/a>","filename":"Ctr+still+trying+their+best+_782bd1da6d877866d15a4bc8de514d1e","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":281,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491629483637,"time":1491629483,"md5":"38Qqk5EK14Sp0sT+tbKwqg==","fsize":68444,"resto":120091861,"id":"lQlkUDFH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120092934,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:32:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"slav trump","time":1491629528,"resto":120091861,"id":"Ldkr6OIk","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120092985,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:32:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120092763\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120092763<\/a><br>Kinda.

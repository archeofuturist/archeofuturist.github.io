It\u2019s not a fucking puzzle, all the history is on the sites. There you crossed ur nerdy hobbies with ur nerdy resentment. Bunch of fucking nerds with your dipshit teenage beefs probably started with a resentment of woman who won\u2019t speak to you and now you think you have become POI radicalized.<br>So how did it happen? How did you become a fucking nazi? A bunch of real Nazis whispered poison in your ears while becoming your only community, your only \u201cfriends\u201d. And they used multiple levels to make irony and bigotry and fascism more acceptable by drowning it in \u201coh we\u2019re just joking\u201d So you combine all this with capitalizing on isolated nerd dude resentment and even deeper isolation, BAM nazi.<br>You can talk to any former \u201cchan\u201d boy and they can tell you how it went from \u201cshotty shock humor\u201d to \u201cwhite supremacist recruitment\u201d. The \u201clol only normies care about hurting others attitude\u201d + the general nerd male resentment of these communities. Its prime fertile ground for actual Nazis to grow. People talk about pol, but you need to see the various communities converge. R9K\u2019s \u201cwho wont woman fuck me\u201d bs \u201canything goes and anyone who gets mad is just a normie\u201d vs endless outbursts of anger at everything. Pol here becomes less of an isolated phenomenon and more of a natural end point for all these circles crashing into one another. And pol, also being its own thing, emans it is rolled back into those communities amplifying your worst aspect then roll it back into pol.<br>So essentially you have an online pressure cooker to turn your typical teenage nerdy bullshit into honest to god fascism. The surrounding of hateful idedas, the detachment from the harm you do? Turning them into \u201cjust jokes\u201d becoming your only friends and that just your community you can see it in many others but again your not a fucking mystery.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":550,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492019038016,"time":1492019038,"md5":"rJvbFojloq84ig4JSQeztw==","fsize":101734,"resto":0,"id":"rcUXTKKh","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-sick-of-you-fucking-nazis","country_name":"United States","replies":38,"images":16,"omitted_posts":33,"omitted_images":14},{"no":120788803,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:34:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120782618\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120782618<\/a><br>nice guess but im pretty sure 90% of people here were always right wingers who like hierarchy discipline personal responsibility and do not like liberalism<br><br>unless you actually think literal nazis still exist in which case KEK","time":1492022079,"resto":120782618,"id":"Ok4kV0NV","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":120789703,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:42:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120782618\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120782618<\/a><br>From a psychological point your attampt is very interesting.

An explanation is that the human sound is carried by the wind which means that our language makes\/is the connection between the nature and the humans.<br><br>After some research we found out that the only language the sounds from the nature are written and read the same as they are heard in the nature, prooves that here, on this land was born the first articulated language, the first fonetic language. If we are open minded, we can understand that the Verb means movement, dynamics, life and from each verb, a whole family of words was born.<br><br>Thus, the verb TO BE ( a fi), translated in 90 languages, makes us see that in romanian language only, the root of the word is kept. In the rest of the languages, word families are just word puzzles. For example:<br><br>a fi - fiu- fiica - fiinta<br>to be- son- daughter - being<br>sein - sohn-tochter - wesen<br><br>The same for the verb &quot;to ask&quot;- &quot; a cere&quot;<br>a cere- cerere- cerinta- cersetor- cercetare<br>ask- request- demand- beggar- research<br>Fragen- Anfrage- Nachfrage- Bettler- Forschung<br>Here is another special situation- the root is &quot;cer&quot; from &quot;a cere&quot;(to ask). <br><br>Cer is in romanian language also a noun, &quot;the sky&quot;. That makes us understand the connection between human mind and the infinite sky- anything we will think or want, we want\/ask from the sky. In hindi, the word &quot;cer&quot;(sky) is also translated as &quot;akasa&quot; ( like the romanian &quot;acasa&quot; which means &quot;at home&quot;). That can be explained. The people from our land, Tracia, gave the information to the hindi people that &quot;the sky is at home&quot; because we came from the sky and the hindis called their sky- &quot;akasa&quot;.

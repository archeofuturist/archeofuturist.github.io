It will go down in history as the start of World War 3,\u201d the Queen said with an evil smile, according to a Windsor Castle insider.<br><br>Queen Elizabeth has an official birthday party celebrated by the British nation in June \u2014 when the weather is better \u2014 featuring the \u201cTrooping the Color\u201d military parade. April 22, her real birthday, is also celebrated, but it\u2019s a more intimate occasion, featuring only family and invited guests.<br><br>\u201cThe Queen was speaking as though she knows the Illuminati\u2019s plans inside out,\u201d the Windsor Castle insider said, speaking on the strict condition of anonymity. \u201cTo make matters worse she seemed turned on by the thrill of a new world war.\u201c<br><br>By the end of 2017 the world will be unrecognizable if the Illuminati keep gaining strength. War in the Middle East has long been the cabal\u2019s preferred method of igniting World War 3, bringing Russia, China and the U.S. into direct confrontation, before ushering in the final phase of their masterplan for global dominance.<br><br>The Queen said: \u201cOne must prepare for the new dawn humanity will soon wake up to, which cannot come into being without a period of complete darkness, the blackest of nights, the likes of which we have never experienced.\u201d<br><br>It is understood the \u201cperiod of complete darkness\u201d refers to World War 3. The \u201cnew dawn\u201d that humanity will soon wake up was explained to be the New World Order.<br><br>The Queen warned her friends and family that celebrity deaths in 2016 would serve as a warning to other famous, powerful people \u2013 join the Illuminati and submit to the power of the cult\u2026 or die. Any celebrities allowed to remain in the limelight in 2017 would be entirely tame and controlled creatures. This is part of the Illuminati plan.<br><br>http:\/\/yournewswire.com\/queen-eliza<wbr>beth-world-war-3-2017\/","filename":"space-lizards-610x400","ext":".jpg","w":610,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":163,"tim":1493467633109,"time":1493467633,"md5":"TR7jRRHB0BnXG4v9t0x07w==","fsize":73683,"resto":0,"id":"4nEejRB+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"queen-elizabeth-world-war-3-must-start-in-2017","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":2,"omitted_posts":7,"omitted_images":1},{"no":123330956,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)09:02:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123327047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123327047<\/a><br><br>why did you just sit back and let all the foreign cunts here?","time":1493470958,"resto":123326815,"id":"ZvOZ70VH","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123331051,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)09:03:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123330480\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123330480<\/a><br>Quickly you must warn Mel Gibson.","time":1493471018,"resto":123326815,"id":"O4+GDMBu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123331112,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)09:04:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123331051\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123331051<\/a><br>max can handle himself.","time":1493471058,"resto":123326815,"id":"YZyXR3Tz","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123331216,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)09:05:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123326815\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123326815<\/a><br>UK confirmed for helping the US liberate the EU and NK<br>Or maybe she&#039;s just bashing the fash","time":1493471118,"resto":123326815,"id":"RZffz+fI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123331370,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)09:07:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;yournewswire<\/span>","time":1493471225,"resto":123326815,"id":"swOTimvh","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123325722,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)07:51:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Can we agree that our culture is completely destroyed beyond repair now?

South Korea will never okay a military strike, too many civilian lives are at risk. This means that the US would have to go against their own allies, which historically just doesn&#039;t really tend to happen. Anglos love offloading all the real work to other nations. Secondly, Russia and China dont have any incentives to agree on more sanctions. Russia will block any new UN sanctions due to the Syria strike, I think that angered Putin personally. China might make a deal if they get the islands for free in return, but how likely is that? And even if China does make a deal for more sanctions (non UN, just China sanctions) then it will still drag out for more decades. It&#039;s not like sanctions ever caused any regime change. And Kim will not attack first, he is not stupid enough for that. What motivation would he have to attack and who? Some meaningless carrier group and then watch himself get obliterated? He has *zero* motivation to start anything. He just wants to keep testing missiles. So for all these reasons, I see the North Korea crisis going absolutely nowhere and being another political loss for Trump.<br>The DPRK actually simply wants free money and food I think. That&#039;s the only explanation for the incredible increase in threats in the recent years. The increase is almost comical, so the rate of increase never made so much sense to me but I have too little information to make an informed call there. <br>Honestly, this situation looks like another classic anglo war. The US tried to goad the other party into attacking first so it can respond without moral or political side effects.<br>In this case I dont think Kim is stupid enough to fall for it but then again, neither should Hitler have been and he did it too.","filename":"war-capabilities","ext":".png","w":900,"h":7335,"tn_w":30,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493471121224,"time":1493471121,"md5":"QLsTNRVHSDE1EIHft8ucew==","fsize":1209257,"resto":0,"id":"f\/ldCajA","country":"AT","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"analysis-of-north-korean-crisis","country_name":"Austria","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":123326830,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)08:07:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"A study from the univesity of boston has LITERALLY proven that liberals are at least 34% smarter than the alt right.

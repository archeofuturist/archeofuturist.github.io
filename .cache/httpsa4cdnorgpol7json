You asked about what happens to nations that didn&#039;t run to the west and exist on russian border. I showed you how some of them are perfectly happy campers. If you think lukashenko is a puppet, you are insane, the man hates putin&#039;s guts and always pushes for more gibs, much like yanuk did in ukraine, unlike yanuk he has common decency and sense to not play with fire and extort both sides. <br><br>Kazachstan can be called a puppet sure, in the same sense that canada or mexico are puppets. <br><br>Stop with your bull, and deal with reality. <br><br>If you want russias puppets looks no further than osetia and tanistria, those are puppets. And even then you have Moldova being favourable towards RF because thay don&#039;t want to deal with tanistria themselves.","time":1490877992,"resto":118905179,"id":"Mt7yn\/VQ","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118914720,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)08:07:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;blame companies for the crisis<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nationalize everything<\/span>","filename":"1489147557801","ext":".jpg","w":454,"h":453,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490875650548,"time":1490875650,"md5":"6sat+q2Jfr2Ts3wQI6aveA==","fsize":86683,"resto":0,"id":"IL7MnlMp","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"blame-companies-for-the-crisis","country_name":"Spain","replies":2,"images":1},{"no":118914890,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)08:10:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118914720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118914720<\/a><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/3mLt55R67D0","time":1490875819,"resto":118914720,"id":"jaornu00","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118917311,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)08:46:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118914720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118914720<\/a><br>WHAD IS GOMMUNISM FOR GOMMIES?

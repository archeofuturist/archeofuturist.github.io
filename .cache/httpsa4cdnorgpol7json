If you understand that God allowed you to come into existence and if you know that he wants you to do good things within your existence then you should strive to do such at any point in your life. When you have no money, when you do have money, when you&#039;re homeless, when you have a mansion.

I believe that as fact but comment only with opinion. <br><br>Now relating to the first world bit, if you are in a position of wealth and or good capacity to give charity or some sort of good deeds then you should definitely do so at some point in your life. Good deeds are good deeds. You may or may not know the people you are kind towards but the actions are moral and there is a reason these interactions exist within our societies. Commit yourself to improving yourself and helping the people around your (family, friends, strangers) succeed in their life too. Your life has meaning because you are here on this planet.

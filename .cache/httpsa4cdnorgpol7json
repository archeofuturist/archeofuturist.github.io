Its the class that needs some help sometimes. And its not receiving any. 8 years of Obama did not help the semi-rural\/rural communities. It didn&#039;t help the working poor and it didn&#039;t help the underclass. All that happened was more immigrants were brought in that competed with the working class for jobs\/drove the wages down and the rest of America told them it was their fault. This doubled down on white communities, as whiteness is effectively primordial sin in today&#039;s society. Meanwhile, you have affirmative action helping minorities - but not just minorities who need it - but minorities across socio-economic classes. So you can&#039;t help but easily see the resentment build, as minorities like Jonathan Butler received praise, allocations of funding, and access to higher education when their rung on the socio-economic ladder already well supplied them with that, while many poor were simply looked over. God forbid the lack of help given to returning vets or the popular mindset of hating the law enforcement these days.<br><br>Imagine being a cop after the Dallas incident, or the various Mike Brown\/etc. protests.

Imagine having people that believe everything you say or that you are the messiah or something. Scientology is a good example of this where people literally cut off contact with their families and give up all of their material wealth to the church. Also there are just the batshit crazy ones like Heaven&#039;s Gate. Ultimately I would argue it&#039;s a method for sociopaths to control weak willed people. Also to the members they don&#039;t think of it as a cult, usually they think it&#039;s their religion or something. To elaborate even more in Scientology they make followers admit things they can later blackmail them with. George Bush had to yell out all his sexual experiences while inside a coffin as part of his initiation into the skull and bones, another thing they could use to blackmail.","time":1491008964,"resto":119079095,"id":"yUKbwGQT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119124857,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:09:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119124222\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119124222<\/a><br>Checked<br><br>Wonder how many corporations commission studies of this kind of thing so they can use the techniques on their employees","filename":"1478203337274","ext":".jpg","w":463,"h":278,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":75,"tim":1491008975981,"time":1491008975,"md5":"k7A\/9rVWd6ICvZDhbDzWBw==","fsize":41442,"resto":119079095,"id":"aoPoGmsK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119124442,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:05:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw Scotish conservative unionist<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw everyone assumes I&#039;m a lefty<\/span>","filename":"1476374344566","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":663,"tn_w":188,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491008707825,"time":1491008707,"md5":"foFHMme5\/iBxLNhJTjOnfg==","fsize":136510,"resto":0,"id":"QgC7Tnd0","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"tfw-scotish-conservative-unionist","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":3,"images":2},{"no":119124775,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:08:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw Scottish nationalist<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw everyone assumes I&#039;d happily bend over to suck EU cock<\/span>","filename":"article-0-19FDF6CA000005DC-319_470x585","ext":".jpg","w":470,"h":585,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491008927830,"time":1491008927,"md5":"yzoKBBUy\/MbDhyeaG4yzwQ==","fsize":69565,"resto":119124442,"id":"Y7XSR360","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119124838,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:09:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119124442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119124442<\/a><br>fuck off lefty","time":1491008964,"resto":119124442,"id":"DxTYcCAM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119124890,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:09:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119124775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119124775<\/a><br>you would you big faggot","filename":"Scottish_Redcoats","ext":".jpg","w":460,"h":290,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1491008992486,"time":1491008992,"md5":"OsmUuXHbsimDzoMyOP7gaw==","fsize":38057,"resto":119124442,"id":"QgC7Tnd0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119110833,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)18:50:52","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Ask a Liberal Anything","com":"Ask a liberal anything, and I will answer as politely as I can.<br><br>------<br><br>THREAD RULES:<br><br>1.

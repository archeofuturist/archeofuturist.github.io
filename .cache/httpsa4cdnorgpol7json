And I don&#039;t actually know any white girls that like black guys, or have been with black guys. It&#039;s a general consensus with all the girls I&#039;ve known that black guys are completely unattractive.<br><br>They have ugly, primate-like facial features, with those fat ugly noses and elongated skulls. Their skin tone is extremely unattractive, and their skin tends to be oily with a bad smell. Their hair is fucking disgusting, that ugly sheep hair, and the way their body hair pills up has legit almost made me puke before. They sound HORRIBLE. The way they talk is such a massive turnoff I can&#039;t even explain. That ghetto, lazy, retarded way of talking makes my pussy shut like a steel trap. The music they listen to is garbage and a turnoff, if I&#039;m ever with a guy and he starts playing some retarded mainstream rap I&#039;m just giving up on the guy altogether. Their personality and the way they act, dress and carry themselves just baffles me, I honestly don&#039;t understand why people accept it, they&#039;re literal savage barbarians with ugly skin and shitty clothes.<br><br>Listen, dumbfucks - we don&#039;t like black guys, stop pretending we&#039;re just going to them in droves. I don&#039;t know if you guys have a fetish for black men &quot;stealin&#039; yo wemens&quot; or if you&#039;re legitimately attracted to black guys and imagine yourselves as white girls, then project that degenerate fetish onto us real white girls, but you need to stop. I live in a pretty big city, and I RARELY see a black guy with a white girl, and the ONLY times I do see it is when the chick is either extremely trashy, extremely unattractive, or both. Fuck black guys, and not the way you want us to.","filename":"1slidethread","ext":".png","w":1156,"h":2031,"tn_w":71,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491922216501,"time":1491922216,"md5":"MQYcjjFVppI3Vdhe7m4ajw==","fsize":296781,"resto":120600865,"id":"U9+WH449","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120606258,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:51:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120606139\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120606139<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120600865\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120600865<\/a><br>Fucking imposters, I am a real femanon and I say there are no women on \/pol\/ you fucking gay ass rat faggot.","time":1491922290,"resto":120600865,"id":"15YFRoXs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120606720,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:55:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120606139\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120606139<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;le bullshit<\/span><br>The only thing that stops women from being fucked by a blacklord is the abscence of money of the latter.","time":1491922532,"resto":120600865,"id":"wC3jX59o","country":"KZ","country_name":"Kazakhstan"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120592450,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:36:12","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Why are airlines so shit?","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=W_T<wbr>b6UJ2yC0","filename":"0505050505050","ext":".jpg","w":519,"h":467,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":224,"tim":1491914172968,"time":1491914172,"md5":"QKLgxnJY+e1l4BgBlmBG8Q==","fsize":44289,"resto":0,"id":"2vyHqjwr","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-are-airlines-so-shit","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":79,"images":15,"omitted_posts":74,"omitted_images":15},{"no":120605980,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:49:08","name":"Anonymous","filename":"cho","ext":".png","w":618,"h":322,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1491922148311,"time":1491922148,"md5":"RWttazMYFfU0RlzyaRAQdA==","fsize":43261,"resto":120592450,"id":"uEWPLZJX","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120606392,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:52:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120592450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120592450<\/a><br>U.S. airlines are run by jews for profit, with operations mostly staffed by nigger automatons (except for the pilots they&#039;re not yet able to automate out of the equation).

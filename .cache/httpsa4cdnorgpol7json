One in which things were broken up by federal region, which wasn&#039;t primarily democratic so as to avoid dumber group majorities from outweighing smarter groups? What characteristics exactly would it have to exhibit? Maybe some type of authoritarian meritocratic technocratic fascism? Some Europeans have expressed that they&#039;d be more okay with the EU if it allowed more national sovereignty and didn&#039;t pursue such obviously Left-Wing ideological goals. I believe that globalism and possibly even a one world federalized government are inevitable at this point so I&#039;m just trying to see what it would have to be like for people to even accept it as legitimate.","filename":"SoccerChicks1","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492225373390,"time":1492225373,"md5":"Wk7QONSyyqrGZYSE1tvisw==","fsize":45371,"resto":0,"id":"Ln3d8h7e","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-there-any-type-or-version-of-federalized","country_name":"United States","replies":35,"images":10,"omitted_posts":30,"omitted_images":9},{"no":121166824,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:05:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121165733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121165733<\/a><br>nice","time":1492229150,"resto":121159232,"id":"uwbL3q5K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121166859,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:06:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;when you realize globalism would be fine if everyone was white<\/span>","filename":"1459193001914","ext":".gif","w":300,"h":223,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1492229171422,"time":1492229171,"md5":"QadLjuM2MwMYwvtSwF0EOw==","fsize":1482420,"resto":121159232,"id":"JcC5RCZJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121167048,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:08:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121166476\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121166476<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;indians<\/span><br>dot or feather?","time":1492229282,"resto":121159232,"id":"Yw0bY4jI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121167156,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:08:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121163573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121163573<\/a><br>Because you wont leave us alone","time":1492229331,"resto":121159232,"id":"w34pbVPs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121167423,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:11:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121167156\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121167156<\/a><br>Fk you, this is my country too.","time":1492229460,"resto":121159232,"id":"Yw0bY4jI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121165413,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:53:15","name":"Anonymous","sub":"How the hell do we defeat the &quot;Anti white&quot; narrative?","com":"With the hatred for white men being acceptable in today&#039;s society and not being allowed to be proud of the white race without being a nazi racist.<br><br>How can we combat it?<br>How can we defeat it?<br>I don&#039;t care about if your a nazi or not but I just want to be proud of white people, you can&#039;t even do that it&#039;s ridiculous!","filename":"IMG_0460","ext":".jpg","w":369,"h":398,"tn_w":231,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492228395471,"time":1492228395,"md5":"azX4lT2vASOILiadGg6Qww==","fsize":24478,"resto":0,"id":"N1ykRvBw","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-the-hell-do-we-defeat-the-anti-white","country_name":"Australia","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":121166739,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:05:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Easy you use a grenade snek it inside building put it inside someones mouth then leave the building and watch the news","time":1492229111,"resto":121165413,"id":"a5ALcsyI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121166985,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:07:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"we need a fat neckbeard to collect all the great things made by white guys like mozart and leonardo da vinci, and then to hold them up high over his head and say how great he is because of it","time":1492229248,"resto":121165413,"id":"tBroR\/W2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121167421,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:10:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"I think there is a resurgence of anti-whiteness because at this time Jews have not learned how to not be hypocrites.

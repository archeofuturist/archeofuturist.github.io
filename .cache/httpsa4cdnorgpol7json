There exists no logically valid answer to this question that doesn&#039;t require you to admit one of the following about Yahweh: <br>A- Omnipotence is self defeating and therefore impossible<br>B- Objective morality and truth is a lie and impossible. <br><br>This is why every sane person is at least 25% agnostic. Religious doctrine taken literally always results in constructed beliefs that can be dissected down to an ad-absurdum status by even the most basic of philosophical questions.<br><br>Anyone who bases their core political beliefs purely on religion is an idiot. Someone who seriously votes and maintains a worldview that hinges on the presupposed truth of an unverifiable doctrine is a cancerous shitstain on humanity and their opinions on anything and everything are without merit.","filename":"845562251532","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":853,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492550731809,"time":1492550731,"md5":"8cfIxt58XZOfUBJO21iQcQ==","fsize":242807,"resto":0,"id":"MVA8hI3A","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-an-omnipotetant-and-omnibenevolent-god-create","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121709999,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)13:19:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"How do we fix women?","filename":"FionaLooksRoughAfterShrek","ext":".png","w":980,"h":898,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":229,"tim":1492535999296,"time":1492535999,"md5":"xqee53Kft8oYPKlahBuDKA==","fsize":1358004,"resto":0,"id":"OG3TQf8Z","country":"US","bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-we-fix-women","country_name":"United States","replies":303,"images":75,"omitted_posts":298,"omitted_images":75,"tail_size":50},{"no":121743083,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)17:25:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121711075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121711075<\/a><br>That gif is pretty amazing.","time":1492550725,"resto":121709999,"id":"tPEL8l7f","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121743156,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)17:25:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121742554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121742554<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;goblin<\/span><br>I think you answered your own question there, buddy.","time":1492550749,"resto":121709999,"id":"\/mqd7plQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121743292,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)17:26:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Buddha&#039;s View on Women<br><br>&quot;Ananda, a woman is given to anger.

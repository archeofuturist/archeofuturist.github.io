They are forever attempting to increase their own image and mitigate damage, through fact or fiction. To a man, this is the signs of a clear psychopath. To a women though, perhaps this is just social intelligence?<br><br>Even men here have admitted feeling bad after adopting the 48 laws of power. Men do not pick up on the small cues of social interactivity and many or taken back or hurt when they realise how a girl has been playing them, keeping them at an orbiting distance.

News of Bannon\u2019s demotion came with various reports detailing the increasing friction between Bannon and the president\u2019s senior advisor and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who reportedly pushed for Bannon\u2019s removal from the NSC.

As the New York Times reported, prominent writers and bloggers on the far right attacked Trump and \u201ccriticized him for launching the strike without first seeking congressional approval \u2014 something he said on Twitter in 2013 would be a \u201cbig mistake.\u201d<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.salon.com\/2017\/04\/11\/glo<wbr>bal-elites-strike-back-have-jared-a<wbr>nd-ivanka-defeated-bannon-and-turne<wbr>d-trump-into-a-cuckservative\/","filename":"1491649289001","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":750,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491992928430,"time":1491992928,"md5":"2LINr4HqpbiWN+AvLKHzHA==","fsize":156357,"resto":0,"id":"sjOEZO09","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"have-jared-and-ivanka-defeated-bannon-and-turned","country_name":"Israel","replies":0,"images":0}]}]}

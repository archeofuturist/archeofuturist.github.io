Hitler lost the war against International Jewry for simply telling the truth, and now the same is happening to Donald Trump. And so now the lies are catching up with the (((liberal))) intelligentsia. <br><br>As the old saying goes, you can hide from reality, but you can&#039;t hide from the consequences of reality. All the rich jewish elites are caught in a web of their own lies. Instead of accepting their defeat they will try to crucify Donald Trump for exposing their master plan which led to the deaths of 100 million people under Bolshevism: Capitalism and Bolshevism have the same Jewish roots, two branches of the same tree that in the end bear the same fruit. Its become brazenly obvious their sick, twisted ideology is leading to the downfall of the west, just as it led to the collapse of Germany, only this time they have nowhere to run. The parasite is well on its way to completely killing its host. <br><br>Trump is Jesus at the Trial of the Sanhedrin. Paul Ryan is Judas. Who will be Pontius Pilate? Will the jews succeed in crucifying Trump and turning the USA into a Communist dictatorship, or will America enter a new renaissance of freedom and prosperity?","filename":"Rome destroyed","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":2533,"tn_w":78,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490456697794,"time":1490456697,"md5":"WyoRYP5Y+tdupLSFqR5JJQ==","fsize":1042483,"resto":0,"id":"7+HI6Mu5","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-surreal-living-in-this-timeline-hitler-lost","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":8,"images":2,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":0},{"no":118237399,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)11:53:57","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1479092838908m","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":1024,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490457237903,"time":1490457237,"md5":"50mxPr7GvttHCATyN+9zUg==","fsize":150243,"resto":118236436,"id":"nMSBFMyH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118237819,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)11:57:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118237314\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118237314<\/a><br>Must be an original.

Assyrians speak Aramaic the language Jesus spoke, we created the wheel and the alphabet. We are from Iraq and have been persecuted by muslims for hundreds of years. When the media interviews people in the middle east they never interview Assyrians my whole church are legal immigrants from Iraq that escaped isis or saddam (we prefer saddam in power he helped Christians) and we are all trump supporters but why would the media give a fuck about us. The middle east belongs to the assyrians but no one talks about us. All of our ancient artifacts were defaced and broken with hammers by isis about 2 years ago and they blew up our museums\/churches.. the only artifacts left are in the University of Chicago museum (best school). The media did not even mention it... they ignored isis knocking over ancient artifacts but if one little thing happens to a muslim you never hear the end of it.

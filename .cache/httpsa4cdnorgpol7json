The syrian government and the russians never denied that they bombed the area to shit since the rebels started a big offensive there two weeks ago. However radar data doesn&#039;t show you what munitions are actually dropped. From that alone you simply can&#039;t tell which side of the story is true.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is it possible the rebels stockpiled shit on purpose, knew the attack was coming, let the stockpile get hit and a small chemical &quot;attack&quot; took place to mask it <\/span><br>Yes. It&#039;s also possible that the airstrike just happend to hit a stockpile of shit they intended to use. Or that it really was a falseflag by whoever. Well, or that the government really dropped CWs there, but they&#039;d have absolutely no reason to do so. If they wanted to kill a few civvies they could&#039;ve done so with conventional weapons. Using gas on a small scale makes no sense.<br><br><br>From what tillerson said earlier (ISIS still main target in syria, assad has to go, political transition after country is stable, negotiating with international partners) i&#039;d just assume that trump and his administration are going with the current MSM shitstorm without planning military action. Just like back in 2013 or during the reconquest of aleppo with that boy in the orange seat the MSM has found sad pictures of dead children and are shilling a narrative hard. Going with it for now allows trump and his administration to please his critics on all sides without making any concessions.","time":1491515978,"resto":119798704,"id":"vq4XhL6q","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119787074,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:09:09","name":"Anonymous","sub":"M\u00e9lenchon","com":"M\u00e9lenchon will win.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; +19 points in a month<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Now the most popular politician in France<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Recent surveys show him on top, before Macron<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.lepoint.fr\/politique\/pop<wbr>ularite-melenchon-s-installe-en-tet<wbr>e-devant-macron-06-04-2017-2117786_<wbr>20.php<br>https:\/\/www.lesechos.fr\/elections\/j<wbr>ean-luc-melenchon\/0211951014748-pop<wbr>ularite-melenchon-devient-la-person<wbr>nalite-politique-preferee-des-franc<wbr>ais-2078062.php<br>http:\/\/www.20minutes.fr\/elections\/p<wbr>residentielle\/2045283-20170406-pres<wbr>identielle-pourquoi-telle-dynamique<wbr>-autour-jean-luc-melenchon","filename":"Jean-Luc_M\u00e9lenchon_-_avril_2012","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":275,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491509349607,"time":1491509349,"md5":"3ad9uj6PBs72rbNobH6dVw==","fsize":13841,"resto":0,"id":"s5Drw7bQ","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mlenchon","country_name":"France","replies":39,"images":7,"omitted_posts":34,"omitted_images":7},{"no":119800140,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:45:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"Lol a sixth Republic x)","time":1491515137,"resto":119787074,"id":"FkRhf48n","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119800418,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:47:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119791706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119791706<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I will still vote for Asselineau<\/span><br><br>There is litterally no good reason for voting Asselineau.","time":1491515270,"resto":119787074,"id":"sKvRixYu","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119800905,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:51:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119800418\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119800418<\/a><br>There&#039;s one : wasting your vote.<br><br>Id rather vote for memelenchon even as a marine voter than choosing for someone with 0 chance of winning.","filename":"1490668277401","ext":".jpg","w":1446,"h":1462,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491515481441,"time":1491515481,"md5":"txIH8qph6V2pvKad2+qlFw==","fsize":164829,"resto":119787074,"id":"8qW7XM7k","country":"FR","m_img":1,"country_name":"France"},{"no":119801133,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:52:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119800905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119800905<\/a><br>I VOTE MARINE TO SAVE THE FRANCE FROM LES ARABES","time":1491515576,"resto":119787074,"id":"FkRhf48n","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119801730,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)17:57:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119801133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119801133<\/a><br>I don&#039;t have any troubles with them.

The continence cult originated as a ritual among soldiers prior to engaging in battle; in later days it became the practice of \u201csaints.\u201d This cult tolerated marriage only as an evil lesser than fornication. Many of the world\u2019s great religions have been adversely influenced by this ancient cult, but none more markedly than Christianity. The Apostle Paul was a devotee of this cult, and his personal views are reflected in the teachings which he fastened onto Christian theology: \u201cIt is good for a man not to touch a woman.\u201d \u201cI would that all men were even as I myself.\u201d \u201cI say, therefore, to the unmarried and widows, it is good for them to abide even as I.\u201d Paul well knew that such teachings were not a part of Jesus\u2019 gospel, and his acknowledgment of this is illustrated by his statement, \u201cI speak this by permission and not by commandment.\u201d But this cult led Paul to look down upon women. And the pity of it all is that his personal opinions have long influenced the teachings of a great world religion. If the advice of the tentmaker-teacher were to be literally and universally obeyed, then would the human race come to a sudden and inglorious end. Furthermore, the involvement of a religion with the ancient continence cult leads directly to a war against marriage and the home, society\u2019s veritable foundation and the basic institution of human progress. And it is not to be wondered at that all such beliefs fostered the formation of celibate priesthoods in the many religions of various peoples.<br><br>89:3.7 (977.2) Someday man should learn how to enjoy liberty without license, nourishment without gluttony, and pleasure without debauchery.

I haven&#039;t learned anything unfortunately - apart from the bit about space rock. The truth is that many Jews really do consider themselves, &#039;the chosen people&#039;. Reading some of the comments here confirms that. When a former chief Rabbi in Israel states that gentiles exist to serve Jews, we all know there&#039;s a deep problem. <br><br>Globalism and Cultural Marxism is largely a Jewish creation to serve the aims of a Greater Israel. I hope one day that Jews grow up as a people and stop pretending they are better than everyone else.

Which is perfectly reasonable, if it&#039;s been working for millions of years, don&#039;t fuck it up.<br><br>The question at hand is that although biology and tradition is good enough for creating a functioning civilization, can we create something even better, given that we&#039;re a species with a higher intellect. At least that&#039;s what the discussion would ideally be about, if the people pushing for it (SJWs and feminists) weren&#039;t completely fucking retarded. Biology is &quot;good enough&quot;, not perfect. While it&#039;s the best thing we know of currently, it&#039;s possible that something EVEN BETTER could exist in theory. The same way we have a biological drive based on our sexes, we also have one based on our curiosity and a desire to improve ourselves.<br><br>Here&#039;s the problem with that, though. In purely biological terms, imagine if in the future we could reliably change our DNA and make humans incapable of feeling fear and sadness. Which sounds like an amazing idea on paper, we&#039;ll get rid of something negative and we&#039;ll all be happy all the time. Problem is, that&#039;s a really simplistic approach that doesn&#039;t take into consideration any of the possible negative ramifications. What if society falls apart due to apathy? What if we develop an aversion to happiness? Fucking with something biology and nature gave us has HUGE implications down the line.<br><br>The same thing applies to gender roles and society. It might be fun to just let everybody do whatever they want and give in to all of their feelings and desires, but it could very well lead to something even worse happening. The implications of normalizing homosexuality on a global scale are no less serious than splicing our genes and fucking with our hormones or something. That&#039;s not to say it&#039;s either good or bad, merely that it needs a ton of research and thought put into it.","time":1490835130,"resto":118838535,"id":"N0ka29Td","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":118859533,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)20:54:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118858795\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118858795<\/a><br><br>someone trans is only pretending if they&#039;re hiding who they really are and lying about their biology<br><br>wearing clothes, looking a certain way, and altering your body in a way you find comfortable isn&#039;t pretending<br><br>the treatment is external whether the mind is the issue or not, that&#039;s how that specific issue is best dealt with<br><br>i&#039;ve known plenty of trans people who say the issue is something in their mind, plenty do<br><br>anyway why do you care what people do to their own bodies unless you&#039;re actively fucking them?","time":1490835251,"resto":118838535,"id":"6ue8DGj1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118859639,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)20:55:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118839069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118839069<\/a><br>FPBP","time":1490835307,"resto":118838535,"id":"ON5liksK","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118856291,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)20:23:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"Daily reminder that \/pol\/ is a Christian board and no amount of r\/atheism invasions will ever change that.<br><br>Enjoy arguing with Gaytheists, enjoy watching them squabble and show they have the theological knowledge of a 12 year old.

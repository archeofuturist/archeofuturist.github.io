They&#039;re your best chance at freedom, and living a future that is like the past. ;)<br><br>2) The left-leaning liberal agenda, the gay agenda, and the feminist agenda have gone too far. The Republican party are the ONLY ones who have had success stopping this.<br><br>3) The internet is a freedom, but it can also have draw backs - such as addiction to porn, and addiction to gaming. These are stealing the youth of our children. It&#039;s almost as bad as child predators.<br><br>4) We need to be good citizens of the republic, and role models for others. This means consuming LESS porn, and gaming LESS. Going out and getting jobs so our parents and grandparents can retire comfortably knowing our society will continue its heritage and traditions.<br><br>5) CHRIST is the true redeemer, it is only in CHRIST that you can find the love of God... and there are Godless atheists in the media, and Godless Islamics over in the middle east - and increasingly in the west that NEED TO BE STOPPED.<br><br>So sign up to your local church AND your local republican party representative TODAY!<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>P.S Great website, just great.","filename":"1ZColrA","ext":".jpg","w":2448,"h":3264,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490831362443,"time":1490831362,"md5":"YtTEzDgKfIbMrxvoly2R9g==","fsize":1057198,"resto":0,"id":"nj49ApOg","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hello-my-fellow-conservacucks","country_name":"Australia","replies":6,"images":0,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":118853001,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)19:53:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Also - can someone tell me how to get more responses to my posts?

The rest of his party&#039;s leadership is for free trade and has no interest in renegotiating NAFTA. Also, the reason for the loss of manufacturing jobs over the last 20 years hasn&#039;t been because the US is getting fucked in trade, but because of automation. We need fewer workers for greater productivity. Lastly, for all the talk of &quot;offshoring&quot; for the last couple of decades, we&#039;re about to see a massive &quot;on-shoring&quot; of jobs back to North America due to the massive increases in labor costs throughout China. Mexico will get some of this, but a lot will come back to the US directly.<br><br>Also, fracking is going to make the US energy independent in the next few years.

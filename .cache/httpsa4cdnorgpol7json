This is significant because there is evidence suggesting that genetic similarity between couples might be linked with infertility and inbreeding. Women (of all races) are naturally attracted to superior genetics as well. There may be other complex reasons for choosing a mate, but genetics is one of them (and is largely subconscious).<br><br>Black people have less harmful mutations than whites. In 2008, a Cornell University study revealed that the genetics of Europeans have far more harmful mutations than people of African descent. These harmful mutations have continued to build up and continue to plague European bloodlines. The same Cornell University study also revealed that people of African descent had far greater variations in their genetics than their European counterparts (reinforcing the previous point).","filename":"IMG_0790","ext":".jpg","w":999,"h":925,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":231,"tim":1493239141700,"time":1493239141,"md5":"YIbntK6CLu2+oavhbhOdTg==","fsize":437785,"resto":0,"id":"eWC\/+9lt","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-blacks-are-superior","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":0,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":0},{"no":122935867,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)16:41:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"People of African descent are the &quot;master&quot; race from which all races derive from.

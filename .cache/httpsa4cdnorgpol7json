No thanks.<br><br>There are two realities you need to come to terms with: 1) You are completely irrelevant to me, and 2) I am relevant to you or you would not be here, contacting me in the first place. Once you accept this, you can begin to analyze your situation. You represent a drain on my time &amp; energy. You know that indulging you is not only unappealing to me, but a horrible business decision. <br><br>At this point you have exactly three options:<br>1) Decide not to approach me. Either leave or lurk and let unreciprocated thoughts of me slowly consume your brain. Remain irrelevant and unacknowledged forever.<br>2) Contact me without paying. Your message is instantly discarded. Most likely, you are blocked. I lose nothing. OR,<br>3) Attach your message to money. Literally, make your message inherently valuable to me.

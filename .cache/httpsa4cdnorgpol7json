The man, who has been named as Ziyed Ben Belgacem, is seen struggling with a soldier for more than a minute before help arrives. Belgacem, a 39-year-old French citizen, held an air pistol to the soldier&#039;s head and used her as a shield. Police believe he intended to use the soldier\u2019s weapon to shoot members of the public. The soldier\u2019s colleague intervened and fired three bursts, shooting Belgacem dead.","filename":"20170321001300822738-original","ext":".jpg","w":704,"h":396,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490144783699,"time":1490144783,"md5":"4b4rRU83Ay9SCrM7dWeHIQ==","fsize":40208,"resto":0,"id":"K85yzIfg","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"french-airport-muslim-terror-attack-female","country_name":"Australia","replies":6,"images":0,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":117699015,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)21:16:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117697818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117697818<\/a><br><br>How dare that evil patriarchal war-monger simultaneously oppress a woman and an innocent peaceful protester all in one go?<br>How dare he treat his female colleague as a &quot;damsel in distress&quot; just because she is a woman?

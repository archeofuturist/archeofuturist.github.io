During the Great Trek of the 1830\u2019s, after the colony had passed from Dutch to British hands, the Dutch-speaking Boers lead by Piet Retief pushed deeper into the African wilderness in search of greater freedom and self-determination.<br><br>Piet Retief signed a treaty with the Zulu King Dingane, after which Retief and a large number of his followers, including women and children, were brutally murdered. The Boers responded to the treachery with what became known as the Battle of Blood River. Outnumbered 33 to 1, the Boers defeated the Zulus without sustaining a single loss.<br><br>An article in Life magazine from 1950 covered the erection of the Voortrekker Monument, an event which attracted a crowd of over 150,000, on their front page.<br><br>Just like the brave White men of America\u2019s past, the South Africans fought and made sacrifices in order to secure a safe homeland for their women and children. And just as it happens in America and other white countries now, the Jew took over and the country descended into the reign of rape and murder. Not even the mainstream media can deny that White South Africans are undergoing a genocide anymore.<br><br>Fact is \u2013 Nelson Mandela was a foul murderer. He was a killer of children, motivated by hatred for their color of skin. But because he was not European and his victims were white, instead of being called a racist murdering terrorist, he\u2019s being called a secular saint.<br><br>Nelson Mandela preached racist hatred against Europeans and bombed an entire South Africa into submission to his Marxist tyranny, in accord with his partner in crime \u2013 Lithuanian Jew Joe Slovo.","filename":"white-genocide-south-africa","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":579,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":222,"tim":1490339560668,"time":1490339560,"md5":"MlgGfvUfhK\/4tDW6DRiS\/g==","fsize":115808,"resto":0,"id":"KkcVrc9U","country":"IN","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"legacy-of-nelson-mandela-a-shocking-truth","country_name":"India","replies":98,"images":40,"omitted_posts":93,"omitted_images":39},{"no":118104065,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)13:27:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118102800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118102800<\/a><br>The white man is fully brainwashed...

Us Mexicans (northern Mexicans at least) were always considered white up until the latter half of the 20th century. Do you know who took control during that time? Yep, the eternal (((nuisance))). Pic related is clear proof of how there are white Europeans who immigrated to Latin America in the 19th and 20th century whose offspring remains here to this day.<br><br>The &quot;white Argentinian&quot; is a meme that you \/pol\/acks perpetuate to this day but I&#039;ll tell you that it is quite accurate.

This should tell you that there is a presence of white hispanics and that you should not limit that presence if it risks a less white America.","filename":"1492562263101","ext":".png","w":1199,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493009985591,"time":1493009985,"md5":"05gmO255S9krVNakQdLStA==","fsize":371076,"resto":0,"id":"z9L6CfBb","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-redpill-for-you-mexicanargentinechicano-haters","country_name":"United States","replies":64,"images":18,"omitted_posts":59,"omitted_images":15},{"no":122553766,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)02:31:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122545493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122545493<\/a><br>I&#039;m from northern Mexico but we ain&#039;t white sure we see blondes here and there but the majority is still mestizo but we ain&#039;t as bad as central southern Mexico my god those guys are really indios","time":1493015495,"resto":122545493,"id":"70r5TJFo","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122554004,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)02:34:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122552567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122552567<\/a><br>lol yet people from all over Mexico come here to stay <br>really makes you think","time":1493015665,"resto":122545493,"id":"70r5TJFo","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122554159,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)02:36:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"In this thread, Paco tries to pull mental gymnastics to appear &quot;white&quot; and justify not paying taxes.","filename":"1492904471937","ext":".png","w":540,"h":540,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493015772572,"time":1493015772,"md5":"Zlrb8\/rN0TQ6jJzPnybJlw==","fsize":481522,"resto":122545493,"id":"VJgSWS5B","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122554206,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)02:36:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122553699\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122553699<\/a><br>Its starting, and saddest thing is that this kids and their parents will embrace it with open arms as &quot;The future of education&quot; or some shit like that, I can already see it.<br><br>To which city are you moving?","time":1493015803,"resto":122545493,"id":"sAukH8ER","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122554362,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)02:38:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122554206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122554206<\/a><br><br>Tepatitl\u00e1n","time":1493015909,"resto":122545493,"id":"twyALFO6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122543566,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:40:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Don&#039;t ask how but I lost my lucky merchant folder and need to stock up<br><br>Post your merchants, the rarer the better","filename":"1491834037926","ext":".jpg","w":706,"h":673,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":238,"tim":1493008854970,"time":1493008854,"md5":"1iUHvbWWi8CqqXn5LLxspg==","fsize":78167,"resto":0,"id":"pouq5mZQ","country":"US","bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":1,"semantic_url":"dont-ask-how-but-i-lost-my-lucky-merchant-folder","country_name":"United States","replies":305,"images":250,"omitted_posts":300,"omitted_images":246,"tail_size":50},{"no":122554355,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)02:38:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122554148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122554148<\/a><br>It happens.

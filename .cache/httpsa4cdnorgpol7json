They handed their money over to a group of people (founders were a black guy and a white guy, plus who knows how many silent investors).

I don&#039;t think they intended to defraud people intentionally, it looked like they tried but didn&#039;t have the balls to abort the mission when it became clear it was going to fail hard in the last few weeks.","time":1493494811,"resto":123366790,"id":"\/mbEU9ef","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

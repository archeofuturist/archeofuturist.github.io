One might even be proud to represent one\u2019s country in some way, since it demonstrates some level of excellence or ability which one has personally attained.<br><br>But being proud of one\u2019s country? This entails an unhealthy \u201cthem and us\u201d mentality, perhaps even a feeling of superiority which is, I believe, outright dangerous. And everyone has to be born somewhere - what word describes somebody who is proud of the geographical location of their birth?<br><br>\u201cFool\u201d, I say.

Western civilization stripped us of our spirituality and our connection to our land and now Europe is being flooded with shitskins to replace the Europeans themselves.","time":1492438879,"resto":121515256,"id":"ZRsIw0rr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121530974,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:23:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121530736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121530736<\/a><br>uhuh, nice story, Varg","filename":"1482796559372","ext":".jpg","w":350,"h":350,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492439031415,"time":1492439031,"md5":"7Iy09Cz537iL6L5YfNh\/bw==","fsize":104379,"resto":121515256,"id":"zDLs8x15","country":"GE","country_name":"Georgia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121500140,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)04:12:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"am i the only one who notices how fucking weird the world has been getting lately?","filename":"uh oh","ext":".jpg","w":612,"h":612,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492416750915,"time":1492416750,"md5":"Z2LFlj+oifWOHwumbLIN1w==","fsize":44351,"resto":0,"id":"v9nG7m+4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"am-i-the-only-one-who-notices-how-fucking-weird","country_name":"United States","replies":266,"images":66,"omitted_posts":261,"omitted_images":65,"tail_size":50},{"no":121527744,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)09:51:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121527663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121527663<\/a><br>dangit.... by 3","time":1492437106,"resto":121500140,"id":"3WVZRgEB","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":121529085,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:05:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121505808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121505808<\/a><br>Yep, it&#039;s the smartphones","time":1492437917,"resto":121500140,"id":"ud6020qY","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121530338,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:17:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121519524\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121519524<\/a><br>cracked was not the first but this whole thing started in smaller hipster and other dumb liberal type groups way back in about &#039;10, and even a bit before, but by &#039;11, the culture was everywhere.

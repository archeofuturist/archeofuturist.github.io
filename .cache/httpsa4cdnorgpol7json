What the Russian geneticists found was that, given known rates of mutation, the most recent common ancestor between Europinoids and Africanoids had to have been at least 120,000 years ago. This evidence, combined with the well established evidence of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA in European and Asian populations, gives significant support to the multiregional theory. The multiregional theory, pic related, holds that the human species first arose around two million years ago and subsequent human evolution has been within a single human species.

North Korea is very similar to Imperial Japan ironically enough. <br><br>Tougher sanctions are going to lead to war, China turning the screws on North Korea is going to lead to war. The truth is North Koreans hate China but they basically pimp their minerals and workers to China to keep the country running.<br><br>I don&#039;t know what Trump&#039;s gameplan is, if his plan is somehow pressure North Korea to the point where they fold their cards and say &quot;Ok you win, we&#039;ll behave from now on&quot;.

Its the opposite of 67 years of North Korean behavior. <br><br>Tillerson and that Indian bitch Nikki Haley are saying North Korean broke the deal but that&#039;s not true. They broke the deal but it was because Dubya didn&#039;t honor the Clinton agreement with NK by being late with oil shipments. That part is never told to the American public, typical deep state shit. <br><br>What North Korea is is a real life Kobayashi Maru, for all you Star Trek fans. Sanction will lead to war, a pre-emptive strike will still kill millions. What Trump needs to do is a extremely unpredictable Trump-like move and either go to Pyongyang to negotiate a deal (and completley change the news cycle from Russia) or something along those lines.<br><br>Its against his m.o of being tough and being against the Iran Deal but its the kind of unorthodox move he needs to do in a no-win situation. Just going by the book and continuing to be &quot;tough&quot; but not going with all-out war is basically what the last 5 US presidents have done with North Korea. He doesn&#039;t have to negotiate a perfect deal, it could be some sanctions being lifted and the annual military drills with S.Korea cancelled in exchange for a moratorium on future missile tests and nuke tests.<br><br>Basically kicking the can down the road and hoping something changes in North Korea.","time":1491371713,"resto":119573202,"id":"HOz9NTXs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119574361,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:55:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119574283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119574283<\/a><br>how long until we know the winner?","time":1491371714,"resto":119573202,"id":"7Y\/NSLA2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119574374,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:55:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119574144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119574144<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119574298\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119574298<\/a><br>I was blackout drunk at the time.

This was his burgeoning interest in actually running for office because they weren&#039;t doing what he saw as reasonable and common sense. He started going around talking about the ills of society most notably in a his Oprah interview outside of the ads he already did:<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SEP<wbr>s17_AkTI<br><br>This led to his joining the reform party after Perot ran in 1992 and 1996, foiling Bush Senior and republicans from getting the white house for their lack of focus on conservative small government principles, especially in the area of economics.<br><br>He was informed by Perot that it was impossible with the current system to win as a third party candidate so sought the republican nomination.<br><br>After meeting with head republican strategists, he learned that the process was locked for Bush II. He then wanted to use the reform party as his foray into politics on the ballot in a 2000 run but the reform party fell apart before the election.<br><br>After the 2000 election there was no point for him to consider a run again until 2008, as he could not run as a Republican. Yet again the process locked him out in favor of establishment candidate McCain but he also did not wish to run in 2008 due to the unpopularity of the Republican party of the time.","filename":"1489630020436","ext":".jpg","w":5760,"h":3840,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491371771385,"time":1491371771,"md5":"dIRoiK35Z2\/lZywooRXexg==","fsize":1917264,"resto":119573202,"id":"3S+OCsNe","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119574435,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:56:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119573409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119573409<\/a><br>ummmm<br><br>okay so Trump&#039;s son in law is getting arrested with a bunch of other scumbags....<br><br>Thank you for this informative information, fellow 4channer","time":1491371776,"resto":119573202,"id":"zYMqNfa3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119574453,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:56:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"HMMMMM<br>WHAT NOW, DRUMPFKINS","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-05 at 1.55.53 AM","ext":".png","w":744,"h":404,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":67,"tim":1491371788102,"time":1491371788,"md5":"vVBWqutmpQzu0Uk8NvnBIA==","fsize":84528,"resto":119573202,"id":"MoEiZt\/x","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119574490,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:57:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119574335\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119574335<\/a><br>You&#039;d think they would of chose someone else<br><br>He&#039;s not gonna last much longer","time":1491371824,"resto":119573202,"id":"h9yfJ0aI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119574522,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:57:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;11th hour plagiarist claims<\/span>","filename":"Screenshot at 2017-04-05 01:55:47","ext":".png","w":1502,"h":883,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":73,"tim":1491371842077,"time":1491371842,"md5":"M0Ersk\/2dKaTjXrlJgTzEA==","fsize":896958,"resto":119573202,"id":"sQGB0Etd","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119574526,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:57:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"About the gas attack in syria. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;assad btfos the rebels and makes massive gains<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;peace talks become possible <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;suddenly gas attack <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rebels and world medias baws <\/span><br>This has happened twice now.","time":1491371845,"resto":119573202,"id":"+OL6FQTo","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119574533,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)01:57:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119574360\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119574360<\/a><br>You assume we care about the lives of shitty gooks.

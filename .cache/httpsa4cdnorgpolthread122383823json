The first round, many candidates run. The rules say if the candidate reaches the 50% round, they win outright, however this occurrence is rare. When the first round is done, the 2 candidates with the top 2 votes move on to a final runoff where those two are the only ones on the ballot. Whichever one gets over 50% wins the presidency.","time":1492924825,"resto":122383823,"id":"kugCEfrU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

It&#039;s like trying to take the &quot;idea&quot; of science and make it into a fashion statement. Why can&#039;t you just practice and enjoy math, science, etc. without trying to be so fucking smug about it? I suspect because for 99% of these people, it isn&#039;t actually about science, it&#039;s about the superiority in their mind that they perceive the intellect required to immerse yourself in science requires.

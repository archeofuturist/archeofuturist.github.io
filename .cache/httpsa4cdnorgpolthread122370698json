Ironically this makes them extremely resistant to change, despite supposedly being &quot;progressive.&quot; Look how poorly they have adapted to their recent political losses.<br><br>In this way &quot;science&quot; has become something of a mind-trap to leftists, who try to wield it like a sword because they believe that science is incorruptible, when it&#039;s sadly extremely easy to fake results, draw erroneous conclusions, or draft specious theories based on circumstantial evidence. It&#039;s also easy to ignore the science you don&#039;t like, or dismiss &quot;unsavory&quot; inquiry altogether, usually under threat of implied force in the academic setting.","time":1492921371,"resto":122370698,"id":"RbFoCQCL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122379124,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)00:25:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122378760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122378760<\/a><br>seriously, who wrote this? Force is MA = m(dv\/dt), with a little arrow over the v if you want to make it a vector, and a moment\/torque (they still havent decided which one is which) is that times a distance.

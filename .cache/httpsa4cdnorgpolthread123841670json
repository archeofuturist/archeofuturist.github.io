If you\u2019re in a bipartisan meeting, I think it is very unusual for one group to walk out and start spiking the football and say, \u2018We won, we killed the other guys.\u2019 It certainly doesn\u2019t bode very well for future discussions.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cI think the president is frustrated with the fact that he negotiated in good faith with the Democrats and they went out to try and spike the football to make him look bad. I get that frustration because I think it\u2019s a terrible posture for the Democrats to take.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cI think what you heard this morning was his sense of frustration over how he\u2019s being mistreated by the Democrats on a bipartisan piece of legislation.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cYou have a president who is able to work with Democrats and Republicans. Again, a little disappointed with the way Democrats acted after the deal was put together.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cWhat I think you heard the president express this morning was frustration over how he\u2019s been treated as part of the negotiation.

SS-Obersturmbannf\u00fchrer H\u00f6ss was commandant of Auschwitz-Birkenau from May 1940 to November 1943. According to H\u00f6ss&#039; own testimony and later memoirs, he was summoned to Berlin in June 1941 where he received &quot;personal orders&quot; from Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler to turn Auschwitz-Birkenau into a large scale extermination camp, modelled on the facility already operating at Treblinka.

Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap among the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.<\/span>","time":1492595137,"resto":121826041,"id":"OJCAUF08","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121826966,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:48:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121826769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121826769<\/a><br>Not related in any capacity other than format, but alright","time":1492595310,"resto":121826041,"id":"J7dgK+3w","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121827199,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:51:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121826966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121826966<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not related in any capacity other than format, but alright<\/span><br>And genre","time":1492595496,"resto":121826041,"id":"OJCAUF08","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]}

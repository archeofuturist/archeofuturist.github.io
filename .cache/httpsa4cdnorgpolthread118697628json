No loyalty to employers. Typically unsatisfied with work compared to previous generations. Usually have terrible work ethic. In general did not acquire any useful skills through school or extra-curricular activities.

I studied alot and did all the homework.&quot;<br>&quot;How long did you study for this test.&quot;<br>&quot;Like three hours!&quot;<br>*Not good* &quot;How many extra problems do you do besides the homework?&quot;<br>&quot;Extra problems? You mean examples from the chapter?&quot;<br>*Mental Face Palm* &quot;If you want to do well you need to do every single problem in the chapters we cover. A good rule of thumb is that for every hour you are sitting in a class room you should have done at least 2-3 hours of prep work for that one hour of class.

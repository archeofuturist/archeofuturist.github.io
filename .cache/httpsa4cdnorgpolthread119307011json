As for Saudi Arabia&#039;s fighting capabilities read:<br>http:\/\/www.meforum.org\/441\/why-arab<wbr>s-lose-wars<br>I&#039;d also like to add that the region&#039;s always been volatile, long before American or even British presence. The Sunni-Shia conflicts date back long before that. And that&#039;s why the &quot;Shia Crescent&quot; seems to be the biggest threat to Sunni countries. I prefer not to &quot;choose&quot; sides, both are fundamentalists in their own ways and both promote terrorism in their own ways too unfortunately.<br><br><a href=\"#p119312328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119312328<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They wish to deny expanding Iranian influence. <\/span><br>Pretty much.","time":1491213753,"resto":119307011,"id":"swhTub4N","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":119312802,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)06:02:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119312691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119312691<\/a><br><br>Looks like it.","time":1491213758,"resto":119307011,"id":"WcJSLgIi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119312816,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)06:02:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119312636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119312636<\/a><br>This.

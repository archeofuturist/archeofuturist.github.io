A lot of what I say will be anecdotal evidence so take it with a grain of salt. I find refugees regardless of where they&#039;re from to be hardworking individuals. They&#039;re usually from shit countries without much education but they work hard for their kids to be successful. <br><br>However, I feel if the government gives them too much shit they become lazy fucks. My parents both worked jobs while going to school to be able to raise me but there is a lot of people who just suck the government dry and do nothing with their lives.<br><br>I live in MB, and if you&#039;re not aware a lot of people are crossing the borders from the US to here due to the travel ban. I&#039;m against that shit because we don&#039;t know who&#039;s crossing that border (same thing with mexico and the states). <br><br>Overall, mostly good thoughts on refugees. If they&#039;re not lazy and ready to work, but that&#039;s a hard characteristic to screen.

We are immigrants. We have many immigrant friends here in Canada. Nobody who is a first generation immigrant - that WE know of, respect these economic refugees. If you were witness to how difficult it is to come to Canada legally, you have respect for those who are lawful and follow the rules. For some reason, the children of 1st generation immigrants (ie. parents came to Canada from France, and made Sally Sue in Canada) think we should welcome everyone with open arms. There was a certain college here in Ontario that was going to offer free education for Syrian refugees. Since our universities and colleges are publicaly funded, people were fuming.","time":1491165693,"resto":119238979,"id":"MYp9xYcM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119243401,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)16:42:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119241293\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119241293<\/a><br>Ayy Yugo refugee brate, my senpai lived in Vukovar then a few months before the shelling happened we moved to Germany then were &#039;fugees in Holland for a bit then moved to Canada, uncle gave us a little loan and a place to stay. Super hard working folks hope I can have work ethic like that when I get my shit together, literally came here with nothing not even knowing english and now we&#039;re better off than most people I know. <br><br>I have a bit of sympathy towards actual refugees too I do think that people need some place to go but it&#039;s difficult to distinguish between economic migrants and legitimate refugees. For example from what I&#039;ve seen Damascus is an absolute shit show (there could be lots of parts that are still ok but I haven&#039;t done too much looking into it), I agree that those people should have somewhere safe to go but I also think that there should be an effort to return and build so there has to be a bit of both worlds. I do hate the fact that none of the neighboring countries are taking in their people, again I&#039;m not too sure about compatibility if some were christians, shia, sunni whatever then obviously they wouldn&#039;t think about it. But like you said <a href=\"#p119242251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119242251<\/a> when they hear about Germany coddling them giving them houses and yearly allowances for all their children they will see $$ in their eyes but you can&#039;t blame a human for taking the path of least resistance so it&#039;s a problem with the system. As for the refugee problem in Canada where they are crossing into Alberta\/Winnipeg getting frost-bite, it&#039;s pretty irresponsible because they are putting their children at risk I&#039;ve heard they cross through blizzards and stuff. Another reason it&#039;s irresponsible is because they are automatically burdening themselves onto the backs of ordinary small town folk who don&#039;t have the resources to properly help them.","time":1491165754,"resto":119238979,"id":"Tp0cwH7M","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119243500,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)16:43:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119238979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119238979<\/a><br>Is it really feasible to move 7 million people from Syria?

As for the refugee problem in Canada where they are crossing into Alberta\/Winnipeg getting frost-bite, it&#039;s pretty irresponsible because they are putting their children at risk I&#039;ve heard they cross through blizzards and stuff.

People judge it based on their own political affiliation rather than the actual process.<br><br>Canada has consistently taken in fewer immigrants each year than there are Canadians born each year. The real reason that our country is becoming less white and more ethnic has everything to do with the fact that white Canadians aren&#039;t having babies. This is the only reason we import working-age skilled immigrants as well. Canadians as a whole (though the ones on \/pol\/ would surely disagree) like socialist policies such as universal healthcare and subsidized post-secondary education, and if we want to keep such a society working, then we have to face the demographic realities. Canadians are not only living longer than ever, but are also delaying entry into the workforce longer than ever in favour of education or NEETdom. This means that the ratio of dependents to taxpayer will increase dramatically, forcing us to import taxpayers. This is not a political change, it&#039;s a cultural change. Our politics are a response to it.","time":1491166185,"resto":119238979,"id":"1A0\/AIPD","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119244287,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)16:50:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119238979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119238979<\/a><br>Hate immigrants.

It&#039;s just simply not fair to the people that apply to enter a country and have to wait when there are people who simply walk across some farms and fields to have good upstanding citizens and tax payer money via hospitals to house and take care of them. We also have to work a little bit on social integration because if you&#039;ve ever been to GTA area, Mississauga\/Brampton there are areas where no buildings have English writing on them and you will need to learn Hindi to get a job and this happens quickly ~10 years Brampton changed very much. <br><br>So it&#039;s a two sided thing, on one hand as humans it&#039;s important to have compassion for our fellow man but we have to remain stern about keeping our nation identity, whether you believe we have one or not, intact.

One of them, is Metis. My mom&#039;s side came here in the late 1600s and helped build the country in the east, integrated with the population and made the country into what it is today. <br>The other side is Austrain immigrants from just after WWII. My grandparents came here from europe with the hopes of making a new life. The big difference between them and every single other immigrant nowadays is, there were no handouts. None. You were expected to come here with at last 2000 dollars, enough to support yourself, and were expected to be employed within 2 months, or you would be deported. My grandfather worked his ass off to make a home for his family and encouraged his children to integrate as well as they could, because they were Canadians now, not Austrian. They could remember their heritage but first and foremost they were Canadians. <br><br>This is the big difference.<br>New immigrants may come here looking for a better life, but they are supported heavily by tax handouts and help from the government, many of which bring over dependents and sandbaggers that do nothing but laze about and collect benefits without even making the slightest effort to integrate. There is no &quot;Little Austria&quot; or &quot;Britan Town&quot; in Vancouver, but there are several areas of the city and the surrounding municipalities that are 80% one race of immigrants, who have refused to integrate in any way. You go to Richmond, a 5 minute drive from the rest of the city, and the population there often refuses to speak english unless you are asian. In Surrey, a likewise district just outside of the city, the population is 70% Indian, and the people there treat everyone else with outright hostilities, making it a hotbed for gang violence and crime. <br><br>New immigrants and those from outside of Europe do not integrate. They come to have the same life they had before but in a place that will pay them to do better. That is it.

Electric vehicles will be advanced enough by then, and with cheap energy they would be extremely useful. Fusion is an expensive investment, so state funded projects might become reality. I highly doubt many power companies can make the investment soon enough to contend with the state. Essentially, expect lobbying and smear campaigns.

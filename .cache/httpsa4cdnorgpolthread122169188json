They used to call this province God&#039;s country, but we&#039;re under the jurisdiction of the federal government, and our leftists provincial and federal governments have been pushing social constructivist gender theories and LGB+ propaganda nonstop, so you constantly feel like you&#039;re under seige. We&#039;re also dealing with an opioid epidemic right now, tons of people on fentanyl and shit, and there&#039;s lots of alcoholism. Our economy is also notoriously unreliable (which contributes to the opioids and alcohol); most people are connected to the oilpatch in one way or another, so when global markets are down, we&#039;re in for a world of hurt. The scenery\/environment can be okay, ranges from -30C in the winter to +30C in the summer (-22F to 86F for burger units), but the mountains are always nice. <br><br>tl;dr, less rights, harsher scenery and a government that is trying to cram Marxist\/leftist propaganda down your throat 24\/7 because we have no way to protest","time":1492802821,"resto":122169188,"id":"uFt4v3N4","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

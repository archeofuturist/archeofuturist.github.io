Arab spring led to all &quot;sectarian&quot; leaders in the region falling and being replaced (thanks to Obama&#039;s efforts) with Muslim Brotherhood puppet regimes. Every single one of these governments was replaced with a far worse Islamic theocracy, except for Syria, which has held on for dear life, and in Egypt, where they rejected our puppet and demanded less retarded leadership.<br><br>2. Over 2 years ago, Obama signed an executive order permitting the US to begin exporting a type of lightly treated Crude oil. This was a massive move that barely went noticed by anyone. It basically signaled our intent to breach our over-five-decades-old agreement with OPEC to not export crude in exchange for their agreement to only trade their petroleum in US dollars. Nixon arranged this. Soon after, we were officially taken off the gold standard, and thereafter the US dollar was implicitly backed by oil. Given all that context, Obama&#039;s executive order was alarming as fuck.<br><br>3. Some time after Obama signed his (almost) crude export permission, congress slipped in the official, full on, buttblowing breach of our OPEC agreement into the National Budget. For the first time since the early 60s we officially told OPEC to fuck themselves and announced intention to begin exporting crude.<br><br>Conclusion, Obama was setting up the entire region as a unified, coalesced theocratic enemy for his predecessor to knock down, the same way Carter strengthened the Soviets for Reagan to destroy. Terrorists have no nation or sovereign identity, Obama set it up so that that would be different going forward, including his creation of an Islamic State. His alleged Muslim background is a ruse to throw everyone off and make the obvious seem inconceivable. We want to export oil to sell to the Europeans and others, to secure them as allies when we destroy their petro supply chain.","time":1491292297,"resto":119435458,"id":"N9xWcLwE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119446185,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)03:52:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119445801\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119445801<\/a><br>Trump","time":1491292344,"resto":119435458,"id":"MSNszIj0","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119446282,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)03:53:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"The major powers have stockpiles of weaponised smallpox and other biological agents, be fun when they come out.","time":1491292433,"resto":119435458,"id":"9wta9Tv7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119446292,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)03:53:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119445957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119445957<\/a><br>turning to baseless insults wont help your cause...if you do not believe that the bible is truthfull...then that is your answer...you believe the lies they feed you. they who do not love you...but seek to bestroy you.","time":1491292438,"resto":119435458,"id":"4VVYY9ML","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":119446370,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)03:55:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119441495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119441495<\/a><br>Kek","time":1491292523,"resto":119435458,"id":"nesOFgBj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119446395,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)03:55:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119446134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119446134<\/a><br>I meant &quot;successor&quot; not &quot;predecessor&quot; in my conclusion.","time":1491292553,"resto":119435458,"id":"N9xWcLwE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119446440,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)03:56:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119435458\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119435458<\/a><br>When: in a year or thereabout<br>What: Switzerland accidentally invades lichtenstein for the 10^6 time, Europeans butthurt about frexit and brexit try to invade us<br>Get btfo&#039;d and genicided because we&#039;re lovely people over here.","time":1491292591,"resto":119435458,"id":"cxZkgyBI","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":119446474,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)03:56:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119435458\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119435458<\/a><br>It&#039;s going to be Turkey.

At both the series, put on by the US Naval War College and the SAASS, one of the presentations involved a directed Kessler cascade that would either be initiated as a last-ditch defense against a large launch, or a prophylactic preemption of one as a demonstration. Kesslerization was examined as both the result of a mass release of swarms of semi-smart &#039;debris&#039; and the intentional destruction of specific objects in favorable paths.<br><br>The idea was that a sufficiently devastating cloud would last for years, and would create basic &#039;windows&#039; over launch sites that would make placement of less indiscriminate SBI and land\/air\/sea-based capabilities much simpler and hard to overcome. Essentially, the analysis said (it was nearly the same one presented both times) that the country with the highest-orbiting and least trackable monitoring and surveillance systems would have the upper hand, regardless of who started a cascade. Directed energy systems were discussed as well, but focused on land prototypes and also on LEO-capable rail\/accelerator installations currently being &quot;investigated&quot;.<br><br>The scientist had a service-relevant military officer co-presenter and a guard with him both times he presented.

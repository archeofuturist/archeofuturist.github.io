There are other things that would be used for the naval war. The United States would win the sea and the air but on land there would be a stalemate because China could not invade the U.S. and the U.S. wouldn&#039;t want to lose a whole shitload of men in the invasion because then public favor for the war would turn to shit. Korea would likely be steamrolled because there just isnt enough men to guard in effectively against a chinese invasion. The war would likely drag on for years with the U.S. bombing China.

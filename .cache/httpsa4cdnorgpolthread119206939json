She was, however, involved in two major collisions with allied vessels. The first occurred on the evening of 10 February 1964, in which Melbourne rammed and sank the RAN destroyer HMAS Voyager when the latter altered course across her bow. Eighty-two of Voyager&#039;s personnel were killed, and two Royal Commissions were held to investigate the incident. The second collision occurred in the early morning of 3 June 1969, when Melbourne also rammed and sank the United States Navy (USN) destroyer USS Frank E. Evans in similar circumstances. Seventy-four American personnel died, and a joint USN\u2013RAN Board of Inquiry was held. These incidents, along with several minor collisions, shipboard accidents, and aircraft losses, led to the reputation that Melbourne was jinxed.&quot;<br><br>You blokes are best left to fight off snakes, spiders, birds, weather, and whatever the fuck else is trying to kill you on a given day.","filename":"straya","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":314,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":98,"tim":1491149194573,"time":1491149194,"md5":"cX3oLR9g\/SAnz+An1yABvw==","fsize":27458,"resto":119206939,"id":"Y4VDestp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119213765,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)12:08:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119213570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119213570<\/a><br>I hope you get raped, and your asshole gets destroyed forever.

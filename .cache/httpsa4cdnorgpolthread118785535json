The left organizes all their radical groups through NGOS and other ways. One thing I&#039;m wondering is why haven&#039;t the altright or conservatives actively engaged and joined forces with the HOTEPS? They&#039;re based and want what most conservative thinkers or right leaning people want.

They are NATIONALISTS and their movement is gaining members of the black community and are based\/woke. What are we going to do to engage? Groups like these need eachother.

Why don&#039;t big podcasts invite HOTEPS to get their message and &quot;our&quot; message out?

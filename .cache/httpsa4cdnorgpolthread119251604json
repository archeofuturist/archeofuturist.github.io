It isn&#039;t about personal defence either. It&#039;s about national defence. See the reason American civilians are allowed to bear arms, is it makes the country virtually impossible to invade. No army on Earth could even chew through one US city if the population (without even using the army\/national guard) employed gorilla tactics. This is why Americans can have guns, because it makes the country as a whole stronger.<br><br>The thing is 99.9% of Americans would willingly hand over their weapons if law enforcement or their military if demanded. Look at what happened in New Orleans if you don&#039;t believe that. It has nothing to do with personal defence, or rights. <br>It&#039;s all about national defence. It&#039;s actually a pretty amazing strategy really.","filename":"discover_card","ext":".jpg","w":292,"h":185,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":158,"tim":1491170261328,"time":1491170261,"md5":"qrv+j9naRx4uCs7zQ5RmXw==","fsize":19212,"resto":0,"id":"BK6WRzEG","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"heres-the-truth-behind-americas-second-amendment","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

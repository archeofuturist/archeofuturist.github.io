Maybe some of the anonymous winners are fake and Camelot just pocket the cash but one of my town locals won big a while back. Some council house chav.

I called smoking degenerate (or something like that) and she took offense to it, tried to get the dyke daughter of the lottery winner to fuck my shit up. Luckily I give off a serial killer vibe so after a few encounters with me and realizing they couldn&#039;t intimidate me they backed off.","time":1493253213,"resto":122963960,"id":"prGuPfFT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122966590,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:39:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122963960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122963960<\/a><br>Another name for it is &quot;the stupid tax&quot; and the funds raised from it usually go to education.

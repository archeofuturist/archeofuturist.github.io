The bottom line is that everything is heritable, an outcome that has taken all sides of the naturenurture debate by surprise. Irving Gottesman and I have suggested that the universal influence of genes on behavior be enshrined as the first law of behavior genetics (Turkheimer &amp; Gottesman, 1991), and at the risk of naming laws that I can take no credit for discovering, it is worth stating the nearly unanimous results of behavior genetics in a more formal manner.&quot;<br><br>The Three Laws are as follows: <br><br>? First Law. All human behavioral traits are heritable.<br><br>? Second Law. The effect of being raised in the same family is smaller than the effect of genes.<br><br>? Third Law. A substantial portion of the variation in complex human behavioral traits is not accounted for by the effects of genes or families.","filename":"evidenve","ext":".webm","w":320,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490194357767,"time":1490194357,"md5":"m2q\/4ouowqx738e\/laPRow==","fsize":910257,"resto":117760493,"id":"COsYjNP+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117767265,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)10:53:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117760493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117760493<\/a>","filename":"1480246323077","ext":".gif","w":2406,"h":1936,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1490194406570,"time":1490194406,"md5":"zX0fY64HmHQKWd7FeVaQmw==","fsize":881581,"resto":117760493,"id":"qbRrdJIV","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":117767309,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)10:53:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117760493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117760493<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;biological fiction<\/span><br>background?<br><br>https:\/\/isites.harvard.edu\/fs\/docs\/<wbr>icb.topic185351.files\/Rushton-Jense<wbr>n30years.pdf<br><br>(2005) Philippe Rushton and Arthur Jensen (author of, &quot;The g Factor&quot;) conclude that IQ is the greatest indicator of future success in Western societies when inter-generational income dependence is accounted for.<br><br>They also found that IQ is at least 50% heritable and likely nearer to 80% heritable.

The reduction in IQs across the West has been met with a marked decrease in average productivity and general health despite vast increases in average wealth, nutrition and access to healthcare. <br><br>The cumulative reduction in IQ is between 12,45 and 13,35 points or roughly one standard deviation on a normal IQ bell curve.

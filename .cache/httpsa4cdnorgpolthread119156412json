I voted for Obama twice and prior to 2015 I pretty much considered myself liberal, most people I&#039;ve spoken to here have said something similar. I think most intelligent people grow out of being liberal eventually, unless they either were born into money and take it for granted or have never lived among non-whites. The key to turning the tide is going to be redpilling younger generations so they don&#039;t become liberal in the first place.","time":1491034005,"resto":119156412,"id":"SnjtwcEb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119159155,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)04:07:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119158706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119158706<\/a><br><br>Yeah I&#039;ve been getting connection errors all night. 4chan hasn&#039;t worked properly since gook moot took over.","time":1491034075,"resto":119156412,"id":"SnjtwcEb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119159158,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)04:07:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119159003\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119159003<\/a><br>You can&#039;t go too far all at once with most people dude.

Only one valid ideology is conservatism. That is the real fact. Because every people just create their own ideas and own group and try to converse it. There is no ideological thing which change consistently. Orwell looks like jews who live with christian majority. He talked. Just talked. We know how minorities act when they become majority.

In his essays, not only does he condemn individuals who were defeatist in the face of Nazi Germany in 1940, but he also condemns intellectuals for being ashamed of their national origin as Britons. One of the reasons he writes sentences as simply as possible is because in one of his essays he talks about political vocabulary being invented to cover up all forms of atrocity by disguising the true intention of the phrase and its true meaning if it were stated plainly. Brief summary, I know, but Hemingway is relevant here too, speaking of his contemporary Faulkner - &#039;Poor Faulkner. Does he really believe big emotions come from big words?&#039;","filename":"Orwell and Hemingway, the Rebels","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":533,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492790359633,"time":1492790359,"md5":"q3jq\/3zuJGLGbBkd6wfw2g==","fsize":93548,"resto":122148053,"id":"+6WcX2XS","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

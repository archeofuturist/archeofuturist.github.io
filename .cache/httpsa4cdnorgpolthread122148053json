In his essays, not only does he condemn individuals who were defeatist in the face of Nazi Germany in 1940, but he also condemns intellectuals for being ashamed of their national origin as Britons. One of the reasons he writes sentences as simply as possible is because in one of his essays he talks about political vocabulary being invented to cover up all forms of atrocity by disguising the true intention of the phrase and its true meaning if it were stated plainly. Brief summary, I know, but Hemingway is relevant here too, speaking of his contemporary Faulkner - &#039;Poor Faulkner.

Your insinuations as told through broken english do not come across as being rational or intelligent, but it may just be the translation. If you&#039;re saying what I think it says, George Orwell was a brilliant mastermind who fooled a planet into believing he spoke one ideology, but believed something sinister. The part I&#039;m confused about is that if Orwell only ever advanced one ideology, what does it matter if he believed something else? It&#039;s too late for him to suddenly come forward and &quot;red-pill&quot; everyone on his real ideals now.","time":1492790997,"resto":122148053,"id":"O7AcoqOi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122152193,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)12:15:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122150494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122150494<\/a><br>He always talked.

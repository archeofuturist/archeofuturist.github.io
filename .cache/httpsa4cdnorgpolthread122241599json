React router is very useful though. <br><br>Check out create-react-app on github or the tyler mcginnis vids (onlinereacttraining). Wes bos for general js stuff, 30 days of js will get you up to speed with es6 nicely and the flexbox one is good too (both are free). &quot;React for those who know just enough jquery to get by&quot; is a good friendly 101, even if a bit older now.

Just using typescript has let me use the features of ES6 however, but when i have time im definitely gonna go through Wes Bos&#039;s stuff. RsX is pretty much a requirement when using Angular&#039;s services so im pretty up to date on it.<br><br><a href=\"#p122254515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122254515<\/a><br>because Angular and React\/Redux (from what I understand about it) handle the state of your ajax calls concurrently. So for instance if this thread was built on Angular\/React it would update all posts asynchronously when a user hits &#039;post&#039; and and the Model\/Component of 4chan detects a change in the database given by the rest service when the Component in React or Angular detects a change. You you wouldnt have to worry about sending an ajax call every 15 seconds or wait until a user presses &#039;update&#039; to update the posts in a thread. It makes handling asynchronous changes easy","filename":"1481811319196","ext":".jpg","w":287,"h":290,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492851494516,"time":1492851494,"md5":"om7Ebw3mtbGTS0MYojArJg==","fsize":18900,"resto":122241599,"id":"D04YlbvA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122256881,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:03:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122254842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122254842<\/a><br>kek, thats a crude as fuck wordpress article, not even containing true doxes (where they work,address, phone number, etc).<br><br>When i&#039;m done it&#039;ll make that look like... well what it looks like now kek... shit.","time":1492851781,"resto":122241599,"id":"D04YlbvA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122257008,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:04:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122255978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122255978<\/a><br>Yea I get that, Angular is incredibly strict with its guidelines on how it wants it&#039;s devs to use it. <br><br>I won&#039;t be surpised if im teaching myself react\/redux in a years time kek, but for now i&#039;ll build this in Angular.","time":1492851895,"resto":122241599,"id":"D04YlbvA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

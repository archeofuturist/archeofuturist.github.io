I have been working on this since May after the Berkeley riot since I realized then the Antifags aren&#039;t going to stop.<br><br>I have been working back-end to front-end and am at 5k lines of code, so it&#039;s still in infancy but I look forward to deploying in September\/October later this year. However I need some help from an Anon that is perferably:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a full stack programmer that can maintain an application built on Nginx, MySql, PHP7.1, REST, and Angular 4x<\/span><br>The MySql DBA and Sysadmin skills are the most important, because those two skills are my weakpoints, and we know this site WILL be attacked by leftist. However this anon will mostly just be maintaining, and I plan on unit testing literally everything so he doesnt have much to maintain.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;an anon with hard tangible proof he&#039;s dedicated to the cause<\/span><br>Obviously I will vet you so this source code doesnt fall into enemy hands. Im assuming if an anon is this dedicated to be working on this that he will have a strong understanding of his ideology and be able to answer in depth questions. A timestamped MAGA hat, Trump contribution receipt, Lepen Contribution reciept, right wing insignia, right wing reading material are all valid evidence of loyalty. But the vetting process would be a long and drawn out thing. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nationality<\/span><br>Honestly, I want an anon living out of state, preferably Russia\/Eastern Europe. In the Good Ole USA, this is a tort violation at best and a Felony at worst. We need an anon hosting this on servers where we wouldn&#039;t be fucked.<br><br>If interested email me at: p1751659@mvrht.com<br><br>I won&#039;t reply for a long time, expect an email around August. Will explain more in the thread.","filename":"repositorycontributionuncensored","ext":".png","w":494,"h":192,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":97,"tim":1492839294291,"time":1492839294,"md5":"Mk46XCo1ExVIMXcUPaHlTg==","fsize":8345,"resto":0,"id":"D04YlbvA","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"working-on-doxing-application-for-antifa","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122242152,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)01:41:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122241599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122241599<\/a><br>bump","time":1492839693,"resto":122241599,"id":"XYOZbn2X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122242276,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)01:42:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Features:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;users create a &#039;perpetrator profile&#039;, including a picture with a nickname and the event they were at<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After a Perpetrator file is created anons can discuss and coordinate in a 1,000 post 4chan style rolling thread. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Users can submit evidence (file of video or image) along with text, and a moderator can then approve\/confirm that evidence and have it saved.

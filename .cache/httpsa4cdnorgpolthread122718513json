You see, the success of the early society, being as it was struggling on every front by Samnites, Etruscans and the Greeks themselves, had developed a code of morality, of civic duty and a dogmatic adherence to the family and its promulgation as all virtuous, the word vir quite literally meaning man.

The groups that did not adapt them, or didn&#039;t adapt them to a sufficient extent, no longer exist today! It creates a sort of a feedback loop there doesn&#039;t it? There has not been a single successful civilization in this world that did not revere the family, did not revere and honor their ancestors and did not place value on hard work as a moral good. There are many examples of societies that utterly lack these predispositions, who, despite being in a resource abundant environment, free from harsh weather or predatory elements, have not gone beyond hunter-gatherer or subsistence farming status. For thousands of years the same! So this virtus, virtue, expounded so forcefully within the Mos Maiorum, created a quite prosperous and weathy society. <br>But it is this success itself that leads to, again from a group adaptation perspective, a situation that no longer necessitates such stoicism and family values. When the market is full of foods from across the known world, when slaves tend the fields in massive estates instead of self reliant yeoman farmers, and primitive forms of contraception allow for prostitution and sexual shenaniganery at yet unheard of levels the Mos Maiorum are a bit of a drag, aren&#039;t they? Who&#039;s to say I should a raise a family, or toil in the fields when the Bread and Circuses keep me fat and entertained? Why should I enlist in the army now, endure the hardship and pain to fight some roudy Picts in the cold wastes of some far flung colony when we can hire Germanic Auxilia, who by the way, are taking up more and more of our Legionary positions, to do so instead?

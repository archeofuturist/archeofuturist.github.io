He&#039;s a bit shy though and doesnt really operate in the public like Richard Spencer does. <br><br>An interesting angle to reach this intellectual portion of the &quot;normies&quot; could be the environmentalist angle. I could absolutely recommend Pentti Linkolas book &quot;Can Life Prevail?&quot; where he attacks liberal, leftist, capitalist institutions alike. He also brings a good critique of democracy. Hes not a rightist per se, but our interest do tend to overlap.","time":1493125766,"resto":122718513,"id":"ga1yhl\/t","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122732116,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)09:12:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122731623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122731623<\/a><br>might as well shill for social matter while I&#039;m at it and dump some vids<br><br>http:\/\/www.socialmatter.net\/<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Zlu<wbr>MysK2B1E<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bvf<wbr>bhLLjpbI<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SEP<wbr>PFdKZbr8","time":1493125926,"resto":122718513,"id":"+GMxcwh1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122732780,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)09:19:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122731887\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122731887<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Alain de Benoist and Guillame Faye<\/span><br><br>Was about to mention Faye in the thread, his sex and deviance book is terrific, as is archeofuturism. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They are not very good speakers however, atleast not in English.<\/span><br>I&#039;ll take your word for it<br><br>I think Hoppe has made the best layman&#039;s case on why democracy doesn&#039;t work.

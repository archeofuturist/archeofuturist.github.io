The bottom line is that everything is heritable, an outcome that has taken all sides of the naturenurture debate by surprise. Irving Gottesman and I have suggested that the universal influence of genes on behavior be enshrined as the first law of behavior genetics (Turkheimer &amp; Gottesman, 1991), and at the risk of naming laws that I can take no credit for discovering, it is worth stating the nearly unanimous results of behavior genetics in a more formal manner.&quot;<br><br>The Three Laws are as follows: <br><br>? First Law. All human behavioral traits are heritable.<br><br>? Second Law. The effect of being raised in the same family is smaller than the effect of genes.<br><br>? Third Law.

First Law. All human behavioral traits are heritable.<br><br>? Second Law. The effect of being raised in the same family is smaller than the effect of genes.<br><br>? Third Law.

For example, Malcolm Gladwell once wrote that genetic theories of the IQ gap are unsupported because, based on Turkheimer\u2019s study, \u201cit\u2019s hopelessly naive to assume that the same rules apply to suburban, middle-class whites as apply to, say, urban, inner-city black families.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is quite natural to assume that Turkheimer\u2019s study was indeed about interaction between race and heritability. The twin sample used, recruited between 1959 and 1965 for the National Collaborative Perinatal Project (NCPP), was 43% white and 54% black. The inevitable inference is that as heritability is zero in poor families, and blacks are disproportionately poor, genes can hardly have anything to do with the lower mean IQ of blacks.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;However, Turkheimer et al. did not actually report results disaggregated by race. Their estimates of genetic and environmental influences on IQ were based on the whole sample. Therefore, the inference that heritability is low (if not zero) in blacks is not directly supported by the paper. As it happens, Kevin Beaver and colleagues have done a study on IQ heritability based on the same sample (Beaver et al. 2013). <\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/scienc<wbr>e\/article\/pii\/S0160289613000858<br><br>Here is a study that actually looks at what you want.

Again, negligible.<br><br>However, the bivariate (when you consider genetic height AND phenotypical height) is thrown in, it goes up to 71% (0.71). In statistics, for a study to be called STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (in other words, where there is almost no chance that the results of the study aren&#039;t just merely due to chance due to factors such as sampling, etc.), you have to pass what&#039;s called an alpha value.

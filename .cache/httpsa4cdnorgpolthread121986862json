That said, he still wants to preserve the powers the executive branch gained under the current constitution, which has been a key strategy for maintaining ruling-class influence on the political system. Beffa wants to modify this system to avoid political polarization and create a broad centrist coalition. This explains why both he and Macron call for the introduction of some degree of proportional representation into legislative elections.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Here, they clearly take inspiration from other parliamentary systems, especially Germany\u2019s. French ruling elites now see German coalitions as a source of strength for domestic capitalism. Further, they are currently preoccupied with implementing reforms that would restore their credibility in the eyes of their German counterparts. So it comes as little surprise that they want to imitate the German system.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Indeed, French reforms are the prerequisite for German ruling elites to embark on a broad reform of the European Union and the eurozone. This reform should create a system of fiscal transfers managed by a eurozone finance minister, further centralizing power at the supranational level. Macron, Beffa, and others have repeatedly made this point over the past years.<\/span>","filename":"I am the best","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":315,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1492704103800,"time":1492704103,"md5":"It+ZQqXaS3OhKCEKUkFOng==","fsize":25410,"resto":121986862,"id":"tGoAvd0m","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122008228,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:01:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121986862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121986862<\/a><br>Kek.

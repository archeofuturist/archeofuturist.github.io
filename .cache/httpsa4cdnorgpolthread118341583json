They either actually have some kind of connection with something they consider to be god, which is strange and irrational and borders on the insane, or they DON&#039;T have such a connection yet claim they do, which would be dishonest, deceitful and manipulative.. As far as I&#039;m concerned which volume of the desert trilogy or whatever other set of beliefs they subscribe to is irrelevant to that wariness, though obviously some believers are preferable to others. I find that wariness of believers tends to be greater or less dependent on whether their tendency to explode is greater or less.","time":1490522619,"resto":118341583,"id":"nLkhk2QG","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118346696,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)06:11:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118341583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118341583<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the Bible is the perfect unalterable word of God<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;except that part LOL&quot;<\/span><br><br>Christian people are not very bright.","time":1490523077,"resto":118341583,"id":"vky0n1w7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118346856,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)06:13:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118343604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118343604<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;so fresh off the boat from reddit, he doesn&#039;t even know ops can&#039;t bump their own threads<\/span>","filename":"you need to go back","ext":".gif","w":700,"h":478,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1490523213422,"time":1490523213,"md5":"nG9gGC8UvWXAxajFPgJstg==","fsize":946926,"resto":118341583,"id":"t8TOCsO8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118349096,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)06:45:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118346856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118346856<\/a><br>Never once visited reddit. <br><br>Do you have anything even vaguely approaching an argument?","time":1490525103,"resto":118341583,"id":"0iSiYHH5","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

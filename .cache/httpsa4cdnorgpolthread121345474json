You can buy shares every time your savings reach $512. It&#039;s not ideal, but it&#039;s the best that can be done if you don&#039;t have much money to play with. That&#039;s why the DRPs are important in this cases since you&#039;ll get shares bought in automatically from your dividend payments.<br><br>As for bullion, buying silver is useful for those starting out since the lower premiums are easy to reach due to the lower price of silver per ounce. In a low income situation, avoiding coins is best in order to reduce premiums. e.g. ~$30 for 1oz of silver. Once you have 80oz (~2.5kg) you can swap it for gold (you&#039;d get at least 1oz gold without using all your silver).","filename":"frosted butts - 1210762307872","ext":".jpg","w":251,"h":237,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1492342334504,"time":1492342334,"md5":"5SfoupDEOoUpsTCHeffBuQ==","fsize":15452,"resto":121345474,"id":"CpiT3odH","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121349139,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)07:32:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"What&#039;s a dumbarse with no skills, only work casual and $60k in the bank supposed to do before recession?","time":1492342335,"resto":121345474,"id":"5O60oDOa","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121349153,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)07:32:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121349071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121349071<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i&#039;m in sydney<\/span><br>I&#039;m sorry.","time":1492342343,"resto":121345474,"id":"33inHcaM","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121349172,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)07:32:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121348237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121348237<\/a><br>Mrs and I are on about 160k combined, no kids yet, 3 year old cars mostly paid out and 45k in the bank. <br><br>Still get knocked back for 500k house in brisvegas...","time":1492342363,"resto":121345474,"id":"5eRGF3PN","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121349175,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)07:32:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"LISTEN TO BOB KATTER<br><br>HE KNOWS WHY PRICES ARE HIGH IN THE LEAST DENSELY POPULATED NATION ON EARTH! <br><br>WHY DOES IT COST $500,000 TO BUY 500SQM OF DIRT IN OUTER SYDNEY?<br><br>LAND USE RESTRICTIONS!<br><br>PIC RELATED!","filename":"fixhousingprices","ext":".png","w":675,"h":911,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492342367425,"time":1492342367,"md5":"WKJCgSW1uAEwDdTUJoWG\/w==","fsize":119843,"resto":121345474,"id":"F4YtBcQq","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121349198,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)07:33:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121349139\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121349139<\/a><br>Hookers, coke and rope.","time":1492342383,"resto":121345474,"id":"33inHcaM","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121349201,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)07:33:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121345474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121345474<\/a><br><br>Currently renting, it&#039;s probably the safest place for me to be considering my wage is fuck all.<br><br>Only thing I need to worry about is if my landlord decides to sell out","time":1492342390,"resto":121345474,"id":"yOZcBSFj","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121349204,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)07:33:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121347936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121347936<\/a><br>Hmm... i wonder what happened the last time we had a boom then a great depression?","filename":"download","ext":".jpg","w":259,"h":195,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1492342391553,"time":1492342391,"md5":"QWVO1Xdl7wA1QYYCwZ1aMg==","fsize":8464,"resto":121345474,"id":"lUZOUz4L","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121349308,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)07:34:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121346392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121346392<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;American architecture<\/span>","time":1492342477,"resto":121345474,"id":"vJnXao9m","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":121349440,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)07:36:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121349198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121349198<\/a><br>I don&#039;t like drugs, barely drink, I don&#039;t want to die, but honestly part of does think taking my money to Thailand and wasting my life fucking cheap whores would be something to do while Aus is fucked.<br><br><a href=\"#p121349175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121349175<\/a><br>Bob Katter is a legend, I&#039;ve been putting KAP and Shooter and Fishers as my top 2 for 10 years now, but too many dumb cunts just put 1 for libs or labor and that&#039;s it.","time":1492342594,"resto":121345474,"id":"5O60oDOa","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121349454,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)07:36:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121345474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121345474<\/a><br><br>I know old school friends in Sydney who are buying little two bedroom apartments, borrowing another 1\/2 mill on the 1. something they&#039;ve already borrowed, just to do up the bathroom, etc, with the plan of paying just the interest for a decade or so before selling for a squidillion and getting the Fuck away from Sydney.<br><br>I think their plans are fucked and it&#039;s all going to come crashing down.","time":1492342611,"resto":121345474,"id":"mFfDSn4G","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121349480,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)07:37:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121348741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121348741<\/a><br>Lol $20 an hour.

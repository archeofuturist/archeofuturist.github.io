The show is a solid 8\/10, is deep and thought-provoking at some points but a little dull at others, but if you are a fan of WWII history, you will DEFINITELY enjoy it. Its suspenseful and action-packed, and has some Based characters like Inspector Kido and Obergruppenfuhrer John Smith","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":4240,"h":2832,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492536360764,"time":1492536360,"md5":"N4WxzFNOQv2LpFCVbfx8KQ==","fsize":514675,"resto":121706808,"id":"QOwmuiYM","country":"LB","m_img":1,"country_name":"Lebanon"},{"no":121710811,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)13:26:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121710583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121710583<\/a><br>How is the Japanese side presented?","time":1492536395,"resto":121706808,"id":"cXqCJB04","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121711014,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)13:28:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121710811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121710811<\/a><br>they are more evil than the nazis in the Show kek","time":1492536487,"resto":121706808,"id":"aRhtB+jJ","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121711141,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)13:29:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121710811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121710811<\/a><br>The military are warmongers, the civilian and police officials want peace because the Nazis have nukes while the Japs dont.","time":1492536552,"resto":121706808,"id":"QOwmuiYM","country":"LB","country_name":"Lebanon"},{"no":121711256,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)13:30:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121706808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121706808<\/a><br>non-blacked Berlin looks awesome:<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GPk<wbr>9fSLq-PI","time":1492536604,"resto":121706808,"id":"rwbANnhl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

I&#039;m an agnostic christian myself. I understand that I cannot know either way, but also understand that the christian way of life, even if there is no God, is the best way of life for humans. Common Filth is a good podcast to listen to if you&#039;re right leaning and want to understand Christianity as a philosophy. Also try reading some Greek stoic philosophy like Cicero in order to understand what is natural and how it results in a better way of life, Christianity basically is an update of Greek stoic philosophy.","time":1493300679,"resto":123035727,"id":"4dTTjm1E","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123037526,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)09:44:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123035727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123035727<\/a><br>Wow what the fuck OP.

It radiates, and cannot be disposed of ordinarily. If you find yourself clinging to old phones and electronics, it isn&#039;t a coincidence. It is a catch-22, one must immune to the effects of something to throw it out(psychologically and physically), but trying to grab and rid yourself of a battery will cause yourself to attract to it and suddenly wonder &quot;perhaps i actually need it?&quot; Fundamentally wrong, you are. <br>Wrap it in foil, whilst wearing rubber gloves and rubber soled shoes. In fact wrap everything with a battery in foil as described and suddenly the interference and chaos of your life will vanish. you can finally throw out the clutter. <br><br>-your mind works as follows: Things I hate (list of items) things i tolerate, things that annoy me etc <br>stop thinking that you think in complete sentences and optimize your mind to the fullest. <br><br>-anyone who realizes that the soil is not organic, mostly, but rather dead materia and recycled things, can be a farmer. The soil must be tilled and cycled constantly so life can grow out of the ashes of dinosaurs past. <br><br>-Go to a greenhouse or one who peddles in plants and find the succulent cactuses. pinch off a bud\/leaf\/thingy (aka steal) and take it home for free. Succulents grow by following over in death and budding from said &quot;carcass&quot;. <br>Let them dry out for 3 days on a paper towel, then place upon soil and let root. slice cactus and treat burns btw<br>(Editors note: as with all thievery, buy something for like a dollar if only to remove suspicion from all the cactus in your pockets.)<br><br>-turning lead into gold is great and all, but if you find yourself starving whilst sitting amongst a collection of valuables, &quot;burn thy cash for warmth&quot;.","filename":"ffff","ext":".png","w":750,"h":318,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":106,"tim":1493447461379,"time":1493447461,"md5":"AmvkH7YnNBi\/XNsQV3zWvA==","fsize":552180,"resto":0,"id":"ruxNc9Mr","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"prove-thy-wisdom-found-through-tinfoilery","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":123305421,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)02:31:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123305384\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123305384<\/a><br><br><br>-alcohol is how men can unleash emotional repression in a social context. even if you can&#039;t get drunk, just sitting across from someone who can and drinking the same drink as them is fun for all. trust in society has been built this way for millenia. <br><br>-learning who to trust and who not to trust is the only knowledge you need to know. <br><br>-when counting coins, do it in front of a mirror, it will seem like more money . <br><br>-know religion. god doesn&#039;t exist (or does he?) but those who believe he does will most certainly kill you if you offend them greatly enough. tread carefully, know your scripture. <br><br>-academia is the sophistry scam, plain and simple. get your degree, but don&#039;t waste time searching for pleasure or meaning in the process. Do the work in the timely 4 years, so you don&#039;t end up spending so much time in college you contemplate graduate school or teaching in academia. <br><br>-the best student in the class is a girl, almost always. <br><br>-a man who knows hard labor has the obvious solution to that problem that has been metaphyscially pestering you for so long. ask and ye shall recieve, the construction worker will never judge you. <br><br>-an aesthete prefers to be left alone, but he is actually mother natures son, a weirdo and lover of beauty who is never truly alone. <br><br>-Be a fisherman in all that you do. <br><br>-men want to win. women want to win something. <br><br>-only asians can attain enlightment, and only non-asians can know christ. <br>I know because when i met a buddha, whilst knowing christ, i never shared so much laughter in being wrong. <br><br>-practice is a vow of silence. if you never shut up in society, why would you shut up in your head? shut up and stop talking out there, so you can shut up in here. then you&#039;ll get better at something. <br><br>-Charity is: &quot;give a bowl of rice to the beggar, for he is god.&quot;","time":1493447487,"resto":123305384,"id":"ruxNc9Mr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

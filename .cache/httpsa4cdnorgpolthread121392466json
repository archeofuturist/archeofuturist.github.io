Which position do you think is more worth it? Border Patrol Agent is a more dangerous job but filled with excitement, and I believe has a better &quot;badge&quot;, but with CBPO, it is a lot more safe, better locations are offered, and offers better pay in some other ways. If anybody here works for either infant agency, your insight would be heavily appreciated.","filename":"IMG_3072","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":427,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492366969686,"time":1492366969,"md5":"+d536PnDUdwdW+yH8rOwyw==","fsize":97592,"resto":0,"id":"zwfSmevE","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-pol-right-now-ive-been-thinking-about-2","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121393409,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)14:29:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121392466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121392466<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;america<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;borders<\/span><br><br>lol","filename":"1492250295066","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":170,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492367378666,"time":1492367378,"md5":"wdbm8jDo0+9JFp9AgIPC0w==","fsize":8843,"resto":121392466,"id":"oGnIpBiH","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

No one needs a commercial truck this large.<br><br>2. The Founding Fathers never envisioned large commercial trucks, and did not intend for people to drive them.<br><br>3. These \u201cassault trucks\u201d are designed for killing large numbers of people quickly, and that is their only use.<br><br>4. We need a \u201cno truck\u201d list immediately, one that does not require due process to get on or off.<br><br>5. No where in the Constitution does it mention the freedom to own these killing devices called trucks.<br><br>6. Large commercial trucks should only be owned by the police, military, or politicians, NOT normal citizens, who can use horses.<br><br>7. We already have licensing, registration, titles, inspection, and multiple taxes on large commercial vehicles, and STILL they are used for mass killing. Enough is enough. We must ban them entirely.<br><br>8. We must follow Australia\u2019s example \u2013 we must have a massive government buy-back of all trucks currently owned by American citizens, then, they must be destroyed.<br><br>9. We must empower the police and military to go door-to-door to forcibly remove these \u201cassault trucks\u201d. Deadly force is reasonable when \u201cdisarming\u201d people of these killing devices.<br><br>10. If it will save the life of even a single child, we must rid our society of trucks.<br><br>11. And lastly, we must continue to resettle enormous numbers of Muslims throughout the United States, primarily in rural, white, Christian areas.","time":1491659404,"resto":120130253,"id":"Z75EvUrL","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120133701,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:53:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120133292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120133292<\/a><br>Why stop at trucks?

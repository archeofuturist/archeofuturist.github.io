Instead of a king or a president you just have a figurehead, like a Grand Duke, who gets elected from among the lords for a set term. That eliminates a number of problems with democracy being able to be subverted by foreign infiltrators, while still preventing any one person from achieving absolute power. <br><br>The main problem is titles.

Etc. etc.<br><br>You have to have an efficient way of promoting talent, as monarchies typically don&#039;t, which means people have to be promoted to the aristocracy from the lower class as a matter of course.

I personally see it as some sort of unholy mixture between the Old Regime and post-Napoleonic modern statism. Here&#039;s the thing: bad kings happen, history is full of them. But under traditional monarchy there were plenty of checks and balances to keep things more or less working.<br><br>The most important of these checks was the aristocracy: they were the actual owners of the land, not the crown. If the monarch went bad, aristocrats would revolt and try to either secede or claim the crown for themselves. The monarch was nothing without noble support, and the nobles gained legitimacy by supporting a respected crown.<br><br>Another factor was the Church. The power of the Pope was nothing to laugh at and only the most powerful kings dared to stand up against the Church. This seems funny nowadays, but back then a word from the Pope meant half your kingdom went up in flames by enraged Catholics.<br><br>A enlightened monarchy gets rid of all those checks and balances and leaves you in the hands of a despot, not a monarch.<br><br>Constitutional monarchism is a charade, a sham.

However I still believe that it would be best to have such a system of aristocratic power but without heredity of the power, since it is very possible for a bloodline to become fucked up, or at least to have an incompetent king (thinking about Louis XVI here, he almost didn&#039;t care about the power and was a shitty king because of it). For such a sort of feudal aristocracy that would generally be, de facto, hereditary, with people in power making their own children the fittest to rule through education, but a system that would still allow for people to be replaced if they no longer are the fittest rulers, such a system would be better in my opinion.","time":1490910081,"resto":118963635,"id":"B4Y9b5Ay","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118973321,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:45:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"(First born) monarchies allow God (if He exists) to influence the politics of a country.

It&#039;s no surprise that liberal democracy always ends up devolving into socialism and hedonism.<br><br>Furthermore democracy does not concern itself with the interests of the few or the individual, preferring to address majorities and big organised political groups. Our rights as individuals, both political or concerning property, are nothing against the will of the many (or the state).<br><br>This leads us to another of the main critiques against democracy: a democratic system cares about what you think. In order to perpetuate the system you need to ensure the citizens don&#039;t vote it away, that&#039;s why we have a public school system and the media is in bed with power. This is something Moldbug referred to as The Cathedral, but I think he wasted a really cool name.<br><br>Rights under a feudal system come from tradition and law and no monarch can take them away; a monarch cares not about what you think but about what you do, and the fact that a monarch rules for a long time and wants his sons to inherit the throne ensures he always keeps the long picture in mind rather than 4-year election cycles.","filename":"1486838452669","ext":".jpg","w":1400,"h":928,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1490907178620,"time":1490907178,"md5":"iHhdQPwI5YasaPWfws840w==","fsize":129322,"resto":118963635,"id":"QYdWqlP6","country":"ES","m_img":1,"country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118967185,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:54:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118963985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118963985<\/a><br>Oh boy","time":1490907278,"resto":118963635,"id":"fHvqIEDX","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":118967490,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:56:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1490907413,"resto":118963635,"id":"Dz1DpqvF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118967529,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:57:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118966982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118966982<\/a><br>What about enlightened and constitutional monarchism?","time":1490907434,"resto":118963635,"id":"fHvqIEDX","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":118967695,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:58:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;d become a monarchist if I could be the King","time":1490907505,"resto":118963635,"id":"+jo0cZxF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118967721,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:58:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118963635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118963635<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why not become a monarchist \/pol?<\/span><br>Because it implies someone, who isn&#039;t you or me, will be at the top of the food chain in perpetuity. &quot;Divine mandate&quot; has also worn out its welcome in the minds of most.

Instead of a king or a president you just have a figurehead, like a Grand Duke, who gets elected from among the lords for a set term. That eliminates a number of problems with democracy being able to be subverted by foreign infiltrators, while still preventing any one person from achieving absolute power. <br><br>The main problem is titles. How does one become a &#039;lord&#039;? Is it a reward for military\/civic service? Are they inheritable? How long do you keep it? Who is in charge of distributing them? What benefits do they provide? Etc. etc.<br><br>You have to have an efficient way of promoting talent, as monarchies typically don&#039;t, which means people have to be promoted to the aristocracy from the lower class as a matter of course. If you don&#039;t, then power tends to be concentrated, and then the number of &quot;new&quot; aristocrats becomes fewer and fewer, which leads to stagnation and the State&#039;s ultimate decay.","time":1490907517,"resto":118963635,"id":"GSYmaeFG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118967907,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:00:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118963635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118963635<\/a><br>And if the king is a tard or a communist\/sjw what?

I personally see it as some sort of unholy mixture between the Old Regime and post-Napoleonic modern statism. Here&#039;s the thing: bad kings happen, history is full of them. But under traditional monarchy there were plenty of checks and balances to keep things more or less working.<br><br>The most important of these checks was the aristocracy: they were the actual owners of the land, not the crown. If the monarch went bad, aristocrats would revolt and try to either secede or claim the crown for themselves. The monarch was nothing without noble support, and the nobles gained legitimacy by supporting a respected crown.<br><br>Another factor was the Church. The power of the Pope was nothing to laugh at and only the most powerful kings dared to stand up against the Church. This seems funny nowadays, but back then a word from the Pope meant half your kingdom went up in flames by enraged Catholics.<br><br>A enlightened monarchy gets rid of all those checks and balances and leaves you in the hands of a despot, not a monarch.<br><br>Constitutional monarchism is a charade, a sham. A monarch under such political system is nothing but either a puppet of the state or a public figure not much different to the Reality TV celebrities that plague media. We monarchist don&#039;t just want a king, we want the feudal system back. Not out of romanticism, but out of respect to our own nature.

You had to commit treason to win. You couldn&#039;t just lose like usual and learn your lesson that shitty candidates means shitty turnouts, like with Palin. You turned a shitty candidate into a winner who still lost the popular vote by selling us out to our enemy.<br><br>In the process, you turned a bunch of white liberal nerds into an army. You provoked a sense of patriotism that we haven&#039;t seen in decades out of these keyboard warriors. These hundred pound white knights put down their mice and picked up baseball bats and helmets and came face to face with neo-nazis who spend all day pumping steroids and lifting weights because they have no lives or intelligence. <br><br>And the skinny liberal nerds are winning.<br><br>They&#039;re successfully preventing the spread of conservative AIDS by silencing the apologists and traitors who try to normalize Trump. You don&#039;t fucking stand a chance. <br><br>The collective physical and intellectual armies are winning and it won&#039;t end until Trump is sitting in a court room crying when all of his assets are confiscated and he&#039;s put in an orange jumper for life.<br><br>You lose. Like always.","filename":"f75c1f303c3f7d12ecfdbcb1ae79971f","ext":".jpg","w":236,"h":236,"tn_w":236,"tn_h":236,"tim":1493352908828,"time":1493352908,"md5":"KzzZV7AbIqJwtL+4L3ZkeA==","fsize":12662,"resto":0,"id":"a8lP9RKt","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"all-you-had-to-do-was-play-fair-and-lose-but-no","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":6,"unique_ips":8},{"no":123145407,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:17:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"God damn you&#039;re a fag dude.","time":1493353051,"resto":123145094,"id":"0okm\/p3U","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123145817,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:21:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123145094\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123145094<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You had to commit treason to win.<\/span><br>lol, so hillary should have won? youre thinking small OP. were bringing the whole fucking thing down.","filename":"1493250733446","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493353263662,"time":1493353263,"md5":"beOKLK2OJBaNRjffh+p9wg==","fsize":217971,"resto":123145094,"id":"5VhrJjX1","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123145939,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:21:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123145817\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123145817<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump literally 0 for 10<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Washington is fully encased in swamp<\/span><br><br>You&#039;re not doing shit, you just made it worse.","time":1493353315,"resto":123145094,"id":"a8lP9RKt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123146083,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:23:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123145939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123145939<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you just made it worse.<\/span><br>exactly","filename":"bvgh","ext":".jpg","w":1694,"h":2560,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493353385644,"time":1493353385,"md5":"3dprCSgwvP9tMIwGef4VHg==","fsize":2058140,"resto":123145094,"id":"5VhrJjX1","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123146128,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:23:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123145094\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123145094<\/a><br>did somebody say shitty candidate?","filename":"1454135008148","ext":".jpg","w":571,"h":355,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":77,"tim":1493353411188,"time":1493353411,"md5":"Ae+8LwxKsV11px8JQpy0gQ==","fsize":64100,"resto":123145094,"id":"6oPWuyQX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123146314,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:24:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123145094\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123145094<\/a><br>Don&#039;t you get yet?

Neither can liberalism can be approached -- as some people do -- as a conversation conducted among philosophers over the centuries. Instead, liberalism must be understood, I think, as a political and social doctrine and a movement GROUNDED IN THE DISTINCTIVE CULTURE AND TRACEABLE TO SPECIFIC HISTORICAL CONDITION. THAT CULTURE IS THE WEST. A EUROPE THAT ROSE IN COMMUNION WITH THE BISHOP OF ROME. THE HISTORICAL CONDITIONS WERE THOSE OF THE MIDDLE AGES.

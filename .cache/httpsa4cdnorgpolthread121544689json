But it did evolve. I&#039;m not offering any argument that liberalism sprang up at a certain point complete, fully matured. Neither can liberalism can be approached -- as some people do -- as a conversation conducted among philosophers over the centuries. Instead, liberalism must be understood, I think, as a political and social doctrine and a movement GROUNDED IN THE DISTINCTIVE CULTURE AND TRACEABLE TO SPECIFIC HISTORICAL CONDITION. THAT CULTURE IS THE WEST. A EUROPE THAT ROSE IN COMMUNION WITH THE BISHOP OF ROME. THE HISTORICAL CONDITIONS WERE THOSE OF THE MIDDLE AGES. THE HISTORY OF LIBERALISM IS ROOTED IN WHAT ECONOMIC HISTORIANS CALL &quot;THE EUROPEAN MIRACLE&quot;.<\/span><br><br>Historicist libertarians master race.","filename":"Ralph Raico 2005","ext":".jpg","w":240,"h":299,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492449217411,"time":1492449217,"md5":"0RLqG1mObGyzQkQQBJAUlg==","fsize":9952,"resto":121544689,"id":"cId51Cxz","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121550469,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)13:14:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121550022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121550022<\/a><br>True, I didn&#039;t think about that<br>However, there will be free-loaders who can view the site without paying","time":1492449266,"resto":121544689,"id":"w672DkDc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

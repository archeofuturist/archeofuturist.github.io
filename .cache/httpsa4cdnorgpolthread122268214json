Roosevelt wouldn&#039;t allow any photos of dead American troops released, until he felt the American public was getting complacent, and they published dead Marines on a beach in New Guinea. So yeah, probably would have reported on it, but possible they wouldn&#039;t have actually shown it. <br><br>I&#039;m not sure about the UK, but here most of the population are a bunch of soft cunts that like to pretend like they care about the rest of the world, but don&#039;t want to be confronted with the reality of it. Our movies are full of blood and gore, and yet most news stations won&#039;t show anything with real death and violence. They&#039;ll report on it sure, but I remember a few years ago the FCC and the public freaked when Fox accidentally aired some criminal blowing his own head off on live tv.","filename":"1491902897816","ext":".png","w":679,"h":429,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492864101199,"time":1492864101,"md5":"YeI1M++yjv9VhfqjCf2YkQ==","fsize":622333,"resto":122268214,"id":"pKUgv+nB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

I never knew regular treatments from a cannabis compound could stop a little girl. Who would have 10-15 epileptic seizures a day to just one episode a month. There has also be other discoveries of cannabis with cancer treatment. Yet the USA and it criminalistic laws against cannabis forbids those kinds of treatments in the USA because Uncle SAM wants to tax people for DOCTOR visits and Government DOPE medications.

I read Lenin&#039;s pedantic explanations for why establishing his totalitarian dictatorship was an essential step in the move towards the abolition of the State, and definitely not just a way to keep him well supplied with roast beef and suckling pig.<br><br>You know who I haven&#039;t read? Hoppe. Friedman. Sowell. Hayek. I sure as fuck have never read Rand. I don&#039;t bother exposing myself to right-wing ideology because it&#039;s all self evident. I&#039;ve never had to have a right wing idea explained to me more than once for it to make perfect sense, but I had to read the entire amazon fucking rainforest to come to even the beginnings of understanding the appeal of Communism. I had to broaden my horizons to such an absurd degree that even when I shut it off I don&#039;t think democracy is a good idea anymore. My brain is like the floppiest roastie cunt ever battered by BBC on a black sofa, except old bearded Germans were the ones fucking me instead of niggers.<br><br>I&#039;ve read Marx, you little faggot. Oh my stars and garters have i read fucking Marx, and it was the most colossal waste of my time I&#039;ve ever indulged in. Never have I read a more content-free volume than the Communist Manifesto.

It runs a &quot;protection&quot; racket and fleeces the population to protect it from enemies it creates so it can justify fleecing the population for still more cash. Run by bureaucrats that ultimately try to secure whatever wealth and power they can while they are in power, which means fleecing the population still further.

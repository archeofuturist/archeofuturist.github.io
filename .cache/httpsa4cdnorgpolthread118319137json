Seeing that AnCap has risen back up in recent months and NatSoc has fallen I will represent the NatSoc arguments.<br><br>Problems with AnCapitalism<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are no boundaries set for those who desire great power withen a nation, allowing limitless manipulation of the populace.<\/span><br>We can see this in what was late eighteenth century America. Rockefeller, Carnegie, and J. P. Morgan were making what would be hundreds of billions a day through manipulation of their workers. Their workers would live in towns these people would built but have no room to progress forward. People were exposed to harsh conditions and payed very little, no matter how hard they worked. Everything was owned by the conglomerates; the houses, the stores, the factories, it was basically a small city state. Along with this there was no room at all for competition because the monopolies bought them all up, claimed all the resources, and bankrupted their competitors. <br>Only when did the United States realize that these monopolists were gaining more control and lobbying the government it became a concern. Here the Sherman Anti-Trust act comes into play and breaks up monopolies and allows competition to compete. The world does much better without monopolies just viewing people as a recourse, while basically enslaving them and putting a false facade that there might be hope you will progress and become the next millionaire, but with a system like that in place, the millionaires make sure they stay rich and the poor stay poor. It isn&#039;t always a matter of intelligence but of the willingness to not view another as a human but as something to exploit.","filename":"Ancap_vs_NatSoc","ext":".png","w":1094,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":68,"tim":1490502358663,"time":1490502358,"md5":"yPIcoW4HxpB8a3y9QVNTfA==","fsize":27324,"resto":0,"id":"pmub+yKv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ancap-v-natsoc-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118319414,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:29:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;lobbying the government<\/span><br><br>What government?","time":1490502555,"resto":118319137,"id":"vYPMjifC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

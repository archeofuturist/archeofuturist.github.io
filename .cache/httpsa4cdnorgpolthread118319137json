Seeing that AnCap has risen back up in recent months and NatSoc has fallen I will represent the NatSoc arguments.<br><br>Problems with AnCapitalism<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are no boundaries set for those who desire great power withen a nation, allowing limitless manipulation of the populace.<\/span><br>We can see this in what was late eighteenth century America. Rockefeller, Carnegie, and J. P. Morgan were making what would be hundreds of billions a day through manipulation of their workers. Their workers would live in towns these people would built but have no room to progress forward. People were exposed to harsh conditions and payed very little, no matter how hard they worked. Everything was owned by the conglomerates; the houses, the stores, the factories, it was basically a small city state. Along with this there was no room at all for competition because the monopolies bought them all up, claimed all the resources, and bankrupted their competitors. <br>Only when did the United States realize that these monopolists were gaining more control and lobbying the government it became a concern. Here the Sherman Anti-Trust act comes into play and breaks up monopolies and allows competition to compete. The world does much better without monopolies just viewing people as a recourse, while basically enslaving them and putting a false facade that there might be hope you will progress and become the next millionaire, but with a system like that in place, the millionaires make sure they stay rich and the poor stay poor. It isn&#039;t always a matter of intelligence but of the willingness to not view another as a human but as something to exploit.","filename":"Ancap_vs_NatSoc","ext":".png","w":1094,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":68,"tim":1490502358663,"time":1490502358,"md5":"yPIcoW4HxpB8a3y9QVNTfA==","fsize":27324,"resto":0,"id":"pmub+yKv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ancap-v-natsoc-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":31,"images":6,"unique_ips":13},{"no":118319414,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:29:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;lobbying the government<\/span><br><br>What government?","time":1490502555,"resto":118319137,"id":"vYPMjifC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118319647,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:31:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118319137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118319137<\/a><br>Problems with AnCapitalism:<br>Creates a power void which will be filled by authoritarian people","time":1490502709,"resto":118319137,"id":"9a+WR1AR","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":118319842,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:33:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Whats so great about NatSoc?<\/span><br>National socialism acts as a collective uplifting everyone, making sure everyone is working and not just making life worse for another. National socialism works towards a brighter, happier, and progressive society. Under the NSDAP millions were employed within the first year, and unemployment was slashed in half, while providing a well off life for all Germans. The economy of Germany grew roughly at 11% throughout the entire depression right up to the war when Germany had to switch to industrial military focus. People such as Werner Von Braun might have taken men to the moon more than a decade earlier if France and Britain had let them sort out their territorial disputes. The German government actually reported surplus and not deficit too, with an astounding level of happiness. The NSDAP issues labor based non inflating currency, the reichmark. The manipulation of markets was gotten rid of so the economy could grow gracefully without self interested people.","time":1490502828,"resto":118319137,"id":"pmub+yKv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118320164,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:37:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118319414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118319414<\/a><br>The one created by powerful(rich) people","time":1490503040,"resto":118319137,"id":"pmub+yKv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118320606,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:42:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Problems tih AnCapitalism<\/span><br>Roads<br>You can&#039;t enforce the NAP<br>You&#039;re a fat neckbeard and will have your shit stolen by niggers the second we flip the switch<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Problems with NatSoc<\/span><br>Literally Hitler","time":1490503323,"resto":118319137,"id":"AupeofRx","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":118320722,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:43:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;national socialism<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;socialism<\/span>","filename":"1483212600757","ext":".png","w":2441,"h":2362,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1490503398291,"time":1490503398,"md5":"I\/eng7RmDhNJ21yQiWgaDA==","fsize":1611630,"resto":118319137,"id":"RL78lAQB","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118320758,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:43:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118320606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118320606<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hitler<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Problem<\/span><br><br>Hitler unironically did nothing wrong","time":1490503417,"resto":118319137,"id":"Cn0HOFsO","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118320821,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:44:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;not combining the best of both worlds<\/span>","filename":"ee0ac6eb7eb0fe38f22a494c08d1394a","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":902,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490503455276,"time":1490503455,"md5":"awpwEA6P\/RQh0WYqdC2fBQ==","fsize":90070,"resto":118319137,"id":"DTHCa7gB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118321065,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:46:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Problems tih AnCapitalism<\/span><br>Cartels<br>Monopolies in finite goods systems<br>Private for-profit courts are inherently biased<br>Will never be implemented (arguably not really a problem)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;problems with NatSoc<\/span><br>Will never be implemented again","time":1490503618,"resto":118319137,"id":"H3GiloHH","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118321069,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:47:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118320722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118320722<\/a><br>Socialism just in name, pic related.

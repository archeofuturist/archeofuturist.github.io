According to ancient Jewish custom, Mary could have been betrothed at about 12 years old. Mary had five sons, Jesus (her first born), Joseph, James, Jude, and Simon and daughters (who aren&#039;t named). Mary was way underage (by today standards) when Jesus was born. Why are people so against older men marrying &amp; having sex with young underage women when God is evidently okay with it.","filename":"mary","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":290,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":181,"tim":1492117964280,"time":1492117964,"md5":"bAXKnsRnxBetW3BPhT6\/eQ==","fsize":13872,"resto":0,"id":"iSUPjN8f","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"christianity-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

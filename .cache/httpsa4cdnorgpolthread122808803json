At least, not in a statistically significant way - there will be the small minority that take up the MAGA flag almost ironically, just to put one over on the Democratic establishment that apparently cast them overboard. Most of these political refugees will end up turning to third parties, and if Bernie ran under the Green or Libertarian flag in 2020 (or even a newly established Progressive Workers&#039; Party or some such), it&#039;s very possible he would reach the vote threshold for that party to get real federal funding. That would be a very healthy thing for the overall American political climate, as it would break the monotony of our two party - no more, no less - system. It would also absolutely guarantee a Trump victory in 2020, but that&#039;s already extremely likely if the political left continues to repeatedly double down on their rhetoric every time that rhetoric fails to achieve its goal.

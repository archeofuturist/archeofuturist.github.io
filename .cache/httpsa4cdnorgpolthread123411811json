A couple 4chan boards, definitely (for me, that is).<br>- You watch other projects and take the best from them.<br>- You create your own kick-ass product, as well as marketing materials.<br>- You go and communicate with your target audience. Gotta have a demo and catchy freebies for them.<br>- You talk with people, answer their questions, keep the topics alive, etc., etc.<br>- And you make those UPDATES constant and good to the best of your abilities.<br>- Monetize this stuff through whatever model you&#039;ve chosen.<br><br>Also, living in Russia helps a lot. Goods here cost pretty much the same as in the US, but services are many, many times cheaper, as well as real estate for the most part. The median wage here is less than $6000\/year.

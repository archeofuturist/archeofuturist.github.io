Besides, it&#039;s a pain is the ass to argue with them because apparently having more center-leaning views makes me satan to them, and liberals can&#039;t meme to save their lives. I have started to agree with you about things like Muslims and illegal immigration, except maybe not the (serious) racist shit, Trump and climate change. I&#039;ve been lurking for a while and I think you glorious faggots have finally won me over. Thanks retards, my lib friends now hate me and I couldn&#039;t be happier. If people really can&#039;t continue being your friend over some minor political bullshit, they were shit friends anyways.","filename":"1490854466644","ext":".jpg","w":263,"h":191,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":181,"tim":1490937210756,"time":1490937210,"md5":"IOVg5QSG556xjntuZ206EQ==","fsize":13905,"resto":0,"id":"ssqOeB2P","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"libfag-reporting-ive-been-having-a-lot-of","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

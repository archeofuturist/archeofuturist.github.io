I&#039;ve tried to show the relative location of where the chemical laced missile landed and the nearby warehouse and grain silos that were said by Russia to contain toxic gas that leaked when the place was bombed. The warehouse as you can see is empty (you might not be able to make it out in the video but there was even a volleyball net at the far end of it). The silos were similarly empty except for some soil and a little animal dung as far as I could tell from the smell. As you can see some of the silos are destroyed, but they are on the far side of the explosion. The ones closer to the explosion are undamaged, which indicates it wasn&#039;t damaged in the chemical bombing. Locals (and satellite imagery) say it was bombed a while ago. There is also rubble around the warehouse from a prior bombing run, but it wasn&#039;t destroyed when I was there. I think the area was further damaged in bombings since the chemical attack. This was its state when I went in.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.FACEKIKE.com\/kareem.sha<wbr>heen\/posts\/10154257460555583","time":1491919035,"resto":120598594,"id":"U5kjAd3m","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120600430,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)09:57:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120599951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120599951<\/a><br>Eh, I like the way you think greecebro<br><br>Anyway, Souran when?

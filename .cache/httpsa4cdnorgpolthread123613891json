Sailer doesn&#039;t get about enough on here: he has more influence on actual policy makers than all of those youtubers put together.<br>http:\/\/nymag.com\/daily\/intelligence<wbr>r\/2017\/04\/steve-sailer-invented-ide<wbr>ntity-politics-for-the-alt-right.ht<wbr>ml<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;And he\u2019s not entirely wrong. Sailer\u2019s influence is impossible to understand without recognizing how far what he refers to as the conventional wisdom has drifted from the common sense of a large part of the country, creating a demand for people who are indifferent to the castigation that normally deters the airing of sometimes wrong, sometimes merely inconvenient ideas. \u201cIn 2017, I\u2019m the voice of reason and moderation,\u201d Sailer told us, in reference to the open ethnonationalists to his right and cosmopolitan liberals to his left. That isn\u2019t true \u2014 Sailer is a perceptive thinker, but his views on race, for which he will inevitably be best-known, still represent the more resentful end of white opinion. Yet if current trends toward partisan and racial polarization continue unabated, Sailerism may indeed come to represent a kind of uneasy center, flanked by identitarian leftism on one side and raw white nationalism on the other. This is a future we should try to avoid.&quot;<\/span><br><br>There&#039;s also a relatively sympathetic piece on neoreaction by Andrew Sullivan in the same issue.<br>http:\/\/nymag.com\/daily\/intelligence<wbr>r\/2017\/04\/andrew-sullivan-why-the-r<wbr>eactionary-right-must-be-taken-seri<wbr>ously.html<br><br>Not gonna archive, these articles actually almost deserve our clicks.","filename":"79E6C5A3-C8AF-417A-9664-A1BA88D9116B-855-000000CC96E43F1E","ext":".jpg","w":710,"h":473,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493641122640,"time":1493641122,"md5":"DcfKclV8z\/CY5lys+5nO4A==","fsize":33959,"resto":0,"id":"3T\/rwpSV","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ny-mag-names-the-sailer","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123616201,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)08:41:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bumping for interest.","time":1493642505,"resto":123613891,"id":"3T\/rwpSV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123617254,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)08:52:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123613891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123613891<\/a><br>Bump","time":1493643123,"resto":123613891,"id":"7QjuAnRx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123618023,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)08:59:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123613891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123613891<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;racial pride and &quot;identitarianism&quot; is great except when whites do it.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;these articles actually almost deserve our clicks<\/span><br><br>lolno","time":1493643571,"resto":123613891,"id":"O95gLPIg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

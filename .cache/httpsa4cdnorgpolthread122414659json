In particular, basic healthcare insurance has issues with asymmetric information that leads to the riskiest groups not getting insured unless the same price is enforced to everyone.<br><br>In short, if public intervention can fix an issue caused by excess of lack of externatilies, or asymmetric information it&#039;s sensible to do so. When it comes to other policies it&#039;s more debatable. Protectionism can be good assuming it&#039;s done temporarily for a new industry so they can learn how to become efficient enough to compete, but those policies very rarely stay temporary because the new industries tend to become lobbying groups.","time":1492950037,"resto":122414659,"id":"Tg6xWPvL","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122418971,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)08:41:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122417113\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122417113<\/a><br><br>You can find a lot on him, it&#039;s a lot to cover.

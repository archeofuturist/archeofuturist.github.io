He&#039;s into art, he&#039;s a huge faggot (literally), and for some reason a guy like me, someone who grew up in a devout Catholic family with super conservative friends and family all around me, actually gets along great with this guy. <br><br>We get into super heated debates and will spend hours every night we hangout getting drunk and challenging each others world view. We literally agree on almost nothing at all, he knows all of my anti-immigrant and anti-gay opinions, but the debates make for a great time. <br><br>You just have to be educated and able to argue honestly, and this type of political discourse is great. I wish this could happen withing our government and in political discourse everywhere, we don&#039;t need to agree, but it&#039;s good to have open debates with these people","filename":"1479011098221","ext":".png","w":749,"h":771,"tn_w":242,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491353504287,"time":1491353504,"md5":"9R8hPX58Jtos\/XhJI6tC2Q==","fsize":175556,"resto":0,"id":"wTYdpoZ0","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"anyone-else-like-having-liberal-friends","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119545488,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:14:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119543128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119543128<\/a><br>It leads to meaningful conversations, and extends beyond the usual banality of petty small talk. Politics is in the realm of &quot;deep ideas&quot; (and indeed leads into other ones like philosophy etc.) but it&#039;s more &quot;accessible&quot; than most others from that category. No one wants to bust into a deep debate about religion, but people wear their politics more on their sleeve and are willing to talk about it.","time":1491354891,"resto":119543128,"id":"6RIBXzF2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119545936,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:19:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119545488\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119545488<\/a><br>Yeah it&#039;s just that so many liberals are so irrational nowadays, this type of discourse is impossible, but the ones who you can truly actually have debates with and know their stuff aren&#039;t bad","time":1491355162,"resto":119543128,"id":"wTYdpoZ0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119547305,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:32:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119543128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119543128<\/a><br>I&#039;m from Chicago and went to private Catholic school my whole life.

Getting a job that pays over a certain amount will mean they lose their welfare. Will this lead to people only getting shitty\/parttime jobs, thus not fixing the problem? What other problems may arise from this?","filename":"for lazy peoble","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491989886879,"time":1491989886,"md5":"v1+tnRRRqD4+bi3I+h8HZw==","fsize":63787,"resto":0,"id":"9\/5VsNrS","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpill-me-on-the-basic-income","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120737868,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:45:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120737408\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120737408<\/a><br>The claim is that Basic Income is needed as society automates<br>The reality is that there won&#039;t be a massive loss of jobs.

I mean, it was ok, but it was hard as fuck labor, for not very great pay, and my boss had basically lied to me about what my wage would be, and when I would get raises. I left my first job after HS to go with him, and it ended up being a MUCH harder job, and my pay was less... and didn&#039;t rise fast enough. I could barely afford my rent. Food.

They seem to forget that the pioneering nations in missile defense, counter nuclear operations and precision strikes are the ones they&#039;re adamant on pissing off. <br><br>To anyone thinking Korea will use nukes at the word go here&#039;s a bit of information for you: For a country to use nuclear weapons against another sovereign state there is a critical requirement - Delivery. The country wishing to deliver a nuclear payload must have a reliable means of getting the nuke from them to the target. Most people like to think of ICBMs so I&#039;ll start off with that one.","filename":"IMG_7210","ext":".png","w":2000,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491976275165,"time":1491976275,"md5":"M9GKogtLM6uuu\/aKF0BxEg==","fsize":28482,"resto":0,"id":"CM7Bmw98","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"declaration-of-war","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":3,"unique_ips":4},{"no":120721297,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:51:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"An ICBM, or Inter-Continental Ballistic Missile, is a missile that is fired into low orbit where it floats around the planet until it gets to a good point over its target where it can release its warhead payload\/s (Yes, there are missiles with 2, 6 or even 12 individual nukes in them - each capable of leveling a medium sized city.) And while it is in that state of orbit it is incredibly vulnerable to being disabled, via many means. (The latest toy for this is legit a giant laser pen. Fires a big ass beam of IR radiation at the missile and burns out all its electronics so it&#039;s a dud in the sky (or space in this case.)) So if Korea were to try out an ICBM and fire it at ye olde land of the free it would (If it even got into orbit with a big ass &quot;made in korea&quot; sticker on the side) be immediately neutralised and rendered useless, it&#039;s trajectory would then be calculated and based upon where it was estimated to land a further response may be necessary. (Most likely a missile to break it up into tiny pieces. There&#039;d be minimal radioactive fallout as that is a main byproduct of the breakdown reaction in a fission bomb, not so much from the fundamental components.)","time":1491976301,"resto":120721269,"id":"CM7Bmw98","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120721333,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:52:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"So, here&#039;s a scenario. Kimmy fires his little missile into orbit where it can then be set to hit the US. The US respond with an interceptor missile fired from a Japanese warship (Yes, they can do that if they ask nicely.) The interceptor missile obliterates the ICBM before it even leaves Korean airspace. The US make an official statement saying Korea has declared war via a method that has been banned by the Geneva Convention. Every nation under the UN (Includes Russia and China) must, by law, respond to the threat with force. Korea is left standing alone against the entire might of the planet. The US proposes a plan to send a team of international specialists chosen by the UN to infiltrate Pyongyang and eliminate Kim. The strike takes 12 hours to plan. The team gets moved to SK (South Korean) airspace ready for stratospheric deployment (Dropped from really high up, some of you may know it as a HALO jump.) 16 hours after the initial declaration of war the team is dispatched into NK, it takes them about an hour to infiltrate Pyongyang. 17 hours after the war-dec the team are in position to raid kimmy&#039;s little bunker. After about 18 hours from the time of war-dec to the assassination of Un the team (Assuming they don&#039;t sustain casualties) Extract via a shiny new toy that the US demo&#039;d on Bin-Laden. North Korea descends into chaos as a border lockdown is held by the adjacent nations. Eventually North Korea surrender to the UN and have their entire weapons arsenal confiscated. A UN appointed council is then dispatched to govern and maintain the country until such time as it is deemed fit to let them govern themselves.","time":1491976327,"resto":120721269,"id":"CM7Bmw98","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120721409,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:52:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"Long story short: For North Korea to attack any nation with a nuclear weapon is for them to sign their own death warrant. And don&#039;t worry about China, if they sided with NK they&#039;d get shit on too, they have numbers but their tech is about as effective as their exports.","filename":"IMG_7211","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":467,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491976376248,"time":1491976376,"md5":"BWnzk12Q90GLegnMtNei6w==","fsize":50610,"resto":120721269,"id":"CM7Bmw98","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120721619,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:55:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120721269\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120721269<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120721297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120721297<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120721333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120721333<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120721409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120721409<\/a><br>tl;dr USA always wins.","filename":"IMG_7212","ext":".png","w":800,"h":502,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1491976548009,"time":1491976548,"md5":"OZNwm891Q9kB4VGM7KiSwQ==","fsize":76673,"resto":120721269,"id":"CM7Bmw98","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120721679,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:56:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s somewhere between highly unlikely and impossible that Best Korea have any delivery system capable of delivering any warhead that could deliver much more than a nuisance strike.<br><br>Trump is basically calling their bluff now because he understands that eventually, Nork will have a serious, fully capable standoff weapon.<br><br>What the plan is for this specific exercise is unknown, but the intended outcome will be a regime in North Korea that stops pursuing this weapon.","time":1491976598,"resto":120721269,"id":"rHzX6Vir","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120721708,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:56:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump for accuracy.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":804,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1491976616069,"time":1491976616,"md5":"zlwq+FNyC4\/y+ExIMlbTOg==","fsize":255205,"resto":120721269,"id":"X5nhFkaq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120721874,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:59:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120721297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120721297<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s trajectory<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s<\/span><br>stopped reading","time":1491976759,"resto":120721269,"id":"ak8MlsWX","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

Also, the father of a victim addressed me the copy of a letter that he transmitted to the judge [for inquiries], that I quote, summing-up: &quot;About the causes of the death of my son A., at the medico-legal institute of Paris, I was told, and this with reserves considering the shock it represented for me, that his testicles were cut and had been put in his mouth, and he has been disemboweled. When I saw him behind a glass, lying on a table, a white shroud covering him up to the neck, a psychologist escorted me. The latter told me: &quot;The only part that can decently shown to you is his left profile.&quot; I noted that his right eye was missing. As I remarked it, I was answered that they pricked his eye and pushed the right part of his face, hence the important hematomas that we noticed when his corpse was placed in the coffin.

It belongs obviously to the judiciary investigation to appreciate its veracity.

I specify, for things to be clear, that some corpses found in the Bataclan were extremely mutilated by explosions and firearms, to such extent that it was sometimes hard to reconstitute dismembered bodies. Therefore, woundings that this father has described could be the result of automatic weapons, explosions and the projection of nails or bolts that ensued.<br><br> M.

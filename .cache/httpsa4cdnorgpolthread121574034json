He told us what he had seen. I didn&#039;t know this colleague, but he was so shocked that it went out naturally.<br> M. Alain Marsaud: Acts of torture happened on the second floor?<br> M.T.P: I think so, because I entered on ground level and I saw no such things, only people hit by bullets.<br> M. Alain Marsaud: To your knowledge, they were perhaps three ? There is no possibility that a fourth one escaped?<br> M.T.P: We are sure that there were three of them, but there might have been four. Waves broadcast emergency calls to the police, the 17 [French equivalent to 911]: we could hear about three individuals, or four.<br> M.

I think we could, at this point, enlighten the matters.<br> M.T.P: Some bodies haven&#039;t been presented to the families because there were beheaded people, people whose throat had been cut and eviscerated people.

Victims talked about it.<br> M.T.P: They turned on their explosives. There were beheadings, people got their thorat cut, and eviscerations.

We have been advised with contradictory information - some of which have been communicated during auditions - that we need to enlighten.<br> M. George Fenech: Indeed, the commission is shaken by these information, that leaked nowhere. Also, the father of a victim addressed me the copy of a letter that he transmitted to the judge [for inquiries], that I quote, summing-up: &quot;About the causes of the death of my son A., at the medico-legal institute of Paris, I was told, and this with reserves considering the shock it represented for me, that his testicles were cut and had been put in his mouth, and he has been disemboweled. When I saw him behind a glass, lying on a table, a white shroud covering him up to the neck, a psychologist escorted me. The latter told me: &quot;The only part that can decently shown to you is his left profile.&quot; I noted that his right eye was missing. As I remarked it, I was answered that they pricked his eye and pushed the right part of his face, hence the important hematomas that we noticed when his corpse was placed in the coffin. This precise testimony could support the sayings from an officer of the BAC [proximity police], according which one of the investigator leaving the Bataclan promptly vomited, after observing a beheading and eviscerations. Do you have any knowledge about this facts?","time":1492462322,"resto":121574034,"id":"CzNTry97","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121580169,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:52:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"M. Michel Cadot: I don&#039;t have any knowledge about these facts, neither from the medico-legal institute, nor from the considered officers. It belongs obviously to the judiciary investigation to appreciate its veracity. Though, I understood that no knife or any other sharp object that would have permitted this kind of mutilation were to be found on the site of the attack. It will be easy to verify it during the inquiry. As for me, once again, I haven&#039;t received any message from the medico-legal institute or the direction of the guardianship of the concerned BAC.<br><br> M. Christian Sainte: I can barely commit myself on this matter, considering the state of the inquiry, but nothing, in the current state of my knowledge, can allow me to think that what has been read is correct. I specify, for things to be clear, that some corpses found in the Bataclan were extremely mutilated by explosions and firearms, to such extent that it was sometimes hard to reconstitute dismembered bodies. Therefore, woundings that this father has described could be the result of automatic weapons, explosions and the projection of nails or bolts that ensued.<br><br> M. George Fenech: He would have been put the testicles in the mouth... M. Christian Sainte: I don&#039;t have this information and, if these facts had been founded, I don&#039;t think I would have missed such an information.<br><br> M. George Fenech: In the wake of the november attacks, acts of barbarism were mentioned.<br><br> M. Francois Molins: It is a rumor. Coroners were unequivocal: there were no acts of barbarism, no use, in particular, of cold steel.

Right now I don&#039;t feel like it&#039;s the reality, it&#039;s a nightmare.<br> It was 9:45 pm, we were in the pit when suddenly we heard gunshots, we turned around, thought it was firecrackers, and in fact it was people shooting in every direction. And then we all lied to the gound, started crawling to the stage, we were crushed by everbody, because, yeah everybodywas panicking, everytime a gunshot could be heard they tried to hide and when there were no gunshots anymore got up again... And we went through a corridor that lead us to the left side of the stage, or right side of the stage and we hid for 2 hours, 25-30 of us, curled up against one another, hearing dynamites, kalashnikovs, everything you want, so... People shouted, as if they were tortured, and until the last moment, they thought it was next to the door, and in fact it was the GIGN, they told us &quot;hands up!&quot; and we all left, wounded people first, because there were wounded people in the room for 2 hours, one with a bullet in the knee, one with a bullet in the arm.

If you look at hindism, the soldier caste rebelled and created the sihk, the merchant class created the buddhist, the worker class created the jain.<br><br>In christianity similiar things have happened. Jesus was a worker class revolt in a way. He took the power from the strong priest class and gave it to the worker. He had no noble blood and the strongest class at that time were the romans, I still believe that this wasn&#039;t the intention as I consider pilate more innocent than the pharisees(jews)","time":1492542245,"resto":121697992,"id":"400G+rQz","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121723787,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)15:04:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121723563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121723563<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i lose because I choose not to argue with a guy who makes literally no coherent points whatsoever<\/span><br><br>if that helps you sleep at night, buddy","time":1492542298,"resto":121697992,"id":"1dJDMF2R","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121723902,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)15:05:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121723787\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121723787<\/a><br>thought you were done<br>I&#039;m not your buddy heathen","time":1492542349,"resto":121697992,"id":"gQVdrqcJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121723980,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)15:06:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121723664\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121723664<\/a><br>Luther was a priest class working for the nobles, and merchants.

I&#039;m 20 myself. The question is: how do I make her my tradi-waifu?<br><br>Like me, she&#039;s a practicing Christian (inb4 fedorafags, please no), so her basic value system is in check and she has already swallowed the biggest, saving redpill on her own. She&#039;s very smart, does well in school and is well-behaved. Additionally, she&#039;s beautiful, does sports, learns foreign languages, plays multiple instruments and sings more beautifully than any girl I&#039;ve ever heard. One of the things we have in common is our love for reading books and writing, and unlike most girls her age, she reads actual literature, not just YA crap.<br><br>Is she still too young to date? She turned 16 in January, while I&#039;ll be 21 this year. I&#039;m worried that of I wait too long, someone else will snatch her, because from what I know about her, she seems to be one in a million and will most certainly have other suitors in some time. On the other hand, she&#039;s still developing and might not be &quot;ready&quot; yet, so what if for some reason she turns out to become something else than what I&#039;ve described when she gets older?<br><br>How should I go about this? Should I just ask her for a coffee? I don&#039;t see her that often, because we live in different cities, but we do meet occasionally when I&#039;m vising my hometown.<br><br>I don&#039;t know if this fits the subject of the thread, but she seems like the kind of girl to start a family with, and we all know there aren&#039;t too many of those around.

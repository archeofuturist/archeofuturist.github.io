These include Los Ubers for Hispanic employees, UberHUE for African-American employees and UberPRIDE for LBGTQ employees. Corporations create such groups to foster a sense of understanding and acceptance.<br><br>Under the heading for Shalom, the group for Uber&#039;s Jewish employees, the description notes that &quot;our goal is to make the world a little smaller, by connecting Uberettos and Jewbers from all backgrounds, encouraging collaboration and closeness from all corners of the globe.&quot; (Uberetto is the company&#039;s generic term for any employee.)<br><br>Uber spokesperson Matt Kalman said the names and terminology for all groups was determined by the employees themselves.<br><br>Self-generated or not, the word &quot;Jewber&quot; immediately irked some on Twitter even though other tech companies have coined similar names including Gayglers, Jewglers and Greyglers, Google&#039;s names for its gay, Jewish and older employees. Others took issue with UberHUE as being inappropriate for an African-American association, while some suggested a Spanish name would have been preferable to Los Ubers.","filename":"jewlidarity","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490761194614,"time":1490761194,"md5":"hUKy4AiAZNq\/idEX8p0NdA==","fsize":60700,"resto":0,"id":"T23SQ\/Fl","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"jewbers-jewish-uber-employee-designation","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118746876,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:29:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118746033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118746033<\/a><br>bump","time":1490761748,"resto":118746033,"id":"KqI0aK0v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118747564,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:37:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118746033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118746033<\/a><br>They would have been better off ignoring Jews.<br><br>With Jews, they win.","time":1490762242,"resto":118746033,"id":"X1JRnOW\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

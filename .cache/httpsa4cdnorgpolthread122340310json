conformist. He surrenders his judgment and allows other people to dominate his life. In this regard, he is the story&#039;s foil, a contrast to its hero, Roark. Everything that Keating does is done under the influence of others. He becomes an architect (although he would prefer the career of a painter), because his mother chooses it. He marries Dominique (although he loves Catherine Halsey), because Dominique&#039;s grace and beauty impress other people. In all the important decisions of his life, Keating gives up his own values because other people disapprove of them. Keating lacks the strength of character necessary to stand on his own judgment.<br><br>An aggressive social climber, Keating desires prestige above all else. Because Keating attempts to rise to the position of partner in the country&#039;s most prestigious firm \u2014 and because he uses any means necessary to attain this end, including flattery, deceit, and, in the case of Lucius Heyer, near-murder \u2014 he is conventionally thought of as selfish. But Ayn Rand presents a revolutionary analysis of such a status-seeker&#039;s nature. Peter Keating, she says, is selfless. He sacrifices the things that he wants in order to please others. He surrenders his own loves and values in an attempt to win social approval. He relinquishes autonomy and permits others to dominate his life. Ayn Rand argues that in order to be selfish a man must be true to his self \u2014 and that the self is fundamentally a man&#039;s values along with the thinking he does to form them.","filename":"roark-integrity","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":364,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1492902042423,"time":1492902042,"md5":"ZJsG7BTZ2bhkMOfJ2GZ0DA==","fsize":105539,"resto":122340310,"id":"CitJU0P3","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122341675,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)19:00:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"ST\/Panelbase Scotland poll<br>Change from 2015<br><br>SNP 44% (-6)<br>Con 33% (+18)<br>Lab 13% (-11)<br>Lib Dems 5% (-2)<br><br>Over","time":1492902048,"resto":122340310,"id":"gn46hpPe","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122341719,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)19:01:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122341253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122341253<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also the British military is almost entirely composed of white patriots.<\/span><br><br>Thats something that people don&#039;t realize too .You occasionally see the od black but other thatn Gurkhas it&#039;s almost all white and will be for generations i predict","time":1492902071,"resto":122340310,"id":"k2v5s4N+","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122341733,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)19:01:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;election night<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you&#039;ve managed to sneak into Tory HQ where they&#039;re throwing a celebration<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mummy May, wine glass in hand, spots you<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;she knows you don&#039;t belong there<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;she pulls you into the other room where there aren&#039;t other people<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;she starts trying to take off your pants and asking if you want to be her Tory Boy Toy<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if you accept, you&#039;ll be forced to live at 10 Downing and you can&#039;t ever leave<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if you refuse, you&#039;ll be sent to one of the Labour Concentration Camps<\/span><br><br>what do you do?","filename":"Theresa May tipsy","ext":".jpg","w":264,"h":320,"tn_w":103,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492902076996,"time":1492902076,"md5":"nDkw708MsZehaFalDhC\/SQ==","fsize":28262,"resto":122340310,"id":"gR6DKY+A","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122341767,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)19:01:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122341238\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122341238<\/a><br>That post is the prime example of why a proper fascist movement is never possible in the United Kingdom.

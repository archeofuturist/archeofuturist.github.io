Not much experience is needed to be fully aware of human weakness and to understand that human beings\u2014and especially the young, who are so exposed to temptation\u2014need incentives to keep the moral law, and it is an evil thing to make it easy for them to break that law. Another effect that gives cause for alarm is that a man who grows accustomed to the use of contraceptive methods may forget the reverence due to a woman, and, disregarding her physical and emotional equilibrium, reduce her to being a mere instrument for the satisfaction of his own desires, no longer considering her as his partner whom he should surround with care and affection.<\/span>","time":1491626089,"resto":120079803,"id":"MbM25591","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120087051,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)00:38:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120086067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120086067<\/a><br>get into debt.<br>consume.<br>obey.","time":1491626283,"resto":120079803,"id":"mkJHJDP8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120087425,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)00:41:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120086067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120086067<\/a><br>Probably trying to even out birth rates among races.

Setting is a mix of sci-fi and cyberpunk with greedy corporations and shit. Currently we trying to get funded on IndieGoGo. I need your help on redpill related jokes. So far I thought about feminazis as main enemy and enforcers of corporations, reptiloids as secret boss and few kinda muslim colonials-planets named New Sweden and New England. I need your ideas, possible references, more subtlety, I can&#039;t go full memelands retard. Nothing of this is final, I really would like to hear your ideas. If the project gets funded and the game becomes commercially successful I plan further to counter pro-left and anti-consumer tendencies in gaming industry.<br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/b51Xyrupsb8<br>My thread on \/v\/ is going nowhere.","filename":"logo2","ext":".gif","w":736,"h":490,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491951212231,"time":1491951212,"md5":"Q8PfsL27V6CxcIuwfQOPZQ==","fsize":265128,"resto":0,"id":"jmsdaQYc","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hello-anons-im-making-pol-influenced-vidya","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":27,"images":4,"unique_ips":13},{"no":120672421,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)18:56:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Some early concepts.","filename":"R4D0Ed_z77Y","ext":".jpg","w":1448,"h":925,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":79,"tim":1491951382355,"time":1491951382,"md5":"UWm761j71isuzFXqDRFJfQ==","fsize":171224,"resto":120672040,"id":"jmsdaQYc","country":"RU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120673118,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)19:01:09","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Fight1V2","ext":".png","w":1366,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491951669337,"time":1491951669,"md5":"qVslGShLXUvBMCY2vUFtuw==","fsize":338083,"resto":120672040,"id":"jmsdaQYc","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120674181,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)19:09:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"I thought you guys would be interested in \/ourguy\/ vidya.","filename":"TroughtAsteroids","ext":".png","w":869,"h":597,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1491952147728,"time":1491952147,"md5":"V1LZSic2ud0H5ASvFm2DwQ==","fsize":172603,"resto":120672040,"id":"jmsdaQYc","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120674202,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)19:09:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120672040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120672040<\/a><br>Have a boop","time":1491952156,"resto":120672040,"id":"UoEvMfTS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120675248,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)19:17:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120674202\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120674202<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a boop<\/span><br>what?","time":1491952639,"resto":120672040,"id":"jmsdaQYc","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120675583,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)19:19:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120672040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120672040<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;New England<\/span><br><br>Try ourwah clam chowdah!","time":1491952786,"resto":120672040,"id":"JwUvUdpc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120675671,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)19:20:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120675248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120675248<\/a><br>Here have another &quot;boop&quot;.","time":1491952824,"resto":120672040,"id":"uXnp8TjX","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":120676000,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)19:23:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"boop boop","time":1491952981,"resto":120672040,"id":"A5MwcGI2","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120676130,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)19:23:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120675583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120675583<\/a><br>and what thats suppose to mean?","time":1491953035,"resto":120672040,"id":"jmsdaQYc","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120676443,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)19:26:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"boop=bump<br><br>also boopbump.

Setting is a mix of sci-fi and cyberpunk with greedy corporations and shit. Currently we trying to get funded on IndieGoGo. I need your help on redpill related jokes. So far I thought about feminazis as main enemy and enforcers of corporations, reptiloids as secret boss and few kinda muslim colonials-planets named New Sweden and New England. I need your ideas, possible references, more subtlety, I can&#039;t go full memelands retard. Nothing of this is final, I really would like to hear your ideas. If the project gets funded and the game becomes commercially successful I plan further to counter pro-left and anti-consumer tendencies in gaming industry.<br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/b51Xyrupsb8<br>My thread on \/v\/ is going nowhere.","filename":"logo2","ext":".gif","w":736,"h":490,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491951212231,"time":1491951212,"md5":"Q8PfsL27V6CxcIuwfQOPZQ==","fsize":265128,"resto":0,"id":"jmsdaQYc","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hello-anons-im-making-pol-influenced-vidya","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":120672421,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)18:56:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Some early concepts.","filename":"R4D0Ed_z77Y","ext":".jpg","w":1448,"h":925,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":79,"tim":1491951382355,"time":1491951382,"md5":"UWm761j71isuzFXqDRFJfQ==","fsize":171224,"resto":120672040,"id":"jmsdaQYc","country":"RU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Russian Federation"}]}

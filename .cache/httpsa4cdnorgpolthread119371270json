The government\u2019s immigration enforcers plan to heighten their \u201csite visits,\u201d they said, to \u201cdetermine whether H-1B dependent employers are evading their obligation to make a good faith effort to recruit U.S. workers.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Justice Department, meanwhile, issued its own stern warning Monday. \u201cThe Justice Department will not tolerate employers misusing the H-1B visa process to discriminate against U.S. workers,\u201d said Tom Wheeler, the acting assistant attorney general at the DOJ\u2019s civil rights division.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Both swipes at the program come days after U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services issued a policy that rethinks the way the government awards H-1B visas to computer programmers. Now, companies must prove that the programmers they\u2019re hoping to hire are doing special, complex jobs requiring unique technical expertise.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.recode.net\/2017\/4\/3\/151<wbr>6...ring-crackdown<br><br>https:\/\/www.uscis.gov\/news\/news-rel<wbr>e...raud-and-abuse","filename":"Screenshot_2017-04-03-14-47-41-1","ext":".png","w":1080,"h":1628,"tn_w":165,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491248986292,"time":1491248986,"md5":"AzLHZMehEVaYvQYSj6g4Ew==","fsize":822976,"resto":0,"id":"CioAfYQb","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-cracking-down-on-h1b-visas-dhs-to-increase","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119371469,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)15:51:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119371270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119371270<\/a><br>REEEE HE SAID HE LIKED HINDUS REEEE HE SAID WE WERE GOOD BUSINESSMEN","time":1491249089,"resto":119371270,"id":"MbOSKo7Y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119371617,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)15:52:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Pakis, Poo-in-loos btfo","time":1491249167,"resto":119371270,"id":"VK7sTPt2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119371927,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)15:55:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119371270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119371270<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;companies can no longer import indentured servants and must compete for American labor <\/span><br><br>Oy vey anodda shoa","time":1491249323,"resto":119371270,"id":"CNt6+f6o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

But if you think you must or desire to talk with them, do not say more than this: <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&#039; Do you hear, Jew, do you know that your principal- ity together with the temple and priesthood are destroyed now for 1460 years? For this year, as we Christians write after the birth of Christ 1543, it is exactly 1469 years, and is thus going on 1500 years since Vespasianus and Titus destroyed Jerusalem and expelled the Jews from it.&quot; <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;On this little nut let the Jews bite and dispute among themselves as long as they want to. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For such terrible wrath of God is sufficient proof that they certaintly must be in error and doing wrong ; even a child can grasp that. For no one should think of God so terrible that He would punish his own nation so unmercifully and keep silent by neither comforting words nor indicating the duration or end of such misery! Who would want to believe in such a God, hope in Him, or trust in Him? <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Therefore, this wrath leads to the conclusion that the Jews are <\/span><br>certainly rejected by God and are not His people anymore, and He also is not their God anymore ; ac- cording to the passage, Hosea 1:9 &quot;Lo, Ammi: You are not my people, so also am I not your God.&quot; Yea, they are in a terrible dilemma. Whatever interpretation they may place on it, we see the thing before our eyes, it does not deceive us.","filename":"On-the-Jews-and-their-Lies-cover","ext":".jpg","w":246,"h":369,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492318780920,"time":1492318780,"md5":"ZTLcXGV7oCF6E4dV79F8Vg==","fsize":79918,"resto":0,"id":"pxp5zogn","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-what-exactly-did-the-jews-do-to-martin-luther","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

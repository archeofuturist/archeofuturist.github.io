Russia you guys are alright in my books so hopefully our two countries don&#039;t oppose each other on a battlefield . America...I guess if Great Britain declares war then we have to go too so the two of us obviously will be allies. France too, you guys are awesome. Australia we probably will be on the same side no doubt so yea. Iran and North Korea you guys will probably fight us if you decide to join in. I dunno whoever else I guess wants to fight on either side. start building those bomb shelters. Also if the draft is enacted how will the west cope? I&#039;m guessing millions of snowflake deserters and conscientious objectors. Or will nukes just be dropped right away?","filename":"6 (1)","ext":".jpg","w":852,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491559090740,"time":1491559090,"md5":"i4q6GuSJ81Z4ksuIElwnuA==","fsize":39516,"resto":0,"id":"NJdumqln","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"welp-it-looks-like-the-cold-war-is-heating-up","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

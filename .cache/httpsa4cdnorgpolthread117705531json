The flu can spread because while it may be potentially lethal you could still get up and go buy groceries or go to the pharmacy, where you come into contact with other people. It often begins with milder symptoms, and people mistake it for a bad cold or allergies, further increasing the risk of person-person contact. The flu can be spread by aerosol droplets, so you don&#039;t need to touch anyone, you just have to be in a space with someone who is coughing or sneezing.

You live in the country where a gang of Muslims and other assorted scum were able to get away with gang raping underage white girls over 10 years in one town alone. If you&#039;re not a nationalist and you still believe Leftist dogma you&#039;re a retarded piece of shit who doesn&#039;t deserve to breathe the same air as the rest of the UK. I&#039;m absolutely bored with your ilk, lecturing and bitching at us with your little leftie fart bubbles, while being utterly fucking wrong.","filename":"1461603621245","ext":".png","w":722,"h":666,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":115,"tim":1493834633213,"time":1493834633,"md5":"yALC73ska1l6Hkz86u34QA==","fsize":29671,"resto":123915581,"id":"0PlRKQCx","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123940625,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:09:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123915776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123915776<\/a><br>That&#039;s absolute bollocks. I&#039;m working class and I feel completely free, I can go and do anything, my dad owns a big national chain and employs thousands of people simply because he has charm and used it to get where he is now. He has no formal education, he used to be a coal miner but his pit closed yet here he is, more successful than any whining git who blames class or race for their pathetic life. People who wage war on class tend to never have met any actual upper class but live in Commie dreams.","time":1493834995,"resto":123915581,"id":"0PlRKQCx","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

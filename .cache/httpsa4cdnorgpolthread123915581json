One might even be proud to represent one\u2019s country in some way, since it demonstrates some level of excellence or ability which one has personally attained.<br><br>But being proud of one\u2019s country?

But thereafter, either parent can forego their career in the interests of their child: that the male must be the default breadwinner is old-fashioned dogma harking back to our prehistoric past (when, incidentally, children would be left with trusted strangers in the tribe just as often as parents pay trusted strangers these days).<br><br>It might perhaps be in the interests of the child that a parent assumes the role of homemaker instead of a trusted, paid stranger or other family member (although there would also be abuse-related cases in which the child was better off with these people - I guess we\u2019re discussing \u201call other things being equal\u201d here and so this is rather a diversion).

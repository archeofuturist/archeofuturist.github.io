Multiple strange coincidences occurred during these events. It was a pretty spooky affair. Internet outages, information mysteriously being deleted from servers and peoples home computers, and even more menacing things were intimated to have happened. Some people said that the key, or parts of the key to some wikileaks insurance files were indeed found but stopped cold.<br><br>Whenever this topic is brought up, it is usually heavily attacked. Attacked to a point that is a little strange. On some boards, discussions of this topic are flat out deleted or stifled one way or another.<br><br>https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/conspiracy<wbr>\/comments\/64m8hp\/summary_of_how_wik<wbr>ileaks_and_assange_were\/<br><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/Pj6Sl<br><br><br>The first link is a summary and timeline of this investigation which really helps to get an idea of the weirdness to this whole event. It also I think shows that there genuinely was something happening here and that it was not just a &quot;LARP&quot;.<br><br>The second link is an archived thread from endchan at a moment fairly early on in the investigation for the insurance key.<br><br>Do any of you guys have any info on this topic? Any good links for further info? Supposedly investigations are still happening underground and as far away as possible from government scrutiny as possible. Some people who were really paranoid from this even talked about it going off grid at one point in time. I honestly dont know. I just want any new info that might be out there. Please help if any of you guys can.","filename":"th6","ext":".jpg","w":286,"h":161,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493951347724,"time":1493951347,"md5":"xfFHKaFqC2+1IW6TniDouQ==","fsize":12534,"resto":0,"id":"ewlaU5zf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wikileaks-blockchain-investigation-what-happened","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":0,"unique_ips":10},{"no":124151619,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:31:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124151380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124151380<\/a><br>Bumpity bump","time":1493951472,"resto":124151380,"id":"W5A\/euX4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124151635,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:31:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1493951480,"resto":124151380,"id":"55C+nCJ1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124151877,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:33:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124151380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124151380<\/a><br>bump","time":1493951619,"resto":124151380,"id":"SPGzBtEG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124152479,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:38:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Any new links or news on the subject?

Any new news concerning this topic would be very much appreciated. <br><br>For those who dont know the full story, I would advise checking out the timeline link I provided. There are some who actively fight against this being discussed and say it is all a big joke, but what little info we do have leads me to believe some crazy shit went down. with unprecedented ddos attacks and manipulating of bitcoin at key times in the investigation, it seems pretty clear that powerful people are stopping this.","time":1493951939,"resto":124151380,"id":"ewlaU5zf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124153071,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:44:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Deepstate Goons from somethingawful likely larped it into being.

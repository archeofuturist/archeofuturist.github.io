They can pass literally whatever they want. And they can&#039;t get their healthcare plan through because their own party is too disorganized to make it happen. Best of all they&#039;re trying to blame the Democrats, who literally have no power to stop them from passing healthcare legislation.<br><br>They spent years talking about how terrible Obamacare is and how they could do a way better job. Now they have the most power they can ever reasonably expect to have, and they can&#039;t get shit done.<br><br>Is there any other modern political party that has so thoroughly cucked themselves?","filename":"download","ext":".jpg","w":984,"h":554,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490401593265,"time":1490401593,"md5":"XjI4464L2m6XNf9xS2bVzw==","fsize":56424,"resto":0,"id":"29g2OT9H","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-we-take-a-moment-to-sit-back-and-laugh-at-how","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118158344,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:29:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118157966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118157966<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;All people in a single political party have the exact same views<\/span>","time":1490401792,"resto":118157966,"id":"blCXpANS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118158722,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:33:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118158344\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118158344<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Handed double majority on a platter<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Can&#039;t do anything with it<\/span><br><br>Not even the great dealmaker himself could safe it.

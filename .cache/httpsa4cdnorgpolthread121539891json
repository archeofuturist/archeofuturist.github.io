It might be different if NI was a seat of culture, an economic boon or even a proud part of the UK, but it simply is not.<br><br>The Culture is Laughable with the Orange Order being one of the most bizzarrely proud and yet pants-on-head retarded groups I&#039;ve ever seen.<br>The Economy is a drain on us, NI is a failed statelet which we must constnatly throw money at and for what? More riots, instability and retarded politics?<br><br>NI is not something I am at all proud of nor do I see any merit in keeping it. I am anti-irish nationalism, but do believe in Ireland being part of the UK but with its own identity as Scotland once had. After all, it is a separate island. Ireland and England could have done great things.<br><br>But this is not the case, and we&#039;re left with the tumour in the North. I think we should cut ties and tell them to fuck off, as they are an absolute humiliation at their worst and a costly afterbirth at their best. <br>I don&#039;t see them as British. I see the whole of NI as one big money draining failed experiment on an Island which we should control entirely or leave to rot.<br><br>What do you believe?<br><br>ROI fags welcome of course but try not to stir up too much nationalist sentiment or the loyalists will get autistic which will encourage even further shitposting.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":382,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":235,"tim":1492443948921,"time":1492443948,"md5":"juUNaC9rC9Wh97AbLyqslA==","fsize":39487,"resto":0,"id":"vr1nNlTi","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"northern-ireland","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":52,"images":5,"unique_ips":26},{"no":121540252,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:48:57","name":"SomeTwat","com":"<a href=\"#p121539891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121539891<\/a><br>I think we should take back the whole of Ireland, preferably democratically.<br><br>But I disagree on the whole &quot;all or nothing&quot; mentality, if the citizens of northern island wish to be part of us then they should stay.","time":1492444137,"resto":121539891,"id":"vgKm3xag","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121540574,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:51:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121539891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121539891<\/a><br>Just unite Ireland.

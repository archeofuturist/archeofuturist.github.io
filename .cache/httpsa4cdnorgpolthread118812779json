Here&#039;s what&#039;s funny. When they bitch and moan when an update comes out to make a more &quot;fair&quot; playing field for newer players. All that work put into leveling a character, into getting special items, into saving gold... wasted because the game developers wanted to make it &quot;more fair&quot; for everybody else. They&#039;ll rage on forums and pitch a fit... and then log into Facebook and share Bernie Sanders gibsmedats memes.","time":1490811046,"resto":118812779,"id":"Q9aT1lB7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

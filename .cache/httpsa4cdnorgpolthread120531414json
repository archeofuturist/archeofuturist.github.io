Termites dont collude to destroy your home. But if they all decide to have lunch on their own, it looks like and is the same outcome. It takes a while to look at them like any other animal and realize its not evil; this is how they survive. They have codified human nature as moral law. The way they get around the horror they create is by deciding others arent human like them. That is predation. To them, they are morally clear. Its often not an act: they genuinely think they are usually doing us a favor by giving us vice, legally changed access to vice, and so on. If miscegany sells titillation to white women and it helps sell perfume on tv ads, they will do it. If they think our value of law is to hammer out each phrase and letter to absurdity, they will gladly help us create a giant legal system. If they can make a vice of money &amp; want itself, they will lobby for ways to create paper financial gimmicks to produce money without value.<br><br>They dont want to destroy humanity or even run it. They usually are content to be advisers, not actually responsible legally for executing government duties.<br><br>At some point, they must&#039;ve figured out the scale of actual obvious government was a pain in the ass that never lasts. So instead of creating an empire that eventually falls, they are happy to roam about forever, waiting for goys to build something &amp; then moving in to finance and lobby it. This is how they survive because they arent really interested in rule as we think of it. They want power and to survive. Its not quite the same thing. These fuckers date back 7000 years and while the rest of humanity is rising &amp; falling in empires, these fuckers are still around and kicking. Thats their bit.<br><br>The Jew is not especially dangerous in what they do. The hazard they bring is always in what they *attempt* at our cost. Am I making sense to you? I hope so.

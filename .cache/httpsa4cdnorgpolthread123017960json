A woman who takes responsibility is key for this.<br><br>Secondly, you need her to, and I hate using this word, &quot;empower&quot; you. After a long day at work, she should be the one who&#039;s there for you with a plate of hot, nice food. The kind of woman that offers to put bandaid on a minor scratch on your calves. Note that this doesn&#039;t mean that she&#039;s 100% submissive, I&#039;m all for taking an off day from work as a &quot;father&#039;s day&quot; to stay home and look after the kids while your wife works one day in the week. <br><br>Thirdly, the chemistry needs to be there. Most of the boys on here recommend finding a Christian, submissive girl, but frankly those are in most cases boring as all hell. The key to maintaining a long term relationship is you two having fun together. You two should tease each other, gently bully one another, you might even play-fight sometimes. <br><br>These are the main things I can think of right now.","time":1493292894,"resto":123017960,"id":"9js1IjSj","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123027253,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)07:42:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123026744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123026744<\/a><br>Ok, so how do you measure reliability and ability to empower?","time":1493293336,"resto":123017960,"id":"zNJoeePg","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123028052,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)07:53:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123027253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123027253<\/a><br>Reliability is relatively easy to gauge, you could look for subtle things like whether she arrives at the right time or always comes in late, whether she &quot;forgets&quot; stuff, but most of all how much she lies, either to you, or to others, about small things. Be able to tell a fake laugh apart from a genuine laugh. Look deep into her eyes when you think she might be lying, or dishonest about something. No person on the planet can truly lie without showing signs. Something interesting to look at for example is, take her to her parents, and observe how she treats her family. Is the way she talks different than how she talks to you? Let her invite some friends, how does she talk to them? Does she use the same words, talk in the same tone?<br><br>Empowerment is almost impossible to measure, because a lot of women fake it at the beginning, but this is one you should (hopefully) sense.","time":1493294021,"resto":123017960,"id":"9js1IjSj","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123028354,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)07:57:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123017960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123017960<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;- being the stay at home dad piggybacking of your wife&#039;s earnings<\/span><br>why even live? what a bunch of pathetic bums.","time":1493294270,"resto":123017960,"id":"Y\/S4VTj7","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]}

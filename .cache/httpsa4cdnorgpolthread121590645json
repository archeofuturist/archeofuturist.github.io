Once it happened, there was no reason for someone in one group who didn&#039;t like his group to just break away and make a new one, which lead Protestantism decaying as denominations spiraled into increasingly higher numbers of increasingly retarded new denominations, and with no actual theological authority, not only can any uneducated layman pick up a bible and declare himself a pastor, but anyone who doesn&#039;t like some part of the theology can just remove it if they convince enough people. The rising spread of progressivism in various Christian denominations is proof that the protestants were wrong about laypeople being able to fully manage and understand theology without a central theological authority.","time":1492467884,"resto":121590645,"id":"N5gutvWS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

If Macedonian opposition wanted to prevent Albanians from getting what they wanted all they had to do was let them into the government and than block the state through bureaucracy, an easy thing in any Balkan state.","time":1493334621,"resto":123095306,"id":"MPEYHikl","country":"BA","country_name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"no":123106933,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)19:12:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123105554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123105554<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;my water has been cut<\/span><br>Fucking Mossad, man","time":1493334777,"resto":123095306,"id":"DFkeIhHq","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123107003,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)19:13:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"beyler galiba rakkaya biz inecez, umar\u0131m \u00f6yle bi salakl\u0131k yap\u0131lmaz","time":1493334812,"resto":123095306,"id":"Y6l1As85","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":123107061,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)19:13:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123106559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123106559<\/a><br>honestly just nuke the balkans and get done with it. im tired of this place","time":1493334838,"resto":123095306,"id":"Rt9TLITO","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":123107300,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)19:15:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123107003\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123107003<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;beyler galiba rakkaya biz inecez, umar\u0131m \u00f6yle bi salakl\u0131k yap\u0131lmaz<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=X6v<wbr>4AISOEWM","time":1493334916,"resto":123095306,"id":"wVlr+vOU","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123107386,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)19:15:51","name":"Syrian Geneal","com":"#Syria #Homs #EasternHoms #SAA #SyrianArmy Soldiers Celebrating the recapture of Abandoned Base north of #T4 airbase #T4Airbase #T4_Airbase<br><br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/IvanSidorenko1\/<wbr>status\/857733164671926272","time":1493334951,"resto":123095306,"id":"VNJZtnd1","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":123107475,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)19:16:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123106933\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123106933<\/a><br>i will follow the example of the uncowed Irish republicans.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The fight to regain political status began in 1976 when one prisoner, Ciaran Nugent, refused to wear a prison uniform.

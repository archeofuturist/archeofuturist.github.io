I lived in a house identical to my fellow masonic kid who ended up raping me thanks to a third mason family doing the old molest and sodomize trick. Drewsthatdude. While my family life was filled with countless abuse, his was relatively lax. Scouts in the basement of a Catholic church to twice a week pentecostal AoG plus other non denominations in a tour of the region. Ive even had traditional hymn and Finnish Lutheran XP. His father was a Utah DJ and now Seattle runs the show. Juno a small local 90s rock band albums help explain my life. A manifest destiny at the control of these handlers. Beauty and the Beast was given a remake because me and my college roommates hollywood connections after I pulled off 5\/9. A CIA honeypot that hacked a WSU student. A judas iscarot clown will prove that true as he took the bribe and money is irrefutable. He even has false tatoo of Judah Lion and Veritas. This is the upper echelon of the freemason&#039;s game because when you are that young and they have you sodomize another kid you are free from the religious brainwashing and guilt. Putting young drew leagues above and ahead in social status with that rebel status chicks love at those ages. Starting a leg up at the detriment of a blameless altar boy. My full name and family has lines going back to the European side of Titles meaning prophet. Your masonic fraternities serve as the entry point where they blend faiths to absorb cultures.

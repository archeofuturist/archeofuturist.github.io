It is a fallacy because the &quot;slope&quot; has not been proven to exist. In order for anyone to give a fuck about what you think, you need to have a reason. Just saying &quot;omg something really bad is going to happen&quot; is not an argument, nor is it proof, nor is it evidence. The reason we came up with empiricism 2000 years ago is so we can actually talk about reality and not have to listen to morons like you who think they can predict the future when they can&#039;t even understand basic logic like I have just laid out.","time":1491511034,"resto":119790440,"id":"DnU0YeeT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119791006,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:38:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119790440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119790440<\/a><br>#NotYourFallacy","time":1491511084,"resto":119790440,"id":"Y46iyqOk","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119791166,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:39:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119790907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119790907<\/a><br>The slippery slope is real though","time":1491511151,"resto":119790440,"id":"zCdiomhV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119791516,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:41:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119790907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119790907<\/a><br>Making a prediction on where things will lead based on actions being taken here and now is not at all unreasonable.

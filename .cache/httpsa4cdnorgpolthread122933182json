I actually started doing that since i (call me a cuck) actually believe she can better me. Anyways the books I chose were Mein Kampf, Julius Evola&#039;s Ride the Tiger, and The Turner Diaries. First thing she did was took my books and said under my condition I can&#039;t read them. She also said &quot;we&#039;re going to be here a lot longer now, you really do need more help than what i can provide alone&quot;. Now im having to do group therapy AND individual therapy.

I actually started doing that since i (call me a cuck) actually believe she can better me. Anyways the books I chose were Mein Kampf, Julius Evola&#039;s Ride the Tiger, and The Turner Diaries. First thing she did was took my books and said under my condition I can&#039;t read them. She also said &quot;we&#039;re going to be here a lot longer now, you really do need more help than what i can provide alone&quot;. Now im having to do group therapy AND individual therapy.

This will both convince your psych that you&#039;re actually trying to &quot;get better&quot; and it will help you, because Plato has more of value to say than most of the &quot;redpill&quot; books out there - and Hitler would say the same. Try to get yourself in shape so you can defend yourself from the beatings and maybe find a boxing gym in the area you can go to. Tell your psych that she is right, and you got into that &quot;white supremacy&quot; stuff because you were depressed, and you&#039;re moving on from it and trying to make a better life where you can find pride in your own achievements - that&#039;s what she wants to hear.

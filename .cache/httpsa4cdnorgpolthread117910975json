Wormwood&quot; is the name of a star in Revelation 8:10-11: \u201cThe third angel sounded his trumpet, and a great star, blazing like a torch, fell from the sky on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water\u2014the name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters turned bitter, and many people died from the waters that had become bitter.\u201d This is the third of the \u201ctrumpet judgments\u201d described in Revelation. The seven trumpets are the judgments of the seventh seal (Revelation 8:1-5). The first trumpet causes hail and fire that destroy much of the plant life in the world (Revelation 8:7). The second trumpet brings about what seems to be a meteor, comet, or other heavenly body hitting the oceans and causing the death of one-third of the world\u2019s sea life (Revelation 8:8-9). The third trumpet is similar to the second, except it affects the world\u2019s lakes and rivers instead of the oceans (Revelation 8:10-11). It will cause a third part of all fresh water on earth to turn bitter and many people will die from drinking it.","time":1490262522,"resto":117910975,"id":"ZeiGGznt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

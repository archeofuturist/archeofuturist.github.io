It probably made more people commit sucide than all the chans combined. Some parts of it are fine if you look for a niche subreddit for a specific game or other intrerest. Most subreddits are still filled with liberals, ISIS supporting muslims and shills. The upvote and downvote system is useless and only good for &quot;You have a different opinion so I will send your comment to non existence.&quot; If you would think of the internet as the real world then Reddit would be Sweden. Site admins, subreddit mods and users are equally cucked, marxist-communist agenda everywhere and they always think they are superior and that others should look up to them. As I said just like Sweden.","filename":"1491034533070","ext":".png","w":463,"h":197,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":53,"tim":1493370382468,"time":1493370382,"md5":"06seAko8Pj9wdYTAHv589Q==","fsize":68371,"resto":123166035,"id":"Qu+ZLX0d","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123172823,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)05:07:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123172499\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123172499<\/a><br>you can browse whatever site you want from reddit to pomf pomf but at the end of the day it has no bearing here dont bring it up and certainly dont treat this site like Reddit like using sage as a downvote or unnecessarily trippfagging for attention and respect the board culture","time":1493370466,"resto":123166035,"id":"x7DuKxv8","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123172963,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)05:09:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"What do you think a Reddit user looks like?

People raise kids out of wedlock just fine all the time...It all depends on whether the father is involved and supportive and in some cases how much the rest of the extended family can help out as well. My contention is that we are averse as a society to hearing about increases in out of wedlock childbirth rate because that generally means it&#039;s in lower class Urban minority and rural white communities where those structures are not in place and father&#039;s aren&#039;t around. So that&#039;s where you get the cycle of crime, drug use, and abuse. But if we see an uptick in out of wedlock birthday among middle and upper class Millennials, I&#039;m not sure we&#039;re destined to see the same pattern. The out of wedlock nature of the birth is not a result off negative economic factors or the father refusing to be a part of the family, but rather young people simply not valuing the institution of marriage.","time":1493134238,"resto":122742461,"id":"8eoFZnMa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122745552,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)11:30:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122742461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122742461<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be me <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have crush on girl<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ask her to prom<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;she says yes<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;couple months later<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Anon I&#039;m having a baby.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;itaintmine.mp3<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gets angry at me for being angry about this<\/span><br>Women were a mistake.","time":1493134238,"resto":122742461,"id":"\/KjuKdVv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122745607,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)11:31:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122742756\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122742756<\/a><br>All you jackoffs were so busy taking the bait you didn&#039;t notice<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(((Weissman)))<\/span>","time":1493134263,"resto":122742461,"id":"Wr+L+Twm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122745700,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)11:31:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122745200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122745200<\/a><br>im not jewish<br><br><a href=\"#p122745333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122745333<\/a><br>im 23<br><br><a href=\"#p122745363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122745363<\/a><br>im embarrassed to share an ancestor with you emil","filename":"IMG_20170425_1933039542","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1920,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493134311145,"time":1493134311,"md5":"GQ+LRXIWuPfe4\/UjWVrIXQ==","fsize":661353,"resto":122742461,"id":"ZT2KGbDl","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122745712,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)11:31:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122744658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122744658<\/a><br>It is a difference in values, not in external control.<br><br>Your grandma didn&#039;t have the same values that your female cousins do.<br>Someone who grows up watching Sex and the City will have a different view on what sex is for than someone who grows up with a more traditional education.<br><br>The same is true for men.

The reason why so many women are having kids outside of wedlock is because of weak men who refuse to put a ring on it. Women truly believe all the bullshit you tell them, when you tell a girl you love her and want to spend the rest of you life together just to fuck her, she really believes it. We are a lost generation, we wont get to all marry lithe 18 year old farm girls like our grandfathers, but thats no excuse to remove yourself from the gene pool and contribute to white genocide. You need to bite the bullet and marry the least damaged roastie you can find and have lots of white children and raise them right.

You can only control your actions. If you think jews control the media, then start your own station and produce pro white media. If you think all the politicians are pro israel, than go to law school and become a politician yourself. If youre not smart enough or dont have the work ethic to make a change yourself, donate and support people who do. The problems are solved by everyone do either small part. They dont get solved by refusing to marry a millennial girl just because she fell for the jewish lies and retreating back into your safespace basement. They dont get solved by naming the jew without doing anything to fix it. Like i said we are a lost generation, we dont get the ideal life we all talk about, but hopefully if we make the right choices from now on, we can give our kids that life. Look at germany in the 1920s, it was filled with prostitues for every fetish you could imagine including mother\/daughter teams. The first thing hitler did was clean out berlin, burning the jewish propaganda and pornography, but did he send all those who fell for their lies to the camps? no, he encouraged marriage and traditional values so that the next generation wouldnt fall for it.<br><br><a href=\"#p122751601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122751601<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cortisol<\/span><br>i had never heard of that, but i have never ridden a cycle","time":1493138233,"resto":122742461,"id":"ZT2KGbDl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122753767,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:43:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122742461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122742461<\/a><br>It doesn&#039;t matter marriage is a joke anyway, it always has been. it doesn&#039;t make up for shitty parenting skills.","time":1493138619,"resto":122742461,"id":"\/\/e0x9Bh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122754836,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:52:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122742756\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122742756<\/a><br>I rather not knock up a psycho cunt and have her ruin my career with biased lawsuits thanks.<br><br>Enjoy your degradation into misery.","time":1493139151,"resto":122742461,"id":"rJgm1BPv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122754917,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:53:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122750201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122750201<\/a><br>Nailed it mate.

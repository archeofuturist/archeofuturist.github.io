People raise kids out of wedlock just fine all the time...It all depends on whether the father is involved and supportive and in some cases how much the rest of the extended family can help out as well. My contention is that we are averse as a society to hearing about increases in out of wedlock childbirth rate because that generally means it&#039;s in lower class Urban minority and rural white communities where those structures are not in place and father&#039;s aren&#039;t around. So that&#039;s where you get the cycle of crime, drug use, and abuse. But if we see an uptick in out of wedlock birthday among middle and upper class Millennials, I&#039;m not sure we&#039;re destined to see the same pattern. The out of wedlock nature of the birth is not a result off negative economic factors or the father refusing to be a part of the family, but rather young people simply not valuing the institution of marriage.","time":1493134238,"resto":122742461,"id":"8eoFZnMa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122745552,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)11:30:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122742461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122742461<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be me <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have crush on girl<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ask her to prom<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;she says yes<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;couple months later<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Anon I&#039;m having a baby.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;itaintmine.mp3<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gets angry at me for being angry about this<\/span><br>Women were a mistake.","time":1493134238,"resto":122742461,"id":"\/KjuKdVv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122745607,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)11:31:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122742756\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122742756<\/a><br>All you jackoffs were so busy taking the bait you didn&#039;t notice<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(((Weissman)))<\/span>","time":1493134263,"resto":122742461,"id":"Wr+L+Twm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122745700,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)11:31:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122745200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122745200<\/a><br>im not jewish<br><br><a href=\"#p122745333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122745333<\/a><br>im 23<br><br><a href=\"#p122745363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122745363<\/a><br>im embarrassed to share an ancestor with you emil","filename":"IMG_20170425_1933039542","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1920,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493134311145,"time":1493134311,"md5":"GQ+LRXIWuPfe4\/UjWVrIXQ==","fsize":661353,"resto":122742461,"id":"ZT2KGbDl","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122745712,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)11:31:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122744658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122744658<\/a><br>It is a difference in values, not in external control.<br><br>Your grandma didn&#039;t have the same values that your female cousins do.<br>Someone who grows up watching Sex and the City will have a different view on what sex is for than someone who grows up with a more traditional education.<br><br>The same is true for men.

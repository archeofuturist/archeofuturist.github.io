I&#039;ve spent a few weeks in there and I&#039;ve never seen such a passively aggressive nation and believe me I travel A LOT.

Shit&#039;s worse than the usual big brother stuff. Yeah sure they are a happy nation when everybody is popping pills and doing drugs. And they don&#039;t seem THAT wealthy.

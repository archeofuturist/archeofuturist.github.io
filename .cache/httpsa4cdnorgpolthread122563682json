I&#039;ve spent a few weeks in there and I&#039;ve never seen such a passively aggressive nation and believe me I travel A LOT. And I don&#039;t think it&#039;s only because of the nanny state since the people voted this socialistic shit in not the other way around. And the fuck is wrong with the ubiquitous Law of Jante? Shit&#039;s worse than the usual big brother stuff. Yeah sure they are a happy nation when everybody is popping pills and doing drugs. And they don&#039;t seem THAT wealthy. When it comes to cars and housing it looks like a 3rd world hell hole yet everybody is waving flags like crazy and shouting their favourite universal answer &quot;Yeah but Denmark is better.&quot;.<br>Is this &quot;Desilusion: The Nation Edition&quot;?","filename":"gettyimages-594735632","ext":".jpg","w":594,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":151,"tim":1493022954217,"time":1493022954,"md5":"n06QHZpBK2SFBKrk3xOxNw==","fsize":77602,"resto":0,"id":"IxaL9Iyu","country":"CZ","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-the-hell-is-wrong-with-denmark-ive-spent-a","country_name":"Czech Republic","replies":16,"images":2,"unique_ips":12},{"no":122564106,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:42:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Luk roven din fede polse gnasker","time":1493023345,"resto":122563682,"id":"oT1F\/q6R","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":122564414,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:46:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122564106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122564106<\/a><br>Also these idiots spend all their taxes on schools to learn a perfect English and then don&#039;t use it AT ALL.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You can&#039;t explain this shit<\/span>","time":1493023596,"resto":122563682,"id":"IxaL9Iyu","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":122565398,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:01:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122564414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122564414<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Czech Republic.<\/span>","time":1493024516,"resto":122563682,"id":"muHRkGx9","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":122565895,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:09:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122565398\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122565398<\/a><br>That&#039;s the saddest part m8.

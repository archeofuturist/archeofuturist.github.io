He was raised from the time he was a boy to be a prophet who would tame the religion of Judaism by injecting Zoroastrian beliefs into it. He was killed by Jews because his teachings were becoming too popular. Jesus was a Jew by birth but a Zoroastrian magi by religion. There is evidence of this in the Bible itself.","time":1491251968,"resto":119375026,"id":"g9yWg\/l6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119377439,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)16:41:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119376831\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119376831<\/a><br>oh hahah i guess i forgot those parts<br>good point<br>...Read the KJV twice, and I&#039;m about half way through genesis on the NIV and you forget those details","time":1491252088,"resto":119375026,"id":"2a4QHYC2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119377683,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)16:43:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119377222\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119377222<\/a><br><br>k, but what about now. today, the 3rd of April 2017?","filename":"FOR_Ukraine","ext":".jpg","w":1065,"h":709,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491252213454,"time":1491252213,"md5":"2+4sEAQVfig6JYrroEecaA==","fsize":304062,"resto":119375026,"id":"wwQRyqQH","country":"PL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Poland"}]}

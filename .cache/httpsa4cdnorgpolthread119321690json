Liebeck was in the passenger&#039;s seat of a 1989 Ford Probe which did not have cup holders. Her grandson parked the car so that Liebeck could add cream and sugar to her coffee. Liebeck placed the coffee cup between her knees and pulled the far side of the lid toward her to remove it. In the process, she spilled the entire cup of coffee on her lap.[9] Liebeck was wearing cotton sweatpants; they absorbed the coffee and held it against her skin, scalding her thighs, buttocks, and groin.[10]<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Liebeck was taken to the hospital, where it was determined that she had suffered third-degree burns on six percent of her skin and lesser burns over sixteen percent.[11] She remained in the hospital for eight days while she underwent skin grafting. During this period, Liebeck lost 20 pounds (9 kg, nearly 20% of her body weight), reducing her to 83 pounds (38 kg). After the hospital stay, Liebeck needed care for 3 weeks, which was provided by her daughter.[12] Liebeck suffered permanent disfigurement after the incident and was partially disabled for two years.[13][14]<\/span><br><br><a href=\"#p119327132\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119327132<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qU0<wbr>EJS3cJIc<br><br>Beats the crap out of here, goes and then comes back to choke her out.

We had an Assault Weapons Ban enacted in 1994. But there was no &quot;tragedy&quot; to push it, and they had to agree to compromise. The law had a ten year sunset clause, meaning that without additional action it would expire in 2004, which it did. It also had a grandfather clause, which allowed already existing &quot;banned&quot; guns and magazines to remain. And finally the law defined an Assault Weapon as a gun having three or more of the following features. Semiautomatic with a detachable magazine, a pistol grip, flash hinder, bayonet lug or collapsible stock. So most manufacturers simply deleted everything but the pistol grip and detachable magazine and kept right on making them. And it resulted in the AR15 going from a rich man&#039;s toy to becoming the most common semiautomatic rifle in the U.S.. And unfortunately, the British and Australian governments learned from that. They waited for the gun cultures in their respective countries to dwindle and then lowered the boom when tragedy occurred. Our gun control politicians tried the same thing when Sandy Hook happened. Except our gun culture had grown and it would have been political suicide for most politicians to back any gun control measures.","time":1491231518,"resto":119321690,"id":"YNdonfkU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119336833,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)10:59:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119324448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119324448<\/a><br>I wonder why they&#039;re taking the time to refer to him as the home owners son, why not just call him the home owner.

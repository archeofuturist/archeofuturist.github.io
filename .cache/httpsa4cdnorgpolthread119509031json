The two minerals balance each other out in your body. When you have too little zinc, copper often accumulates in various storage organs in your body. So when ejaculating everyday you can easily get a zinc deficiency, which could also lead that you have too much copper in your body. I personally had the following symptoms: can&#039;t concentrate anymore, acne, oily skin, hair loss, dandruff and fatigued. After 15 days since I started NoFap I can already focus better, more energy, dandruff disappearing, acne almost gone but still experiencing hair loss.

They gave as good as they got, and they were able to keep a presence in the streets for hours. <br><br>Everything that we have vocalized about the Trump presidency, that it has mobilized racists and fascists, that it emboldens them, that it allows them to present their bigotry as simply another political opinion, is coming true. <br><br>In the aftermath of this event, It is time for some serious reflection. Now is not the time to sugar coat the truth, to revel in the feeling of success of a clean punch to a Nazi&#039;s face, but rather to take a step back and ask what organizational steps can take place to stop this from happening again. What tactics can we use to disrupt their events, even when there are similar numbers to our own? What differences must we put down, and alliances we need to create, in the resistance to fascism? <br><br>My thoughts are with our comrades in the Bay who were injured today.

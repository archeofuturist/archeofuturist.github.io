At the basic level he seems like a typical bluepilled guy, democrat, lawyer, anti gun, huge supporter of big government, hates cops, etc. But he also fucking HATES Jews. He openly admits that he is antisemitic and Jews are the cause of most of the world&#039;s problems. Since he&#039;s been in law for 40+ years he has a massive amount of first hand experience with Jews and he knows all about their bullshit. He&#039;s also extremely anti-PC, he believes in the George Carlin approach to words just being words, and he cracks nigger jokes and stuff like that all the time. Yet again he is a huge supporter of leftist movements and government programs. I don&#039;t understand how he can be so redpilled about the Jews but be so bluepilled about all of the agendas that Jews are pushing.","filename":"1471624730981","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490899459445,"time":1490899459,"md5":"49JOzpveOqOuxngWblX\/8A==","fsize":103732,"resto":0,"id":"BgsMfZTJ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"do-you-know-anyone-who-blurs-the-line-of-bluepill","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

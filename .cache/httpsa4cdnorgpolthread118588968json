Under Bulgar command, the entire invading Byzantine army was destroyed. The Bulgars, although the ruling class, were much less numerous than the Slavs and Thracians, of which there were many, and therefore quickly assimilated into Slavic culture (although many aspects of Bulgar and Thracian culture remained), until by the 10th century they had adopted the Slavic language, with the Bulgar language going extinct in the kingdom (Bulgaria also created the Cyrillic alphabet :D). This is what happens when the Bulgars were &lt;1% of the total population. Yet the country has their name, which is astounding! Bulgaria is the oldest country in Europe that hasn&#039;t changed its name since it was first established!<br><br>Between 600-900AD, basically we&#039;re just warring back and forth with the Byzantines and growing. Christianized in the 9th century as well.","filename":"1490321377118","ext":".png","w":1920,"h":1259,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":163,"tim":1490662894461,"time":1490662894,"md5":"JGjXVJhm7krVuT49kp97pw==","fsize":758761,"resto":0,"id":"qcm1zQjD","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-happened-in-your-country-between-600-900","country_name":"Canada","replies":3,"images":2,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118589930,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:09:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118588968\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118588968<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be american<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there was no real civilization on this continent before columbus<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;none of the natives had written language so if there were significant events then nobody knows about them anyway<\/span><br>I guess some savages probably killed some other savages with rocks between 600 and 900AD","time":1490663398,"resto":118588968,"id":"jMcRFawp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118590421,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:11:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118589930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118589930<\/a>","filename":"aboriginal","ext":".jpg","w":327,"h":265,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":101,"tim":1490663499377,"time":1490663499,"md5":"4GzOMO5TPimrElWZIjk4KQ==","fsize":33944,"resto":118588968,"id":"qcm1zQjD","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118592366,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:29:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118589930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118589930<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be prairie nigger<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;walk everywhere<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no horses to ride because ancestors ate them<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;try to build a casino<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fail because no white people<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;doesn\u2019t matter because no meth or booze to buy with profits<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;decide to jerk off<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fail because masturbation hasn\u2019t been invented<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;get eaten by a bear<\/span>","filename":"ChiefLuigi","ext":".png","w":719,"h":548,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1490664585838,"time":1490664585,"md5":"C2+8nQbOpMuYP2EH\/wqpAw==","fsize":445905,"resto":118588968,"id":"jXZwPoxQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

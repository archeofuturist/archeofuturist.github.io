The warmest year on record refers to the INSTRUMENTAL RECORD, that is, the record that dates back to 1880, that&#039;s as far back as our actual observational data go. Any temperature records from paleoclimatology are approximated and inaccurate. There aren&#039;t temperature records from the paleozoic or the vast majority of the phanerozoic. The only other readily reliable temperature records we have go back a few hundred thousand years, and are from ice core specimens, and these only measure the relative temperatures of the poles, or high altitude locations.

In fact, when temperatures and CO2 in the atmosphere is high, mass extinctions have occurred. The largest mass extinction even in Earth history, the Permian-Triassic, occurred at a time of massive CO2 ppm increases in the atmosphere due to massive volcanic activity over millions of years. 96% of marine species went extinct, and over half of all genera. A likely reason for this extinction was due to the clathrate gun hypothesis, in which methane clathrates at the sea floor were released due to warming temperatures in the ocean due to increased CO2. <br><br>He also neglects to mention that life on Earth in the past didn&#039;t include a human civilization of nearly 8 billion people, with an economy based on fossil fuel usage and agriculture that is vulnerable to climate change, as well as over half the population living within a few miles of the coastline, meaning our civilization is very vulnerable to climate changes.","time":1490285087,"resto":117937467,"id":"jdky8aGi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117946908,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)12:05:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117946741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117946741<\/a><br>1 degree over a hundred years isn&#039;t very fast.

We find that since the mid-twentieth century, greenhouse gases contributed 0.85\u00b0C of warming (5\u201395% uncertainty: 0.6\u20131.1\u00b0C), about half of which was offset by the cooling effects of aerosols, with a total observed change in global temperature of about 0.56\u00b0C. The observed trends are extremely unlikely (&lt;5%) to be caused by internal variability, even if current models were found to strongly underestimate it. Our method is complementary to optimal fingerprinting attribution and produces fully consistent results, thus suggesting an even higher confidence that human-induced causes dominate the observed warming.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.nature.com\/nclimate\/jour<wbr>nal\/v6\/n2\/full\/nclimate2876.html<br>https:\/\/www.acs.org\/content\/acs\/en\/<wbr>climatescience\/atmosphericwarming\/c<wbr>limatsensitivity.html<br>https:\/\/www.ipcc.ch\/pdf\/assessment-<wbr>report\/ar5\/wg1\/WG1AR5_Chapter08_FIN<wbr>AL.pdf<br>http:\/\/rspa.royalsocietypublishing.<wbr>org\/content\/464\/2094\/1367","filename":"ngeo1327-f3","ext":".jpg","w":946,"h":671,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1490285572051,"time":1490285572,"md5":"DEZlewQ\/\/62Zm5p7MHSAZQ==","fsize":96878,"resto":117937467,"id":"jdky8aGi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117948002,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)12:14:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117946741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117946741<\/a><br>It really hasn&#039;t.

It is already clear the positive effect that it is having in Asia; but even in Russia, with whom we&#039;re supposedly on the brink of war, we are in a better position to negotiate than we were a week ago. A week ago, the &quot;muh Russia&quot; narrative would not have allowed Rex to meet with Putin for several hours and discuss US-Russia relations. Now people are begging for a detente.<br>The only relationship Trump has actually damaged is the one with Assad, and he was never going to be our friend. Trump does not operate on one-dimensional principles, like Rand. He acts in the interest of producing a desired result, and that is exactly what we are seeing here.

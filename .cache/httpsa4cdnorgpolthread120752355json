Are syrians have fears of renewal strikes on their objects?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A: Today we discussed it with mister President. It&#039;s strongly resembles me events of 2003 when UNSC U.S representatives showed so-called &quot;chemical weapons&quot; which they discovered in Iraq. After this they started military company which led to distruction of counrtry, increasing of terrist treat and appearence of ISIS on internetional scene. All the same going on now, and they partners acting like a yes-man. In this regard i recall our great wrighters Ilf and Petrov, I want to say: &quot;Pretty boring, lads&quot;, we all all of this. As for cause of this happenings, everybody want to recover relationships with U.S. Many Eastern European countries take so-called anti-Trump posion un the course of electoral campaign, because of previous U.S. administration. Syria, Russia, common enemy is a very good platform for consolidation. We are ready to wait, however we hope it come to a some positive trend of cooperation. In the domestic american consumtion it is some political reasons, all political rivals of current President didn&#039;t disappear and if something happen they will blame him, i&#039;m sure.Now about a possibility of new strikes, we had an information from different sources that similar provocations, i have no other words for this, are preparing in other regions of Syria, which includes Southern suburb of Damaskus, wheres planning to put stealthily some substance and accuse the Syrian govermen in chemical weapons usage, but we sure any event of that kind should be officially investigated. We are being about to ask the UN-OPCW in Haague and we will make a decision after this investigation<\/span>","time":1492004116,"resto":120752355,"id":"HJ9bcLjF","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120755785,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:35:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Turkish security forces have held 43 foreign nationals who entered prohibited military zone on country&#039;s border with Syria in Kilis<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/twitter.com\/metesohtaoglu\/<wbr>status\/852137848006467585<\/span><br>T-thanks turkey...?<br>never thought i would say that","time":1492004122,"resto":120752355,"id":"NLVI5Uxt","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":120755906,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:36:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120755616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120755616<\/a><br>here you go champ","filename":"1475898556337","ext":".png","w":991,"h":759,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1492004198944,"time":1492004198,"md5":"8WfyMdBr6XIwESd1oe9nNw==","fsize":21877,"resto":120752355,"id":"aJKPMYmA","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120756070,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:38:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120755785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120755785<\/a><br>You really trusting the roaches word?Its just as worthless as the americans word","time":1492004300,"resto":120752355,"id":"MkjqNBFq","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":120756097,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:38:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120755555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120755555<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;five fives<\/span>","filename":"Checking hard","ext":".jpg","w":544,"h":499,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1492004311870,"time":1492004311,"md5":"81pXPMqQn0FkuqwvXrvULA==","fsize":42793,"resto":120752355,"id":"t\/5tg8d0","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120756105,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:38:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120753910\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120753910<\/a><br>the effect is not the problem here.<br>it&#039;s how you use it.<br>faggots here still don&#039;t believe that the SAA has been barrelbombing civilian area in a psychological purpose:<br>&quot;make people tired of this war and surrender&quot;.<br><br>this is why they target bakeries (memes aside), hospitals, infrastructure, dense civilian areas etc.<br><br>even the US does the same, like they did during WW2.","time":1492004319,"resto":120752355,"id":"k0feqLNA","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120756233,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:40:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120756070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120756070<\/a><br>I bet it&#039;s kurds trying to cross into syria who they stopped","filename":"1476263522185","ext":".png","w":1344,"h":756,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492004410005,"time":1492004410,"md5":"aeeeKWmAQoqjYRTMLJPxRA==","fsize":922879,"resto":120752355,"id":"NLVI5Uxt","country":"BE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":120756266,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:40:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120755555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120755555<\/a><br><br>wtf I am now an ISISsie","time":1492004431,"resto":120752355,"id":"Kjlufttd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120756317,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:40:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120755906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120755906<\/a><br>that one guy who nailed it though.","filename":"Pol on Assad&#039;s neck","ext":".png","w":846,"h":869,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492004458486,"time":1492004458,"md5":"CPpdNeh9nLjRPy9GlKzl8w==","fsize":72207,"resto":120752355,"id":"t\/5tg8d0","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120756338,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:41:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120755566\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120755566<\/a><br>Sure thing.","filename":"1491048149069","ext":".gif","w":360,"h":288,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1492004474287,"time":1492004474,"md5":"aI7CgWgN7bXrrOeF+R5jDg==","fsize":491886,"resto":120752355,"id":"OtSG+Lqt","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120756361,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:41:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120755906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120755906<\/a><br>thank you ausbro","time":1492004487,"resto":120752355,"id":"Xo7407lZ","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":120756387,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:41:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120755555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120755555<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I just had a guy who could only handle one finger!

Who benefits from a souring relationship between Russia and US? China. Who benefits from US being sucked into another middle east quagmire? Also China.<br><br>There maybe some truth in Trump bombing Syria to pressure China into taking a harder stance on North Korea. But North Korea is not Syria. Syria can&#039;t strike back at any important US allies (except Al-Qaeda and ISIS), while Seoul is only 40 miles from NK border. Then coincidentally, it was reported that China sent 150k troops to NK border, which has since been debunked by both Chinese foreign ministry and US DoD. But the message is out. It was also reported that China opted for US coal instead of NK coal, but what the media didn&#039;t mention is China suspended importing coal from NK in February, and only for one year to fulfill the quota. The Global Times (CCP mouthpiece) opinion piece that threaten to bomb NK? Released BEFORE Xi&#039;s meeting with Trump.<br><br>China paid lip service (you could say they sucked Trump&#039;s cock) to stroke Trump&#039;s ego. Trump feels good and leave them alone on critical issues and call it a win. Remember when Trump was going to walk back from One-China policy? The minute he reverted his position, China granted his company hundreds of millions worth of trademarks. It appears they&#039;ve succeed yet again in doing so.","time":1492006521,"resto":120752355,"id":"Nd5Horrn","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":120759748,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:15:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120759254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120759254<\/a><br>1973 War Powers Act","time":1492006549,"resto":120752355,"id":"HJ9bcLjF","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120759785,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:16:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120758930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120758930<\/a><br>Anyone else feel you can&#039;t trust Russian posters?","time":1492006575,"resto":120752355,"id":"FVV1LLD7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120759878,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:17:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120759421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120759421<\/a>","filename":"map-airfields","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492006623858,"time":1492006623,"md5":"Syuh9Y\/y2IZu0Qa9K8xWkQ==","fsize":170100,"resto":120752355,"id":"zzpGiknL","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":120759892,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:17:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Whole human family<\/span><br>Who the fuck is this guy","time":1492006635,"resto":120752355,"id":"kFMMQreb","country":"BA","country_name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"no":120759971,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:18:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120758950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120758950<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tomalak misayls<\/span>","time":1492006687,"resto":120752355,"id":"W0e08i7K","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120759984,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:18:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120758950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120758950<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;59 tomawack <\/span><br>kek","time":1492006691,"resto":120752355,"id":"Tj0P9ZpC","country":"MK","country_name":"Macedonia"},{"no":120760045,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:18:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tomawack missiles<\/span>","time":1492006728,"resto":120752355,"id":"NLVI5Uxt","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":120760087,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:19:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120759878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120759878<\/a><br>Thanks kikebro","filename":"1489588495597","ext":".jpg","w":663,"h":1012,"tn_w":81,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492006748607,"time":1492006748,"md5":"rhcL6FXSklVsYbc6S7sOZg==","fsize":116178,"resto":120752355,"id":"c8TJDNBB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120760124,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:19:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stakes in Syria are very high. We all know why. Two paths lie before us. One is more outrages, destruction and death, stoked by regional and intl divisions, or even escalation and deeper confrontation. That is what all Syrians feel and I share their feels. But there is another discussion, a rallying for ceasefire. We need a consensus among major stakeholders to support completely the UN led peace process, as per 2254. We have made modest and incremental progress. 5th round saw no breakthroughs, but no breakdowns either. Parties engaged in substance for 9 days. Discussions were business like and on final day they told me, all of them, they are ready to return to Geneva for 6th meeting. Governance issues, constitutional issues, election and counter-terrorism were topics, with goal of political transition while preserving sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Syria. Delegations prefer to focus on different issues, gaps are still wide, but everybody engaged. Discussed principles of character of a post-transition state. One day all of these discussions must come together for a package negotiation. I felt growing appreciation for basis of transition must be legally and constitutionally solid, well-mapped and agreed upon. Syrians must participate in this. But now, this fragile progress is in grave danger. Talks were overshadowed by intensification of fight. Hard to reach areas, displacement, Thousands fighter evacuated to Idlib, etc. Political statements issued after geneva talks are concerning. GOvt intention to reconquer all syrian territory withou negotiations. Some opposition supports more battles with intl backing. We witnessed horrors of chemical weapons on innocent syrian victims.<\/span>","time":1492006768,"resto":120752355,"id":"cZSJGMG6","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120760156,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:19:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120759892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120759892<\/a><br>de mistura, as neutral as a un envoy can get i guess","time":1492006784,"resto":120752355,"id":"NLVI5Uxt","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":120760262,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:20:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Anyone here know how to identify al nusra front or isis?

Hundreds injured, 86 died. Symptons point to use of nerve agent, probably Sarin based mix. US decision to strike airbase is testimony to gravity of threat, sent mssg that regime would have known already. France proposed draft resolution which is simple and balanced text that condemns attack, reaffirms UN support, and seeks verification of act. What is at stake is bring council around at key objective with is to stop CW. Beyond CW tragedy, all of Syria is landscape of devastation, cessation of hostilities by Astana process no longer exists. Regime never respected ceasefire. Regime is tightening by refusing humanitarian convoys. This is deliberate policy of prevarication, causing people to flee, in contravention of UNSC resolutions and HR law. Guarantoors of syria are responsible for all this. RU must walk its talk. Respect the Astana ceasefire and allow humanitarian assistance. We need more inclusive observation mechanism, since swept last year Fra called for this. Some may deny evidence, we cannot continue as Apr4 attack did not take place. We cannot pretend this chaos and devastation is not Assads fault. Pol solution is more urgent than ever. As long as this regime is in power bc of complicity of those propping it up, there will never be peace in Sryia. Refugges have no hope of returning home and we will never have oppo to tackle terrorists. Pressure to bear on stakeholders so they can engage in good faith in negotiations. In conclusion, recent developments have mode lines and shown that urgency of need of pol transition, creating conditions for re-engagement of all leading players.<\/span>","time":1492008173,"resto":120752355,"id":"cZSJGMG6","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120762544,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:42:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120762401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120762401<\/a><br>23\/59","time":1492008177,"resto":120752355,"id":"srZhkUpx","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":120762647,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:43:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120752660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120752660<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;allies winning ww2<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;carpet bomb german civilians<\/span><br>what&#039;s the point<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;US winning war on Japan<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;double tap with nukes<\/span><br>what&#039;s the point<br><br>Dresden, Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki confirmed false flags","time":1492008223,"resto":120752355,"id":"NM1yX+9y","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120762815,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:45:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120762533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120762533<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Respect the ceasefire<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;when it was the moderate memers who broke it<\/span><br>Can&#039;t make this shit up.","time":1492008310,"resto":120752355,"id":"iyCcaGZ\/","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120762862,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:45:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120762212\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120762212<\/a><br>Such ideology as you described is called trotskiism and it makes damage to health, it can damage your head literally. &quot;world revolution&quot; was stopped many times by sharp objects<br><br>i assume you are shabothgoy","filename":"1912097","ext":".jpg","w":390,"h":601,"tn_w":81,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492008332906,"time":1492008332,"md5":"DLABh\/vGmxfhDkkQY6UT2Q==","fsize":49328,"resto":120752355,"id":"ecu4n2BT","country":"UA","country_name":"Ukraine"},{"no":120762928,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:46:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"So where can I find the resolution that US, UK and france proposed or it&#039;s main points?","time":1492008366,"resto":120752355,"id":"kFMMQreb","country":"BA","country_name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"no":120762932,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:46:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120762401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120762401<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.rt.com\/news\/384333-puti<wbr>n-idlib-attack-provocation\/<br><br>guaranteed<br><br><a href=\"#p120762647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120762647<\/a><br>disrupt German logistics and to feed the anglos and jews their needed hun blood <br>To send a political message to the USSR and test the effects of nuclear weapons on human targets","time":1492008368,"resto":120752355,"id":"1jMAyiES","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120762953,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:46:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120761496\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120761496<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wrong side of history<\/span><br>The \u00bbwrong side of history\u00ab is about striking people with fear.

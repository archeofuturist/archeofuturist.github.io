You can raise a family in moderate comfort in comparison to previous generations. You can know you won&#039;t die on any given day if you follow simple rules and reduce free-thinking. <br><br>Zombie apocalypse, complete freedom but no security. Blow shit up but die at any moment. Constant struggle but moral quandaries are ever present. <br><br>Not entirely sure if this is a reasonable \/pol\/ question but kind of curious who would choose which. Also, it won&#039;t be some The Walking Dead type shit. <br><br>Pic moderately un-related. Although, in the dystopian future you can have a bride given by the state if you&#039;re superior genetically. You&#039;ll probably bump uglies with a shit-tier mountain girl if choose the latter.","filename":"1472839152064","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1331,"tn_w":202,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493072569303,"time":1493072569,"md5":"OZo79BK\/c++ep6h9Yij3tA==","fsize":139488,"resto":0,"id":"+2YdT+18","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"zombie-apololypse-or-dystopia","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

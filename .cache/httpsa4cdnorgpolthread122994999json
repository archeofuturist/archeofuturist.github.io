The first person stated that it was State&#039;s Rights, while the other argued that it was solely about slavery. <br><br>So, who&#039;s right, \/pol\/? From what I studied in college, the bigger picture was about states rights while slavery was the catalyst. And researching this topic has left me confused. All the sources I looked up say that states rights was a myth. This baffled me because I remember there being a lot of tension between the North and South that was non-slavery related such as which annexed states get to be part of the North or South and how much political power the North had against the South. Are these details really insignificant because slavery was the bigger incentive?","filename":"c08c67a5-5936-4baa-b9e9-abc42cda68e8","ext":".jpg","w":3000,"h":1906,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":158,"tim":1493267527405,"time":1493267527,"md5":"q5biESP29nNkyEHeiCFoow==","fsize":909913,"resto":0,"id":"3jJ1IoUA","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-i-overheard-a-conversation-today-between-two","country_name":"United States","replies":19,"images":2,"unique_ips":16},{"no":122995357,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:35:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"state&#039;s rights is the later revisionist version. original declarations of war by the southern states are available online. all put slavery as the first, often sole, issue.","time":1493267730,"resto":122994999,"id":"+hCAHE2o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122996208,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:44:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122994999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122994999<\/a><br>Bot generated thread.","time":1493268254,"resto":122994999,"id":"AO2pATnR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122996516,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)00:47:30","name":"OP","com":"<a href=\"#p122996208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122996208<\/a><br>Lolwut?

I bet you learned in school that slaves were universally treated horribly and white people where awful, but this simply just isnt true. Of course there are outliers where yes they were treated bad, but there were also blacks who wished to stay with their masters because their lives were better under them.

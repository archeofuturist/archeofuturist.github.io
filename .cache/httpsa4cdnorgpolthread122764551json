What you&#039;re refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU\/Linux, or as I&#039;ve recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.<br><br>Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.<br><br>There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine&#039;s resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU\/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU\/Linux!","filename":"123","ext":".png","w":600,"h":509,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":106,"tim":1493154454494,"time":1493154454,"md5":"6EZIMtdwFRl+Maob0DI2oQ==","fsize":638437,"resto":122764551,"id":"0ZQudwqE","country":"CR","country_name":"Costa Rica"},{"no":122787570,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:07:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122765415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122765415<\/a><br>You don&#039;t?","time":1493154462,"resto":122764551,"id":"qWIF12gG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122787573,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:07:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122764551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122764551<\/a><br>THEY SAY THAT MY VIBE IS TOO DARK MY EYES ARE TOO HARSH","filename":"download (11)","ext":".jpg","w":259,"h":194,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493154463092,"time":1493154463,"md5":"OXue4DhaGwesVDS6wvlYFg==","fsize":7448,"resto":122764551,"id":"alsf\/I3m","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122787616,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:08:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122782782\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122782782<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You mean its cheaper to build a fucking island and build a bigass skycraper on it than make a space hotel?<\/span><br><br>Unironically, literally yes.","time":1493154483,"resto":122764551,"id":"Idn6o\/o3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122787657,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:08:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122766468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122766468<\/a><br>Ugly as fuck<br>Looks like it was designed for 3 year olds at a tard school","time":1493154505,"resto":122764551,"id":"qWIF12gG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122787716,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:08:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122787549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122787549<\/a>","filename":"stallman_slap","ext":".jpg","w":460,"h":450,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":122,"tim":1493154534839,"time":1493154534,"md5":"HlJ0UwNBtTLUtyV8I3C9Vw==","fsize":206431,"resto":122764551,"id":"9NGx\/3zX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122787835,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:09:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122778688\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122778688<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;comparing Carmack&#039;s god-tier code with that shit on the right that does nothing<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;calculates the larger of two numbers<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if(a &gt; b &amp;&amp; b &lt; a)<\/span><br><br>Fuck me all the way dead.","filename":"1339817032439","ext":".gif","w":320,"h":184,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1493154580074,"time":1493154580,"md5":"WlP8opRcUwwLNQsp3jcfMQ==","fsize":1718298,"resto":122764551,"id":"5JPYsj8d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122787957,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:10:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122787487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122787487<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Never been an astronaut that was an interior decorator<\/span><br><br>Most are ex military and shit hanging out all over the place in a workspace is unsat.","time":1493154638,"resto":122764551,"id":"BqBYy12T","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122788008,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:11:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122771608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122771608<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wow astronauts are infront of greenscreens but they&#039;re in space infront of greenscreens.<\/span>","time":1493154666,"resto":122764551,"id":"wQIs7TJh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122788030,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:11:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122785875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122785875<\/a><br>It&#039;s not a reflection.<br>It still actually moves a little.","time":1493154677,"resto":122764551,"id":"Y3KbYIdi","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122788172,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:12:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122771485\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122771485<\/a><br>Trust me, those retards are actually up there<br>Ever since the ISS was built nothing but faggots have been sent up there and it&#039;s disgusting just how low standards are for astronauts in other nations.

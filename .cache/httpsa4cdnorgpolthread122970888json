You&#039;d think that if you have less money you should spend it more wisely but they spend it on shit that has fuck-all to do with space like aid to muslim countries and &quot;climate change&quot;. Despite all the corruption and bureaucracy of the military industrial complex, they would get boots on Mars with far greater speed and efficiency than fucking NASA.","filename":"one guy doing all the work","ext":".jpg","w":1873,"h":1200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":160,"tim":1493255504356,"time":1493255504,"md5":"p8drZZ1Tl8U2gqTQio0oAQ==","fsize":941382,"resto":0,"id":"w7XLwd0\/","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"several-forms-of-powerful-nuclear-propulsion-have","country_name":"United States","replies":21,"images":4,"unique_ips":20},{"no":122971197,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)21:14:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"If you think sending astronauts to Mars is easy, I&#039;ve got news for you.","time":1493255656,"resto":122970888,"id":"hd+dMrDF","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122972605,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)21:25:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"For starters the launch window only happens like every 2 years","time":1493256340,"resto":122970888,"id":"wCn5nW3+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122972980,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)21:28:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122970888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122970888<\/a><br>how many of them u think have herpes?","time":1493256536,"resto":122970888,"id":"GmUEwpcg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122973029,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)21:29:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Spend enough time in a low gravity environment and your eyes start turning to jelly.

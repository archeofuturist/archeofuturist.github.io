Of course it\u2019s best to start with google, but instead of going to Wikipedia like a normal Saturday. I decided to check out buzzfeed for lulz. Anyways, I found this article: https:\/\/www.buzzfeed.com\/hannahjewe<wbr>ll\/inventions-by-women-that-changed<wbr>-the-world?utm_term=.ef14zeqoGl#.xu<wbr>dYD9nbeP<br><br>It\u2019s about 18 inventions women apparently invented. So I went through the list (researching every single one obviously). And I\u2019ll list the ones that check out and the ones that don\u2019t, but first I had to change my definition of an actual invention vs. something else. This is because I noticed a ridiculous focus on patents and not on the actual way the inventors invented the invention or \u201cidea\u201d. As if the focus was on getting it clear to the public that it was HER idea.<br><br>I decided not to use a dictionary definition of an invention, but a list of qualifications specifically listed for women. Just so it is actually HER invention and not a collaboration or \u201cadvice\u201d from her part. The qualifications are:<br><br>-The female inventor invented the invention without help from a man<br>-She didn\u2019t accidentally stumble on to the idea<br>-She actually worked on it, and did not just give advice<br>-She designed the first of its kind OR she modified an existing idea immensely.<br>-If it\u2019s an idea that spawned an entire franchise of idea\u2019s, it must be an amazing contribution.","filename":"rosie-riverter","ext":".gif","w":350,"h":417,"tn_w":209,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490462613536,"time":1490462613,"md5":"faH0VooAqdq+bwnGXqsSlQ==","fsize":64598,"resto":0,"id":"IHlU0i9E","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-i-decided-to-do-some-research-on-female","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118247011,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)13:23:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"The ones that check out:<br><br>1843, Nancy Johnson, Ice cream maker<br>*note: Apparently this checks out, on the patent anyways. Theres very little known about her, but her device is still used today. I\u2019ll give her the A++ of the female inventions. According to the text, she did it all by herself and made ice-cream available with ease.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1871, Margaret Knight, Paper bag machine<\/span><br>*note: Paper bags allready existed but she made a machine that made it with a square bottom. This was short-lived, because Charles Stilwell made it better and well usable and he was the one making money from it. Although, it checks out. Apparently, miss Knight was a patent hungry female, just like most of the women on this list.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1843, Ada Lovelance, note-G<\/span><br>*note: I was extremely sceptical on this one, because I learned the same thing in school when I was blue-pilled. I just couldn\u2019t believe a woman wrote the first computer program. And I was right, mostly. Ada Lovelance, was one of the few people that \u201chelped\u201d Charles Babbage on the first analytical machine that was never built. Actually Babbage had the idea and started building it, made 24 \u201ccomputer\u201d programs 6 years before Lovelance\u2019s notes. To add: Lovelance actually just translated writings of an Italian mathematician and within her translation she added notes, in which note-G had the most complex non-erronous computer program for BABBAGE\u2019s machine. This totally checks out, she did do this, and she contributed, that\u2019s why she\u2019s on this list. She did contribute and her idea was used. But did she write the first computer program? No. Did she invent the machine? No. She just contributed, and should not be glorified as being smarter than men like the uni makes her sound like.","time":1490462638,"resto":118246964,"id":"IHlU0i9E","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118247066,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)13:24:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"The ones that did not check out:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1893, Margaret A. Wilcox , The first car heater<\/span><br>*note: I couldn\u2019t find any evidence of her building the first car heater? The only thing google found was the same article where her name is mentioned. One website suggested that she invented the way the heater looked, but apparently it was inefficient and her idea was just ignored by the actual inventors of car mechanics. It\u2019s all just very vague.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1904, Elizabeth Magie, Monopoly<\/span><br>*note: Apparently, she did invent the landlords game. I checked the game, and it looks like you only lose in the game and it just doesn\u2019t seem entertaining. It apparently gave \u201cinspiration\u201d to build monopoly designed by teachers in Atlantic City and sold on to the Parker Brothers. The landlords game is a pretty standard design for a board game. She in no way contributed to the actual monopoly game except for inspiration. Inspiration, like mentioned before like \u201cadvice\u201d isn\u2019t the actual invention.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1887, Anna Connely, The fire escape<\/span><br>*note: she invented the bridge of a fire escape, not the actual fire escape, those already existed. The bridge is fine, but some things are just common sense. We have the same issue here with patent ridiculousness. I don\u2019t find an addition like this an actual contribution. It\u2019s just like inventing the \u201cjail\u201d spot on monopoly. You didn\u2019t invent the game, you just invented DLC.","time":1490462668,"resto":118246964,"id":"IHlU0i9E","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118247135,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)13:25:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;1882, Maria Beasly, Life raft<\/span><br>*note: just like the ones before, this fits in the \u201cimprovement\u201d or addition.

The patent writes: \u201cThe object of this invention is to improve the raft described and claimed in my Letters Patent of the United States numbered 226,264, and dated April 6, 1880, so that it may be more readily used.\u201d The article blatently states that she casually invented the life raft: \u201cOne day in 1882, Maria Beasely looked out at the sea and said, \u201cPeople should, like, stop dying in huge transportation disasters.\u201d And then she invented life rafts.\u201d<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1947, Maria Telkes, residential solar heating<\/span><br>*note: Thomas Johann Seebeck invented the first thermoelectric power generator (which Telkes is praised for) however, Telkes is apparently called the \u201csun-queen\u201d by peers. I couldn\u2019t find anything on her actually inventing residential solar heating, but I can guess she contributed \u201csomething\u201d, just like the other women on this list.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1914, Florence Parpart, the first electric refrigerator<\/span><br>*note: On pinterest, the only thing I could find about her was: \u201cNot much else is known about the inventor of the refrigerator, Florence Parpart.\u201d As far as Wikipedia is concerned: Fred W. Wolf of Fort Wayne, Indiana actually invented the refrigerator. I could find nothing else on this woman, except the fact she is in this article on 10 websites not unlike buzzfeed.","time":1490462707,"resto":118246964,"id":"IHlU0i9E","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118247167,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)13:25:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; 1899, Letitia Geer, single-hand use medical-syringe<\/span><br>*note: I searched for an hour for this invention, and I discovered that her invention isn\u2019t the mainstream used syringe at the time. Actually, syringes were pretty usable with 1 hand, the only thing as far as I noticed she added, was a \u201chook\u201d so you could grab it more easily. Syringes from the 1600\u2019s were pretty usable single handedly. They had the index and middle finger extensions already, and also the thumb press thingy. Syringes were already optimized, she just added a hook, it\u2019s just not worthy of a mention.

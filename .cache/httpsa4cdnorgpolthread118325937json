In America we need change because under the covers most politicians and the 1% globalists have been selling out the American people for decades.<br><br>How do you get corrupt people to change? You give them terrible pain. Trump was put into power by our vote because we know he is going to be the worst president ever. Donald Trump is that very visible pain and that pain will inspire real change. It is all part of the plan of people that really love this country and love ALL the people in it. Would you rather have blatant disgusting Trump or sneaky Hilary? Choose the one who is mostly likely to inspire real change after 4 years...and that would be the in your face Trump,a man with a supersized ego who feels no need to strongly cover his greedy moves. Trump&#039;s Tweets or Hilary&#039;s private e-mail server are both bad, but seeing how government fails via a public twitter feed is priceless. We deserve better. In sum folks, Kek is the god of chaos...who has a frog&#039;s head (I am not making this up). According to the legend, out of Chaos comes order but you need chaos first. The sheeple outside of 4chan think KEK means LOL and we like it that way. It spreads the message faster. All hail the clan of kek!!","time":1490509624,"resto":118325937,"id":"sJB1PqKe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118330884,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)02:42:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118325937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118325937<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;drumpfkins<\/span><br><br>people still say this?<br><br>Really?","time":1490510534,"resto":118325937,"id":"vPlKf8X0","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"}]}

Although Socialist Korea&#039;s air force is not the most up to date, but it, along with her artillery and strategic rocket forces, are more than capable of wiping out American and SK airpower on the ground in a first strike scenario. After that it&#039;s game over for the Americans and South Koreans as the KPAF operates with total aerial supremacy while the KPA ground forces mops up any remaining resistance. The Korean People&#039;s Army is capable of conducting a shock and awe campaign that will make the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan look like children&#039;s games.<br><br>Socialist Korea has not only the military might, but more importantly the political will to wage total war against all imperialist forces and South Korean traitors until the final victory.","time":1492220856,"resto":121148243,"id":"0q6MyEk3","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121149966,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)21:48:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121148243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121148243<\/a><br>Literally nothing happened<br><br>No Nuclear test<br><br>No response","time":1492220889,"resto":121148243,"id":"V7rK0zgL","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121150111,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)21:49:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121149966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121149966<\/a><br>At least we know NKorea will easily pussy out.","time":1492220955,"resto":121148243,"id":"dfecP2kn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121150168,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)21:49:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121149389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121149389<\/a><br>the face of incessant American threats and provocations, nuclear arms are the most reliable deterrence to safeguard Socialist Korea&#039;s right to exist. <br><br>The Korean people do not want a war, but are not afraid of one.

In 2008, he paid Trump $95 million for a Palm Beach mansion \u2014 nearly $15 million more than the most expensive private property had sold for in the area at the time, and twice as much as Trump had paid for it four years prior. While Trump had invested some in the property, the closing price still represented a $50 million premium on what he had acquired it for. But that\u2019s not the only thing that was out of ordinary about the sale.<br>ADVERTISING<br><br>\u201cIt was out of the ordinary because of the uniqueness of the property, the speed of the transaction,\u201d David Newman, an attorney who represented Rybolovlev\u2019s ex-wife during the couple\u2019s divorce, told The Seattle Times. Newman said his team could never find any evidence that Rybolovlev had ever assessed the property, or hired anyone to perform an evaluation on it, before the sale.<br><br>\u201cIf someone is paying $90-something million, more than anyone else has ever paid for a private residence, one would think they might look around and do a little due diligence, or even have an inspection,\u201d Newman added.","filename":"1490190309613","ext":".png","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490261715211,"time":1490261715,"md5":"5VHmCGzbfQ+rp9DFfce8JQ==","fsize":431089,"resto":0,"id":"XwfHLpMj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dmitry-rybolovlev-a-russian-billionaire-whose","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":117912881,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)05:37:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"Seems like the globalists really need that war with Russia","time":1490261849,"resto":117912716,"id":"+5XysK8O","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117912953,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)05:38:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Rybolovlev owns a large share of the Bank of Cyprus.

Palmer Report discovered via Rybolovlev\u2019s flight records that not only has the Russian billionaire been following the president around the country, his travel itinerary also closely aligned with key events and meetings in the MI6 piss dossier. Records show Rybolovlev traveling to West Hampton on August 1, the same time that Michael Cohen, Trump\u2019s longtime lawyer, was in the area, according to geotagged tweets. From there, Rybolovlev traveled to Dubrovnik, Croatia, where Jared and Ivanka Trump were vacationing at the time. He then traveled to Budapest, Hungary, which is only 85 minutes by air to Prague, Czech Republic \u2014 the city Cohen swears he\u2019s never visited.","time":1490261905,"resto":117912716,"id":"XwfHLpMj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117913006,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)05:39:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117912716\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117912716<\/a><br>OK this is good, sauce?","time":1490261954,"resto":117912716,"id":"P8M7U6\/i","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":117913146,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)05:41:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"it paints a picture of a two-week span in which 1) Dmitry Rybolovlev meets with Michael Cohen in the Hamptons to arrange or prepare for the Russia blackmail meeting, then 2) Rybolovlev travels to discuss the matter with Donald Trump\u2019s daughter and son-in-law, then 3) Rybolovlev travels to Prague to reunite with Cohen and meet with the Russian envoy.<br><br>What was it that allegedly happened at that Prague meet-up, again?

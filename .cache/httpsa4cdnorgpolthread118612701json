He had a shitty video, sure, but it felt like there was a coordinated attempt to make him look like shit and to destroy his career. What was that about? Is it because he&#039;s one of the few intelligent commentators left who actually supports the free market and resistance to mass immigration? His videos and conversations are still vital, in my opinion, so I just want to see where the situation stands.","filename":"424","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490676726062,"time":1490676726,"md5":"Ukg3qkUSkTT6w5GSN5xshQ==","fsize":147994,"resto":0,"id":"bYr+KkBf","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"now-that-the-dust-has-settled-why-was-there-mass","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":8},{"no":118612786,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:53:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118612701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118612701<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is it because he&#039;s one of the few intelligent commentators left who actually supports the free market and resistance to mass immigration?<\/span><br>wrong<br><br>pic related","filename":"ross","ext":".png","w":971,"h":690,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1490676791077,"time":1490676791,"md5":"ndYn8461a4Do+yqS9lq3NQ==","fsize":586948,"resto":118612701,"id":"Y2DdMiZ0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118612930,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:54:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118612701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118612701<\/a><br>Because he&#039;s an uniformed moron who almost seems like a deliberate plant to discredit us by couching our viewpoints in poorly constructed arguments.","time":1490676890,"resto":118612701,"id":"K5YG5+Sj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118613005,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:55:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118612701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118612701<\/a><br>I&#039;m not a molymeme fan myself, but I can see why the leftypol\/antifa libshits on here would coordinate a mass shilling campaign against him since he does provides entry level redpills to thousands of normies on jewtube.

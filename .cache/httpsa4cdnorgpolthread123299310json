Realism has its place, but defeatism just leads to defeat! So here are some good happenings:<br>At least 350,000 people have registered to vote since the election was announced - most of them under 35!<br>The press - including the tabloids - have made a BIG story of Tory plans to raise National Insurance, VAT and abandon the pension triple lock (1) (2) (3 - warning Daily Mail link) Finally, some pressure on them. Its a good opportunity and Corbyn seized it by promising to keep the lock.<br>We&#039;re gunning with some populist policies that are going to appeal to many in the street. Its an interesting strategy and I think it will pay off. Its hard to outright distort such a policy and newspapers being negative makes them look very anti-worker.<br>Lets have our daily reminder of TORY ELECTION FRAUD.<br>All those extra members are converting to big volunteer numbers. Hard data is yet to materialise, but anecdotal evidence suggests we are beginning to get out in force. I\u2019m volunteering for the first time and I know many that are the same. 500 turned out in Stoke for the final weekend of campaigning and that formed the basis of a strong resistance against a UKIP swing.<br>Door knockers, leaflet posters and stall runners will help covert policies which are genuinely popular with the electorate to votes. They are there to be won! Or if Corbyn(ism) is not your gig, getting the word out about the many great candidates we have and their local records. We always come off well against some airlifted in toff who supported the local incinerator that everyone hates (okay, thats just my area.)<br>Please share your good news, experiences and stories!

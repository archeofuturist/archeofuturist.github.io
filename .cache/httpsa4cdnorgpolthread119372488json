It&#039;s like you&#039;re taxing yourself, stretching to your very limit, to come up with something that makes your pre-existing worldview make sense.<br><br>Jordan Peterson strikes me as a really shy, retiring type. I don&#039;t think he&#039;d strike any normal person any differently. If you&#039;re reading his personality dispassionately, you have to come to the conclusion that he has really strong convictions. Extremely strong. <br><br>I just can&#039;t figure out what in his personage you&#039;d get that image from. It&#039;s coming from so far out of left field. It&#039;s incongruent-- like an old school rapper in the grand ole opry. It&#039;s like you haven&#039;t really even read or watched any of his stuff at all-- you&#039;ve only heard about him from news articles, that even if they&#039;re not biased have no reason to mention his personality.<br><br>If you really want to attack Jordan Peterson&#039;s character, it makes far more sense to call him deluded. To say that he&#039;s loaded up on delusions of contact with the Christian God or something. That criticism would land-- he has said himself that he doesn&#039;t let exclusively let empirical &quot;truth&quot; guide his actions (though he has a convincing rationale for it). You could probably convince some people with that tack.

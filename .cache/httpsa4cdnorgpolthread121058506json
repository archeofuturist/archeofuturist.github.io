If Russia, France, Germany and Austria-Hungary worried about each other, then they would be less of a threat to Britain. By about 1907 it was becoming clear to Britain that the greatest potential threat to Britain was going to be Germany. The strong economy, large population and powerful armed forces of Germany seemed to be capable of dominating Europe. As a result, Britain began to support Russia and France. Britain joined the Triple Entente.<br><br>Despite being part of the Triple Entente, Britain was not committed to going to war in 1914. The Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, spent much of the summer of 1914 furiously trying to reassure Russia and Germany and prevent a war happening. Even when German troops invaded France and Belgium as part of the Schlieffen Plan, Britain did not have to go to war.<br><br>Germany hoped Britain would stay out of the war altogether. However, the Germans knew that Britain had promised to defend Belgium under the Treaty of London of 1839. The Germans wanted the British government to ignore the Treaty of London and let the German army pass through Belgium. The British government made much of their duty to protect Belgium. Belgium&#039;s ports were close to the British coast and German control of Belgium would have been seen as a serious threat to Britain. In the end, Britain refused to ignore the events of 4 August 1914, when Germany attacked France through Belgium. Within hours, Britain declared war on Germany. The Kaiser said how foolish he thought the British were. He said that Britain had gone to war for the sake of a &quot;scrap of paper&quot;.<br><br>Within a few more days, Britain, France and Russia (the Allies) were all officially at war with Germany and Austria-Hungary (the Central Powers). What had started as a small, local problem in the Balkans was turning into the biggest and most brutal war the world had ever seen.","time":1492176542,"resto":121058506,"id":"QuabGCot","country":"GB","trip":"!!cPFjrjAdPLx","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121060120,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:31:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121059640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121059640<\/a><br>Memeing Holland backfired","time":1492176670,"resto":121058506,"id":"nYbKvo0J","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121060151,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:31:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121059942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121059942<\/a><br><br>If only we had seen the future, fighting a brutal bloody wall costing millions of young men for a non-country that then would rule over you 100 years later.","time":1492176687,"resto":121058506,"id":"HNQ0wCF5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121060159,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:31:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121059942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121059942<\/a><br>Thanks Tony Robinson","time":1492176689,"resto":121058506,"id":"dCNmRjt+","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121060205,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:32:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121059227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121059227<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121059640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121059640<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the corner of some foreign field<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The gunner sleeps tonight<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What&#039;s done is done<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We cannot just write off his final scene<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Take heed of the dream<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Take heed<\/span>","filename":"2012319-night-fog-ddotg","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":392,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492176721246,"time":1492176721,"md5":"ydyJTLk5isXO4mD68bY1rA==","fsize":13802,"resto":121058506,"id":"be1xHJpl","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121060274,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:32:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"what happened to Kristenlad? haven&#039;t seen him in a while","time":1492176767,"resto":121058506,"id":"WUOnNDdh","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121060430,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:34:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Great Britain<\/span><br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/121049659#p121049659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121049659<\/a>","time":1492176869,"resto":121058506,"id":"uXM2k1Zx","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121060432,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:34:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121059640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121059640<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121059942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121059942<\/a><br>this lad, the Germans were petulant and ascending in industrially, it was inevitable. <br><br>I believe we signed a defence treaty with France? in relation to potential German aggression, after the Boer wars because Germany supplied weapons and aid to the Boers.

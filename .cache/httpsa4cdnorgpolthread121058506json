If Russia, France, Germany and Austria-Hungary worried about each other, then they would be less of a threat to Britain. By about 1907 it was becoming clear to Britain that the greatest potential threat to Britain was going to be Germany. The strong economy, large population and powerful armed forces of Germany seemed to be capable of dominating Europe. As a result, Britain began to support Russia and France. Britain joined the Triple Entente.<br><br>Despite being part of the Triple Entente, Britain was not committed to going to war in 1914. The Foreign Secretary, Sir Edward Grey, spent much of the summer of 1914 furiously trying to reassure Russia and Germany and prevent a war happening. Even when German troops invaded France and Belgium as part of the Schlieffen Plan, Britain did not have to go to war.<br><br>Germany hoped Britain would stay out of the war altogether. However, the Germans knew that Britain had promised to defend Belgium under the Treaty of London of 1839. The Germans wanted the British government to ignore the Treaty of London and let the German army pass through Belgium. The British government made much of their duty to protect Belgium. Belgium&#039;s ports were close to the British coast and German control of Belgium would have been seen as a serious threat to Britain. In the end, Britain refused to ignore the events of 4 August 1914, when Germany attacked France through Belgium. Within hours, Britain declared war on Germany. The Kaiser said how foolish he thought the British were. He said that Britain had gone to war for the sake of a &quot;scrap of paper&quot;.<br><br>Within a few more days, Britain, France and Russia (the Allies) were all officially at war with Germany and Austria-Hungary (the Central Powers). What had started as a small, local problem in the Balkans was turning into the biggest and most brutal war the world had ever seen.","time":1492176542,"resto":121058506,"id":"QuabGCot","country":"GB","trip":"!!cPFjrjAdPLx","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121060120,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:31:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121059640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121059640<\/a><br>Memeing Holland backfired","time":1492176670,"resto":121058506,"id":"nYbKvo0J","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121060151,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:31:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121059942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121059942<\/a><br><br>If only we had seen the future, fighting a brutal bloody wall costing millions of young men for a non-country that then would rule over you 100 years later.","time":1492176687,"resto":121058506,"id":"HNQ0wCF5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121060159,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:31:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121059942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121059942<\/a><br>Thanks Tony Robinson","time":1492176689,"resto":121058506,"id":"dCNmRjt+","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121060205,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:32:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121059227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121059227<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121059640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121059640<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the corner of some foreign field<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The gunner sleeps tonight<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What&#039;s done is done<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We cannot just write off his final scene<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Take heed of the dream<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Take heed<\/span>","filename":"2012319-night-fog-ddotg","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":392,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492176721246,"time":1492176721,"md5":"ydyJTLk5isXO4mD68bY1rA==","fsize":13802,"resto":121058506,"id":"be1xHJpl","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121060274,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:32:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"what happened to Kristenlad? haven&#039;t seen him in a while","time":1492176767,"resto":121058506,"id":"WUOnNDdh","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121060430,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:34:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Great Britain<\/span><br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/121049659#p121049659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121049659<\/a>","time":1492176869,"resto":121058506,"id":"uXM2k1Zx","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121060432,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:34:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121059640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121059640<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121059942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121059942<\/a><br>this lad, the Germans were petulant and ascending in industrially, it was inevitable. <br><br>I believe we signed a defence treaty with France? in relation to potential German aggression, after the Boer wars because Germany supplied weapons and aid to the Boers.

saw me handing out fliers for the Beady Union. I&#039;d seen these dudes around before wearing nazi uniforms and stormhelms and shit so when one of them asked me what I was advertising I tried to play it off like it was nothing; I told him he probably wouldn&#039;t like it but he insisted I hand him the flier, as soon he saw it he called his friends over and said, I shit you not:&quot;Looks what he got ourselves a little beady eyed anglo BLOOD&quot;.<br>First time I&#039;d ever heard someone say &quot;Anglo&quot; to me IRL, I didn&#039;t know what to do, all I could manage to say was that I am not an Anglo, I was scared, they&#039;re all bigger than me and look like they lift. <br>He tore up the flier and told me that if I am not an Anglo, I sure look like a &quot;little beady eyed anglo pig&quot; they all laughed and walked off. Needless to say I was shaking, I&#039;d worn my SMASH THE ARYAN RACE shirt to campus before and had no problems, this was first time I&#039;d ever been harassed for my views.<br>Now whenever I see any of this group they&#039;re always call out shit like &quot;hey its the Anglo! Why don&#039;t you follow your ancestors and get Blitzed?&quot; one of them even made a bee-line for me across the hall making STUKA divebomber noises and would&#039;ve shouldered me if I didn&#039;t move out of his way in time. <br>IDK what to do, there&#039;s no way I could fight them, and I don&#039;t want to risk it with the university anyway, fighting on campus is serious offense. <br>This is happening at least once a week, some times more, its getting to the point where IDK what to do, yesterday I almost had a panic attack thinking about having to go back to

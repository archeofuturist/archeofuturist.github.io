Where did those come from when the sumerians where the first, and why are the people discribed always the same if they were just made up?<br>The sumerians believed the blue eyed white people where gods, the annunaki. The Aztecs as well, and describe them from coming over the sea with a ship that moved on its own. The chinese talk about blue eyed and blonde haired people who created the first civilization and ruled in the early time. A lot of egyptians mummies are shown to have had blonde hair etc. the we wuz kings stuff was probably just created to rob whites of their heritage<br>Diving a bit into \/x\/ territorry here:<br>Hitlers Ahnenerbe tried to find out about the origins of the white people, and maybe he did find out something (((they))) absolutely fear which is the reason (((they))) try to destroy whites so furiously, more than any other ethnicities.<br>Later on Hitler went to antarctica, created New Swabia (which by the way seems to be still claimed by Nazi-Germany while Norways claim ended in 1945 https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_S<wbr>wabia ) and again a lot of cultures speak about a realm beneath the earth, like shangri la for example, and civilization is said to exist there as well.<br>Another interesting thing is that &quot;Paradise&quot; in the bible originally came from the word meaning &quot;walled enclosure&quot; which would be pretty much fitting into the inner earth. Did Hitler find out that the whites came from the inner earth, the biblical paradise, and from there spread their knowledge with others.

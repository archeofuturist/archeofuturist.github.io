I think the sheer amount of complexity brought on by the internet, esp. in the case of social media, has most likely had some incredibly negative consequences at the socio-cultural level. I have a hunch that there is some kind of biological limit to the amount of social complexity humans are cope with (kind of like a Dunbar&#039;s Number of sorts) and the internet for all its good, has catalyzed an increase in social complexity unprecedented in history. It could very well be that being connected to information and people across the whole world is way too much for many people to handle.","time":1493589639,"resto":123520983,"id":"jOWl8o9m","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123533736,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)18:02:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123525353\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123525353<\/a><br><br>I agree with this.<br><br>I can&#039;t stand placing a bid project on Freelancer to have every 3rd world tier nigger &amp; their inbred cousins offer me their their equally shitty tier services for my design projects.","time":1493589771,"resto":123520983,"id":"BDdumR5c","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

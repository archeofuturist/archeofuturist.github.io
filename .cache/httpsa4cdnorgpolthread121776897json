You couldn\u2019t say he was ever loved. Someone writing in to the London Review of Books dug up the BBC\u2019s audience research reports on Savile\u2019s first appearances on Top of the Pops. \u201810 Dec 1964. Jimmy Savile, who introduced the programme on this occasion, was obviously disliked by a large number of the sample audience. Many indicated their aversion to this artist by remarking that anything they had to say about him would be \u201cquite unprintable\u201d, whilst comment by those who freely expressed their feelings was liberally larded with such terms as \u201cthis nutcase\u201d; \u201cthis obnoxious \u2018thing\u201d; and \u201cthis revolting spectacle\u2019 You don\u2019t have to be loved, or even liked, to be a popular figure. Savile didn\u2019t even have the love-to-hate appeal of a national pantomime villain such as Simon Cowell. His ticket to fame was his grotesquerie itself (and this grotesquerie meant that one of the most initially unnerving things about the revelations was being forced to think of Savile as any kind of sexual being). As Andrew O\u2019Hagan argued in his piece on Savile for the London Review of Books, what mattered in the new world of television light entertainment was not likeability, or talent, but a certain larger-than-life aura \u2013 call it eccentricity, or call it derangement which Savile easily possessed as his birthright. Even those who found Savile creepy could accept that he \u2018belonged\u2019 on television. After all, where else could he possibly belong? The problem was that, after the 60s, if you belonged on television, there was nowhere that wasn\u2019t open to you.<br><br>At the time when Savile was abusing, the victims were faced, not with Jimmy Savile the monster, Jimmy Savile the prolific abuser of children, but with Jimmy Savile OBE \u2013Sir Jimmy Savile \u2013 Jimmy Savile, Knight Commander of the Pontifical Equestrian Order of Saint Gregory the Great. When we ask how Savile got away with it all, we must remember this.","time":1492573285,"resto":121776897,"id":"Oi2as7Rd","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121795840,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)23:42:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121795180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121795180<\/a><br>He does the best turkeys.","time":1492573326,"resto":121776897,"id":"dVE5s4G1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

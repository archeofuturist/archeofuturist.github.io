Democrats will put forward some manufactured and embarrassingly artificial candidate that can achieve their insect like agenda, while Gabbard will resonate with most people and seem like the common sense pick. Democrats will run the media and social manipulation machine 24\/7 until they find a meme that the public responds to so they can bring Gabbard down. Maybe she said something benign like &quot;No, I don&#039;t really believe women can be as sexually promiscuous as men in our culture.&quot; Feminists will latch onto it while snarling and drooling blood that someone would DARE to not support women sleeping with as many partners as they can. OR they will latch onto Gabbard so viciously and for all the wrong reasons (&quot;SHES A WOMAN AND MUST LEAD!&quot;) that it will turn people off to her. Trump supporters will just smile and maybe occasionally give the public a push. Eventually that most annoying of breed, the Reddit millenial Democrat, will play armchair political strategist and put forward some stupid argument like &quot;well...we can&#039;t support Gabbard because Robo-candidate is just the most viable option because it has the support of popular billionaires like Saul Niggerman and we have to go with viability. Here, let me cite a midterm paper I wrote for my political science course&quot; and that will be a wrap.","time":1490628355,"resto":118510204,"id":"SkseVuOd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118522770,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)11:26:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118518340\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118518340<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; She<\/span>","time":1490628379,"resto":118510204,"id":"oAlS8U2s","country":"KG","country_name":"Kyrgyzstan"},{"no":118522882,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)11:27:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118510204\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118510204<\/a><br>This guy","filename":"giphy (1)","ext":".gif","w":480,"h":265,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1490628451487,"time":1490628451,"md5":"PYQ7Wb00Jb10SmGI7\/YQZA==","fsize":1516168,"resto":118510204,"id":"awPYbQRw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118523571,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)11:33:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118510204\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118510204<\/a><br>I would wanna see Tim Kane vs Trump in a DEBATE!

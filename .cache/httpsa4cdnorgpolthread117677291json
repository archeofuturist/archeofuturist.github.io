Almost all of my time on \/pol\/ is to laugh the day away while I wait for trades to either materialize into winners or losers. If you&#039;re wondering how to factor a race war into your positions, you first need to truly define what you mean by &quot;race war.&quot; Then you need to decide what is the probability of a race war according to your definition. You then would have to estimate what sort of value it would have on your positions in the event it occurred. Even if you were able to quantify every required variable, you would still have that phantom beast of &quot;uncertainty&quot; that could negate all of your efforts and render your trades as losers. So ultimately I think unless you really believe a race war has a good chance of happening, you&#039;re better allocating your time and efforts to taking into consideration the impact of variables that more easily accounted for. This is an even bigger waste of time of trying to value and structure a trade around the possibility of a CEO dying in a car crash or something of that nature.","time":1490136941,"resto":117677291,"id":"3OmKiP2m","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117683286,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)18:56:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117682155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117682155<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this would be a civil conflict<\/span><br>I agree at its onsett but the civilians have low moral for long term wars, and low organization.

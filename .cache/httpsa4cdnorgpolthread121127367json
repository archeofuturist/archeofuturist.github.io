The current drug used to treat said parasite, for which he holds the patent in the US, dates from the 1950&#039;s and doesn&#039;t do a very good job. This parasite is exceptionally rare and only affects around 2k people in the US each year. As a result of the age of this drug, it&#039;d be very cheap for a long time. As a result of the rarity of the parasite, most hospitals and clinics that keep a dose of the drug on hand had their samples expire due to the aforementioned rarity of the parasitic condition. Shkreli hiked the price of the drug, the cost of which would have been almost entirely born by insurance companies, not the patients, in order to fund research into a new and better treatment. He also made a public guarantee that if someone somehow &quot;fell through the cracks&quot; and didn&#039;t have coverage or couldn&#039;t afford the drug that he&#039;d send them a dose for free at no expense to the patient. <br><br>This is actually very common practice in the pharmaceutical industry, to hike the price of treatment in order to fund new drugs. Shkreli has pointed to notable examples of such practices including those instances by Merck pharmaceuticals, a major company in the industry. People only hate Shkreli because he pulled off a real-life trolling job and has a punch-able face. Whatever defects in his personality there may be, HE DID NOTHING WRONG.","filename":"anchorman","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":420,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1492211571940,"time":1492211571,"md5":"nKm98kGomEry1TyUmLoiLg==","fsize":47182,"resto":121127367,"id":"VCbay1Xq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121129990,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:12:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121129841\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121129841<\/a><br>What do you mean sources?<br><br>If by sources, you&#039;d like to hear it from Martin himself -- just use google and listen to one of his interviews.<br>Aside from that, it&#039;s really, really basic and fundamental business practice.","time":1492211574,"resto":121127367,"id":"QNtsRpcN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121130102,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:13:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121128996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121128996<\/a><br>No he isn&#039;t he wanted to speak to him<br>He&#039;s called him stupid several times in his livestreams","time":1492211633,"resto":121127367,"id":"FZp1KwZ+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121130210,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:14:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121127544\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121127544<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he fell for the assmad serb memes<\/span><br><br>He&#039;s actually a nice guy like most Albanians.","time":1492211687,"resto":121127367,"id":"24GKUPeJ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121130257,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:15:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121127367\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121127367<\/a><br>we know it&#039;s you","filename":"90b","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":780,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492211710949,"time":1492211710,"md5":"WAZE7Sl6Ew58GF2LW2Hq5A==","fsize":38273,"resto":121127367,"id":"lBgCkGTs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121130284,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:15:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121129985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121129985<\/a><br>This is a fuller explanation than I gave.<br><br>Price gouging does occur, but what Martin did was absolutely not an example of anything remotely close to price gouging.","time":1492211726,"resto":121127367,"id":"QNtsRpcN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121130513,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:17:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121129868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121129868<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Serb cumskin<\/span>","filename":"IMG_2421","ext":".png","w":912,"h":629,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1492211848727,"time":1492211848,"md5":"vs1gziGyILtWCBIT9DGdkg==","fsize":635181,"resto":121127367,"id":"24GKUPeJ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121130621,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:18:20","name":"Krist\u00f3fer has no upperbody strength","com":"<a href=\"#p121127367\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121127367<\/a><br>shitgrin daddy&#039;s boy.<br>good at business but a faggot overall.","time":1492211900,"resto":121127367,"id":"FBQ0Fh7w","country":"IS","country_name":"Iceland"},{"no":121130679,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:18:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121127367\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121127367<\/a><br>he fucked over jew insurance companies and prolly killed some fags","filename":"self sacrifice","ext":".jpg","w":790,"h":894,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492211930188,"time":1492211930,"md5":"Fjc+1rmjMKyYacdb\/2ARjQ==","fsize":253278,"resto":121127367,"id":"AEjYdL8G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121130899,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:20:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Okay, so he did a relatively normal business practice. <br><br>Then why did the media go after him?

I&#039;ll try to type about how I personally view it, though.<br><br>It occurred during a divisive election in which healthcare was the forefront issue (socialized vs privatized healthcare). <br>The media (and I don&#039;t mean this to sound as redundant or biased as it might seem) is typically left-leaning, because those who consume pop. culture news are typically left-leaning themselves. It&#039;s nice to read a single headline that satiates whatever political bias you might have. So, when one story is printed in a way that is palatable to someone, it catches on. <br>Politics is inherently two-faced. Politicians need to convince voters to vote for them, and very often, that means that they need to spout nonsensical things. Hence, Hillary and Bernie preached about how Martin&#039;s actions were evidence of corporate avarice and conspiracy. The average voter has a very limited knowledge base (you shouldn&#039;t expect otherwise), and they eat this kind of stuff up. When these same politicians enter office, they&#039;ll very often not act on these &quot;promises,&quot; because they simply don&#039;t make for sound policy. And then voters complain that Congress isn&#039;t doing its job -- when really, they are.","time":1492212829,"resto":121127367,"id":"QNtsRpcN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121132674,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:35:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121132496\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121132496<\/a><br>I see, thank you.","time":1492212916,"resto":121127367,"id":"xyT6SfSh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121132737,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:35:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121132496\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121132496<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When these same politicians enter office, they&#039;ll very often not act on these &quot;promises,&quot; because they simply don&#039;t make for sound policy.<\/span><br><br>I&#039;d argue that you&#039;re seeing this with Donald Trump right now.

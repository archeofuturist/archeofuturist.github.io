Benes was considered the father of modern Czechoslovakia which was created as part of the Treaty of Versailles, which everyone at the time admitted had flaws. The problem was that Czechoslovakia had more Germans in it than Slovaks. The Czechs made up a bare majority of the population, but enough to keep Benes in power.<br><br>There was no doubt that there was discrimination going on against the Germans by the Benes government. Unemployment was staggering in the German areas. Land was seized under &quot;land reform&quot; from German owners and distributed to Czechs. German companies were shut out of government contracts. Officials in German areas, like police and postal, were all Czechs. It could be said that Benes was conducting slow-motion ethnic cleansing as the German population dropped from 3.5 million in 1910 to 3 million in 1930.<br><br>The Sudeten Germans, led by Konrad Henlein, petitioned the League of Nations fourteen times for redress of grievances. The were not alone, the Slovaks did pretty much the same. The demands of the Sudetens was either: autonomy within Czechoslovakia or unification with Germany. Benes refused to consider either one.<br><br>Chamberlain sent Viscount Runciman on a fact-finding mission to determine the truth of the allegations and the Runciman Report pretty much agreed with all the accusations. The British sent Jan Smuts to see Benes and tell him &quot;fix this or your on your own&quot; and he came away with the impression that Benes couldn&#039;t understand why anyone would have an opinion different from his. Finally, between Hitler&#039;s threats to do something about the German problem and Benes&#039; refusal to do anything, the Allies decided that Benes wasn&#039;t worth sticking up for and signed an agreement with Hitler, which was really a modification of the Treaty of Versailles.","time":1493761195,"resto":123797839,"id":"SuuYOGL0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123823688,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:40:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123797839\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123797839<\/a>","filename":"thisbitch","ext":".jpg","w":563,"h":426,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1493761240640,"time":1493761240,"md5":"lZOi0fvMEnO2U84x\/20S\/g==","fsize":36996,"resto":123797839,"id":"W2kVVyOj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123823817,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:41:40","name":"Anonymous","filename":"V\u00e1clav Havel","ext":".png","w":290,"h":174,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":75,"tim":1493761300633,"time":1493761300,"md5":"15O9PQpS0DP4BljWxBFnaw==","fsize":71232,"resto":123797839,"id":"YkQ6dTId","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":123824561,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:47:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Churchill, dishonourable mentions to Blair and Heath.","time":1493761629,"resto":123797839,"id":"7oP65Lvj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123824778,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:48:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123804426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123804426<\/a><br>horseshit, post-modern historians agree that napoleon was actualy code word for love between man.

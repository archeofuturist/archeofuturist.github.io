People think it just means social globalism - open borders and free movement of peoples so immigrants can live anywhere at any time with no hassle.<br><br>Globalism is economical, cultural, and political. The ancient Silk Road is an example of economic globalism. The internet - where you can connect with millions of people from around the world, sharing ideas and data freely, is an example of cultural globalism.<br><br>What the Jews, big banks, powers that be, Illuminati - whatever you believe in - are doing by sending thousands of third world brown people into one area is not true social globalism. True globalism is two-way, which means those white people in England, France and Germany would have to move by the thousands to Syria, Afghanistan, India etc. In this way, social globalism fails and is much harder to achieve than political or cultural globalism.<br><br>I think when \/pol\/tards say they want to fight the globalists they don&#039;t really consider the ramifications of such a task. They just think it means fighting the jews who want to make one world culture of brown people. Or they want to fight the international banks, or liberal agenda.<br><br>But fighting globalism - really fighting it - means returning the world into an era of nation-states, like how it was in ancient times, with no global powers like the UN or the IMF, no free trade, no communication of languages, people and ideas. <br><br>The only logical first step to achieve this is to shut down the internet and all forms of electronic communication. But anons enjoy the internet and the wonders of globalization.","time":1492325830,"resto":121328636,"id":"7SJiuUys","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121331439,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)03:03:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121329902\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121329902<\/a><br>Holy shit, stop proxying faggot, no Australian would ever make such a screencap-worthy summary of reality","time":1492326209,"resto":121328636,"id":"PWO9WF\/6","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":121331677,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)03:06:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121330883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121330883<\/a><br>Interesting post.

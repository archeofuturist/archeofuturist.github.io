A mutation may very well makes a protein\/enzyme worse at digesting chitin. That doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s lost any &#039;information&#039; - that&#039;s not really a thing in genetics. There is no information. Genes, and by extension all living beings, are just extremely complex chemical reactions. You wouldn&#039;t say that nitrous acid (HNO2) has less information than nitric acid (HNO3)! They&#039;re just different chemicals. The same is true with genes, and the proteins which they synthesize. They&#039;re just different chemicals, and so they interact with other chemicals differently. So while the protein\/enzyme may very well be worse at digesting chitin, it is now likely to be better at digesting something else. If the environment has a lot of chitin, this is generally a bad thing for the organism. However, if the chitin runs out but something similar is available, then the organism with the &quot;defective&quot; chitinase may actually HELP the organism.

Once it is duplicated, sure, let&#039;s say that it doesn&#039;t provide new information (even though I don&#039;t think the word information should even be used in this way). After it&#039;s duplicated, let&#039;s say the new gene loses part of itself. So now you have the old gene, and then part of a duplicate. Since these are right next to each other, it&#039;s very plausible that the duplicated, but also modified, one could combine with the original. Maybe it&#039;s the portion separating them which is removed. There! Now you have a gene with &quot;new information&quot; added, but it happened BECAUSE of a deletion.","time":1491450684,"resto":119681313,"id":"Zp\/lhG2w","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119700838,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)23:52:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119699691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119699691<\/a><br>I fully agree.

During the cold months, the thicker fur bear is warmer, less likely to die to the cold, more attractive to the female and therefore more likely to mate. These genes will be passed on. Safe to say that this one mutation will cause a change in that particular species? Whether it be generations down the line or not, that is evolution.

All the theory of evolution by natural selection claims is that living beings experience random mutations, and the mutations which result in the most favorable phenotypes for the being&#039;s specific environment proliferate because those with the mutations are more successful, and so breed more, thus facilitating this mutation. Over very long periods of time, the living beings often change enough to where two groups which could previously interbreed are no longer able to do so. This means that each group will begin to drift in different directions (genetically) because mutations cannot be shared between them. This eventually results in speciation.

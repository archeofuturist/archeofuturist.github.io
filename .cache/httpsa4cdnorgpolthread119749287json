How does it feel to know that 36.9% of the UK&#039;s economy is from London? Maybe next time you Poortherners meet a Londoner you should thank him for the dole money you collect. <br><br>How does it feel to know every year millions of tourists come to see London while no one gives a fuck about your depressing Northern shit hole? How does it feel to know you have no culture or relevance to the UK never mind the world. <br><br>London is a land of opportunity which is why it is such a magnet for immigrants, I know you will respond that you &quot;Hate niggers and pakis&quot; but why? Is it that people can come from Ghana and Pakistan, work hard, build a career and make something of themselves all on their own merits while you Poorthern shits just sit their collecting dole and drinking cans of cider? Do the hard working immigrants make you feel bad for being such a lazy shit? I would take a million Asians, blacks and eastern Europeans over one of the lazy northern animals. <br><br>What is my conclusion? If you hate London you hate it because you can&#039;t hack it. You are not smart, quick or hard working enough to compete. You don&#039;t have the willpower to come down here and start at the bottom renting a flat and work hard until you eventually get that mansion in Hampstead. You hate it because everyone in London is doing something while you sit there doing NOTHING. Collecting dole.... Drinking warm cider out of a can.... I don&#039;t know if Poortherners cause more pity or more disgust.<br><br>London should become an independent city state and leave the rest of this shithole country to rot.","filename":"c38a3949e6965c90bf1e95ca4b5e59d7","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":372,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":232,"tim":1491489961706,"time":1491489961,"md5":"7qpcYd9QHuGcrVT\/ABRxlw==","fsize":35094,"resto":0,"id":"9kWxme73","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-does-it-feel-to-know-when-people-say-uk","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":33,"images":6,"unique_ips":23},{"no":119749453,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)10:47:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hey good for you man.","time":1491490068,"resto":119749287,"id":"AtPhuOUA","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":119751195,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)11:06:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119749453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119749453<\/a><br>Thanks","time":1491491217,"resto":119749287,"id":"9kWxme73","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119751237,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)11:07:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119749287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119749287<\/a><br>OP is cranky because his local pret-a-manager stopped stocking his favourite Syrian Semen Dip.<br><br>Also Yorkshire won more Gold medals in the olympics than the rest of the UK combined, Has one of the overall whitest percentages, Huge farmland expanses and literally killed a remain supporting MP<br><br>London on the other hand is about 60% Muslim and the other 40% is either foreign or Louis CK level cucks, Has a muslim Mayor and has one of the worst air quality levels in the world.","filename":"xyznxdvp5xix","ext":".png","w":1192,"h":1472,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491491247070,"time":1491491247,"md5":"YCeZ+SvrQw\/9nPxHZm11Xw==","fsize":572270,"resto":119749287,"id":"N0Mpk16X","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119751389,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)11:09:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119749287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119749287<\/a><br>Also <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Destroy the economy of the rest of the UK whilst spending millions on statues and foreign aid<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;36.9% of the economy&quot;<\/span>","time":1491491351,"resto":119749287,"id":"N0Mpk16X","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119751410,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)11:09:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119749287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119749287<\/a><br>None of that contribution to the economy is from migrants, its almost entirely the financial and banking sector, which aren&#039;t hiring some fucker from northern africa.","time":1491491361,"resto":119749287,"id":"4BJE8wx0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119751610,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)11:11:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119749287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119749287<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;people can come from Ghana and Pakistan, work hard, build a career and make something of themselves<\/span><br><br>Sounds like London is a real paradise.","time":1491491493,"resto":119749287,"id":"WNc1TVmm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119751624,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)11:11:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119749287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119749287<\/a><br>Alt right btfo","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":595,"h":553,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":116,"tim":1491491503246,"time":1491491503,"md5":"l4vmTPDeza3H31PAzQ4hWw==","fsize":123744,"resto":119749287,"id":"tFCUkrM6","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119751761,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)11:13:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119749287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119749287<\/a><br>Ha, you don`t see people being confused when they`re differentitating between Kanto region, Tokyo, and Japan","time":1491491593,"resto":119749287,"id":"9DPuRRiA","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":119752018,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)11:16:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119749287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119749287<\/a><br>That&#039;s right.","filename":"1408571358363","ext":".jpg","w":677,"h":525,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1491491775957,"time":1491491775,"md5":"Epmje51I+F8enzXg1bdv+Q==","fsize":74662,"resto":119749287,"id":"GqEN5lSc","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":119752134,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)11:17:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119749287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119749287<\/a><br>t. dole collector in his mum&#039;s back room<br>Mate, you&#039;re posting on 4chan&#039;s \/pol\/ board at 3.45pm in the afternoon.

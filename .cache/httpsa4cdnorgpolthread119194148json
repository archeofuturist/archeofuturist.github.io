Even if they are the nicest, hardest working people, they are still driving around in cars with out of state places and lapsed insurance (good fucking luck if one has had too many Tecates and decides to broadside you with their falling apart van or lawn truck), costing our local municipalities a fortune when they go straight to the ER for any injury\/illness. Of course they aren&#039;t even here legally so what&#039;s the fucking point in trying to get them to pay for the procedures? Furthermore, there is a large periphery of gang activity which has been selectively ignored by our wonderful center-left politicians until now. <br><br>If they are here illegally, they have to go. I don&#039;t buy the puppy-eyes &quot;oh I&#039;m just a poor ese, haysus por favor&quot; bullshit.

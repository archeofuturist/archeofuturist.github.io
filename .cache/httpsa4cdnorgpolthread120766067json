Putin&#039;s global political strategy seems to be about testing how far he can push things with the west, and he can only do this because of our rampant political correctness and our refusal to deal with reality.<br>Our politicians are docile and passive, and can only function within a bubble where other people think like them. They can deal with other western countries just fine, but they have no way of dealing with countries and governments that don&#039;t give a fuck about the imaginary rules that the west has set for itself. In the past, the west&#039;s political, military and economic power forced others to dance to our tune, but now that other countries have started catching up, they no longer have a reason to listen to us. China and Russia can more or less do what they want on a global scale, because they don&#039;t play by the same rules.

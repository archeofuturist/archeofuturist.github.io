Jamie McGoldrick, the UN humanitarian coordinator for Yemen, said Hudaida on the Red Sea, which is under the control of Houthi rebels, is a vital lifeline for Yemeni civilians threatened with starvation. He said the coalition needed to take humanitarian concerns into account while pursuing its campaign. \u201cThis port is the most essential, the most crucial part of our ability to feed people and get medical services\u201d into Yemen, McGoldrick said in Jordan\u2019s capital Amman. \u201cThe Hudaida port is the only port that we can use to serve the bulk of the population in need.\u201d The UN has appealed for $2.1 billion in international assistance for Yemen and McGoldrick said he hoped for commitments during an aid conference in Geneva next week.

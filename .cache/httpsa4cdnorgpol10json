We at \/pol\/ take pride in seeking to discover the true nature of reality. We always take the red pill. I&#039;ve noticed that Antifa is closely aligned with Black Lives Matter and that many Antifa genuinely believe that whites and cops are murdering black people at high rates. The problem with the belief is that our govt keeps detailed statistics on cop-involved shootings, and about murders in general and which races are murdering which races. So, my question is how do you defend this belief in the BLM narrative? Do you think the numbers are fake? Or have you never been exposed to this information? Or do you not understand statistics? I&#039;m genuinely trying to understand your mindset. <br><br>http:\/\/www.nationalreview.com\/artic<wbr>le\/429094\/black-lives-matter-wrong-<wbr>police-shootings","filename":"IMG_5475","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493132645280,"time":1493132645,"md5":"okZku6m4e2hRgzjCaGsVDg==","fsize":137373,"resto":0,"id":"CnrsL4E7","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dear-antifa","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":0,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":0},{"no":122744223,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)11:18:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122743605\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122743605<\/a><br><br>I disagree that they are retarded.

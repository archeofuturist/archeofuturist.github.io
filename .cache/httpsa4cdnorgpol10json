People will just believe what they personally want to believe and then try to find data and evidence that justifies it. But it doesn&#039;t have to be this way, at least when we&#039;re talking about economic systems. I mean sure, some people like not having a boss while others like strict hierarchy but that&#039;s only a difference in preference and debating it won&#039;t lead to anything. We have the statistics and we have the data. We have lots of pure, objective numbers and we can use them to determine which economic system is the best. In the end, the best economic system is the one that makes people the happiest (and we have lots of data on happiness), so what I&#039;m saying is...<br><br>...Can&#039;t we just make a huge simulation consisting of a bunch of hypothetical nations with various economic systems put in place and then compare them to see which one ends up having the happiest population?<br><br>We can have a computer simulate supply and demand, economic crises, every single person looking for a job, somebody&#039;s probability of finding a job given their skills, various companies competing or not competing, making different products etc. and see how everything works out under all the proposed systems from communism to capitalism. Sure, it&#039;s a fuckton of variables but it&#039;s 2017 and we probably have the required computing power. I heard Google will let you use their enormous amount of computer power if you give them an interesting enough reason. I think objectively calculating the perfect ideology and, as a consequence, potentially improving the lives of millions and maybe even billions of people is a pretty good reason.<br><br>SO WHY THE FUCK HAVEN&#039;T WE DONE THIS ALREADY?!","filename":"kulaksdeservedit","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492100066240,"time":1492100066,"md5":"yhds1ue09QpVpn9bVe6iZQ==","fsize":450342,"resto":0,"id":"XMIIV7P0","country":"HR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"theres-always-a-lot-of-debate-about-what-the-best","country_name":"Croatia","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":120905449,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)08:43:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLL<wbr>OLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLO<wbr>LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOL<wbr>OLOLOLOLOLOLOLLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL<br>why does he keep selling us out fellow pol-bros?","filename":"lol","ext":".jpg","w":845,"h":582,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":172,"tim":1492087430473,"time":1492087430,"md5":"9WRVw1O3w5JsZI2s2M1oZw==","fsize":77144,"resto":0,"id":"QyckFun4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lolololololololollololololololololl","country_name":"United States","replies":93,"images":24,"omitted_posts":88,"omitted_images":24},{"no":120922702,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)11:39:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120922600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120922600<\/a><br>fuck im too drunk for this kind of multidimenisonal thinking","time":1492097982,"resto":120905449,"id":"6fIzTcjc","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120923616,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)11:47:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Will these faggots ever accept the fact that Donald Trump is their president, no matter how much they bitch and moan, they can&#039;t change that fact.","time":1492098448,"resto":120905449,"id":"cqcQXw\/h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120924307,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)11:54:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120905449\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120905449<\/a><br>Are huffpo \/ourguys\/ now?","filename":"1488944738493","ext":".jpg","w":424,"h":498,"tn_w":106,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492098847047,"time":1492098847,"md5":"e3naFaxDdKzVBTfhXvwNCg==","fsize":63861,"resto":120905449,"id":"KuhvyWYf","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120924418,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)11:55:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120905449\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120905449<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Huff, Snuff &#039;n Puff Post<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a reliable source of news<\/span>","filename":"1491939065205","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492098913535,"time":1492098913,"md5":"3+4F4ISclfCOdDsjTJYv+Q==","fsize":13695,"resto":120905449,"id":"yKm9Gq7L","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":120926463,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:14:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120922600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120922600<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120921727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120921727<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120922702\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120922702<\/a><br>I love you finnbruh<br>I just drank a shot of vodka on your honor","time":1492100062,"resto":120905449,"id":"q9t9PWu2","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120902314,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)08:04:53","name":"Anonymous","sub":"JUCHE GENERAL- NO MOTHERLAND WITHOUT YOU EDITION!","com":"Back due to popular demand!

Local media reported that those two bodies were thrown from the same plane as the body that landed on the hospital. <br>The official did not know if the man was alive when he was thrown from the plane. Officials from the state prosecutor\u2019s office were at the scene, he said. <br>Local media reported that suspected gang members had picked up the two other corpses. <br>Sinaloa is the home state of Joaquin \u201cChapo\u201d Guzman, who ran the Sinaloa drug cartel until his arrest in 2016.

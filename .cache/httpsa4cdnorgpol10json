In contradistinction to these approaches, neuropsychiatric concepts and methods have received relatively little attention in this area. In this article we adopt a neuropsychiatric developmental perspective and undertake a review of the psychiatric literature on violence and autism spectrum disorders. Our analysis of this literature suggests the presence of an association between autism spectrum psychopathology and serial homicidal behavior. Recommendations for further research to help clarify the nature of this association are briefly discussed.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed<wbr>\/15568202","time":1490229591,"resto":117857089,"id":"M\/UxQJkA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117857059,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)20:33:21","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Hey BRITBONGS!

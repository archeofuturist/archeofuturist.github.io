I agree completely, but you have to remember, fusion is still in its early phases. This is why for the time being im not opposed to fission and fusion working together, so long as fission eventually gets replaced by fusion.<br>2. Fission will never get around the fact that it will still have the possibility to leak extremely harmful radioactive materials that could harm the surrounding ecosystem for centuries. That isn&#039;t an issue with fusion because it doesn&#039;t use highly radioactive material like uranium.<br>3. I get what you&#039;re saying, but Chernobyl still happened. 3 mile island still (almost) happened. Fukushima still happened.

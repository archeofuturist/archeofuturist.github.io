Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian.

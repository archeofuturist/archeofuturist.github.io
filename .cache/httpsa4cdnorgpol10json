information suggested that NKs threats were empty. Now, seismic activity in the region is increasing due to increased nuclear testing, and NK is claiming to have the technology for a mid-ranged icbm. <br>Finally, President Xi appears to be on board with Trump&#039;s desire to intervene. The most likely\/best case scenario is a quick infiltration of NK by China so they can install a more competent puppet government and retain a buffer from SK\/US military forces.","time":1492498374,"resto":121650782,"id":"XyNLG2R\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121651863,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)02:53:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"So I need a brief rundown; am I a Los Angeleno cuck, in any immediate danger?

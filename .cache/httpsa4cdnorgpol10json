This isn&#039;t actually a loan, although it&#039;s defacto treated like one. It&#039;s basically saying &quot;we&#039;ll back you for X amount of dollars, in exchange for you eventually paying that back plus interest.&quot; Sounds like a loan, right? But what&#039;s being loaned? Nothing. A fabrication. A ghost of money that doesn&#039;t actually exist. But the bank is stable and they did their math, so odds are pretty good you&#039;ll pay it back, or at least enough people will pay them back that they&#039;ll be fine if one or two don&#039;t.<br><br>Banks are so secure in this that they make investments based on what that loan repayment is worth. So they&#039;ll invest in X, using your nearly guaranteed loan repayment as collateral, and make money that way. Back in the day, lines of credit weren&#039;t as good and random &quot;runs&quot; on the bank where people all wanted to take their money out at once would cause huge issues because the banks never actually had that much money on hand. But that&#039;s not really the big problem. The issue this causes is 1) A certain class of bankers literally printing money for no actual value and 2) No value being added but money being created means inflation.<br><br>In National Socialist banking, every dollar created by had to actually represent an equal amount of work or product. If a government wanted to print 5 marks, they had to order 5 marks worth of autobahn to be built or whatever. That means government spending, even if it ends up being on corrupt favoritism shit, still ends up producing something. It usually ends up creating a lot of economic activity without rampant inflation.<br><br>This is a simplified version, but I hope that makes sense. the Natsoc generals on \/pol\/ have some great pastebins and videos that explain it better than I could.","time":1492660188,"resto":121939057,"id":"0SAcZwZB","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121947920,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)23:51:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121939393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121939393<\/a><br>This WILL get replies by nu-\/pol\/","time":1492660317,"resto":121939057,"id":"u21Wt6Yi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121950008,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:10:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"I prefer brunettes.","time":1492661444,"resto":121939057,"id":"INPxRgh9","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121948906,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:00:24","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Afraid Yet You Nazis?","com":"My comrades have acquired their first pushka, xer is my pushka!","filename":"1492637798122","ext":".png","w":830,"h":639,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":192,"tim":1492660824396,"time":1492660824,"md5":"pDeiNI+bWyngsqTaSAmaFQ==","fsize":192040,"resto":0,"id":"Wopqi+A6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"afraid-yet-you-nazis","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":4,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":1},{"no":121949497,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:06:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121948906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121948906<\/a><br>Shame that nugget is gonna not get cleaned after being fired and just sit in some cucks shed.","time":1492661169,"resto":121948906,"id":"Q0WulXJF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121949502,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:06:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121948906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121948906<\/a><br>I fear nothing","time":1492661171,"resto":121948906,"id":"1BS2elMV","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121949606,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:06:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121949427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121949427<\/a><br>We will strike fear into the hearts of all fascist dogs with our beautiful nazi blasters!

I could offer some advice.<br><br>The best advice is to call a cab or a friend to come pick you up. But, sometimes that is just not possible or feasible. So, I might get shit on for encouraging this, which I&#039;m not, but here&#039;s some tips where you can make it home without killing yourself or someone else:<br><br>Most important: Realize that you&#039;re fucked up and cannot drive the same way as when you&#039;re sober. Your reaction time is longer, so take it real easy.<br><br>Try not to be noticed. The way to avoid getting noticed is to keep your speed down and don&#039;t change lanes. Stay in the right lane and keep your speed down. If there&#039;s someone in front of you, suck it up and don&#039;t try to pass.<br><br>If your not careful, you might wind up going over the speed limit and a cop will first pull you over for speeding and THEN will realize your plastered. Cruise control is the drunk driver&#039;s best friend.<br><br>Roll down the window and let cold air blast you in you face. It&#039;ll keep you awake.<br><br>Driving on a straight monotonous road might allow you to pass out behind the wheel. A curvy, but not too curvy road might keep your mind active enough to avoid passing out.<br><br>Choose a route less traveled. Less traffic means less chance of hitting someone or something. Cops also don&#039;t usually hang out on roads with little traffic.<br><br>If you&#039;re pulled over, you&#039;re probably fucked. But, if you keep it polite and try to pretend you sober, maybe the cop might just slap you a ticket for what he pulled you over for. Whatever you do don&#039;t mouth off. In fact, talk as little as possible. This actually happened to me, but that was before they really started cracking down on this shit.<br><br>Realize just how drunk you are. If you just can&#039;t make it home, pull over somewhere like a parking lot and sleep it off.","time":1492851350,"resto":122248672,"id":"n44DOy6D","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122256728,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:00:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122253978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122253978<\/a><br>it&#039;s funny that nothing in this post checks out","time":1492851635,"resto":122248672,"id":"PRj8iUay","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122256474,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:56:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"Post yfw she lose and you realize the wave of the right wing politics is over.","filename":"marine-le-pen","ext":".jpg","w":961,"h":641,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492851379760,"time":1492851379,"md5":"fHQc5BT+eZO5vAehXUxzTg==","fsize":38177,"resto":0,"id":"IXqXoxur","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"post-yfw-she-lose-and-you-realize-the-wave-of-the","country_name":"Sweden","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":122256585,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:58:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"if you dont sage when posting ITT your mom will die in her sleep tonight","time":1492851487,"resto":122256474,"id":"W+IGwTQz","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":122256727,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:00:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122256585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122256585<\/a><br>You&#039;re not facing the reality that France has the largest mudshit and largest kike population in all of Europe.","time":1492851635,"resto":122256474,"id":"imtraSL4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122256503,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:56:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"Where were you when Antifa lost all of their credibility?<br><br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/bamanboi\/status<wbr>\/855701099910758400","filename":"IMG_4903","ext":".jpg","w":248,"h":189,"tn_w":248,"tn_h":189,"tim":1492851416786,"time":1492851416,"md5":"9+fk54UwqjLsD3A+fGsNAg==","fsize":32413,"resto":0,"id":"\/ESsFBKs","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"where-were-you-when-antifa-lost-all-of-their","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":122256720,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:00:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122256503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122256503<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Watching<\/span>","time":1492851631,"resto":122256503,"id":"j7CkmSaj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122256757,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:01:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122256720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122256720<\/a><br>Imagine getting cucked this hard in front of a giant group of people.

A man in a nearby car suddenly began yelling homophobic insults at them before exiting his vehicle and violently assaulting both Johnson and Williams. Johnson recorded the encounter on his phone, and the authorities quickly identified the alleged assailant as Steward Butler, a football player at nearby Marshall University.<br><br>A grand jury indicted Butler for committing both battery and a hate crime against both men. While West Virginia does not explicitly include sexual orientation in its hate crime law, it does bar violence against an individual \u201cbecause of sex.\u201d Prosecutors argued that, as used in this statute, sex encompasses sexual orientation, citing the federal judiciary\u2019s growing consensus that the two categories cannot be logically separated. Before the case went to trial, Butler\u2019s defense counsel contested the hate crime charges, arguing that a criminal statute must be interpreted as narrowly as possible. A judge agreed and threw out those charges; the prosecutor\u2019s office appealed. On Tuesday, the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals heard arguments in West Virginia v. Butler to resolve the reach of the state\u2019s hate crime measure.<br><br>Lauren E. Plymale, an assistant prosecuting attorney for Cabell County (in which Huntington is located), kicks off the morning with a simple plea to the justices: Let us take this case to a jury. Plymale argues that Butler\u2019s battery was \u201cbased on the sex\u201d of his victims and \u201cthe state is entitled to take this issue to a jury. <br><br>To back up this claim, Plymale makes the three familiar arguments put forth by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and endorsed by multiple federal judges. First, she asserts that Butler\u2019s assault was rooted in \u201csex stereotyping,\u201d a form of sex discrimination recognized by the United States Supreme Court.","filename":"Huntington","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":530,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1493235118374,"time":1493235118,"md5":"ZUoUAAEDPzl47sW74VLWLg==","fsize":62440,"resto":0,"id":"pMxQFZUn","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"do-statutes-covering-sex-cover-sexual-orientation","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":122928407,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:46:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122926429\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122926429<\/a><br>bump","time":1493235963,"resto":122926429,"id":"M3r2rq1S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122914776,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:04:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"How you have prepared for the upcoming race war?<br>Deus vult!","filename":"setit","ext":".jpg","w":812,"h":507,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1493229882712,"time":1493229882,"md5":"Qo0EQhVsr7+YTujUn5HYdw==","fsize":52383,"resto":0,"id":"HUhNyfTi","country":"FI","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-you-have-prepared-for-the-upcoming-race-war","country_name":"Finland","replies":111,"images":23,"omitted_posts":106,"omitted_images":22,"tail_size":50},{"no":122927406,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:39:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122918777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122918777<\/a><br>start smoking them yourself and you&#039;ll see why they&#039;re so good.","time":1493235556,"resto":122914776,"id":"2l888brz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122927429,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:39:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122926998\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122926998<\/a><br>Sure they do but that has nothing to do with my point, but apparently I misunderstood and anon meant short guerilla-like ambushes<br><a href=\"#p122926757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122926757<\/a><br>They make more sense here I&#039;d imagine, since you&#039;re not going to engage in lengthy engagements might as well have something a little more accurate","time":1493235566,"resto":122914776,"id":"Nsr4Ni+S","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":122927972,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:43:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122914776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122914776<\/a><br>lol why do you have the maniheim translation? get the Ford its way better.","time":1493235789,"resto":122914776,"id":"hP5Czy6K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122928005,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:43:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122927429\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122927429<\/a><br>In basic I during M16 qualifications I hit all my 300 meter targets with iron sights.<br><br>Any modern semi-auto will be more accurate than you, bolt action are even more so, unless it&#039;s super old.","time":1493235800,"resto":122914776,"id":"EEehsPjI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122928358,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:45:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122922059\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122922059<\/a><br>who is this guy? <br>He make redpilled video?","time":1493235942,"resto":122914776,"id":"TfzexiWu","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"}]}]}

It was a truck of peace, goy! Shh... Just don&#039;t worry about it. You should bring in more refugees to make them feel at home in your country, that&#039;s probably why this terrible accident happened! Mr. Mohammed probably was feeling lonely so he lost control of that truck.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why don&#039;t you just turn on the TV and relax? CNN has a great program on integrating refugees into society starting in 30 minutes!<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hehe, yes goy, yes. Just a couple more million refugees and you&#039;ll be doing much better, just trust me! You trust me with your money in the banks, why wouldn&#039;t you trust me with the future of your country!<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I promise that these gentle refugees won&#039;t cause any issues, here, take a shekel for your troubles.<\/span>","filename":"ixSdAMb","ext":".gif","w":501,"h":504,"tn_w":248,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491599340595,"time":1491599340,"md5":"M7mrvL8SwXVmvVFyoBKI5Q==","fsize":10992,"resto":0,"id":"Ee5DWHHh","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dont-panic","country_name":"Australia","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":120025384,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)17:17:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ok.

My old home town was featured in headline news. It seems there was a shoot in Fresno that was racially motivated. In fact, the shooter is being charged with a hate crime according to Fresno P.D.

It&#039;s about fucking time. Oh yeah, and the fucker yelled &#039;Allahu Akbar&#039; when he was arrested, so there&#039;s possibly a terrorist component to the crime as well.

That said, there&#039;s something all of you don&#039;t quite understand.<br><br>Every time you try to &quot;red pill&quot; a woman about rapefugees by pointing out the fact that they are, in fact, violent rapists, it falls on deaf ears. Why? Women don&#039;t care.<br><br>They don&#039;t care? Nope. This statement probably confuses even the most hardcore of redpilled misogynists, &quot;But women are always going on and on about rape and rape culture!&quot; That&#039;s just an extension of their rape fantasies. You&#039;re probably clued in on female masochism by now but few of you actually realize it seeps into politics. Women use the made-up concept of &quot;rape culture&quot; to talk about their #1 fantasy, rape. It&#039;s like if a guy who you know has a femdom fetish talks about the &quot;epidemic&quot; of women going around kicking guys in the balls and spitting on them. &quot;Yeah OK, Rick. That&#039;s nice, you weird perverted asshole.&quot;<br><br>However, it isn&#039;t subconscious desire to fuck Arab rapists that leads to women&#039;s apathy regarding rapefugees. It&#039;s a lot more subtle. Think about your reaction to hearing about a 12 year old boy who scored with a hot MILF teacher. It&#039;s probably not one of disgust. But you probably condemn male pedophiles all the time. Why? Your sexual fetish has left you in a state of moral ambivalence. Instead of judging with your mind, you judge with your dick. If you had low testosterone, you might view the situation differently.<br><br>Women know importing tens of thousands of inbred rapists is a bad idea on a logical level but seldom do women use logic when making decisions as I&#039;m sure you all know. On the surface they will condemn any rape, but in their heart they don&#039;t give a shit about the victim. They think about the rape and self-insert, to feel warm and cuddly for one quick moment at the thought of being ravaged by a hairy, villainous sultan. It feels good, feels feminine. Then they put down the newspaper.<br><br>And they think, &quot;It will never ACTUALLY happen to me.

I think it&#039;s been mentioned before (not sure how accurate) that historically a minority of men pass on their genes. In the past weak men didn&#039;t tend to pass on their genes, now they do, quite a lot. So a problem that was rare, is now more common because the natural filtering mechanism (eugenics happens on it&#039;s own if we follow natural laws) has been interfered with. Polygamy is also a natural system, what men don&#039;t tend to understand is that polygamy works by men taking on as many wives as they can support. <br><br>Which gives motivation for success, you can only be a farmer? You have as many wives as you can prove for, while leaving room for the children you have with them. Same is true for any role in a society, you have what you can provide for, and if you want more, you become more successful, take on more responsibilities, work harder. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That goddesses personified her <\/span><br>Hinduism(of which Kali is relevant) is rooted in Vaishnavism, which itself is rooted in Vedism. In Hinduism, they believe that beings like Kali are an avatar, or different persona of a different detiy. A man God still sits atop the divine hierarchy, and one of the core principles laid fourth in vedism was maintaining the caste system(largely a racial hierarchy). The point of using Kali as an example of female worship isn&#039;t accurate if you&#039;re familiar with the religion and it&#039;s history.","time":1492423562,"resto":121475972,"id":"KD9o30Ke","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121508623,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)06:07:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121506707\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121506707<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Was fun talking to you<\/span><br>I agree anon, thank you, I&#039;ve enjoyed it and this thread quite a bit.

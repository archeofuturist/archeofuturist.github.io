I understand where you&#039;re coming from OP. The first thing that comes to mind when you speak about breaking traditions and cultures is the American idea that the government shouldn&#039;t end-user one culture or religion over the other, and if it does, we have failed as a democracy.<br>Liberals who yell, &quot;cis white scum,&quot; are similar to the neo Nazis who yell, &quot;Hitler did nothing wrong, the Aryan race is superior,&quot; etc.<br>An inherently socialist idea is that everybody should be equal. There shouldn&#039;t be a &quot;dominant&quot; culture, because they leads to the dominant in society accumulating &quot;privilege&quot; (legislation that benefits the dominant and takes away from the lesser cultures.) I.e., gays being refused the legal right to marry.<br>Many socialists are also very irreligious and, frankly, uncaring about whatever &quot;culture&quot; and traditions are. I, for one, don&#039;t think that culture and tradition are real things. I don&#039;t care about your tradition of eating together at the table after saying your prayers. I don&#039;t care about the idea that it should only be man and woman in a marriage, or the crazy man in the sky who says so. Those ideas are not meaningful in any way. Love, equality, and welfare on the other hand, are meaningful ideas, because they reduce suffering.<br>As for the hatred for your own nation, in my case, I hate aspects of America. I don&#039;t hate my country. I refuse to not see the problems of my country, and I want to fix them. A few if them are: the deadly two party system that we have that stifles real democracy, the continuing wars that we perpetuate for oil money, the huge budget for our military, the idea that the president can force something on an entire nation(executive orders), and the propagandas forced down our throats that communism is bad(times square billboards about how communism kills).","time":1490804290,"resto":118793798,"id":"0alaHI\/d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118801728,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)12:19:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118801615\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118801615<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;communist taqqiya<\/span><br><br>top jej fampai","time":1490804359,"resto":118793798,"id":"mVnDH2FF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118801910,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)12:21:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118793798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118793798<\/a><br>You&#039;re referring to marxists, which are really just secular Jews.

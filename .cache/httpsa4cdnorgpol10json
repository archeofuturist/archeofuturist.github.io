So it&#039;s actually important to teach kids gender roles so they can know their place in society and what their duties and responsibilities are. Having an entirely freeform society is nothing but a recipe for chaos which is exactly what we&#039;re seeing nowadays, when men are no longer men and women are no longer women because nothing apparently differentiates the two in the eyes of certain radicals, and that political opinion is being codified into law. It&#039;s entirely fucked up and it&#039;s going to be our undoing. Identity is an important thing; fucking with it or not giving the kids an identity at all is as close as you can get to child abuse without striking your kid. I know some of this by personal experience; I was raised as an expat kid and have no feelings of nationality or culture, especially since I&#039;m an American mutt, and it&#039;s had a negative impact on my psyche.

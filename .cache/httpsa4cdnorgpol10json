HUGE NASA COVERUP!","com":"NASA has built a device, an Artificial Sun\/Simulator Reflector and placed it heliosynchronis in orbit outside the Earth&#039;s Atmosphere. NASA technology is very highly advanced and they are able to cloak (hide) objects in outer space including our Solar Sun. Our Solar Sun is not white but yellow in its appearance. The device is about the size of a football field that unfolded after being launch into space. It is white and very very bright. Because the device is so close to the Earth and infront of our Solar Sun it is cloaking (hiding) our Solar Sun. It also bends light like a Prism and here is how to prove it. If you follow this procedure you will see both suns (Our Solar Sun and the Artificial Sun) at the same time. You will need two (2) pairs of UV Sunglasses. UV Sunglasses with a upper tinted lenses work excellent. 1.) Place 1 pair of sunglasses on and close 1 eye. 2.)WHILE LOOKING AT THE SUN, hold the other pair of sunglasses 10 inches in front of the other pair (look on the upper tinted area of the lense). Slowly bring the second pair closer towards your face like a telescope. You will see two suns. 1 sun will be bright white; that is the Artificial Sun\/Simulator Reflector. The other sun, which is our Solar Sun will not be as bright and will appear to be a different color depending on the tinted color on the sunglass lense. Our Solar Sun is 93 Million Miles behind the device. If you do this technique correctly, you will see two suns WITH YOUR OWN EYES; the Artificial Sun and our Solar Sun.

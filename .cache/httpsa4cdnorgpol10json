Somehow, the parents don&#039;t realize what&#039;s going on and continue caring for the bastard. And then the cycle continues.<br><br>How this relates to modern cuckolding: the idea is that the cuckoo is using the resources and efforts of another bird in order to raise its young. However, human cuckolding refers to the act of your mate cheating on you. The reason this is considered such a massive offence is because of ancient reproductive practices we still use today.<br><br>Most species, including humans, like to take the most efficient means of reproduction. For men, this means fucking as many women as possible without being restricted to who you fuck. For women, this means locking down a mate who will provide for and protect both her and her child. This is the reason women are much more reluctant for some fuk compared to men, despite the existence of contraceptives; it&#039;s biologically engrained and then reinforced by societal pressures (and the knowledge of STDs).","filename":"cuckoo","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":1057,"tn_w":189,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490685383824,"time":1490685383,"md5":"nHnf2YMaFHEkwL+fWA05JA==","fsize":212201,"resto":0,"id":"yRdNW1HB","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cuckolding-explained","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0},{"no":118624306,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)03:17:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118624241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118624241<\/a><br>Part 2<br><br>Assuming you aren&#039;t the absolute pinnacle of manliness, the only way most sane women will agree to fuck you is if you have a close enough relationship with them that they trust and like you. For many, this would mean going out and hanging out with them, and in most cases, footing the bill for these activities. This essentially means that you are INDIRECTLY PAYING FOR SEX. In a way, you unofficially own the rights to fuck her.<br><br>Therefor, if you were to find out your woman was fucking someone else on the side even while the two of you were in a relationship (and you are probably still paying for everything), it would be similar to someone violating your property rights, like having been robbed. You practically paid to be in that relationship and someone else was given a free pass for the same limited supply of goods? Unacceptable. This is the reason getting cucked is so appalling, it is essentially being the victim of theft.<br><br>There are some important exceptions to this, however. For instance, if you were in a relationship with a girl and both of you paid for your OWN stuff and not for each other, finding out she cheated on you would not qualify as getting cucked, since you never invested your money in it. And while you may have invested your time in it, you probably did not go into that relationship with the ultimate goal of getting the succ; this is any scenario in which a guy has a female friend who isn&#039;t also his GF. As another possibility, let&#039;s say your spouse is a stripper. While she may be giving a lesser version of the goods you&#039;re getting to other guys, she&#039;s not doing it for free. If you own a home and\/or have kids together, it is expected that since she&#039;s working (too), some of that money will be spent on shit benefitting both of you and your children, meaning you are now benefitting from her actions.

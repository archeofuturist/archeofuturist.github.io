Mulattoes are almost never accepted as white, so they instead identify entirely as black rather than mixed race. Mixed race Asians are a fairly recent phenomenon, but hapa children of Europeans and Asians have historically never been accepted in Asian countries: for example, Indo-Dutch children were persecuted after the end of Dutch occupation, and many Viet-American babies of US soldiers had to be brought to America because they would be ostracized in Vietnam.<br><br>Because neither whites nor asians are welcoming of the racially impure, hapas are left without any racial identity at all. This is why Hapa males are rightfully stereotyped as being &quot;beta&quot;: never fully accepted by either group, they never truly &quot;belong&quot; anywhere. It is commonly thought that female hapas escape this complex, but I suspect this is simply because most hapa women are so attractive that they never experience any kind of discrimination. <br><br>Hapa males are not genetically inferior; they are only conditioned to believe that they are inferior because of their inability to feel racial pride.","filename":"1478054779442","ext":".png","w":537,"h":525,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":244,"tim":1490069143529,"time":1490069143,"md5":"8k+FW6w1F7Zlc07nhHFlQg==","fsize":106478,"resto":0,"id":"6Y7fTx1I","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-reason-why-hapa-males-are-beta","country_name":"United States","replies":52,"images":6,"omitted_posts":47,"omitted_images":5},{"no":117589438,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)00:56:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117589144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117589144<\/a><br>Yeah it&#039;s kinda weird to borrow that term for blanket usage.

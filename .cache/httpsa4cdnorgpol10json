It&#039;s even bigger problem in countries like US where people like Soros can spend their money on &quot;charities&quot; that actually just promote what ever he wants them to promote. They can effect what media or education tells you either directly or indirectly, so you shouldn&#039;t follow them blindly.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;paper mill worker<\/span><br>Well those guys just pretty much made themselves completely unemployable. I agree that that sort of union bullshit is stupid, but all people should work more together in general to try to get their voices heard and to get everyone to have fair treatment, instead of just voting a different set of lying ass holes to the governemnt every 4 years to fuck everyone up the ass.","time":1490744876,"resto":118669421,"id":"kw3pTtyc","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118717736,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)19:57:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118701879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118701879<\/a><br>This countries lost already.","time":1490745422,"resto":118669421,"id":"OO0U8HEo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118718530,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)20:03:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118669421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118669421<\/a><br>I would fight for my country, which just might mean that I have to fight against it.","filename":"commando","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":2879,"tn_w":52,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490745801183,"time":1490745801,"md5":"+\/wwsGFnAbu4SAIMpKnJgQ==","fsize":2034647,"resto":118669421,"id":"PDDbayVJ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118719086,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)20:08:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"I WOULD FIGHT FOR MY PEOPLE, NOT THE GOVERNMENT<br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118711791#p118711791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118711791<\/a><br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118711791#p118711791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118711791<\/a><br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118711791#p118711791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118711791<\/a><br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118711791#p118711791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118711791<\/a>","time":1490746124,"resto":118669421,"id":"v3peuebO","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118720114,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)20:17:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118716603\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118716603<\/a><br>Why do you keep bringing up Swedes? I&#039;m not one of them and I&#039;ve already said that I don&#039;t like them. RKP is also so small that they can&#039;t decide anything by themselves. I believe in meritocracy to a certain extent, so defence should be arranged by those, who know most about it. In this case officers. A good start would be to let them join the discussion. Unfortunately officers aren&#039;t allowed to speak publicly about what&#039;s going on behind the scenes. This negatively affects the public discussion. There&#039;s a lot of wrong or incomplete information in circulation.<br><br>Modern Russia still has many of the same interests as Soviet Union, whether you like it or not. I don&#039;t but I accept as it as reality and act accordingly.<br><br>I was talking about economy and the only people who complain about elite in that regard are socialists.<br><br>Still, you won&#039;t achieve any sort of high level of living unless you either educate yourself or start a business, preferably both. Being an employee isn&#039;t usually bad but then you&#039;ll have to settle for what&#039;s given to you.<br><br>And again, using your money to influence things other than economy is out of the scope of what I said. Sure, those who pay more taxes should have more say on what they&#039;re spent on but it should be done openly and not in secret like Soros does. Soros is pushing an agenda and not raising public discussion. There&#039;s a huge difference. Also one good way to give more power to people would be to move to direct democracy. That way economic elite would have less power to lobby their agenda. Capitalism is about economy and should stay that way. In my opinion it would be in the national interest that our welfare state would make a shift towards a model, where everyone would be placed on the same starting line instead of the same finish line. The current system is broken in two ways: workers have artificially high wages and benefits and elite can use their money to influence the &quot;starting line&quot; to benefit themselves.","time":1490746662,"resto":118669421,"id":"yZPyp16c","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"}]}]}

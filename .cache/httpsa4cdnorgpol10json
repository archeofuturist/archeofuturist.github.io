Since they can only have a small amount of children in their lifetime (compared to men) they must invest heavily in those children, to ensure their future success and reproduction. Thus, they will be looking not only for a mate with good genes, but for a provider, who can also invest parental resources to fathering the child. Obviously, a child with two parents will fair much better then a child with one parent. <br><br>So, you&#039;d expect, since women need both a good mate and a provider, for them to be incredibly faithful, right? <br><br>Wrong. <br><br>Here is the thing, only the top 10% of women can expect the top 10% of men to become their provider. The top 10% of men, on the other hand, can expect to be high in demand for all women. Men have a very low base investment for having children, and so, if the woman allows them too, can have sex with nearly any women who desires it. So, wouldn&#039;t it be in the interest of the lowest quality women to mate with a high quality male, thus gaining an improved genetic advantage, despite not gaining any parental resources?<br><br>Thus, we get the Madonna-Whore Dichotomy. <br><br>People classify women as two classes; Sluts and Prudes. Sluts are the kind guys have fun with as young men, but Prudes are the kind of girl a guy wants to marry. Why? Well, because if a girl is sleeping with a new guy every week, chances that her children are actually yours are low. Thus, Men, while they will certainly sleep with a slut, will not marry her or desire her for any sort of long term relationship. They will, in other words, pump and dump. <br><br>And you, as a man, want to do everything to avoid becoming a provider for these whores. <br><br>Cont.","filename":"1489455928580","ext":".jpg","w":680,"h":680,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490890970666,"time":1490890970,"md5":"HQgbbwBXqmsSIE0LJpRQNQ==","fsize":87173,"resto":0,"id":"\/amQaq7w","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"women-a-darwinian-understanding-of-female-nature","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1},{"no":118937967,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)12:37:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118936407\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118936407<\/a><br>Cont.<br>A prude, on the other hand, is exactly the kind of female that you want to have a long term relationship with.<br><br>Why? Because if you believe she won&#039;t have sex with men usually, then you can be sure that your children belong to you, and you aren&#039;t expending resources on another mans children. When a man first meets a women, he is subconsciously trying to gauge if she is a slut or a prude, and a women are subconsciously judging if a man is a provider or a mate (or both, men can be both, and usually are) <br><br>But with that being considered, wouldn&#039;t it be in the interest of a women to find a high quality mate, who wouldn&#039;t invest resources in her offspring, and a low quality provider, who believes her children are his? The only reason not to is the perceived risk of discovery, and then loss of parental resources from the cucked husband.<br><br>Another thing, women can be perceived as sluts and prudes by different men, depending on what the women is trying to convince the man. She&#039;ll convince her provider that shes a prude, by not sleeping with them for as long as possible, (unless a child is coming soon and she needs the man to believe its his), while actively getting as much dick from Chad and co as possible. <br><br>So, you, as a man, need to not only understand what a girl is trying to convince you that she is, but really dig deep and understand how easily she&#039;s put out in the past. You&#039;ve also got to know what you want from the relationship. If you&#039;re just trying to get an easy lay, then convince her that you believe shes a prude. If she believes that you believe that shes a prude, then she won&#039;t care how much she puts out. If you want a long term relationship, same thing. Never, ever, let yourself become the beta provider, on the other hand.

The first step is to increase the shame for people who cheat. Make punishments very harsh for women who bear children who are not genetically her husbands, and apply these same punishments to men who sleep with women not their wives. Remember, for every cheating whore, there some chad fucking her. Make paternity tests mandatory, etc. <br><br>Thing is, A lot of countrys are taking steps backwards in this sense, to allow women the chance to easily cheat their husbands out of a genetic future. <br><br>For instance, did you know in France its illegal to get a paternity test without a court mandate? Meaning that men can&#039;t easily tell if their child is theres. In other places, if you raise a child for long enough, and then it turns out it isn&#039;t yours, you&#039;ve still got to pay child support for the little bastard. <br><br>Why? <br><br>Feminism, obviously.

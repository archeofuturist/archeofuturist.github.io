Aside from the useful publicity of \u201cbringing home\u201d an American hostage, there was an implicit progressive subtext to both his earlier flight and eventual return: Young introspective soldiers are often troubled about their nation\u2019s ambiguous role in the Middle East and so, understandably, sometimes err in their search for meaning. When they do, and when they perhaps \u201cwander off,\u201d the government has win-win resources to address their temporary lapse \u2014 in this case, killing two birds with one stone by downsizing the apparently repulsive Guantanamo Bay detention facility and returning punished-enough Taliban combatants to their families. <br><br>What Susan Rice (ostensibly the go-to consigliere in such deals) could not say is that the Obama administration released five dangerous terrorists in order to bring home one likely deserter, whose selfish AWOL behavior may have contributed over the years to the injury or even deaths of several American soldiers tasked with finding him. Instead, we got the lie that Bergdahl was a brave solider who served with honor and distinction and was captured in mediis rebus on the battlefield, with the implication that his personal odyssey inadvertently led to the bonus of returning in-limbo foreign detainees and reducing the population of an embarrassing gulag. <br><br><br>http:\/\/www.nationalreview.com\/artic<wbr>le\/447231\/why-progressives-lie-left<wbr>ist-agenda-requires-deception","filename":"1486963334612","ext":".jpg","w":680,"h":523,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":192,"tim":1493720068490,"time":1493720068,"md5":"ZTfOQBGwrVK4ptFCuy\/W3g==","fsize":51318,"resto":0,"id":"UAgJ+p9g","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-this-true","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":123752189,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)06:05:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"Black people are superior to whites in every way.

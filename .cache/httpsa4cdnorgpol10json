of the year, a dramatic increase over the same period last year.<br><br>The incidents followed an overall 34% increase in anti-Semitic assaults, vandalism and harassment last year when compared with 2015, according to the report.<br>The surge in anti-Semitic incidents in the United States came against an overall drop in such incidents worldwide, according to a report issued Sunday by the Kantor Center for the Study of Contemporary European Jewry at Tel Aviv University.<br><br>The Kantor report, which surveyed approximately 40 countries, said incidents of anti-Semitism dropped 12% globally. In France, home to Europe\u2019s largest Jewish community, reports of anti-Semitic acts dropped 61%.

The report noted that anti-Semitic incidents on U.S. college campuses rose by 45%.<br><br>While the trend line was down overall worldwide, the report pointed with alarm to a \u201ccontinuation of the widespread increase, sometimes dramatic, in verbal and visual anti-Semitism on social media and during demonstrations \u2026 that cannot be quantified.\u201d","filename":"whitefamilies","ext":".jpg","w":369,"h":513,"tn_w":179,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493019790512,"time":1493019790,"md5":"VC7aEDm1OaarsqHfMM4Wsg==","fsize":40361,"resto":0,"id":"AE6tw0A5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"adl-antisemitic-incidents-have-reached-levels","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122538870,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)23:54:44","name":"Anonymous","sub":"FASHWAVE GENERAL","com":"Now with more \/CHRISTWAVE\/ and W E S T H E T I C A<br><br>Guide (remember to log out!):<br><br>https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/<wbr>1DIeovVhwprNb9z4x9Pxiyr84nhouf3mxz3<wbr>uzDOlARdo\/edit#<br><br>Someone was doing requests in the last thread, I can do some if there&#039;s good source images\/text","filename":"C_Coolidge","ext":".jpg","w":551,"h":328,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":148,"tim":1493006084421,"time":1493006084,"md5":"Ks6V7JAftqyYh1X8pu\/eMA==","fsize":467525,"resto":0,"id":"PQyx4A0c","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fashwave-general","country_name":"United States","replies":207,"images":134,"omitted_posts":202,"omitted_images":129,"tail_size":50},{"no":122558368,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)03:25:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"requesting some fashing.

It\u2019s not a fucking puzzle, all the history is on film. There you crossed ur artistic farse with ur artistic frustration. Bunch of fucking artfags with your shallow political beliefs probably started with a feeling of injustice because people rejected your shitty works and now you think you have become politial activists.<br>So how did it happen? How did you become so self-important? A bunch of real degenerates whispered poison in your ears while becoming your only community, your only &quot;friends&quot;. And they used multiple levels to make decadence and depravity and corruption more acceptable by drowning it in &quot;oh we\u2019re just experiencing&quot; So you combine all this with capitalizing on failed artfag resentment and even deeper need for validation, BAM &quot;activist&quot;.<br>You can talk to any former &quot;art&quot; man and they can tell you how it went from &quot;mindless open-minded fun&quot; to &quot;globalist degenerate recruitment&quot;. The &quot;lol only backwards people care for traditional aesthetics&quot; + the general failed artist resentment of these communities. You need to see the various communities converge. Hollywood\u2019s &quot;who wont producers hire me&quot; exhibition&#039;s &quot;anything goes in art and anyone who gets mad is just a redneck&quot; vs endless outbursts of deconstruction at everything. Lousy art here becomes less of an isolated phenomenon and more of a natural end point for all these circles crashing into one another. And modern art, also being its own thing, emans it is rolled back into those communities amplifying your worst aspect then roll it back into art.<br>So essentially you have an urban pressure cooker to turn your typical aspiring artist bullshit into honest to god lunacy. The surrounding of empty idedas, the validation of the bullshit you do?

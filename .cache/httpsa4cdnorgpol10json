Again he formally abrogates an Old Testament command in order to intensify and internalize its application. This law originally prohibited the formal exaction of an overly severe punishment that did not fit a crime as well as informal, self-appointed vigilante action. Now Jesus teaches the principle that Christian kindness should transcend even straightforward tit-for-tat retribution. None of the commands of vv. 39\u201342 can easily be considered absolute; all must be read against the historical background of first-century Judaism. Nevertheless, in light of prevailing ethical thought Jesus contrasts radically with most others of his day in stressing the need to decisively break the natural chain of evil action and reaction that characterizes human relationships.48<\/span><br>Antist\u0113nai (\u201cresist\u201d) in v. 39 was often used in a legal context (cf. Isa 50:8) and in light of v. 40 is probably to be taken that way here. Jesus\u2019 teaching then parallels 1 Cor 6:7 against not taking fellow believers to court, though it could be translated somewhat more broadly as \u201cdo not take revenge on someone who wrongs you\u201d (GNB). We must nevertheless definitely resist evil in certain contexts (cf. Jas 4:7; 1 Pet 5:9). Striking a person on the right cheek suggests a backhanded slap from a typically right-handed aggressor and was a characteristic Jewish form of insult. Jesus tells us not to trade such insults even if it means receiving more. In no sense does v. 39 require Christians to subject themselves or others to physical danger or abuse, nor does it bear directly on the pacifism-just war debate.","filename":"1486358798177","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491117874043,"time":1491117874,"md5":"kqGu8IOXL7ux5wAestXSNQ==","fsize":184732,"resto":119163298,"id":"kXmnkAEs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119176676,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)03:24:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119176654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119176654<\/a><br> Verse 40 is clearly limited to a legal context. One must be willing to give as collateral an outer garment\u2014more than what the law could require, which was merely an inner garment (cf. Exod 22:26\u201327). Coat and shirt reflect contemporary parallels to \u201ccloak\u201d and \u201ctunic,\u201d though both of the latter looked more like long robes. Verse 41 continues the legal motif by referring to Roman conscription of private citizens to help carry military equipment for soldiers as they traveled.<br>Each of these commands requires Jesus\u2019 followers to act more generously than what the letter of the law demanded. \u201cGoing the extra mile\u201d has rightly become a proverbial expression and captures the essence of all of Jesus\u2019 illustrations. Not only must disciples reject all behavior motivated only by a desire for retaliation, but they also must positively work for the good of those with whom they would otherwise be at odds. In v. 42 Jesus calls his followers to give to those who ask and not turn from those who would borrow. He presumes that the needs are genuine and commands us not to ignore them, but he does not specifically mandate how best we can help. As Augustine rightly noted, the text says \u201cgive to everyone that asks,\u201d not \u201cgive everything to him that asks\u201d (De Sermone Domine en Monte 67). Compare Jesus\u2019 response to the request made of him in Luke 12:13\u201315. It is also crucial to note that \u201ca willingness to forego one\u2019s personal rights, and to allow oneself to be insulted and imposed upon, is not incompatible with a firm stand for matters of principle and for the rights of others (cf. Paul\u2019s attitude in Acts 16:37; 22:25; 25:8\u201312).\u201d Verses 39\u201342 thus comprise a \u201cfocal instance\u201d of nonretaliation; specific, extreme commands attract our attention to a key ethical theme that must be variously applied as circumstances change.","time":1491117897,"resto":119163298,"id":"kXmnkAEs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119176731,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)03:25:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119169307\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119169307<\/a><br>You know you fucked up when BUDDHISTS want to kill you","time":1491117954,"resto":119163298,"id":"Dz4113lY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119176740,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)03:26:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"being a Non-Aggression Principle - abiding Christian is","time":1491117968,"resto":119163298,"id":"8Gcj3q93","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119178740,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)04:01:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"GOD nor JESUS was pacifist.

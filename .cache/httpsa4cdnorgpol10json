Wait, it was even easier to tell now that it&#039;s a false flag because when Obama had to deal with it, it was an unknown source that did the attack. <br>Now it&#039;s clear that Assad&#039;s troops bombarded an ISIS weapons cache that happened to have gas in it.<br><br>4. Trump is still our God emperor, he is playing 4D chess<br><br>He is trying to make the neocons reveal themselves by waiting for war endorsements and then he knows who his enemies are.<br>It&#039;s a little doubtful though, he already sent troops to Syria which wasnt necessary. Although that might have been the Pentagon because according to news articles he gave them the power to do more moves without his direct approval, that itself may also be a chess move to reveal Pentagon neocon traitors.","filename":"sad","ext":".png","w":1109,"h":851,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":191,"tim":1491497641598,"time":1491497641,"md5":"oRetrvbC6l03bbAy6BXndw==","fsize":1083295,"resto":0,"id":"KWCbFsII","country":"AT","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"full-analysis-of-the-current-situation","country_name":"Austria","replies":11,"images":2,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":1},{"no":119768356,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)13:43:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119762484\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119762484<\/a><br>The plan to take down Assad has been in the works for many years and since Obama failed and Hillary did not get elected does not mean the plans will not go forward.

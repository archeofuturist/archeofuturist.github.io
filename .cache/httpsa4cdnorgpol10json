Capitalism makes no attempt to address these issues, so it gets a pass for them. It&#039;s a horrifying ethical relativism that would not be tolerated in any other circumstance. Can responsibility only exist with intent? The ethical foundations of most cultures and legal systems in our society disagree. People generally agree that negligence is not an acceptable excuse.<br>But capitalism gets a pass.<br>It feels like just because it&#039;s not someone pointing a gun at another person, and you have access to 20 types of cereal and an iPhone, Capitalism gets a pass on all this crap.<br>But misery, hunger, suffering and death are still there, and are just as real. They just drag for longer to the point we all get used to it. Suffering is not just a statistic, these are actual human beings suffering because of the social and economic structures we created in our world. It&#039;s all just a horror picture constantly playing in the background of our lives, one that most people simply get used to.<br>And to me, that makes it worse, because in a way it&#039;s as if we&#039;re all pulling a very slow trigger, and we&#039;re supposed to be PROUD of it.","filename":"2008_us_foodsec","ext":".jpg","w":396,"h":400,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490666149980,"time":1490666149,"md5":"VgJKxUuLU\/8W9cAC7bl\/UQ==","fsize":40222,"resto":118594075,"id":"6pwQ+Ewo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118586881,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:42:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m in Iceland.

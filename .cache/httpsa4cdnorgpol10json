The only way to change it isn&#039;t to scream and whine and get the government to make things different. it&#039;s to start being politicians and combat sexism with social empathy. Its my opinion that this kind of behavior has only increased sexism against women. a large portion of feminists think they can get the government to mandate a kind of opinion set and it shows when they ruin and ban their own gender from institutions if they don&#039;t follow and spread the image they want spread.<br><br>So its no real suprise that pol is the same way, they don&#039;t understand that jews are the way they are because they where forced into blase and hated jobs like usury and those jobs turned out to be very important and productive, just like other religious dissidants. It would be a stretch to say they are there as merit but it&#039;s not a conspiracy, europe took the actions that would put them in power, and then whined about all the power they had. for funsies you can also show that in various times certain dynasties and rulers of countries where all headed by someone with blood relation to britain, so in the 1800s was monarchy a british conspiracy? according to pol, who uses the same way of thinking on jews, it would have to be. Jews aren&#039;t the enemy, and it&#039;s important that pol realize this because the longer they go without understanding it, when they finally take down the jew, they will simply become the jew, just like feminists are now being sexist against women in the place of men who wont be. <br><br>if you think power doesn&#039;t corrupt. you need to watch this,<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rSt<wbr>L7niR7gs","filename":"1489076267879","ext":".jpg","w":912,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":41,"tim":1493045299670,"time":1493045299,"md5":"zmwSQzm0dZfTwPjLkh15vQ==","fsize":256648,"resto":122592416,"id":"wArLMoIw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122595507,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)11:11:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122593184\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122593184<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the only real difference is this one.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Both theories imply that the \u201cend-game\u201d of the conspirators has something to do with the demolition of the \u201ctraditional\u201d society.<\/span><br>Yea, I guess I could have worded it somewhat better.

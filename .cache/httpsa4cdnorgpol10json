While it seemingly doesn&#039;t have anything to do with the &quot;superhuman&quot; theory, the way I see it the &quot;noble lie&quot; is pretty much the &quot;myth&quot;, or religion, that holds a society together. It is a mythological story that, while it probably holds no scientific truth (like the religious texts), it contains a story that acts as a guideline of morals and behaviours that the society can look at for guidance. This directly connects with the Nietzschean outlook on religion, in that it doesn&#039;t exist to explain how the world works, but merely how people should act, a set of unwritten rules or steps you can follow, in accordance to the steps the hero of your mythology (or religion, or noble lie) takes in his journey to overcome the troubles of life. When you take that basis away (when you kill god), people are left without a guiding allegory, and look to different mediums to obtain it. It&#039;s why ideologies and nihilism sprouted and flourished directly following the fall of religion in Russia.<br><br><a href=\"#p118535077\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118535077<\/a><br>Personally I haven&#039;t even managed to complete tsz yet, it seemed very condensed to me and I have only recently acquired a big interest to Nietzsche (I&#039;m surrounded by Marxists here in Greece and Nietzsche is considered a really dark and &quot;sick&quot; matter in a way, I wasn&#039;t even exposed to his works until I got into uni. <br>He was quite literally a great predictor, seeing where our societies would go in ways we even today fail to identify.

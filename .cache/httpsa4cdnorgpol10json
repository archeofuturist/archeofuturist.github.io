Corporations inherently have interests at odds with the individual. In a perfect corporate world the labor would be slaves, the goods would be as expensive as possible and consumers would have no alternative but to pay. When the only purpose is to increase profit each year with all other concerns secondary this leads to a world where Corporations are predators.","time":1491195243,"resto":119282328,"id":"dfaYb07m","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119292496,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:54:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119282387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119282387<\/a><br>fpbp","filename":"Marx_Sniped","ext":".jpg","w":980,"h":742,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1491195275570,"time":1491195275,"md5":"lsJXyMTMeC8MCjDWhzgD0w==","fsize":130208,"resto":119282328,"id":"tIZKwMoz","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119292847,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:58:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119282328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119282328<\/a><br>Nothing, you fucking socialist.","time":1491195522,"resto":119282328,"id":"kvzIN\/nr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119292790,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:58:06","name":"Anonymous","sub":"sjw mods","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw when you post something that&#039;s not even against the rules and your post still gets deleted<\/span>","filename":"swjmods","ext":".png","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491195486151,"time":1491195486,"md5":"vKNssZlH2ZHLNofipRB0gQ==","fsize":114708,"resto":0,"id":"MZ5um3tN","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sjw-mods","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":119294599,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:19:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119292790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119292790<\/a><br>Says Muslims are going to dominate<br>Gets delet<br>Lol mods are such sjws<br><br>You don&#039;t deserve green text","time":1491196778,"resto":119292790,"id":"1tDEvg1a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119292759,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:57:39","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/pol\/, was westward expansion a meme?","com":"I feel like we intended to grow more than we did, now we have seemingly unlimited square milage of natural wasteland with no explicit purpose or worth.","filename":"This Land is My Land","ext":".png","w":491,"h":370,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":188,"tim":1491195459293,"time":1491195459,"md5":"TpgQT7CZZA4Fx\/cVmmLYIA==","fsize":313454,"resto":0,"id":"hgjz4Hmq","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-was-westward-expansion-a-meme","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":119289078,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:14:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;child is black<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dad looks beta<\/span><br><br>Jewgle at it again.","filename":"whiteybtfo","ext":".jpg","w":2157,"h":1503,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":174,"tim":1491192866858,"time":1491192866,"md5":"nc0VOqdiEglfCNb1OgYE0A==","fsize":706717,"resto":0,"id":"SXU6bgxw","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"child-is-black","country_name":"Australia","replies":10,"images":3,"omitted_posts":5,"omitted_images":1},{"no":119291981,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:48:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119289078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119289078<\/a><br>Shes got a stronger jawline than this manlet.","time":1491194913,"resto":119289078,"id":"S4lnc6C5","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119292498,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:54:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119289701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119289701<\/a><br>Why do Slavs squat?","time":1491195277,"resto":119289078,"id":"RJ\/02Qq2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119292552,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:55:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119289078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119289078<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;child is black<\/span><br><br>Not with that hair.<br><br>He looks Pakistani.","time":1491195318,"resto":119289078,"id":"XY2OMRcn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119292713,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:57:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"The wife is hispanic.

Then, he signed an order undoing protections for wildlife and the environment.<br><br>The policy Zinke reversed would have phased out toxic ammunition and fishing tackle from national wildlife refuges by 2022. The purpose of this common-sense safeguard was to reduce lead, a powerful neurotoxin that persists in water and soil for a long time.<br><br>Birds are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning. Ducks and waterfowl rooting around the bottom of wetlands accidentally eat discarded lead. Birds of prey eat animal carcasses that contain lead bullet fragments -- making lead poisoning a huge threat for iconic species like bald eagles and California condors.<br><br>While other government agencies are moving forward with policies to limit lead exposure, the Interior Department is going backward. It&#039;s especially frustrating since nontoxic alternatives already exist for hunters and anglers.<br><br>That Zinke undid this protection on his first day is extremely disconcerting given his professed dedication to the environment.

The British army didn&#039;t march around killing off every tribe in the territories they controlled. In fact, much like the French, they allied with many of them. Hell, one of the causes of the American Revolution was that the British denied any further settlement westward onto Indian lands which upset many of the British-American colonists. There are several reasons as to why you don&#039;t see many American Indians in North America. For starters, there weren&#039;t that many to being with; the land was sparsely populated when the Europeans arrived. Birth rates were very low for them compared to the Europeans; many of them were nomadic tribes, and nomads tend not to have many children due to their lifestyle that involves them constantly being on the move. They were simply outbred; you had many American Indians, particularly women, marrying white men. It was a boost in status for them and offered a higher quality of life. This is why there are a large number of whites in the U.S. who have a very small percentage of American Indian in them. That&#039;s not to say that there wasn&#039;t any war involved; there was, but it wasn&#039;t a major cause of death.","time":1490522403,"resto":118343306,"id":"fw2s0ak1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118345822,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)05:59:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/KpLEQOIURro<br><br>this ypu have to know!","filename":"1489872789391","ext":".png","w":1067,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490522372774,"time":1490522372,"md5":"b18fyrHKd4FxXtz\/DWWeoQ==","fsize":712155,"resto":0,"id":"2JROkdL4","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-ypu-have-to-know","country_name":"Germany","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118345249,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)05:51:49","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Muh Wh*te supremacy","com":"Kek.

The United States offers a premium rural experience. Other countries are better if you prefer an urban lifestyle. The idea in finding an ideal place to live in the US is to avoid places where gangs, Muslims, or Mexican cartels congregate. Islam is cancer. Regular Mexicans are fine. Mormons are fine. Stay out of Mormonism, though. As someone who has had to fake religious belief for family reasons, be advised that this is a miserable lifestyle. Best to just leave them to their own devices and avoid arguing with them.<br><br>Until we finish deporting the foreign trespassers, any area that has a lot of Mexicans is going to have a lot of cartel members. Most of the Mexicans are victims, but that is how the demographics work out. Wherever you go, you&#039;ll get used to the weather. What matters are the people. So, I&#039;d suggest heading up to North Dakota. There is new oil money up there for anyone willing to work damned hard in miserable conditions. The pay is lucrative.<br><br>Think of cold winters and minimal urban luxuries as gang and terrorist repellant. The cold northlands attract the nicest and best people. Go to, say, Alaska, Canada, the US Upper Midwest, Iceland, Scotland, Norway, Finland, Russia, or Hokkaido. Sadly, Sweden is no longer included in this list. South of there reside almost all of the disease, war, crime, and corruption in the world.","time":1490522066,"resto":118340674,"id":"tanNPde7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118345590,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)05:56:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118340674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118340674<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2000<\/span><br>non-whites are everywhere now","filename":"1486884150049","ext":".png","w":4200,"h":3105,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1490522191143,"time":1490522191,"md5":"oBfl61GXHy2dl+ZxSOSeIw==","fsize":640223,"resto":118340674,"id":"hws\/bkiB","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118345595,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)05:56:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118345438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118345438<\/a><br>...You know, just avoid New England, the Great Lakes area, or Northwestern Washington.

Impression Products is a small business with about 25 employees. It specializes in buying used printer cartridges and remanufacturing them. In 2012, Lexmark decided to add Impression to an already existing lawsuit against other remanufacturers. While the other defendants eventually settled, Image has stuck it out and the case has made it to the highest court in the land.<br><br>You can read the full, technical details of the case here but the simple version goes like this: Since the \u201890s Lexmark has used what\u2019s called a \u201cshrink-wrap license\u201d with its cartridges. It offers a \u201cprebate\u201d to consumers by knocking off 20% of the price in exchange for their agreement to never resell or reuse the cartridge. The consumer agrees to this the second they open the package. Essentially, Lexmark believes that those cartridges belong to them, not the consumer reselling them because the consumer didn\u2019t have the right to sell them in the first place.<br><br>25 years ago, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears patent cases, carved an exception out of the patent exhaustion principle allowing patentees to set post-sale restrictions so long as these are otherwise legal and \u201cclearly communicated.\u201d In a separate case, the Federal Circuit concluded that when a patented item is sold abroad, the patentee\u2019s U.S. rights are not exhausted at all. The Federal Circuit upheld both of these precedents when it ruled against Impression Products earlier this year. The Supreme Court has never ruled on either of them.<br><br>http:\/\/www.scotusblog.com\/2017\/03\/a<wbr>rgument-analysis-justices-skeptical<wbr>-categorical-exhaustion-patent-righ<wbr>ts\/","filename":"printerink","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490503197854,"time":1490503197,"md5":"Kap9854Z3o8WFSNkOH723w==","fsize":70064,"resto":0,"id":"U5CtO5Kj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"supreme-court-printer-cartridge-case-could-be-the","country_name":"United States","replies":145,"images":11,"omitted_posts":140,"omitted_images":11,"tail_size":50},{"no":118338566,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)04:25:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118324060\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118324060<\/a><br>Students, and people applying for jobs.

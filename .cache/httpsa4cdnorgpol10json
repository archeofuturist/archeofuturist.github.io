Would you like to destroy reddit in a matter of hours?<br> <br>For the past few months, I have been working my way inside of the modteam of reddit&#039;s r\/EnoughTrumpSpam. It has 75,000 subscribers and, in addition to having an exclusive channel with the admins of reddit (who have shared some very... interesting... details about collaboration with Shareblue and CTR), have a direct channel to David Brock himself.<br> <br>Pic related are some of the juicier modchats, exchanged at various times since the election. In them, they discuss coordination with forcible shutdown of right-wing subreddits and tactics on direct order from Democratic-leaning Super PACs. I promise you, this is just the tip of the iceberg.<br> <br>For obvious reasons, I can&#039;t post this on reddit. I have seen the admins IP-track users firsthand and obviously do not want to be compromised. When word of this reaches the ETS mods they will message the admins to find the rat (in fact I might do it), and the jig will be up. My continued anonymity is critical here.<br> <br>https:\/\/mega.nz\/#F!mMMzCBIQ<br> <br>Here is the folder of the exported modchats, without the decryption key. The chat with the admins is 94 MB and the internal chat is 245 MB.<br> <br>Now, because I&#039;m an asshole, I&#039;m not doing this for free.

Instead they are mostly tired old men who whine a lot but are still gaining steam due to modern society collapsing.

As you can see on the website below he was in multpiple locations as a medic. Eventually in 1946 after the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, he was sent there to help any survivors. When he got back to America, he suffered from radiation poisoning for the rest of his life. The weird thing and my question for \/pol\/ is: the U.S. government did not include that he served in Hiroshima in his discharge papers. They refused to acknowledge he was ever there. I want to know why the government denies him being there and what can I do to get them to admit he was there?

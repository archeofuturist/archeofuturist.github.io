However, that philosophy, that culture, created societies by which all others are measured and found wanting. <br><br>What is the alternative? What culture has the east? What culture has Africa? They have the culture of &quot;manana&quot;, of &quot;insh&#039;allah. Abby nay, kul and hazar&#039; ho. If it works it works and if it doesn&#039;t it&#039;s not my fault and not my job to fix it. <br><br>You ask me how to measure a piece of art? How to measure a culture? Easy, you measure both by what they give to people. If a piece of art gives people vision and beauty and uplift, then it is worth something. If a culture gives it&#039;s people wealth and health and agency, then it is a good culture. How do you measure the worth of a culture? Personally, I measure it in infant mortality rates. I measure it in wars won, in colonies planted and in the spawning of great men.","time":1493625284,"resto":123590038,"id":"gxFHi17X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123588422,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:31:17","name":"Anonymous","sub":"RED ALERT JIDF OUT IN FORCE","com":"THEY ARE HERE NOW","filename":"987465432132416541651","ext":".jpg","w":1182,"h":684,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":144,"tim":1493620277684,"time":1493620277,"md5":"7r5k4o4ZiH2ij18Q2MoLjg==","fsize":123506,"resto":0,"id":"Pk2kExPg","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"red-alert-jidf-out-in-force","country_name":"United States","replies":29,"images":10,"omitted_posts":24,"omitted_images":9},{"no":123591575,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)03:11:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123588785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123588785<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123588981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123588981<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123589642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123589642<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123590261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123590261<\/a><br>\/pol\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Everyone who speaks up about Israel is a muslim leftist SJW<\/span><br>Any left wing board<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You literal Nazi anti Semite<\/span>","filename":"1488481730292","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":672,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493622698840,"time":1493622698,"md5":"HG7D3FBly\/yq2+VKCVBKaQ==","fsize":64803,"resto":123588422,"id":"Pk2kExPg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123592128,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)03:19:55","com":"<a href=\"#p123591575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123591575<\/a><br>those SJW college kids are part of (((their))) attacks of society, just saying this newest influx doesnt appear to be JIDF specifically, although JIDF and other shills always operate, hence this post <a href=\"#p123589642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123589642<\/a>","time":1493623195,"resto":123588422,"id":"XS6VwpaL","country":"CR","trip":"!!N\/rXIUiSjoZ","country_name":"Costa Rica"},{"no":123592229,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)03:21:22","com":"<a href=\"#p123591575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123591575<\/a><br>i think you read my post out of context, i am not saying you are a college sjw shill, i am saying this newest influx of normies, are.","time":1493623282,"resto":123588422,"id":"XS6VwpaL","country":"CR","trip":"!!N\/rXIUiSjoZ","country_name":"Costa Rica"},{"no":123592367,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)03:23:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Do (((they))) even get paid?","filename":"tb","ext":".png","w":500,"h":303,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1493623397683,"time":1493623397,"md5":"MXiSobpL4A1DDOmL5dtVcQ==","fsize":68144,"resto":123588422,"id":"I+7h6lCR","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123594434,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)03:54:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123588422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123588422<\/a><br>supported platforms:<br>stops at Vista<br>firefox 1.5 and 2.0<br>that pic is a little bit old, no?","time":1493625246,"resto":123588422,"id":"fLSog3r0","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123594132,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)03:49:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"All these zombie movies...

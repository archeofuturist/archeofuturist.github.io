Most pretend to have one, which they pretend to enjoy, but most don&#039;t. I can&#039;t say I don&#039;t have enough friends and even some good friends, which I have managed to hold a deep connection, but still I think I&#039;m kind of an outlier and it was partly luck, because most people have pretty weak bonds of friendship. Since my friends are spread I have, quiet a decent amount of time for myself, which I enjoy too. There is a sense of perpetual longing in me for more and for the distant. I can&#039;t tell it with certainty, if my live was really worth it or wasn&#039;t. I believe it was, but in a very subjective way, in which you tend to forget much of the bad things and can barley tell by which standards you made your desicon. The more I thought, about dead the less I seem to fear it and also the older I got. I feel we don&#039;t know enough, about dead to really decide. Sometimes it&#039;s a strange feeling to have something in the world, which you can be sure of and it seems to natural to should make you afraid. I believe Neets have a more decent live and at the time more frighting perspective than others. Many of the neets are undoubtly more happy, than much of the rest of the society.

I think she\u2019s incredibly brave, but knowing Asian moms \/ white dads, who dream of that all-American white picket fence, this kind of thing probably makes them nuts. No, WMAW is rarely progressive. As I said, nobody really knows what we go through as half-Asians with white dads \/ Asian moms\u2026 even if they\u2019re \u201cnot that bad\u201d (which I\u2019m sure Schuyler\u2019s parents aren\u2019t), we still have a shiiiiiiitload of issues.<br>This is another interesting case demonstrating what we go through.<br><br>I think many of us half-Asian kids internalize the highly sexualized aspect of WMAW and the stereotypes of the Asian china doll belonging to the white male\u2026. As I said, you don\u2019t grow up under a stereotypical \u201cwhite man and Asian woman\u201d couple, completely ignore its stereotypes (especially when your mom and dad live up to the stereotypes \u2013 and even if they don\u2019t, I mean, c\u2019mon, even still\u2026), surrounded by a white society that hates Asian people but loves Asian vagina.<br><br>Witnessing that dynamic (the dominant white male \/ submissive Asian woman image) as a child might so upset the female child as to push her to try to escape her gender, wherein she no longer feels like she falls under the sexual gaze of the white male father.<br><br>I\u2019m actually being serious here.<br><br>White man \/ Asian woman couples are straight up weird.

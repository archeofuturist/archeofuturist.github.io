I paid my $6.95 to rent the title, and sat back, prepared for outrage.<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.baka.com.au\/comment\/the-<wbr>red-pill-ban-an-absurdity-only-onli<wbr>ne-activism-could-create-20170421-g<wbr>vpd1l.html","filename":"1473986347001","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":613,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":159,"tim":1493066901713,"time":1493066901,"md5":"Q32wIFyRkeR0H\/tZauHPHA==","fsize":269262,"resto":0,"id":"i4X0+FdS","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"annabel-crabb-the-red-pill-movie-ban-is-an","country_name":"Israel","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122631937,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:19:42","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Can other regions even compete?","filename":"NAFTA_logo","ext":".png","w":550,"h":450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":204,"tim":1493065182883,"time":1493065182,"md5":"DkCl3fraQLnvdO7bKwXFkA==","fsize":62453,"resto":0,"id":"XG25KrU9","country":"MX","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-other-regions-even-compete","country_name":"Mexico","replies":12,"images":1,"omitted_posts":7,"omitted_images":0},{"no":122633177,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:29:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122632120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122632120<\/a><br>America:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;war criminals<\/span><br>patriots<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jewish puppets<\/span><br>you mean the politicans and the tiny SJW population, a lot of us are woke af<br>Mexico:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spics<\/span><br>there is a lot of white DNA in Mexico from Spanish and other colonizers, lurk moar<br>Canada:<br><a href=\"#p122632069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122632069<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;AFUCKINGLEAF<\/span><br>can&#039;t argue with this","time":1493065780,"resto":122631937,"id":"fIN8sB9e","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122633233,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:30:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122631937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122631937<\/a><br>Bump<br><br>I fucking love \/cum\/!","time":1493065801,"resto":122631937,"id":"B1mpIDgK","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122633263,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:30:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122632446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122632446<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;your<\/span>","time":1493065817,"resto":122631937,"id":"5af+HHvp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122634139,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:37:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Have all the diversity you would want in Mexico<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Have the powerhouse in the US<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Have all the maple and bacon in Canada<\/span><br><br>What&#039;s not to love?","time":1493066222,"resto":122631937,"id":"XG25KrU9","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122635514,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:48:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122634139\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122634139<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have all the (((diversity))) you want in Mexico<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have all the obesity you want in the US<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have diabetes in Canada<\/span><br>kek<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What&#039;s not to love?<\/span><br>Neocon shills<br>Civic Nationalists<br>Leftists<br>Liberals<br>Mass Immigration<br>Trudeau<br>99% of the population actually","time":1493066901,"resto":122631937,"id":"fIN8sB9e","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122597010,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)11:25:03","name":"Anonymous","sub":"It&#039;s official","com":"No space colony <br>He chose to eat from the tree of knowledge","filename":"IMG_0280","ext":".png","w":640,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493047503080,"time":1493047503,"md5":"LccbMl3oRsOrwDXOPBxg2g==","fsize":288974,"resto":0,"id":"u2KwAZrB","country":"US","bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-official","country_name":"United States","replies":306,"images":65,"omitted_posts":301,"omitted_images":65,"tail_size":50},{"no":122635963,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:51:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122606084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122606084<\/a><br>Are you fucking 12 years old?

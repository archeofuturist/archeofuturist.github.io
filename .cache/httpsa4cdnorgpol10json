Especially now that there&#039;s like four or five of them airing at the same time? Like the biggest problem is that they all share the same write team or some shit and every day all five of the shows will run the same exact topic and joke points, gets pretty old especially when it&#039;s the same topic (Trump) almost everyday. They hardly brush up on any other topic at all anymore, a good half of their shows are devoted to cracking jokes on Trump and friends. Then comes the other problem that a lot of the shows are pretty mediocre and don&#039;t really have anything special to carry them, like especially Trevor&#039;s show, it almost feels like him and his correspondents don&#039;t even really want to be on the show, it&#039;s really awkward to watch and given it&#039;s the same rehashed material and mediocrity it&#039;s kind of bad, I appreciate them trying but they&#039;ve really spread themselves out too bad. Like they really should consolidate back into just one or two quality shows instead of these five or so meh shows. Like shit, isn&#039;t one of Trevor&#039;s correspondents getting another show, like his own show can barely stay a float and they&#039;re already trying to grab a meh guy from a meh show to run an entire show on his own.<br>I feel the only okay ones right now are Bee, Oliver and Colbert, the prior ones occasionally have an actually interesting topic that they focus on and the latter has some fun interviews.

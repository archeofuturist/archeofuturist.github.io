I accept it more particularly as it comes from a colored lady, for if there is any one on God&#039;s earth who loves the ladies I believe it is myself. ( Immense applause and laughter.) I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to elevate every man to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going. I have not said anything about politics today. I don&#039;t propose to say anything about politics. You have a right to elect whom you please; vote for the man you think best, and I think, when that is done, you and I are freemen. Do as you consider right and honest in electing men for office. I did not come here to make you a long speech, although invited to do so by you. I am not much of a speaker, and my business prevented me from preparing myself. I came to meet you as friends, and welcome you to the white people. I want you to come nearer to us. When I can serve you I will do so. We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment Many things have been said about me which are wrong, and which white and black persons here, who stood by me through the war, can contradict. Go to work, be industrious, live honestly and act truly, and when you are oppressed I&#039;ll come to your relief.

If white men were not allowed to vote, it is unlikely that the United Kingdom would be leaving the European Union, it is unlikely that Donald Trump would now be the President of the United States, and it is unlikely that the Democratic Alliance would now be governing four of South Africa&#039;s biggest cities.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If white men no longer had the vote, the progressive cause would be strengthened. It would not be necessary to deny white men indefinitely \u2013 the denial of the vote to white men for 20 years (just less than a generation) would go some way to seeing a decline in the influence of reactionary and neo-liberal ideology in the world. The influence of reckless white males were one of the primary reasons that led to the Great Recession which began in 2008. This would also strike a blow against toxic white masculinity, one that is long needed.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At the same time, a denial of the franchise to white men, could see a redistribution of global assets to their rightful owners. After all, white men have used the imposition of Western legal systems around the world to reinforce modern capitalism. A period of twenty years without white men in the world&#039;s parliaments and voting booths will allow legislation to be passed which could see the world&#039;s wealth far more equitably shared. The violence of white male wealth and income inequality will be a thing of the past.<\/span><br><br>-continued-","filename":"shelley_garland","ext":".jpg","w":230,"h":359,"tn_w":160,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492116368793,"time":1492116368,"md5":"5gRBiaelSJD9nUhlNnfghw==","fsize":18881,"resto":0,"id":"8oTQzuTJ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"could-it-be-time-to-deny-white-men-the-franchise","country_name":"United States","replies":242,"images":34,"omitted_posts":237,"omitted_images":34,"tail_size":50},{"no":120986709,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)20:06:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120986377\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120986377<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Government spending skyrocketed under his administration which he publicly later regretted after his presidency<\/span><br><br>No, YOU are the fucking retard assuming someone is not a leftist because they are a Republican","time":1492128388,"resto":120960863,"id":"8oTQzuTJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120986819,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)20:07:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120986559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120986559<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You must be over 18 to post here<\/span>","time":1492128444,"resto":120960863,"id":"8oTQzuTJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120988979,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)20:25:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120985197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120985197<\/a><br>At least he has accomplished more than being a kangaroo-fucking shitposter on a Taiwanese basket weaving public access channel","time":1492129501,"resto":120960863,"id":"8oTQzuTJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120989228,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)20:26:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120960863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120960863<\/a><br>what is xer&#039;s gender and race? looks like a half asian man in a wig.","time":1492129616,"resto":120960863,"id":"gswLXd6J","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120989379,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)20:28:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120989228\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120989228<\/a><br>It&#039;s a crossdressing South African fag with probably botox","time":1492129686,"resto":120960863,"id":"8oTQzuTJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

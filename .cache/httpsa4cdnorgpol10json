His talents for speaking, publicity and propaganda were quickly recognized,[3] and by early 1920 he had gained authority in the party, which changed its name to the NSDAP (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei or National Socialist German Workers&#039; Party) in February 1920.[4]<br>The precursor to the SA had acted informally and on an ad hoc basis for some time before this. Hitler, with an eye always to helping the party to grow through propaganda, convinced the leadership committee to invest in an advertisement in the M\u00fcnchener Beobachter (later renamed the V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter) for a mass meeting in the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus, to be held on 16 October 1919. Some 70 people attended, and a second such meeting was advertised for 13 November in the Eberlbrau beer hall. Some 130 people attended; there were hecklers, but Hitler&#039;s military friends promptly ejected them by force, and the agitators &quot;flew down the stairs with gashed heads.&quot; The next year, on 24 February, he announced the party&#039;s Twenty-Five Point program at a mass meeting of some 2000 people at the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus. Protesters tried to shout Hitler down, but his former army companions, armed with rubber truncheons, ejected the dissenters. The basis for the SA had been formed.&quot;<br><br>Con. later.","filename":"Put the SA in USA","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":426,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492897063040,"time":1492897063,"md5":"7OWCEMnKQWFCdr7aGgVboA==","fsize":101317,"resto":122330359,"id":"3f4slLD9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122331242,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)17:38:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122331121\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122331121<\/a><br>A permanent group of party members who would serve as the ruffian Saalschutzabteilung (meeting hall protection detachment) for the DAP gathered around Emil Maurice after the February 1920 incident at the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus. There was little organization or structure to this group. The group was also called the Ordnertruppen around this time.[6] More than a year later, on 3 August 1921, Hitler redefined the group as the &quot;Gymnastic and Sports Division&quot; of the party (Turn- und Sportabteilung), perhaps to avoid trouble with the government.[7] It was by now well recognized as an appropriate, even necessary, function or organ of the party. The future SA developed by organizing and formalizing the groups of ex-soldiers and beer hall brawlers who were to protect gatherings of the Nazi Party from disruptions from Social Democrats (SPD) and Communists (KPD) and to disrupt meetings of the other political parties. By September 1921 the name Sturmabteilung was being used informally for the group.[8] Hitler was the official head of the Nazi Party by this time.[9]<br><br>On 4 November 1921 the Nazi Party held a large public meeting in the Munich Hofbr\u00e4uhaus, which also attracted many Reds and other enemies of the Nazis. After Hitler had spoken for some time, the meeting erupted into a melee in which a small company of SA thrashed the opposition. The Nazis called this event the Saalschlacht (&quot;meeting hall battle&quot;), and it assumed legendary proportions in SA lore with the passage of time.

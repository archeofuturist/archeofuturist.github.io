And then every cop within 10 miles uses it as an excuse to turn their lights on and see just how damn fast the ugly ass ford explorers will fly over a speed bump on the way to the call. Which may end up being relatively minor. Maybe they only need 2 cars. And they get 20..This can get incredibly dangerous, Chicago streets are mostly very straight and you can build up a massive head of steam. Last thing the department wants is 2 squads going to the same call, having a criss cross crash at an intersection at 90mph. Bad press. Embarrassing. Hell there was just a crash the other day where a cop booking ass to a call accidentally crashed into a parked Honda and the guy in said Honda died. Generally the unit that originally called for the backup will call the slowdown once they&#039;ve got the help they need. Or a Sgt will do so. The dispatcher then repeats it. If you get in an accident responding to a situation where you thought another officers life was legitimately in danger, hey, still in trouble, but you had a valid reason, so you&#039;ll probably be alright.. If they called slowdown however , and you still crash into an ice cream truck at just below the speed of sound..

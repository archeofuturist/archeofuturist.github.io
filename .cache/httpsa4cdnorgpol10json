We know that the formation of fetishes &amp; other fringe kinks can come about by poignant sexual experiences had around the time of puberty, like say the first time you saw a girl&#039;s pussy was when you walked in on a girl shitting in the bathroom, then as you go on to develop your sexuality during puberty you get super turned on by scat stuff. <br><br>Similarly, a hugely disproportionate amount of gay men are molested during youth, so those experiences can dramatically alter the sexual psychology of a person. <br><br>Sexuality is very malleable to environmental conditions, in prison which is a high stress environment, even outside of cases of rape, dudes will lower their standards so low that the visceral contact is enough to justify gay sex, just to achieve orgasm. <br><br>So along these lines it&#039;s not so absurd to think that people who have a large sexual drives and can&#039;t attain a girlfriend or are too inept to solicit a prostitute, will fry their brains on porn, and eventually unravel into all sorts of weird avenues, in the search of satisfaction.

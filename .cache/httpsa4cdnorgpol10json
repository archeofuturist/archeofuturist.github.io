Everybody hates taxes, but they forget that the more government services provide, the more must be required in taxes. Democrats fake getting around this all the time by fudging the budget office reports and marking plans (like Obamacare) as &quot;revenue neutral&quot;. I think a lot of these problems are exacerbated by the two-party system, if the freedom caucus was a third party that was just closely allied with the Republicans, they could more effectively express their viewpoints.

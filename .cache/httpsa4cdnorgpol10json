Not so much:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The two Republicans who are trying to dethrone Trump I have stated are two men I would not shake hands with. John McCain, when a Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy as a Navy pilot, played a hog-dog maneuver on July 29, 1967 that killed 134 sailors. McCain while on the deck of the carrier U.S.S. Forrestal, pulled a trick by doing a \u201cwet start\u201d up of his jet to show off. This created a large startling flame and sudden shocking noise from the rear of a jet engine. He also seems to have apparently armed a weapon that resulted in launching a powerful Zuni rocket across the carrier\u2019s deck hitting other parked planes. The subsequent massive explosions, fire and destruction went several decks below and nearly sunk this U.S. aircraft carrier. This stunt resulted in the deaths of 134 sailors and seriously injure another 161 sailors blinding some.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Any other Navy pilot causing this type of death and destruction would have been grounded and charged. Not McCain. For you see, his grandfather was a famous FOUR STAR Navy admiral and his father was at the time a Navy FOUR STAR admiral. McCain was simply transferred and everything was covered-up. What is alleged to have happened thereafter is on that mission in Veitnam, McCain was so disliked by other pilots for what he did and his privileged status, they deliberately left him out to get shot down pulling away to leave him flying alone as an easy target.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.armstrongeconomics.com\/<wbr>international-news\/politics\/ny-time<wbr>s-first-reported-trump-was-wiretapp<wbr>ed-back-in-january\/","time":1490909362,"resto":118967424,"id":"Z7ef2PEG","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118971641,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:30:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"He&#039;s a fucking traitor that wants constant war<br>Now he&#039;s trying to provoke Supreme Leader","filename":"Capture","ext":".png","w":598,"h":556,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":116,"tim":1490909447630,"time":1490909447,"md5":"6ETSjjWhEKziy\/xlx0+7Og==","fsize":279556,"resto":118967424,"id":"35XwtKKl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118971676,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:31:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118967424\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118967424<\/a><br>globalist terrorist who doesn&#039;t give a fuck about the American people and colludes with his fellow international terrorists and currency manipulators to weaken the USA for personal gain and leave a trail of brown bodies while doing it.<br><br>he&#039;s going to hell and I hope he has a stroke soon","filename":"Pappy","ext":".jpg","w":424,"h":430,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490909464737,"time":1490909464,"md5":"m\/ZWvpml5oExhjiiPkWZkQ==","fsize":26395,"resto":118967424,"id":"24sKSQlg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118971875,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:32:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gets caught<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;people still think he&#039;s a hero.<\/span>","filename":"1462000031667","ext":".jpg","w":276,"h":280,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490909556721,"time":1490909556,"md5":"P4PXhho7p8hXGj+iu4Wc7Q==","fsize":24392,"resto":118967424,"id":"L4bd7Evc","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118972450,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:37:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118970160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118970160<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;American hero<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Songbird of Hanoi<\/span><br>Pick one","time":1490909856,"resto":118967424,"id":"t8FKo2Iq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118967190,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:54:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Prove you&#039;re not a blind follower and name 1 criticism of the political mainstream media industrial complex:<br><br>I&#039;ll start.<br><br>Jews.","filename":"a;sldkfasdf","ext":".png","w":445,"h":470,"tn_w":236,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490907282767,"time":1490907282,"md5":"2CF3NYsf5WvzptlJ1JrY8g==","fsize":419798,"resto":0,"id":"vsvrH46w","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"prove-youre-not-a-blind-follower-and-name-1","country_name":"United States","replies":28,"images":11,"omitted_posts":23,"omitted_images":8},{"no":118971405,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:28:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118970847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118970847<\/a><br>I actually just thought of a solution just now, if you would humor me?

He is the deformed product of free enterprise and his country\u2019s freakish love of fame. Because he had a TV show, he has name recognition. Because he\u2019s wealthy, he has a platform. Because he\u2019s an American narcissist whose lust for himself will never be satisfied even as his role as President of the United States.<br><br>Put another way, he is a derivative of Allen Ginsberg\u2019s Moloch. In his 1956 poem \u201cHowl,\u201d which quite rightly caused a ruckus, Ginsberg graphically and lengthily describes all the suffering souls of his generation. He then asks a very pertinent question, \u201cWhat sphinx of cement and aluminum bashed open their skulls and ate up their brains and imagination?\u201d<br><br>His answer is, in part:<br><br>Moloch! Solitude! Filth! Ugliness! Ashcans and unobtainable dollars! Children screaming under the stairways! Boys sobbing in armies! Old men weeping in the parks!<br>Moloch! Moloch! Nightmare of Moloch! Moloch the loveless! Mental Moloch! Moloch the heavy judger of men!<br>Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless jailhouse and Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judgment! Moloch the vast stone of war! Moloch the stunned governments!<br>Moloch whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch whose blood is running money! Moloch whose fingers are ten armies! Moloch whose breast is a cannibal dynamo! Moloch whose ear is a smoking tomb!<br> <br><br>And so on. The name Moloch first shows up in the Old Testament as a pagan god to whom children are sacrificed. Moloch becomes a projection of all that is coldly, crudely, viciously American. It is a horrifying vision.<br><br>It is highly likely that Trump now praises him. He has cast off the idiots who praised KEK and is now working with the very people who he claimed to be fighting against.

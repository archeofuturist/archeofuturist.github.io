That part of military assault is very (un)obvious. For example i was working in upper west side restaurant and one of the regulars made his fortune in real estate by utilizing such &quot;labor&quot; provided by prison industry. So he served as slave owner for former prisoners - very cheap labor. So he used to renovate brownhouses. SODA SOPA. He was already retired in the early 2000s. Of course it doesn&#039;t mean he was using prison labor. Maybe it was only &quot;ihre papiere bitte&quot; identities. I was asking about security and safety issues dealing with ex convict - it didn&#039;t seem an issue to him at all. So maybe human resources were in fact busy seabees or traveling journeymen al-qaeda of worshipful company of freemasons. <br>So in this sense prison in the target society serves as pool to attack the free society in unfair manner.

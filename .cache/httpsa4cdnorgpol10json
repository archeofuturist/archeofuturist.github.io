As a non white (majority of \/pol\/, see:HWNDU), I can see clearly what is going on. Or rather, what has already happened. The truth is, The genocide has already largely happened. The seeds were sown long ago and we&#039;re beginning to see the fruits now. The whites you see are stragglers. Whites aren&#039;t having kids. This might seem anecdotal, but any time I travel to a major American city, on the rare occasion that you see a white person, they&#039;re usually older (over 50). And if you see any that are in their 20s or 30s, they usually don&#039;t have a child. Instead they have a beautiful, purebred dog that they paid $3000 for. White people are starting to wake up, sure. This election in a way was evidence of that. But the truth is, the damage has been done.

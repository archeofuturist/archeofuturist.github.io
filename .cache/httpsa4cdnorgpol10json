They want to justify the infamous behavior at the front. But such talk is falsehood, helpful only to our enemies.Each commander, Red Army soldier and political commissar should understand that our means are not limitless. The territory of the Soviet state is not a desert, but people - workers, peasants, intelligentsia, our fathers, mothers, wives, brothers, children. The territory of the USSR which the enemy has captured and aims to capture is bread and other products for the army, metal and fuel for industry, factories, plants supplying the army with arms and ammunition, railroads. After the loss of Ukraine, Belarus, Baltic republics, Donetzk, and other areas we have much less territory, much less people, bread, metal, plants and factories. We have lost more than 70 million people, more than 800 million pounds of bread annually and more than 10 million tons of metal annually. Now we do not have predominance over the Germans in human reserves, in reserves of bread. To retreat further - means to waste ourselves and to waste at the same time our Motherland.Therefore it is necessary to eliminate talk that we have the capability endlessly to retreat, that we have a lot of territory, that our country is great and rich, that there is a large population, and that bread always will be abundant. Such talk is false and parasitic, it weakens us and benefits the enemy, if we do not stop retreating we will be without bread, without fuel, without metal, without raw material, without factories and plants, without railroads.,<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;This leads to the conclusion, it is time to finish retreating.

Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), along with Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.). About 70 other members of Congress, all Democrats, have said they support the bill, which would allow the Federal Trade Commission to classify conversion therapy and its practitioners as fraudulent.<br><br>\u201cThe bill is very simple,\u201d Lieu told The Washington Post. \u201cIt says it is fraud if you treat someone for a condition that doesn\u2019t exist and there\u2019s no medical condition known as being gay. LGBTQ people were born perfect; there is nothing to treat them for. And by calling this what it should be, which is fraud, it would effectively shut down most of the organizations.\u201d<br><br>Conversion therapy, also referred to as \u201creparative therapy\u201d or \u201cex-gay therapy,\u201d purports to be able to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation. Highly controversial, the practice has been decried by dozens of mental health, medical and LGBT rights groups as harmful and misleading. Nevertheless, very few states have passed legislation banning it.<br><br>A San Francisco State University study found that, compared to LGBT youth who are accepted, young people who experience rejection based on their sexual orientation or gender identity were eight times more likely to have attempted suicide, nearly six times more likely to report high levels of depression and more than three times as likely to use illegal drugs, according to the nonprofit Human Rights Campaign.<br><br>Seven states and the District of Columbia have successfully passed legislation to ban or restrict conversion therapy in some way. California was the first to do so, banning the practice outright in 2012; others are New Jersey, Oregon, Illinois, Vermont and, just this month, New Mexico. Although New York does not have an outright ban, the state effectively prohibits conversion therapy through administrative regulations.","filename":"convertible2","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493339047319,"time":1493339047,"md5":"+HqNSeliDfFDLbPDAyx+aA==","fsize":726211,"resto":0,"id":"gGqnDOJ4","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"democrats-introduce-bill-in-congress-to-ban","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":123116518,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)20:27:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123116150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123116150<\/a><br>bump","time":1493339234,"resto":123116150,"id":"imzZJ7LV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123104124,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)18:52:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why does it seem like social media is inherently left-leaning?","filename":"1489905473841","ext":".jpg","w":1357,"h":2048,"tn_w":165,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493333524795,"time":1493333524,"md5":"EDVk7Uz10sU4mZXNQYSy0Q==","fsize":233715,"resto":0,"id":"acmq2O\/G","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-does-it-seem-like-social-media-is-inherently","country_name":"United States","replies":66,"images":9,"omitted_posts":61,"omitted_images":9},{"no":123115428,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)20:18:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"It caters to the mentally ill","filename":"tgii6qrfuzty","ext":".jpg","w":1566,"h":936,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":74,"tim":1493338704429,"time":1493338704,"md5":"arg25AtsNzLtudDV3r0KmA==","fsize":159593,"resto":123104124,"id":"h9r3EWh6","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123115560,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)20:19:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123104124\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123104124<\/a><br>owned by jews<br><br>the bots that pretend to be people are jews<br><br>the most followed people are jews with botnet followers","time":1493338766,"resto":123104124,"id":"ppQTkm3W","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123115658,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)20:20:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Because social media is mostly a millennial thing, ran by millennials.

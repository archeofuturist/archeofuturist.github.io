That being said, there is one course of political action that, if properly implemented, would reform much of the world for the better: Eugenics. Thoughts on how we can persuasively and humanely implement sterilization? Perhaps some sort of voluntary means, for example:<br><br>You can go on some sort of supplemental or complete welfare program if you agree to be sterilized before having [x] number of children. This WOULD increase welfare spending in the short term, but over the course of what would have likely been a few generations of insane reproduction of types that would have been inclined to go onto welfare anyway, we would both save lower welfare costs over the long term and also make a better environment for the K-selected types to perhaps up their reproduction slightly. This is a really sloppy idea, I admit, so I want to throw this out for \/pol\/ to chew on and get some ideas for how we could make such a sale to society, or implement it in some PRACTICAL way. After all, &quot;gas all degenerates&quot; really is not a viable option, even if you didn&#039;t have any moral qualms about such a system.

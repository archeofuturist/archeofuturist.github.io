estrogen, in fact the effect on the body is different depending on the amount you intake, as far as i know in low amount phytoestrogens compete with estrogen so th effect on the body might be lower actually, with high amounts it would show estogenic effect,<br><br>the second reason why injecting a bunch of estrogen wont increase test is because the body doesnt have a mechanism to convert estrogen to test while it does have one for test to estrogen, its called aromatase and its only job is to convert excess test to

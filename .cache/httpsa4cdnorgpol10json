There was a civilization of humans before us that died out around 8000-12000 years ago in a cataclysmic event. In that event the humans who survived lost consciousness and as the smartest ones slowly regained it they created systems that relied on this ancient knowledge and which could easily be used to manipulate people and slowly coalesce them back into society (not necessarily all bad things). Jesus, Buddha, Mohammed, etc. all were created using archetypes from the previous generation.

There is ZERO respect for men that aren&#039;t GQ types with perfect hair. Women are stone cold hypergamists here and if you have so much as a slightly receding hairline, you are going to experience a SEXUAL DEATH SENTENCE. Bald men in Toronto are treated like complete garbage. I&#039;ve been ridiculed by strangers, people online, coworkers and even friends over my thinning hair, by both men and women. It wasn&#039;t like this before I was balding though, I actually had people treat me decently and it all went downhill over the years. This place is a nightmare if you havent won the genetic lottery, the sense of entitlement from BOTH sexes in Toronto is disgusting; women expect every man to be a Brad Pitt and all the men in Toronto feel as if they should be having sex with all the women, every night. The cockblocking he describes is real. The 2am cutoff for alcohol is a joke (its called a NIGHT club for a reason). But the women are a problem, its no wonder so many of them flock to the financial district looking for the 6 figure salary guy with perfect hair. Dont bother making small talk with women here, youre better off just cutting to the chase and telling her if youve got a car, your own place and your salary. Toronto is a career city, everyone here is shallow. The guys are no different, theyre just as bad. It&#039;s a city where both sexes are hellbent on destroying eachother.","filename":"1464079841563","ext":".jpg","w":470,"h":512,"tn_w":229,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492321695886,"time":1492321695,"md5":"Rs0qPkkYN1qBhQfr9V417Q==","fsize":74245,"resto":0,"id":"dSIwsPUE","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"as-a-balding-man-toronto-is-actually-much-worse","country_name":"Canada","replies":13,"images":2,"omitted_posts":8,"omitted_images":2},{"no":121326091,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)02:06:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121324322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121324322<\/a><br>depends on what the rest of your face looks like, this isn&#039;t fucking middle school<br>I&#039;ve had a receding hairline since 22 ish and kept it buzz length (don&#039;t shave, it&#039;s not a good look for WM)<br>No loss in confidence because I think it&#039;s attracting better women<br><br>I look at pics when I had hair and I looked like the generic Chad, which only attracted Staceys.<br><br>Idk, It&#039;s more about facial structure when females are older than 21.<br><br>if women are attracted to you with hair, they&#039;ll be attracted to you without imo.<br><br>it&#039;s about eye contact and being genuine in my experience.<br><br>tfw still no wife, because no I&#039;m not marrying anyone with more than 2 sex partners.<br>faceapp is the future unfortunately lol","filename":"1492116881246","ext":".jpg","w":1034,"h":1031,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492322804665,"time":1492322804,"md5":"+EsC3zncF6Neh2+1RAR3Nw==","fsize":158255,"resto":121324322,"id":"gMCuxGxm","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121326338,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)02:09:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121324322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121324322<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;balding<\/span><br>Shave it off you fucking pussy","time":1492322952,"resto":121324322,"id":"J\/mhixGA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121327560,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)02:21:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121324322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121324322<\/a><br>Balding male here as well.<br><br><br>I&#039;ve done a lot of research into the whole field of balding and I&#039;m still surprised that their is no &quot;universal&quot; cause for it. <br><br>While the genetic perspective on the subject has some merit, i&#039;ve been entertaining the conclusion that a huge driving force behind this epidemic is epigenetics.<br><br>Males undergo various forms of fitness tests throughout life and a common one is stress.

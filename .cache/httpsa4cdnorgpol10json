The Nazi &quot;Storm Detachment&quot; or &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot; arose out of a need to protect Nazi party meetings from violent Communists. <br><br>In the early days of the Nazi party and Hitler&#039;s rise, they were heckled as old-fashion, racists, traditionalists, etc. Largely by the KPD or Rotfront, the communists of 1920s\/30s Germany. Even in the early 30s, Hitler was talked about as a buffoon and a political novice who could be manipulated by the more traditional conservatives (even after the Nazi party had grown to be the largest party in Germany). Communist attacks on Nazis grew in intensity, and streetfighting soon commenced (going from barroom brawls to fighting with clubs to finally shooting at each other). Many Nazis were assassinated by Communists and Horst Wessel Lied, the Nazi anthem, was a song written by one of the men turned into a martyr by Goebbels&#039; propaganda.<br><br>Watching what happened at the Battle of Berkeley and the way the police completely refused to intervene, I am beginning to think that conservatives\/alt-right need better organization and an outfit like the Sturmabteilung to protect people and make sure Communists can no longer attack old people or try to kick people to death on the floor.... or throw fucking explosives.<br><br>I&#039;m gonna quote some stuff from (((wikipedia))), and tell me if it doesn&#039;t sound familiar.","filename":"Based Stickman","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":540,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492634012726,"time":1492634012,"md5":"VXhG\/A0cJuLJBHR4uRZ6hA==","fsize":74738,"resto":0,"id":"N86kXioi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"american-stumabteilung","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":4},{"no":121892216,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:35:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121891978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121891978<\/a><br>The DAP (Deutsche Arbeiterpartei or German Workers&#039; Party) was formed in Munich in January 1919 and Adolf Hitler joined it in September of that year. His talents for speaking, publicity and propaganda were quickly recognized,[3] and by early 1920 he had gained authority in the party, which changed its name to the NSDAP (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei or National Socialist German Workers&#039; Party) in February 1920.[4]<br><br>The precursor to the SA had acted informally and on an ad hoc basis for some time before this. Hitler, with an eye always to helping the party to grow through propaganda, convinced the leadership committee to invest in an advertisement in the M\u00fcnchener Beobachter (later renamed the V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter) for a mass meeting in the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus, to be held on 16 October 1919. Some 70 people attended, and a second such meeting was advertised for 13 November in the Eberlbrau beer hall. Some 130 people attended; there were hecklers, but Hitler&#039;s military friends promptly ejected them by force, and the agitators &quot;flew down the stairs with gashed heads.&quot; The next year, on 24 February, he announced the party&#039;s Twenty-Five Point program at a mass meeting of some 2000 people at the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus.

The group was also called the Ordnertruppen around this time.[6] More than a year later, on 3 August 1921, Hitler redefined the group as the &quot;Gymnastic and Sports Division&quot; of the party (Turn- und Sportabteilung), perhaps to avoid trouble with the government.[7] It was by now well recognized as an appropriate, even necessary, function or organ of the party. The future SA developed by organizing and formalizing the groups of ex-soldiers and beer hall brawlers who were to protect gatherings of the Nazi Party from disruptions from Social Democrats (SPD) and Communists (KPD) and to disrupt meetings of the other political parties. By September 1921 the name Sturmabteilung was being used informally for the group.[8] Hitler was the official head of the Nazi Party by this time.[9]","filename":"Put the SA in USA","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":426,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492634249146,"time":1492634249,"md5":"7OWCEMnKQWFCdr7aGgVboA==","fsize":101317,"resto":121891978,"id":"N86kXioi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121892735,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:39:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121891978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121891978<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121892216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121892216<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121892506\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121892506<\/a><br>On 4 November 1921 the Nazi Party held a large public meeting in the Munich Hofbr\u00e4uhaus, which also attracted many Reds and other enemies of the Nazis.

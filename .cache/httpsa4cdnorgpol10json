He surmised that because they still physically appear very semitic, their brains must be largely similar to the Jews of old. This is incorrect because Jewish women steal powerful gentiles and make their children into Jews -- this practice is unique to Judaism. This means that ultra-wealthy Jews are far less &quot;Jewish&quot; than they claim, even after only a few generations of gene-thievery.

That conclusion is that we really fucking need Christianity. I&#039;m actually an atheist, but I&#039;ve thought quite a while on this, and this is the conclusion I&#039;ve come to. Everything is shitty in the way it is right now thanks to religion going out of style. As much as the bible is filled with authoritarian bullshit...some of that bullshit is highly potent truth about maintaining society. It is entirely possible to live without a bible to guide you and still have strong morals and understanding of values in society, however it is not a given. I think many attempting to think freely reach this state...they think a little bit about religion, and realize 1) theres some bullshit, and 2) some of it is restrictive. The automatic reaction is to fully reject religion. Unfortunately it seems most stop there, they don&#039;t continue to contemplate about the idea of God, or the point of humanities existence etc etc. <br>This, combined with innate instinctual desire to see humanity succeed, creates your typical liberal atheist: A person who doesn&#039;t give the slightest fuck about religion, and likely a loose understanding of morals.<br><br>Given all I&#039;ve learned about religion and Christianity...I&#039;ve concluded we desperately need religion, and Christianity is the absolute best one, most likely to be the most successful and lead to the best most civilized world.

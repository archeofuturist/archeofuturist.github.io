Concerning that \/pol\/ was about to be kill, the original users made a discord and advertised the discord on the thread. Month after month hundreds and thousands of users flocked to the discord for a more structured and organized place for politically incorrect discussion. There were raids against many foes and friendships were founded with other discords. Many famous autists and kameraden from the board passed through the doors of the server. There was drama, too much fucking drama holy shit.Over that time the community grew and grew. New channels were introduced to represent the growing community and the mod group was expanded. Happenings happened, memes were memed, and there was autism on a scale that had never been seen before. A lot of fun times are had in this discord, and every night when you hop on you; will see channels full of people talking in text. You hop on voice chat in the general channels and you hear \/pol\/, in all its grandeur.

My ex-girlfriend was a Middle Eastern Jew, clearly trying to get me to race mix by having a relationship with me, so I cut her off entirely, typical Jews trying to force half-breed kids on the world. Her (((mom))) literally attempted suicide after I called her a \u201cgreedy kike\u201d (she pretended to love me, but thanks to \/pol\/ I was aware that this was all deception). My parents were literal cucks who voted against Trump and got mad at me when I pointed out where (((they))) were manipulating their ideas, when they heard about how redpilled I was with that kike girlfriend they acted all cucked and demanded I see some Pajeet therapist who gave me (((medication))). I stopped going, never gonna take the Jew drugs. It\u2019s really sad how far that Jew went to pretend that she wanted her daughter to marry a non-Jew, desu I feel sorry for Jews that have to try that hard to submit a white person to their lies.","filename":"racemixing mtv","ext":".jpg","w":501,"h":595,"tn_w":210,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492569233490,"time":1492569233,"md5":"BJob6FBLg72yCfOGC6pkew==","fsize":69957,"resto":0,"id":"erx4nUdA","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-was-right","country_name":"United States","replies":26,"images":12,"omitted_posts":21,"omitted_images":11},{"no":121793335,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)23:19:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121790615\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121790615<\/a><br>doing gods work<br><br><a href=\"#p121792596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121792596<\/a><br>k","time":1492571987,"resto":121787168,"id":"tMtRjccp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121793499,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)23:21:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121788565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121788565<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121789008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121789008<\/a><br>I want to fuck that cartoon horse really really badly","time":1492572072,"resto":121787168,"id":"DwNYbwae","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121793676,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)23:22:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121787168\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121787168<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i<\/span><br>stfu and gtfo you faggot","time":1492572172,"resto":121787168,"id":"x6RpPg9B","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121793731,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)23:23:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121792596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121792596<\/a><br>Don&#039;t forget super male vitality","time":1492572199,"resto":121787168,"id":"MjI9aEdK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121796006,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)23:43:37","name":"Sage","com":"<a href=\"#p121787168\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121787168<\/a><br>This isn&#039;t subtle at all.

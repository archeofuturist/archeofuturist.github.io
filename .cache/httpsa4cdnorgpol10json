She, of course, picked a new doll. The obsession is real. While we were checking out, the cashier asked Sophia if she was going to a birthday party. We both gave her a blank stare. She then pointed to the doll and asked Sophia if she picked her out for a friend. Sophia continued to stare blankly and I let the cashier know that she was a prize for Sophia being fully potty trained. The woman gave me a puzzled look and turned to Sophia and asked, &quot;Are you sure this is the doll you want, honey?&quot; Sophia finally found her voice and said, &quot;Yes, please!&quot; The cashier replied, &quot;But she doesn&#039;t look like you. We have lots of other dolls that look more like you.&quot; I immediately became angry, but before I could say anything, Sophia responded with, &quot;Yes, she does. She&#039;s a doctor like I&#039;m a doctor. And I&#039;m a pretty girl and she&#039;s a pretty girl. See her pretty hair? And see her stethoscope?&quot; Thankfully the cashier decided to drop the issue and just answer, &quot;Oh, that&#039;s nice.&quot; This experience just confirmed my belief that we aren&#039;t born with the idea that color matters. Skin comes in different colors just like hair and eyes and every shade is beautiful. #itswhatsontheinsidethatcounts #allskinisbeautiful #teachlove #teachdiversity #thenextgenerationiswatching&quot;","filename":"nog","ext":".png","w":365,"h":378,"tn_w":241,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491294466839,"time":1491294466,"md5":"7kpnuF0ZTgC7+1ytPai9Qw==","fsize":212545,"resto":0,"id":"Y98CD3w5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-wuz-dolls","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":119427378,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)23:55:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"how will western civilization end?","filename":"dsf","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":363,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":181,"tim":1491278104843,"time":1491278104,"md5":"4H80azECda1nCjEZfn4Xww==","fsize":310350,"resto":0,"id":"8KFEH8n5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-will-western-civilization-end","country_name":"United States","replies":185,"images":39,"omitted_posts":180,"omitted_images":38,"tail_size":50},{"no":119447011,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)04:05:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119446834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119446834<\/a><br>I know, I&#039;m just joking about 2012.","time":1491293115,"resto":119427378,"id":"fOd7nHGr","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119447012,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)04:05:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119427378\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119427378<\/a><br>with a roaring applause","time":1491293115,"resto":119427378,"id":"BfAUdTJs","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119447437,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)04:11:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119433144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119433144<\/a><br>Japan?

Immigrants throw themselves at the walls with bombs strapped to their chests, significantly reducing the outsider population. People inside the wall live in a right-libertarian paradise. Protesters are routinely run over for blocking traffic and every home has at least three guns.<br><br>Suddenly, Super-Muhammad, the giant Frankenstein&#039;s Arab built off of the remains of Jihadists climbs over the wall and detonated the weapons of mass destruction strapped to his chest. The wall-dwellers retaliate, and push out of the wall, eradicating outsiders.<br><br>2100<br><br>Birds are chirping. The sun is shining. People hum softly as they clean their rifles.

This means, generally speaking, your country must consent to following international law. In theory, this means that your country could stop following international law when that law stops favoring it. But, for some strange reason, countries tend not to be quite this bold\u2014but then again, there are scores of exceptions at every level involving every sort of rule.<br><br>Prior to 1945, and much more prior to WWI, the vehicle of international law was the threat of war. It&#039;s still somewhat possible to see military action lie to address violations of international law\u2014Trump&#039;s bombardment of the Syrian air field, for instance. The overall character, however, of military action within the general field of international law is quite different today.<br><br>Today it&#039;s more of a &quot;carrot and stick&quot; system. Things like foreign aid, relaxed barriers to trade, and concessions in terms of past actions form the &quot;carrot&quot; part. Things like trading sanctions, interference with diplomatic actions, and limited military interventions to prevent specific acts form the &quot;stick&quot; part. The &quot;stick&quot; bits are sometimes collectively called &quot;countermeasures.&quot; I had a professor in law school who was REALLY into them as a means of effecting change on the international stage.","time":1493743816,"resto":123785295,"id":"yp0kco6j","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123787382,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)12:52:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123785484\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123785484<\/a><br>Leaf gets it","time":1493743955,"resto":123785295,"id":"e6lKY83X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123787730,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)12:55:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123787123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123787123<\/a><br><br>This is a pretty detailed response, thanks Anon.<br><br>The problem arises when a country attempts to justify breaking international law stating that another country has broken international law, using your Syrian airfield strike for example.<br><br>Even though Al-Assad &#039;gassed&#039; his own people and broke convention, Trump also broke convention by bombing without security council approval (even though they would never allow such a strike to happen).","time":1493744132,"resto":123785295,"id":"+NsUTx48","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123787911,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)12:57:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123785295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123785295<\/a><br>International law is just virtue signalling writ large.

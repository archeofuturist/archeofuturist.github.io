I don&#039;t see the advantages, even the all the EU legislations where - even if annoying - kind of minor and now over 20000 legislations have to be revised, lots of stuff has to be rebuilt from scratch. <br><br>And no, I don&#039;t let the &quot;keep your mudslimes, niggers EU!&quot; etc. as an argument, Britain has always accepted lots of poos and other foreigners to their country and they will neither stop doing this nor throw out who is already there because of Brexit.

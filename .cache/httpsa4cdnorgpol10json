Essential to the concept of insurance is that no one expects to use it. For the holder, insurance is a hedge against unforeseen, rare, and catastrophic outcomes. For the lender, insurance is a bet that the holder won\u2019t call in the liability. The classic insurance scenario, which dates back to the age of Hammurabi, is when merchants take out loans contingent on a vessel\u2019s safe return from a voyage; if the ship were to sink at sea, the loan would not have to be repaid.<br><br>Today, what is called \u201chealth insurance\u201d is better understood as a pre-payment or installment program. Everyone expects to use their \u201cinsurance\u201d many time a year. Both Trumpcare and Obamacare seek to lower these installment payments by creating mandates and incentives that pool the healthy and the sick, the young and old, as a way of averaging out costs. Fiddling with this absurd model is much like trying to repair a car\u2019s engine by giving it a new paint job.<br><br>Moreover, the fact that America has decided to socialize the insurance market, as opposed to socializing healthcare providers, reveals something important about our collective psyche and delusions.","time":1490332557,"resto":118044978,"id":"YGwjoUQG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118044979,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:11:53","name":"Anonymous","sub":"The Case for Being a Cuck","com":"http:\/\/www.gq.com\/story\/the-case-fo<wbr>r-being-a-cuck<br><br>it&#039;s over<br>it&#039;s ok to be a cuckold lads<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jason Kander is an Afghanistan veteran who can literally assemble a gun blindfolded.

I figured out The Holy Bible Really Is True 100% so, sorry but I also repent for that because why would I be sorry for knowing God and Jesus Christ The Truth?

The judge argued that in &quot;the mentality of the Turkish cultural circle,&quot; what the woman &quot;had experienced as rape&quot; might be considered merely &quot;wild sex.&quot; The judge refused to convict the rapist, because &quot;no intention is demonstrable.&quot;<br><br>According to the German daily newspaper M\u00e4rkische Allgemeine (forgive the weak translation from Google Translate), the judge told the woman, &quot;I believe Mrs. G. every word,&quot; but added that &quot;her tormentor probably did not know what he was doing to her.&quot; On the night of August 18, 2016, the 23-year-old Turkish man sold drugs to the young woman and they consumed speed together.<br><br>He asked her to &quot;go to bed with her&quot; and she refused. According to the report, she had said he was &quot;not her type.&quot; But the drug dealer forced himself on her. Here&#039;s how the paper described the encounter:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The young drug trader then complimented his customer, dragged her by the arm, threw her on the bed and pulled her out. He shoved his shoulders firmly against the metal bars at the head of his bed, his head jammed between two of them. The woman cried &quot;stop&quot; and resisted by scratching the accused at the back. But at some point she gave up and let her go as she put it. Several times he had entered her, the whole ordeal ended after four hours, when he got a call and suddenly had to leave, so that she too could go. <\/span><br><br>She refused, cried &quot;stop&quot; after he had grabbed her, and then finally she gave up. To most people, that sounds like rape. Indeed, the German paper reported that the Turkish man &quot;carried on the sexual intercourse for hours on end so badly&quot; that the girl could &quot;not run properly for the next two weeks.&quot;","filename":"1491796936130","ext":".jpg","w":853,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492850790320,"time":1492850790,"md5":"01xET8qXbSdy5lg7MB7WVQ==","fsize":90249,"resto":0,"id":"qOK9EDAh","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"german-judge-says-turkish-mans-forced-violent-sex","country_name":"United States","replies":32,"images":5,"omitted_posts":27,"omitted_images":5},{"no":122258092,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:23:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122256613\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122256613<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Msy<\/span><br><br>hahahaha shit tier image fuck you","time":1492852987,"resto":122255811,"id":"XpG2RLyF","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122258343,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:26:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122258092\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122258092<\/a><br>butthurt papas faggot detected<br>go kiss nigger feet","time":1492853209,"resto":122255811,"id":"TGMBPdT4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122258404,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:27:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122255811\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122255811<\/a><br><br>But what about &quot;No means no&quot;?","time":1492853261,"resto":122255811,"id":"uZXPzyH5","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122258685,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:31:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122258404\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122258404<\/a><br><br>By being white you have given consent to get robbed for the extermination of your people inside Germany according to (((merkel)))","time":1492853496,"resto":122255811,"id":"NMWkQusT","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122259105,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:38:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Luther<\/span><br>The Papists throwing a hissy fit for thirty years because Luther called out their Pharisee-type bullshit is not Luther&#039;s fault.","time":1492853880,"resto":122255811,"id":"2lHRlqUp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122259104,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:38:00","name":"Anonymous","com":".","filename":"hate speech","ext":".png","w":589,"h":381,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":161,"tim":1492853880705,"time":1492853880,"md5":"8SJ3tlay7UY9dPQ+HDDiXQ==","fsize":58560,"resto":0,"id":"SkSG7\/Rn","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122252832,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)03:58:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"What&#039;s the most common blue pill you see on this board, \/pol\/? <br><br>The one I notice the most is the climate change blue pill.

Or more sinister, organized elements?<br><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/IIMZm<br><br>Officials in Dallas said the city\u2019s warning system was hacked late on Friday night, disrupting the city when all 156 of its emergency sirens sounded into the early hours of Saturday morning.<br>The alarms, which started going off around 11:40 p.m. Friday and lasted until 1:20 a.m. Saturday, created a sense of fear and confusion, jarring residents awake and flooding 911 with thousands of calls, officials said.<br><br>Mayor Mike Rawlings called the breach \u201can attack on our emergency notification system\u201d and said it was evidence of a need to upgrade and safeguard the city\u2019s technology infrastructure.<br>\u201cWe will work to identify and prosecute those responsible,\u201d he wrote on his Facebook page.<br><br>The alarms blasted for 90-second durations about 15 times, Rocky Vaz, the director of the city\u2019s Office of Emergency Management, told reporters at a news conference.<br><br>Mr. Vaz said emergency workers and technicians had to first figure out whether the sirens had been activated because of an actual emergency. And turning off the sirens also proved difficult, eventually prompting officials to shut down the entire system.<br><br>\u201cEvery time we thought we had turned it off, the sirens would sound again, because whoever was hacking us was continuously hacking us,\u201d Ms. Syed said.<br><br>Mr. Vaz said that Dallas had reached out to the Federal Communications Commission for help and was taking steps to prevent hackers from setting off the entire system again, but that city officials had not communicated with federal law enforcement authorities.<br><br>Security officials have warned for years about the risks that hacking attacks can pose to infrastructure. The number of attacks on critical infrastructure appears to have risen: to nearly 300 in 2015 from just under 200 in 2012, according to federal data. In 2013, hackers tied to the Iranian military tried to gain control of a small dam in upstate New York.","filename":"texas","ext":".png","w":615,"h":599,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":243,"tim":1491729813257,"time":1491729813,"md5":"vwn1\/yEyBq9vvoXY9Iu0zg==","fsize":26360,"resto":0,"id":"ojDdNL8X","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"midnight-dallas-sirens-confirmed-work-of-hackers","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":120265184,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:48:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120263265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120263265<\/a><br>bump","time":1491731326,"resto":120263265,"id":"nxfb2EPh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120265261,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:49:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120263265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120263265<\/a><br>Told ya so.<br>They&#039;ve been doing this shit for a while.","time":1491731378,"resto":120263265,"id":"oqWw2weC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120252841,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)03:01:29","name":"Anonymous","sub":"AUSPOL Cheap goon from Aldi edition","com":"G&#039;day you filthy cunts<br>I guess Blumf was really a filthy kike all along huh?

What the fuck?<br>And then this morning an army guy came to my for and said &quot;you&#039;re going to fucking die soon&quot; and then he left.

Last month, he just off and left for an entire week with his family down to Florida (or some other tropical place if you are in Florida already). Didn&#039;t say anything.

Something big is definitely up for Sunday.<br><br>Finally though, the biggest sign that something isn&#039;t right is that earlier this week, I awoke to flashing lights and sound. Everyone shuffled out of the building, and I heard some people whispering something about an oven. Are they preparing to put us into gas chambers?<br><br>I&#039;m shaking and scared.

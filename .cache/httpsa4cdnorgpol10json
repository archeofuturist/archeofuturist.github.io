Then I think of how little people in the 21st appreciate the people who had to work and go against the grain of society to fight for freedom. We aren&#039;t a perfect society, but you can&#039;t really say we are an evil society. We are constantly seeing progressive changes year by year. It&#039;s just that now, some people (especially on the left) want to totally upend the old traditions of traditions and replace them with muh emotions that might seem all well and good on paper, but lead to hasty decisions. I hate this propaganda culture being propagated by the globalist elites to ensure the population becomes consumerist toddlers who don&#039;t think for themselves.

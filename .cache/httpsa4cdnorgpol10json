Politics (and what comes with it - government, etc.) have an impact on your life. When you discuss left vs right and authoritarian vs libertarian, you&#039;re talking about the use of force. You&#039;re enacting legislation, and laws have to be enforced by people with guns and the threat of violence (physically or civilly), fundamentally. If you don&#039;t pay your taxes, the taxman&#039;s going to TAKE the money, whether you like it or not. A tax levy or lien, criminal tax evasion charges, etc.<br><br>You ask, &quot;why should I care? I&#039;m just a man, I can&#039;t change the system - plus, I&#039;ll be dead and none of it will matter.&quot; Well, to say individuals have no effect on politics or society at large is untrue, I would argue. You&#039;re standing on the efforts of some of those individuals right now.<br><br> Do you ever plan to have kids? If so, I would say politics should definitely be of interest, because you yourself are standing on top of the remnants of the efforts of your ancestors - individual men. Perhaps acting together, but individuals all the same. They each had to make the choice to act. <br><br>Everything you have, all of your culture, traditions, the VAST amount of wealth in modern western society is owed to the efforts of dead men. They died, and their children carried on in their footsteps, one step or two steps forward at a time. The last veterans of WW1 died not too long ago. <br><br>Yes, someday you will die, but your children and society at large will carry on. If we assume that suffering is intrinsic to life, then any measures that can be made to reduce suffering and improve our livelihood are good. In the same way that our lives were made vastly better by our ancestors, I think we owe it to ourselves, our children, and hopefully the rest of humanity to act responsibly in caring for and improving this delicate and intricate thing we call society.<br><br>also if you want to know more watch jordan peterson","time":1490935255,"resto":119010249,"id":"XEFuywXc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119022323,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)00:56:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119014650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119014650<\/a><br>there would be a trace. there is a finite amount of mass in the universe and earth would simply be displaced.","time":1490936189,"resto":119010249,"id":"cAqred4j","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119022594,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)00:59:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"What kills me is that most in the world don&#039;t see that capitalism and western civilization were always going to lead to collapse. The socioeconomic myths that pervade our society about wealth and it&#039;s accumulation is mostly false.

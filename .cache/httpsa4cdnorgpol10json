I honestly do not even know what to say about abos. It&#039;s not just how they look but how they live. They all smell like hot garbage and you can smell them from 50 yards away. Once a buddy and me were driving around some rural spots and came along some place that was literally called the &quot;aboriginal shire&quot; or something like that. They all looked at us like we weren&#039;t supposed to be there, there were underfed horses all over the place and just hanging around in the street. Several yelled at us as we drove by (this is common all over Australia, even non-abos do this). Many of the houses were literally tin shacks like the kind I have seen in the Dominican Republic. Every property had at least one smashed up car on it. A gang of them tried to fight us because we saw an overturned turtle on the beach and we flipped it back on its feet. They literally came running out from some bushes and confronted us. It turns out they flipped it over and were waiting for it to die -- it was their dinner.<br><br>Please OP don&#039;t go","time":1490420510,"resto":118162763,"id":"Y6P4rk6z","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118191826,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:42:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118191546\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118191546<\/a><br><br>Let me guess; Perth?","time":1490420572,"resto":118162763,"id":"Lj+fneP\/","country":"MY","country_name":"Malaysia"},{"no":118191827,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:42:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118191546\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118191546<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he just realised this shit<\/span><br>Look at all those countries above us you tool.

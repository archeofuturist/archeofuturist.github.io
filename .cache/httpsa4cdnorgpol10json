We produce the sickest original content, we book Ask Me Anything Sessions with the most elite of the pro-Trump personalities (think Bill Mitchell, yeah that&#039;s right *airhorn sound effect*), we have half of the Reddit community (and ALL of the Reddit leadership ;o;!) trembling in fear at our digital might, and essentially we were the deciding factor in memeing the &quot;God Emperor&quot; into the White House.<br><br>And the best part? The part that drives you misguided skinheads insane just like it drives the loony SJW Tumblr crowd insane? Is that we do all of this WITHOUT the hate that you guys (two sides of the same coin, really) deal in. THAT is why we are WINNING, THAT is why we are the new Counter Culture, because it really, truly doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re a Jew, Muslim, Christian, Buddhist, Mexican, White, Heck, even a Papua New Guinean. As long as you understand the need for true conservative principles, free market economics, civil rights, and an honest desire to Make America Great Again then I&#039;m proud to call you my brother (or sister!) of arms!","filename":"1490915253547","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":687,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":245,"tim":1491454021784,"time":1491454021,"md5":"OcjOgpVRqdI0gxYGYcIo2g==","fsize":90853,"resto":0,"id":"4RFQSuiC","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"based-pedes-report-in-hold-back-the-night-plays","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1},{"no":119708114,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:06:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;that samefagging<\/span>","filename":"11422422811424","ext":".png","w":968,"h":916,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":118,"tim":1491455208601,"time":1491455208,"md5":"5V88sviyQhSBjqM2nr7bkw==","fsize":175764,"resto":119706354,"id":"y0J83FrC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119708985,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:16:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119706354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119706354<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ecause it really, truly doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re a Jew<\/span><br>stopped reading","time":1491455801,"resto":119706354,"id":"PPdhQahj","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119709083,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:17:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119706354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119706354<\/a><br>k","time":1491455851,"resto":119706354,"id":"msd2lWKn","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119708972,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:16:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"THIS IS WHERE ALL THE KEKS ARE HIDING<br><br><br>http:\/\/plastuer.com\/place\/<br>http:\/\/plastuer.com\/place\/<br>http:\/\/plastuer.com\/place\/<br>http:\/\/plastuer.com\/place\/<br>http:\/\/plastuer.com\/place\/","filename":"THEHAPPENING","ext":".jpg","w":1031,"h":1070,"tn_w":240,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491455790986,"time":1491455790,"md5":"LNJ\/nkI\/\/EV04ILqH2guiQ==","fsize":66636,"resto":0,"id":"6xmwlxbn","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-is-where-all-the-keks-are-hiding","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":119708392,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:09:46","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Is Weaponizing Intel Okay?","com":"How come liberals are okay with domestic spying against private citizens?","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":734,"h":408,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":138,"tim":1491455386771,"time":1491455386,"md5":"O1fgv7dyJsdsQbqeZDddig==","fsize":87671,"resto":0,"id":"30EjWQoa","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-weaponizing-intel-okay","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":119708934,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)01:16:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Liberals?

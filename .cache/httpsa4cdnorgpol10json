The French presidential election looks like it&#039;s down to two candidates: Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen. And although Le Pen is fairly close to Macron in first round polling, it&#039;s obvious that nobody is going to reach 50%, which means that the top two candidates will go head to head in the second round.<br><br>As of right now, Macron is leading Le Pen in second round polling by about 25-30 points. In fact, Macron is holding a sizable lead against every other candidate in second round polling. So the only way to keep him from winning is to push him into third place. So even if Le Pen beats him in the first round, at least one other candidate will have to beat him as well.<br><br>The most obvious choice is Francois Fillon, but he has been several points behind the two leaders for some time now, and it doesn&#039;t look like he can close the gap.<br><br>There is, however, a fourth candidate, Jean-Luc Melenchon, whose numbers have skyrocketed recently and he is now only about a point behind Fillon. However, he has much more momentum on his side, and is the more likely of the two to edge out Macron.<br><br>If Melenchon catches up to Macron, and Le Pen regains her lead over Macron, then the presidential election is going to be a runoff between Melenchon and Le Pen.<br><br>Le Pen is polling much better against Melenchon than she is against Macron, and even if she doesn&#039;t win, Melenchon would make a much better candidate than Macron anyway.<br><br>So my plan is this: focus efforts on meme&#039;ing Melenchon into second place to eliminate Macron and send the election to a Melenchon-Le Pen runoff. And keep meme&#039;ing Le Pen, so she gets back in first place. We don&#039;t want a Macron-Melenchon runoff.<br><br>What say you, \/pol\/? Can we get Le Pen elected by meme&#039;ing Melenchon ahead of Macron in first round voting?

This general is for the discussion of Marxism-Leninism, the ideology of revolutionary socialism and communism.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491873977368,"time":1491873977,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"3fa\/bzoT","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":175,"images":79,"omitted_posts":170,"omitted_images":76,"tail_size":50},{"no":120545234,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)23:26:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120545185\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120545185<\/a><br>The Jewish Bolshevik Commies<br>http:\/\/trutube.tv\/video\/1013\/The-Je<wbr>wish-Bolshevik-Commies<br><br>The Jewish Century by Yuri Slezkine<br>http:\/\/books.google.com\/books?id=9Q<wbr>NuiuhPzzIC&amp;pg=PA175#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=f<wbr>alse<br><br>Jewish Communists<br>http:\/\/www.jewwatch.com\/jew-communi<wbr>sts.html<br><br>Jewish Founders of International Communism for the One World Order<br>http:\/\/www.jewwatch.com\/jew-communi<wbr>sts-founders.html<br><br>Jewish Pre-Eminence in the Political Left\/Communism<br>http:\/\/www.holywar.org\/jewishtr\/com<wbr>mun.htm<br><br>The Jewish Role in the Bolshevik Revolution and Russia&#039;s Early Soviet Regime<br>http:\/\/www.ihr.org\/jhr\/v14\/v14n1p-4<wbr>_Weber.html<br><br>Jewish Activists Created Communism<br>http:\/\/www.truthtellers.org\/alerts\/<wbr>jewishactivistscommunism.html<br><br>Jews and Bolshevism<br>http:\/\/www.heretical.com\/miscellx\/b<wbr>olshies.html<br><br>Jews and Communism<br>http:\/\/iamthewitness.com\/doc\/Jews.a<wbr>nd.Communism.htm<br><br>Jewish Bolsheviks<br>http:\/\/www.liveleak.com\/view?i=cf7_<wbr>1256305898<br><br>Jewish Bolshevism<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Jewis<wbr>h_Bolshevism<br> <br>Jewish Faces in Chinese Government<br>http:\/\/jewishfaces.com\/china.html<br> <br>Jews and Communism - The South African Experience<br>http:\/\/rense.com\/general85\/jcom.htm<wbr><br> <br>Judaic Communists: The Documentary Record<br>http:\/\/www.revisionisthistory.org\/c<wbr>ommunist.html<br><br>Karl Marx<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Marx#<wbr>Childhood_and_early_education:_1818<wbr>.E2.80.931835<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ancestrally Ashkenazi Jewish, his maternal grandfather was a Dutch rabbi, while his paternal line had supplied Trier&#039;s rabbis since 1723, a role taken by his grandfather Meier Halevi Marx.<\/span><br> <br>Leon Trotsky<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Trots<wbr>ki#Childhood_and_family_.281879.E2.<wbr>80.931895.29<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He was the fifth child of eight of well-to-do Jewish farmers, David Leontyevich Bronshtein and his wife Anna Bronshtein.

Leave time to teach your children, and be part of the community so they can learn by your example.","time":1493553752,"resto":123463685,"id":"KdzgU7D5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123471005,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)08:03:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Gas the kikes already https:\/\/youtu.be\/PbdDMWognH4","time":1493553790,"resto":123463685,"id":"t7CtY6Fd","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123470873,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)08:01:35","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Starting to hate chinks and Pajeets","com":"There&#039;s just too many of them and they&#039;re taking over the entire planet.

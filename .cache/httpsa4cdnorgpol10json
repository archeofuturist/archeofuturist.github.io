It was acknowledged that Germany would have to strike first if they were to preserve Germany&#039;s culture, traditions, and racial homogeneity. At that critical juncture it was a choice between keeping Germany &#039;German&#039; or letting the jews enslave the German population, as they&#039;d already done to Russia and China (and are currently in the final stages of doing to Europe and the United States). <br><br>It&#039;s commonly assumed that if Germany had won the world would have been a dark and oppressive place ruled by tyrants.

No more sickness, no more degeneracy, no more racial mixing, and much less conflict caused by ethnic, religious and cultural diversity.

faggots.<\/span><br>Here&#039;s the plot; many Americans get tax returns. Either because they are retarded and overpay&#039;d horrendously or got lost in the shear complexity that is State and Federal tax. <br><br>Anyways, this money that you get back is your money, i.e. it was never supposed to be taxed so they give it back to you. With that being said. Why in Santa&#039;s Reindeer fuck shack does the government make you claim this return so that they can fucking tax you on your money THAT WAS NEVER SUPPOSE TO BE TAXED IN THE FIRST PLACE???<br><br>Through my rage and in between my REEE&#039;s I began thinking. Why the fuck do we let this shit happen? Don&#039;t we the people have the ability to make this shit go away? So I thought some moar, and I came to a realization. &quot;No, you autistic absolute fucking casual&quot;. &quot;You can&#039;t do shit about it&quot;. <br><br>Think about it, we elect officials to represent us to avoid &quot;mob rule&quot; that comes with Democratic systems. These officials then vote on bills to either turn them into laws or to reject them, like a European women rejects her unborn baby with down syndrome. They also create and enforce policy with &quot;OUR&quot; ideals in mind. So with that said. If we were to make a petition to get rid of the Gov from taxing our tax returns, this petition would get passed, it would then wait months in bureaucratic limbo for fuck all until finally making it to capitol(he&#039;s just a bill sitting there after all) just to have it immediately shot down by the very people that we elected to portray our thoughts and ideologies and opinions. Even when voting against it goes directly against why we voted for them in the first place. To any dipshit that is smart enough on how to operate an ar-15 to shoot up a nightclub is smart enough to know that theirs something wrong here.<br><br>Either something in our political system needs to be refined or the whole thing needs to be thrown out in general. Either way, something has to change.

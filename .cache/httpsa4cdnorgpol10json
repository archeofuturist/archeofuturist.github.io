Examples given to support this argument were South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, and Taiwan all of which were authoritarian and experiencing a period of rapid growth.<br><br>The belief that authoritarian governments were likely to economically out-perform democracies was reconsidered in 1997 during the Asian financial crisis. There are of course many instances of authoritarian nations that have not encountered rapid economic growth. A good historical example is Spain in post-war Europe. More recent examples of poor economic performance in nations with authoritarian regimes are Myanmar and Zimbabwe. Despite the Asian financial crisis the idea of developmental authoritarianism remains an attractive route to economic expansion in many developing nations. The Communist Party of China, which presides over the world\u2019s fastest growing economy, uses this concept today as justification for its authoritarian rule.<br><br>While the link between political authoritarianism and economic growth may not be precisely understood, thinkers in anarchist and anti-authoritarian traditions have examined the &quot;economy&quot; itself as a realm of authoritarianism. In particular, similarities between business corporations and the state have often been highlighted. Both institutions are hierarchical, collective entities with clearly delineated chains of authority and command.","filename":"m335","ext":".png","w":1238,"h":939,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":189,"tim":1493242956261,"time":1493242956,"md5":"bMPrGJ9DBvrQYcncOBLROA==","fsize":678438,"resto":0,"id":"WDTlkbgc","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"in-the-late-20thcentury-political-elites-in-east","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122943708,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:40:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"Really puts a dick in your ass you may like, skippy home slice","filename":"irony","ext":".png","w":1407,"h":379,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":67,"tim":1493242819791,"time":1493242819,"md5":"XLBDaCrs\/t3rxHGOuJ8ypQ==","fsize":1056806,"resto":0,"id":"\/7\/6tiss","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"really-puts-a-dick-in-your-ass-you-may-like","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":122943982,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:42:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"Clever.

Putin controls the largest oil company in Russia. He made a 800 Billion dollar deal with the CEO of Exxon Mobil. Obama put sanctions in place which stopped that deal. Russia then hacked into our government in order to get Trump elected. When the CIA told Congress this in September (James Comey was also in that meeting), Mitch McConnell refused to tell the American people, blackmailing Obama saying he would frame it as playing partisan politics during the election. Comey released the infamous no-information letter. Mitch McConnell&#039;s wife was picked for Trump&#039;s cabinet. The CEO of Exxon is now the Secretary of State. Wonder why our President has been so quick to dismiss the CIA&#039;s findings?.........it gets better..2\/...Here are some facts : Decide for yourselves 1) Trump owes Blackstone\/ Bayrock group $560 million dollars (one of his largest debtors and the primary reason he won&#039;t reveal his tax returns)<br>2) Blackstone is owned wholly by Russian billionaires, who owe their position to Putin and have made billions from their work with the Russian government.<br>3) Other companies that have borrowed from Blackstone have claimed that owing money to them is like owing to the Russian mob and while you owe them, they own you for many favors.<br>4) The Russian economy is badly faltering under the weight of its over-dependence on raw materials which as you know have plummeted in the last 2 years leaving the Russian economy scrambling to pay its debts.<br>5) Russia has an impetus to influence our election to ensure the per barrel oil prices are above $65 ( they are currently hovering around $50)","filename":"bribe-oo","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":423,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":162,"tim":1490273786324,"time":1490273786,"md5":"yaIdAADiXwJV7kQGLzB\/Ww==","fsize":45212,"resto":0,"id":"an\/CClQ1","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"in-case-you-havent-connected-the-news-dots-putin","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":1,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":1},{"no":117931182,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:38:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Everyone already knows this...","time":1490276297,"resto":117927404,"id":"72YqdUWh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117931811,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:44:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117930468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117930468<\/a><br>5) Seems true enough, Russia has been braced for low oil prices but would certainly like them to be higher","time":1490276657,"resto":117927404,"id":"VMXIvaKq","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117932877,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:53:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117927404\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117927404<\/a><br>Poor Rex Tillerson<br>Can&#039;t make billions anymore<br>But Rex has nothing to do with Russia....<br>And he&#039;s not the current State Secretary","time":1490277233,"resto":117927404,"id":"3gXq8\/V4","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":117933231,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:57:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"TruthOrFiction.com<br>TruthOrFiction.com was founded by Rich Buhler, a journalist, speaker, and author who was also known as the &quot;Father of Modern Christian Talk Radio&quot; at KBRT<br><br>Unlike other similar websites, TruthOrFiction.com does not primarily provide fact-checking about current events.

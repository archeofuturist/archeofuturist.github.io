Representative Emanuel Celler of New York proposed the bill, Senator Philip Hart of Michigan co-sponsored it, and Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts helped to promote it.<br>The Hart\u2013Celler Act abolished the quota system based on national origins that had been American immigration policy since the 1920s. The new law maintained the per-country limits, but it also created preference visa categories that focused on immigrants&#039; skills and family relationships with citizens or U.S. residents. The bill set numerical restrictions on visas at 170,000 per year, with a per-country-of-origin quota. However, immediate relatives of U.S. citizens and &quot;special immigrants&quot; had no restrictions.<br><br>he Hart\u2013Celler Act of 1965 marked a radical break from the immigration policies of the past. Previous laws restricted immigration from Asia and Africa, and gave preference to northern and western Europeans over southern and eastern Europeans.[2] In the 1960s, the United States faced both foreign and domestic pressures to change its nation-based formula, which was regarded as a system that (((discriminated))) based on an individual\u2019s place of birth. Abroad, former military allies and new independent nations aimed to (((delegitimize discriminatory immigration))), naturalization and regulations through international organizations like the (((United Nations))).[3] In the United States, the national-based formula had been under scrutiny for a number of years.","time":1490738007,"resto":118687438,"id":"bbfI6BsC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118702513,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)17:54:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"The Al

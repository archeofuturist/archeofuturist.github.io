The Russians briefed the United States on the proposed target. This is a process that started more than two months ago. There is a dedicated phone line that is being used to coordinate and deconflict (i.e., prevent US and Russian air assets from shooting at each other) the upcoming operation.<br><br>2. The United States was fully briefed on the fact that there was a target in Idlib that the Russians believes was a weapons\/explosives depot for Islamic rebels.<br><br>3. The Syrian Air Force hit the target with conventional weapons. All involved expected to see a massive secondary explosion. That did not happen. Instead, smoke, chemical smoke, began billowing from the site. It turns out that the Islamic rebels used that site to store chemicals, not sarin, that were deadly. The chemicals included organic phosphates and chlorine and they followed the wind and killed civilians.<br><br>4. There was a strong wind blowing that day and the cloud was driven to a nearby village and caused casualties.<br><br>5. We know it was not sarin. How? Very simple. The so-called \u201cfirst responders\u201d handled the victims without gloves. If this had been sarin they would have died. Sarin on the skin will kill you. How do I know?

Not quite: Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny is no progressive hero<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anti-corruption protests swept across nearly 100 Russian towns and cities last week, from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad in the West to Vladivostok in the Far East. They were the biggest demonstrations in Russia since the 2011-12 protests against alleged election fraud.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Police arrested hundreds of protesters and activists, among them Alexey Navalny, an opposition figure and anti-corruption campaigner. Navalny had sparked the protests by releasing a report claiming that Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has built himself an empire of mansions, estates, yachts and palaces.<\/span>","filename":"IMG_5864","ext":".png","w":681,"h":899,"tn_w":189,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491856122259,"time":1491856122,"md5":"IMVaGivvFJUgVz1uncpxnA==","fsize":521224,"resto":0,"id":"qZGavEo0","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"salon-strikes-back","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":28,"images":5,"omitted_posts":23,"omitted_images":2},{"no":120492467,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:16:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120486630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120486630<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Random fucking numbers<\/span><br>when will the rest of the world start using real measurements?","time":1491858991,"resto":120485914,"id":"lPimGRQH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120492480,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:16:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120492055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120492055<\/a><br>an ever growing demographic in israel<br>enjoy the enrichment, arab :^)","time":1491858997,"resto":120485914,"id":"V0czLYje","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120492866,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:19:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120492480\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120492480<\/a><br>Ashkenazi apartheid state forever","time":1491859148,"resto":120485914,"id":"iE0A9biA","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":120493257,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:21:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120485914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120485914<\/a><br>The rapid shift in stances is also a tactic.<br><br>If your head is constantly spinning, you&#039;re easier to manipulate.","time":1491859318,"resto":120485914,"id":"vo0UuDiR","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120494311,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:29:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120491056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120491056<\/a><br>Don&#039;t forget about the chinks, Russia is becoming very multicultural, and it must because otherwise it will not survive.<br><br>http:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/International<wbr>\/story?id=82969<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Chinese are invading Russia \u2014 not with tanks, but with suitcases.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Alexander Shaikin, in charge of controlling the Russian-Chinese border, said on June 29 that 1.5 million people from China have illegally entered the Russian Far East over the past 18 months.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It\u2019s impossible(!!!) to know the exact level of Chinese migration into the Russian Far East; Russia has not run a census in over a decade.

The service has repeatedly warned that the Chinese could become the DOMINANT ETHNIC group in the Russian Far East in 20 to 30 years.

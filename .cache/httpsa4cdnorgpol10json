If they want to be wealthy later on in life. <br><br>So, what do the good girls do? They realize the true value of a dollar. The good girls get a degree and work hard. The good girls sacrifice and save for the future.<br><br>But a far larger number of girls these days don&#039;t do that. They become gold diggers. They go after rich guys with money instead of good guys that truly care about them, and they get fucked over. This is where the real cancer reveals itself.

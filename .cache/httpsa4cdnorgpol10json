He won only 43% of the white vote in his first election. Honestly, if these people wanted to use a black politician as an example, Tim Scott (R) of South Carolina is probably a better example. Tim Scott has never run against a white candidate. But he has at least gotten a lot of white southerners to vote for him.<br><br>2) White voters know that black people represent only 13% of the population and are no threat to white supremacy in a democracy. In some of the areas that had a lot of white voters going for Obama, like Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, and so on-- black people are an even smaller share of the population, sometimes hardly even visible. White voters in these areas know that ultimately, they hold the power of the ballot box, and what they give to a man like Obama they can take away just as easily. Can we really say that voting for Obama was a vote against systemic racism when white voters who voted for them were not risking their racial privilege?<br><br>3) Assuaging white guilt was a mental point that some white voters convinced themselves Obama&#039;s election would serve. There was the idea &quot;If I vote for him it proves I&#039;m not a racist.&quot; Then, when they go and do something racist (like vote for Trump) they can use their vote for Obama as a defense. &quot;I can&#039;t be racist because I voted Obama!&quot; But does supporting a minority candidate once really mean you can&#039;t be racist forevermore?","filename":"b4f","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":451,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490865465870,"time":1490865465,"md5":"BjiXmb+rZYULm7ky1yH9TQ==","fsize":24669,"resto":0,"id":"hqDnh2Zu","country":"EE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"when-discussing-the-election-sometimes-someone","country_name":"Estonia","replies":6,"images":1,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":118905118,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)05:24:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118904764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118904764<\/a><br>They elected a mulatto twice. <br><br>Seems pretty open to me.","time":1490865873,"resto":118904764,"id":"ww+HVwsz","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118905170,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)05:25:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"Excellent example of neomarxist postmodern pseudophilosophical psychobabble.","time":1490865929,"resto":118904764,"id":"tM9an6WF","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118905223,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)05:26:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sage for OP pic","time":1490865990,"resto":118904764,"id":"tME2g3lm","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":118905369,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)05:29:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118904764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118904764<\/a><br>So you made a whole Thread just to bring out one single argument we had here 1000 times?<br><br>If you consider that black people voted with incredible 95% Obama, doesn&#039;t that mean, that your theory, that you can read racism out of voting data, says that black people are the most racist people?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;White voters know that black people represent only 13% of the population and are no threat to white supremacy.<\/span><br>If those 13% vote with 95% for their candidate, just because he is black, then they are a threat.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they can use their vote for Obama as a defense<\/span><br>This is just plain stupid<br><br>Is this your first time on \/pol\/?

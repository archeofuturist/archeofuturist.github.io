The archived content is now accessible at ObamaWhiteHouse.archives.gov, including pages about climate change, health care, civil rights and LGBT issues.<br><br>So if we\u2019re going to be nit-picky, it was the Obama administration that removed whitehouse.gov\u2019s pages about these issues, along with every other piece of content their team ever published.<br><br>The Trump administration started off with a blank slate. When populating the website with their own content, they did not create pages about the four issues Takei mentioned. They did, however, create six pages about issues that defined the Trump campaign: energy, foreign policy, jobs and economic growth, military, law enforcement, and trade.<br><br>The Obama team handled the whitehouse.gov transition in the same manner as the George W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations.

This choice would result in unemployable masses, who would require assistance to survive, or who would otherwise revolt. <br><br>This is why UBI\/UGI (universal basic\/guaranteed income) is nothing more than a panacea for consumer capitalism, even while being the pinnacle of socialist labor control.<br><br>The other choice is to decentralize the means of production, advancing technologies that allow self-employed individuals or small employers to compete directly with large monopolies, often with an advantage of agility and lean production methods. Think manufacturing startups using open source software and an industrial form of 3D printing technology that is highly scalable to produce automation solutions intended for the consumers themselves. In this scenario, the individual is no longer the consumer of goods, but the producer of goods, and the consumer of the means of producing goods. Other industries would simply adjust and already are (agriculture, mining) but others are already on the starting steps to realistic self-sufficient consumer economies (energy, consumer electronics, consumer goods, clothing). Marketplaces could exist where other small companies could sell directly to consumers without the need for high overhead costs. Other industries would perish, like the carriage painters and coopers of the 19th century.","time":1493384421,"resto":123186933,"id":"W4DDqPGS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123191558,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)09:03:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123186933\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123186933<\/a>","filename":"Untitled","ext":".png","w":833,"h":538,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":80,"tim":1493384586829,"time":1493384586,"md5":"jzZRYkSc0TMpZCf5F84KQA==","fsize":6166,"resto":123186933,"id":"BJdp2ymw","country":"ME","country_name":"Montenegro"},{"no":123191956,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)09:07:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123189266\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123189266<\/a><br>Interesting theory snek!","time":1493384851,"resto":123186933,"id":"hqv37c4W","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123192659,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)09:14:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123186933\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123186933<\/a><br>As long as things cost something, there is work to be done.","time":1493385296,"resto":123186933,"id":"giu\/NBZf","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123191764,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)09:05:19","name":"Anonymous","sub":"EU the tax haven","com":"The benefits system in the UK is quite convoluted.

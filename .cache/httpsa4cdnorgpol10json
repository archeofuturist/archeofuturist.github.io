The case of \/pol\/ isn&#039;t a supermajority of 60%, it&#039;s a hypermajority of 90%. You cannot, I repeat, CANNOT achieve such a level of agreement over a topic without being an incredibly ideological website like stormfront or \/leftypol\/. And even then, both of those sites always have polarized arguments regarding most things.<br><br>Yes, an agreement that the current EU is bad, sure. But at least some people should be asking for reformation, claiming how it would devastate the continent&#039;s economy and open it for Russia should it break up arbitrarily. Those arguments do not exist here, and the very few people who post them get shut down instantly. Plus, \/pol\/ is a very influencing hotspot for the internet, so it&#039;s only natural to take it as being influenced if such a state like Russia has already proven their intentions to influence opinion (see: RT). Add the simple details together and you can come up with a relevant enough chance for that to be happening as well.

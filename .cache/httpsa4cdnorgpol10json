Libertarians live in a fantasy land where the balance of power will peacefully correct itself of the US suddenly retreated it&#039;s global presence. But that&#039;s not the real world. Itd be great to be able to have a purely defensive force but that isn&#039;t realistic right now. The increase is basically undoing a cut that happened under Obama a few years ago. Enough generals have spoken out about our equipment being outdated and depleted that I&#039;m inclined to believe the claim that it&#039;s &quot;needed&quot; in order to optimize our military. If the US just suddenly brought all the troops home the world would completely destabilize. For one, we literally are the defense force of Europe. Eurocucks bitch one minute about our presence then cry about Trump abandoning them in the face of Putin the next<br><br>In the mideast Obama spent his entire admin pulling out troops on the ground in the middle East and replacing them with CIA ops and arming terrorists. Now the region is a total disaster that no one else can really deal with it. Russia&#039;s too poor and has too many other problems, Europe is already getting invaded, and if China is allowed to deal with it they&#039;ll just blatantly conquer the region for a Chinese empire and dominate the west in every arena afterwords.Truthfully, Trump (and McCain actually in 08 election) was right when he said that leaving Iraq would create a power vaccum. Now Muslims are launching Jihad against the world and the Saudi-Iranian proxy wars are escalating towards real cofrontation. The mideast situation is really something that will have to be dealt with by the US. That&#039;s just how it is.<br><br>Basically the US must be strong right now or the world is going to spiral out of control. And once the Europe and the Mideast are dealt with we&#039;re still going to have to have a huge historical showdown with China.","filename":"1489621463161","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":615,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":192,"tim":1490070970826,"time":1490070970,"md5":"tyyHwN+9muoOfBvKteyKDg==","fsize":60729,"resto":0,"id":"yXxdQ2xI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-do-you-think-pol-is-trumps-dod-budget","country_name":"United States","replies":17,"images":4,"omitted_posts":12,"omitted_images":2},{"no":117590285,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)01:05:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117590093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117590093<\/a><br>Inshallah.<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/North<wbr>ern_Cyprus","time":1490072738,"resto":117587445,"id":"HRQGIEQR","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":117590613,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)01:09:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117589369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117589369<\/a><br>A nation with a billion people, a 15 trillion dollar economy and the largest military by man power doesn&#039;t just collapse without putting up a fight.

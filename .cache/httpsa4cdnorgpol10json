I lived there since 2011, attending a local university then working for a couple years in the city. I&#039;ll briefly try to explain why I think that Houston&#039;s trajectory is a grim omen for the future of the country as a whole.<br><br>Houston is not a &quot;real&quot; city. It is not a city that arose from coherent neighborhoods and communities into a larger whole. Houston is more like an encampment of economic nomads, people who arrive in the city with no prior connections, and leave just as quickly in order to chase other economic opportunities. It has a very transient feel to it, and a lack of &quot;community.&quot; <br><br>It is also a collection pond for human refuse of various types - the ghetto trash (including the famous Katrina refugees), illiterate Central American peasants, a bizarre array of &quot;refugees&quot; from every hellish corner of this Earth, and quite a few dead-enders who moved to the area because it is cheaper than most other cities, then got stuck due to not having any money.<br><br>Economic nomadism and lack of community leads to GRIFTERS on a mass-scale. This is something I noticed quickly about the city - the quantity of scammers and hucksters and cheats is South Florida-tier. And they can get away with it because there is always a new crop of suckers moving in. <br><br>There is a lot of crime and PREDATION - and Houston criminals are often quite brutal, executing robbery victims in front of their own families without hesitation. Several such cases have taken place in just the past month. And due to the lack of cohesion and trust, these crimes often go unsolved.

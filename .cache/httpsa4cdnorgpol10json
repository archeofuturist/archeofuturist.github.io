Its cringe-worthy. I don&#039;t know how to fix this. When someone asks me if I&#039;m Irish because muh red hair there is no right answer. &quot;No, I&#039;m american&quot; is cringey although its my go to. People cannot accept that my dad or mom or someone MUST be irish and then they go offthemselves on how they are actually italian, british, faggotonian, etc. I can&#039;t stand it but there is an obsession with being anything but American.","time":1493062762,"resto":122623745,"id":"yLKLXkPM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122628422,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)15:49:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122623745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122623745<\/a><br><br>Americans don&#039;t pretend to be European<br><br>the fuck is wrong with you","time":1493063370,"resto":122623745,"id":"dTNg4Qm2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122628776,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)15:52:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122626212\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122626212<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122626867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122626867<\/a><br>It has to be some deep rooted insecurity, perhaps it&#039;s because they&#039;re taught to be &quot;ashamed&quot; of American history due to the slaughter that comes along with it (Slavery, Trail of Tears, Manifest Destiny, Mexican-American war, etc etc) but Europeans have been at each others necks for decades upon decades and don&#039;t suffer from the same shit.<br><br><a href=\"#p122627272\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122627272<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this<\/span><br>We need to make burgers proud to be burgers again","filename":"1492375959439","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493063570983,"time":1493063570,"md5":"0hI6vpKNHUYDST\/rci1ocw==","fsize":227400,"resto":122623745,"id":"Pq3r9i6i","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122629103,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)15:55:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122623745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122623745<\/a><br>It is pretty lame, but using the MUH HERITAGE meme ironically is a fun way to banter with Yuros.","filename":"redneckkrauts","ext":".gif","w":412,"h":309,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493063742331,"time":1493063742,"md5":"ptPdXgNa\/Bvl0RWic4ySig==","fsize":8556,"resto":122623745,"id":"IjUexJHg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122629371,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)15:58:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Americans are dumb lol","time":1493063881,"resto":122623745,"id":"BT9Y+hrd","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]}]}

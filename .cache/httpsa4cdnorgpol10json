The allegation trick is used all the time in politics and for instance is what was used against Flynn.<br><br>The trick starts with knowing a secret about someone or something. This secret can&#039;t be public information. <br><br>You then allege that the person did it. For instance, &quot;Bill Clinton did you have sex with monica in the white house?&quot;<br><br>When he denies, then you trot out the cum stained dress. You already knew about the dress before though. All you are doing is playing the game of getting a defense on record to make things worse.<br><br>For instance, if you know Trump played golf saturday, but that is secret information. &quot;Trump did you take the matter seriously Saturday?&quot; He says yes, you respond, &quot;Why did you golf all day then?&quot;<br><br>You are setting the other person up. This is what Trump has done time and time again. He alleges against any opponent. The secret is that Trump is using instinctual proper game theory. If all allegations are &quot;tricks&quot; then you know to answer truthfully. The secret to Trumps instinctual 4D ability is that he makes some allegations that are false with the true ones. So his opponents do not know.<br><br>If you always go all-in after you have a winning hand, you are failing. You need to bluff sometimes so the other person calls.<br><br>This is the strength of Trump&#039;s allege tactic. That he uses proper mathematical optimal game theory to always get maximal value. Just like a poker player would. Yet, the media misunderstands this and still haven&#039;t caught on that actually making false allegations a portion of the time is the most ideal strategy.<br><br>This is one of the 4D chess strategies the MSM can&#039;t pick up on because of lack of intelligence and wide education.","filename":"4dchesss","ext":".jpg","w":591,"h":555,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":234,"tim":1491377368897,"time":1491377368,"md5":"Ap4CTjECTsqiZKwf3ExevQ==","fsize":70091,"resto":0,"id":"dUGJA2q7","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-4d-chess-secrets-thread-1","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":3,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":1},{"no":119583052,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)03:56:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119581515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119581515<\/a><br>The only hobby left to ruin is innawoods.","time":1491379007,"resto":119581407,"id":"w6poM\/Go","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119583182,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)03:59:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Kruschev did exactly this when a U-2 pilot got shot down over the USSR","time":1491379145,"resto":119581407,"id":"bBJcbxx8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119583567,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)04:06:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"this is finally what i want<br><br>can we talk about more secrets?","filename":"5965","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491379563223,"time":1491379563,"md5":"vurqdKPiSRTgS\/vKWj4Ubg==","fsize":22621,"resto":119581407,"id":"giA4JgeZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119583756,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)04:09:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119583052\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119583052<\/a><br>key top shelf","time":1491379742,"resto":119581407,"id":"Wi0cjV90","country":"AE","country_name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"no":119584037,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)04:13:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119581407\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119581407<\/a><br>That paragraph spacing reeks of redddit.","time":1491380007,"resto":119581407,"id":"VKjxJD0s","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119576377,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)02:19:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"F","filename":"2E8943FA-4A02-4F24-B5DD-0D9E31BB98CF-448-0000004A8D780C55","ext":".png","w":2000,"h":3957,"tn_w":126,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491373192482,"time":1491373192,"md5":"Sz8GKBhsmIvbYr\/oFEHhKw==","fsize":289940,"resto":0,"id":"lO+ATlpI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"f","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":6,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":1},{"no":119579024,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)02:54:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119578004\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119578004<\/a><br>Soon<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bkT<wbr>42T7WsN4","filename":"1452729068334","ext":".png","w":983,"h":869,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1491375253418,"time":1491375253,"md5":"LGcMcclYeH7L\/FqH8DinaQ==","fsize":136686,"resto":119576377,"id":"cPPWaKQn","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119579470,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)03:00:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119576377\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119576377<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw we win<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SCX<wbr>-88JgCDE","filename":"NMR","ext":".png","w":240,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491375644169,"time":1491375644,"md5":"zNDeJ0mVU+7w3RMJrnBBlw==","fsize":13309,"resto":119576377,"id":"cPPWaKQn","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119580380,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)03:13:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119579024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119579024<\/a><br>optimistic Sven is optimistic","filename":"1490089171903","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":1061,"tn_w":106,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491376400095,"time":1491376400,"md5":"8KKMmPjP3Y7Q3EhzEnAOfA==","fsize":565242,"resto":119576377,"id":"AjpYMlwA","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119583617,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)04:06:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sweden","filename":"meanwhile","ext":".gif","w":400,"h":340,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":106,"tim":1491379614874,"time":1491379614,"md5":"VAjreyJOC9V1IysQyc\/ssw==","fsize":2586424,"resto":119576377,"id":"8l2F0M7j","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119583738,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)04:08:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119576377\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119576377<\/a><br>F for Flaccid.","time":1491379731,"resto":119576377,"id":"u3UoEsKA","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119578086,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)02:41:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Should it be okay to yell &quot;I&#039;ve got a bomb&quot; on a plane?

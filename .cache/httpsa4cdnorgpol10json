difluoride (DF) with isopropyl alcohol to create a mixture of Sarin and hydrogen fluoride (HF \u2013 hydrofluoric acid). Some of these interesting chemicals include:<br><br> DIMP \u2013 The chemical diisopropyl methylphosphonate (DIMP) was found in a large number of the samples. DIMP is a known byproduct of the basic chemical reaction that creates Sarin using the DF and Isopropyl Alcohol reaction.<br> Trinitrotoluene and trinitroazine \u2013 These are conventional explosives and may have been used as the bursting charge<br> Dimethylmethylphosphonate \u2013 This is a precursor of DF, several steps further back down the production process. It is a precursor of methylphosphonic dichloride, which in turn is used to make DF. Its presence could be as a contaminant in the Sarin left over from the manufacturing process.<br> Methylphosponofluoridic Acid (MPFA) \u2013 This substance is a degradation product of DF. It is also a degradation product of Sarin under some circumstances.<br><br> Hexamine, also known as hexamethylenetetramine. This was found in numerous field samples at the sites investigated by the OPCW\/UN team. It has numerous industrial uses. However, up to the point of the UN report, it has had little or no published use in chemical warfare.

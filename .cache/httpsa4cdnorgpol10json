All the adults are oblivious fucking retards while the only sane and reasonable people are the kids. This is what these generations actually grew up believing to be true because these cartoons and tv shows were the only guidance they had since feminism destroyed families and their mothers spent all day working and the fathers thought it was enough to just pay child support. Its no wonder this crazy fucking generation of people today act as if they are most enlightened people in the history of mankind who are here to teach their teachers a lesson and not the other way around. The respect for the aged ceased to exist, you have college students screaming and lecturing teachers and you see teachers bowing down their heads at them and apologizing. Young people actually arguing to take away the right to vote for people over 50 because they voted against their beliefs, they literally think they live in an episode of south park. If the adults dont believe what they believe then its obviously because they are retarded because its just impossible for them to be wrong. Anybody who disagrees with them is not only wrong but evil and must be silenced and destroyed. The past two generations have been literally raised by television and now the Internet that my generation used as babysitters, they get their morals and world view from the last 30 seconds of a south park episode where the kid speaks and basically lectures the adults with a reasonable argument that ends up saving the day and the adults were barely capable of understanding.

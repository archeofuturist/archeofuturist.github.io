Another person, Sam (Sam has a large number of nephews and nieces, so we&#039;ll call him Uncle Sam), decides to stop Marvin from going to the marketplace using coercion. He goes down there with his M16 and blocks the road. As a result, Marvin can&#039;t trade for food and, as a result, he starves. So then the question is, did Sam kill Marvin? Did he violate his rights? Almost anyone would say yes, Sam acted wrongly. In fact, if Marvin died as a result, then Sam killed him. It wouldn&#039;t be that Sam failed to help Marvin. No, he actively intervened....This is analogous to the U.S. government&#039;s immigration policy.

That&#039;s why so many are invading europe pretending to be a war refugee when actually only 1 out of 5 is an actual war refugee. I don&#039;t have numbers for every welfare they receive in european countries. But here in Canada those muslim immigrants receive $3600\/month of welfare, more than the average household income. Good thing that the Atlantic ocean is there to keep them from illegally coming here by boats, otherwise we would be in a worst situation than Germany and Trudeau would have 100% chances to be reelected in 2019.","time":1490729954,"resto":118679253,"id":"OZAUKQd7","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118686760,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)15:42:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118683161\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118683161<\/a><br>underrated and saged for slide thread","time":1490730136,"resto":118679253,"id":"MDF3pLJd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118683541,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)15:13:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Left:Democrats<br>Right: Republicans<br>Middle: Healthcare","filename":"b4T1C8ucU4","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490728415221,"time":1490728415,"md5":"Wz8I3Q\/+HHXsNDw\/YCftTQ==","fsize":1184855,"resto":0,"id":"LKGv07E+","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"leftdemocrats","country_name":"Canada","replies":20,"images":7,"omitted_posts":15,"omitted_images":7},{"no":118685325,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)15:29:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118683541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118683541<\/a><br>So Republicans are in love with Democrats and want to be their maid?","time":1490729367,"resto":118683541,"id":"GmiXdkcV","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118685462,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)15:30:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118684479\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118684479<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Saikawa is fucking gross and obnoxious<\/span><br>She&#039;s just scared of not being accepted so she tries to act confident.

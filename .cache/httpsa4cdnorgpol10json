The base group (us) is the most numerous and resourceful, and therefore the greatest threat to the establishment. Furthermore, being accustomed to wealth, we are the priciest client-group. To maintain the most power at the cheapest cost the government therefore invites in barbarians and gives them free reign to humiliate, rape, rob, and occasionally kill members of the base group. This ensures that said barbarians align with the establishment at no real cost to the ruling class. This is in fact one of the oldest tricks in the book, as can be seen many times in history. Notably in ancient Rome where barbarians were given land, and tacitly given free reign to loot the country, in exchange for quelling dissidents through their service in foederati regiments.","time":1491648301,"resto":120115796,"id":"Z0VXFT5A","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120115382,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:18:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"BOLIVIA HATE THREAD!!!!!","filename":"C80UDaXWAAIK8z2","ext":".jpg","w":1046,"h":1200,"tn_w":217,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491646697628,"time":1491646697,"md5":"G0yyH7ZsdY9M92pO1iAV6g==","fsize":144695,"resto":0,"id":"Nm1YPuDl","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bolivia-hate-thread","country_name":"Australia","replies":3,"images":1},{"no":120115589,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:21:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120115382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120115382<\/a><br>Shareblue shills are shilling for Kushner","filename":"kushner_shareblue2","ext":".png","w":1322,"h":1417,"tn_w":116,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491646872611,"time":1491646872,"md5":"mdpgH1Mx0BP3V70YWaxUxA==","fsize":988850,"resto":120115382,"id":"nf9QMztB","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120115753,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:23:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120115589\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120115589<\/a><br>kek found the bolivian-american","time":1491647015,"resto":120115382,"id":"Nm1YPuDl","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120117380,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:45:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120115382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120115382<\/a><br>Bolivia is a Russian satelite country<br>That doesn&#039;t make Bolivia more relevant<br>Bolivia hates freedom<br>Bolivia loves dictators","time":1491648300,"resto":120115382,"id":"twazz6r6","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120117360,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:44:43","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Bathroom","com":"Listen up niggers, its time \/pol\/ made a change in the world again.

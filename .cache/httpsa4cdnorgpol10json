Familial and kinship relationships are most important. <\/span><br><br>Civilization as it ends: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Urban - your living conditions are far away from nature. They are covered in trash, smog, foreign people who share no relation with you. The air you breath is polluted, and you are crammed into small spaces.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The System - you are forced to work in a deeply complex system, over which you have no control. You cannot free yourself from the system, and this system ensures that you adjust yourself to its goal of production and homogenization of people and culture - through psychological technique mainly. You are a part of the mass, and atom. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nihilism - God is dead, and all things are meaningless. Confusion ensues as to what purpose you have in life, and no moral codes exist independently of social convention and government. Everyday life become difficult. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Community - is broken down, and you use people instrumentally. Short lived relationships serve you temporarily. You cannot find a wife, as technology gives her far too many options from which to choose. Women are common property of the strong.<\/span>","filename":"Oswald_Spengler_The_decline_of_the_west","ext":".png","w":388,"h":595,"tn_w":163,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490671463802,"time":1490671463,"md5":"7uB\/mkJwLvyDrPGNfUhjsg==","fsize":33638,"resto":0,"id":"xgpsEIVX","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"civilization-as-it-begins-and-ends","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":118606732,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)23:47:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118604534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118604534<\/a><br><br>I will shameless self-bump this post once or twice.","time":1490672850,"resto":118604534,"id":"xgpsEIVX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118606849,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)23:48:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118604534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118604534<\/a><br><br>One moar bump.","time":1490672920,"resto":118604534,"id":"xgpsEIVX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118609290,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:15:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118606849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118606849<\/a><br>Interesting","time":1490674530,"resto":118604534,"id":"S+paLYu8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118598734,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)22:28:15","name":"Anonymous","sub":"FIGHT BACK FOR YOUR BOARD: DRAIN THE 4CHAN SWAMP","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The variety of threads allowed here are very flexible and we believe in freedom of speech, but we expect a high level of discourse befitting of the board.

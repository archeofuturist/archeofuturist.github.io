It is described as such by its own doctrine. To clarify this definition: a political entity (for example, the Australian Government), is one which seeks to impose its laws on a society. These laws are enforced through violence, or threat of violence (by the police or armed forces). This is the definition of the term \u201cPolitical.\u201d Religions have rules which apply only to their followers. These rules are enforced by threats or rewards from a supernatural entity, usually in the afterlife and followers are free to leave. This is the definition of a religious movement. Islam has religious aspects such as the belief in Allah. However, Islam is mostly political. Islam\u2019s foundational doctrine contains a legal code called Sharia Law. This legal system mandates violent punishments, some of which are barbaric. Leaving Islam is a capital offence. Importantly, Sharia Law also applies to non-Muslims. Muslims are obliged to carry out violent Islamic legal rulings whenever possible (as with the Salman Rushdie and Charlie Hebdo affairs). Islam encourages Muslims to conquer and hold territory which is also a political action. The Australian Government faces constitutional difficulties protecting its citizens from Islamic political violence due to the classification of Islam as a religion.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.aph.gov.au\/Parliamentary<wbr>_Business\/Petitions\/House_of_Repres<wbr>entatives_Petitions\/Petitions_Gener<wbr>al\/Petitions_List?id=EN0155","filename":"download (1)","ext":".jpg","w":275,"h":183,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492070761076,"time":1492070761,"md5":"bJJnQ8+nH3aHHSlNXnFswg==","fsize":9214,"resto":0,"id":"G4Knqe3D","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"petition-to-reclassify-islam-as-a-political","country_name":"Australia","replies":10,"images":3,"omitted_posts":5,"omitted_images":2},{"no":120886576,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)04:17:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120885936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120885936<\/a><br><br>signed, we need to get this through some normie facebook groups","time":1492071431,"resto":120885936,"id":"MtVex4R3","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120886591,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)04:17:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120886502\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120886502<\/a><br>A man who sucks cock is still a faggot, even if he claims he&#039;s not.","time":1492071442,"resto":120885936,"id":"OCSSoNzD","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120886793,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)04:20:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120886591\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120886591<\/a><br>We are not talking about cocks and not about man.

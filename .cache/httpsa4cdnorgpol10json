Two days after the socialist republic was proclaimed, Hitler ran for and won a position in Eisner\u2019s government, taking the position of \u201cDeputy Battalion Representative\u201d, where some of his duties included serving as a liaison officer with the Department of Propaganda.[9][10] After Eisner was assassinated in 1919, Hitler attended the funeral and in solidarity with the socialist republic and with Eisner, a Jewish Marxist reformer, he wore a black armband on one arm and a red communist brassard on the other, as evidenced by surviving film footage of the funeral.[9] In the footage, Hitler and a few men from his unit are seen walking in Eisner&#039;s procession. Furthermore, one of Heinrich Hoffmann&#039;s photos of the procession showed Hitler in attendance, taken just before Eisner was eulogized.[9] After Communist Party of Germany seized power, it appears that Hitler did not join a Freikorps with his comrades or desert his post to fight the communists in the streets. This incident suggests that Hitler\u2019s opinions concerning nationalism, socialism and Marxism were still not resolved.<\/span>","filename":"1467081220758","ext":".jpg","w":719,"h":553,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":192,"tim":1492641822307,"time":1492641822,"md5":"jK200v8n3PBZW+i1tOV9iA==","fsize":37533,"resto":0,"id":"KcOLU1DU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hitler-worked-for-a-communist-jew-in-1919","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":2,"omitted_posts":7,"omitted_images":1},{"no":121912049,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)19:01:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121911277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121911277<\/a><br>I think with the Versailles treaty fucking Germany over as much as it did, basically whoever got into power was going to go to war.

Weber paints a group portrait of the List Regiment, Hitler&#039;s unit during World War I, to rewrite the story of his military service. Drawing on deep and imaginative research, Weber refutes the story crafted by Hitler himself, and so challenges the historical argument that the war led naturally to Nazism. Contrary to myth, the regiment consisted largely of conscripts, not enthusiastic volunteers. Hitler served with scores of Jews, including noted artist Albert Weisberger, who proved more heroic, and popular, than the future F\u00fchrer. Indeed, Weber finds that the men shunned Private Hitler as a &quot;rear area pig,&quot; and that Hitler himself was still unsure of his political views when the war ended in 1918. Through the stories of such comrades as a soldier-turned-concentration camp commandant, veterans who fell victim to the Holocaust, an officer who became Hitler&#039;s personal adjutant in the 1930s but then cooperated with British intelligence, and the veterans who simply went back to their Bavarian farms and never joined the Nazi ranks, Weber demonstrates how and why Hitler aggressively policed the myth of his wartime experience.<\/span>","time":1492643604,"resto":121909805,"id":"KcOLU1DU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121915045,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)19:25:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hitler was involved as a counter intelligence agent in the post WWI Reichswehr.

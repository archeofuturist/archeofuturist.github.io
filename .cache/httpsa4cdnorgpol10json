We would be mistaken to claim that the antiquated speculative nature of Fashwave betrays the aesthetic as a thing only predicated on nostalgia. While it might be considered a collage of sorts, stitched together from pieces of 80s and 90s pop-culture; VHS tapes, video game soundtracks, neo-noir landscapes, neon, lasers, synthesizers, streaking brake lights and 8-bit arpeggios\u2014Fashwave only operates modally to subvert the mainstream progressive agenda by way of nostalgic cues to the otherwise uninterested.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The real strength and fascination of the aesthetic lies in its ability to draw a parallel between anachronistic futurisms; that is to say, what ideals were once held for tomorrow and have since fallen either out of favor, out of fashion, or out of plausibility\u2014and icons of western art now so unpopular in the mainstream circles of acceptable media.

Through simply investing social security tax into the S&amp;P 500 and then purchasing a High Dividend ETF the lowest quintile households could become millionaires. Furthermore, there is one key fact about social security that liberals never talk about. YOU CAN&#039;T PASS DOWN SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS. Let&#039;s say you are 65 and have a son who is 35 and a grandson that is 15. Your son also makes the lowest quintile.<br><br>Under social security both your son and grandson get ABSOLUTELY NOTHING when you die. However, if you invested your social security taxes then your son would inherit $3,330,626 in assets. This would also STACK WITH HIS ASSETS providing even him more income. Consider the scenario where the grandfather dies at 65. Under social security his son, again, GETS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. With investments he would at the very least inherit the $499,523 in S&amp;P 500 assets. Following the same investment strategy, his income would grow substantially.

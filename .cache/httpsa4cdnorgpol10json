The powers that be claim that there must be evil nazi racist forces at work behind this, and they hire people like me to do research and pinpoint the exact nature behind these phenomena. Unfortunately, science has a thing for objectivity and factual truth isn&#039;t very welcome nowadays. Therefore my findings have been censored.

There is the Kalgin Island almost right across from them which is very lowly populated but is in the middle of Kenai and redoubt bay (bay of a mountain range) which would be easy to figure. He&#039;s going for a real &quot;could be literally anywhere on the earth&quot; idea, most likely in the forest in a mountainous and\/or hilly area. I&#039;ve circled two spots he may go for if he wants to do somewhere near where he is now, one in the Kasilof area and one in the area of what is called Clam Gulch. Best we wait for an update in his location before we make any solid assumptions, as there&#039;s the likelihood of him going into the mountains (he already looks like a homeless mountain boy). Goodnight and good luck. Will check HWNDU and vice&#039;s website in the morning (AK time) to see if anything changes. Goodnight and praise be to Kek.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1536,"h":2048,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490421472579,"time":1490421472,"md5":"UrwDp02\/xvt+SkwFRgXHxg==","fsize":590143,"resto":118174008,"id":"j4T8p2LE","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118193319,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)02:00:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"but will he have access to an internet connection with power for 4 years that&#039;s his goal am i right","time":1490421618,"resto":118174008,"id":"U8RhSNPp","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118185991,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:35:59","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Are there really only about 15 million Jews in the world?","com":"It somehow seems like the real number is much higher... but maybe this is just an illusion caused by Jewish domination of various prominent fields.<br><br>What do you think?","filename":"jpop15","ext":".png","w":694,"h":476,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":171,"tim":1490416559649,"time":1490416559,"md5":"Rg8LzfxzBPEfYqxxSSu8dg==","fsize":231031,"resto":0,"id":"pNFTIl7r","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-there-really-only-about-15-million-jews-in","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":3,"omitted_posts":8,"omitted_images":1},{"no":118189113,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:10:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118188943\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118188943<\/a><br>Ashkenazis are obviously not from the middle east.","time":1490418623,"resto":118185991,"id":"T6b1H\/83","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118189544,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:15:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"it just seems like theres more because you are obsessed with them, thats all","time":1490418918,"resto":118185991,"id":"V12LkJJJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118189600,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:15:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"ummmmmmm ya. theres a reason we&#039;re the chosen race ;)","time":1490418957,"resto":118185991,"id":"o\/74jiNX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118189832,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:18:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118185991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118185991<\/a><br>Lots of secret Jews out there..

To stop this, I think that some method of prevention should be set in stone[I have no clue what this method would be, I&#039;m not a political genius I&#039;m just some fucking anon venting on this trashy website]). <br><br>I have taken to reading the Communist manifesto to make observations, and there are certainly things I can&#039;t agree with, so I won&#039;t get defensive of the political party itself.

Cap it at $10000 for the young, and graduate it upwards as you age. Separate, catastrophic plans optionally available from the free market, which will by it&#039;s nature will be very cheap. If you need more, and you didn&#039;t plan ahead, you lose your house and savings as God intended, but you either pay the hospital bill or go to a halfway house until you work it off.<br>The only .gov involvement is the law about the paycheck deduction. But unlike social security taxes, it doesn&#039;t go to the government, it goes to an account in your name. Just like a retirement account, no taxes until it&#039;s used, and then only if it&#039;s not used for medical expenses.<br>Not ideal, but this means I don&#039;t have to pay for the people who put an iphone and data plan ahead of anything else.","filename":"aca","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":607,"tn_w":197,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490438596811,"time":1490438596,"md5":"6AhOVVw+lWo+6HL8ww560g==","fsize":29423,"resto":0,"id":"D70manb9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-health-care-bill-should-be-a-mandated-health","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118212640,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:42:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Stop repealing Obamacare","filename":"trump cuck","ext":".jpg","w":1172,"h":1182,"tn_w":247,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490438535114,"time":1490438535,"md5":"Fm5u5jxFDxW+t32J9XpcLw==","fsize":224725,"resto":0,"id":"UYEaOozP","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"stop-repealing-obamacare","country_name":"Germany","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118211658,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:27:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Has anyone here any links or interestimg facts about the economic model of nazi Germany?","filename":"image13","ext":".gif","w":441,"h":308,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":174,"tim":1490437651948,"time":1490437651,"md5":"kvtNL07fMxHaoTiLJE8JfA==","fsize":4707,"resto":0,"id":"kvEmLZSF","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"has-anyone-here-any-links-or-interestimg-facts","country_name":"Germany","replies":3,"images":2},{"no":118212016,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)06:32:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118211658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118211658<\/a><br>Virtually all records were destroyed after the war, and the kikes claim what does exist is fabricated unless it suits their needs. <br><br>Canadian Liberal Prime Minister at the time.

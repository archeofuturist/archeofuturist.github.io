It completely destroyed any semblance of the notions of classical liberalism being applied to it&#039;s own populace in World War 2. Over a century of Fabian society marxist bullshit has warped our population into thinking that no matter what social problems are present in conemporary society, taxing the rich (and everyone else) will solve them. We drink water, we eat food and we think socialist. We have a political system that represents nobody and survives on pure tribalism. We have completely changed the nature of our capital city, because once the Labour party discovered that once working class oiks get a little cash together they tend to think more conservatively, so rather than adapt to this trend they thought it apt to import millions of foreigners so they would always have a large voting base (should&#039;ve imported a few million more given their current predicament). We are America&#039;s lapdog and our quaint, yet glorious culture is becoming more base and vulgar as a result of it. We shot ourselves in the foot when the church endorsed the actions fo the government (wholesale slaughter of young men) in World War 1, rather than being above the temporary whims of nation and government.<br><br> We also have regulations that seem hellbent on destroying small business, I mean if your local Paki shopkeeper decides to show you his fine selection of tobaccos so you can make your choice, that business can then be fined to the tune of \u00a310,000. We have a bullshit education system, which gives you no knwoledge of the classics (because oiks can&#039;t afford it, and even if they could what would they do with that knowledge except subvert our Marxist ideals)and history is taught with massive 500 year gaps. This means what our youth get isn&#039;t a richer understanding of the world, but instead a few trendy job skills like programming which will be outdated by the time they enter the workforce.","time":1493849205,"resto":123947948,"id":"qlWcWQW1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123972906,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)18:07:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123972791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123972791<\/a><br><br>We also have a paedophile occupational government, which nobody seems to care about.

Our governments, whether they be Labour or Tory want to browbeat us with this funding crisis so they can tax whatever the fuck they like (the next labour government will give us fat, sugar and alcohol taxes). Real wages haven&#039;t risen at all since 2008. Most of our towns look like the one in Eraserhead.

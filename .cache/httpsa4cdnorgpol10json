The cartoon also showed women&#039;s perspective, of which consisted of two women discussing having sex with Chads, and then getting married and denying sex with their beta husbands. <br><br>The cartoon has really struck me, but I don&#039;t think because it hits close to home. I am 18 yrs old, 6&#039;2, good-looking, and have a 6 incher (I know that it&#039;s average but I am okay with that). I dumped my qt girlfriend awhile back because it was just too stressful. Also, I think I&#039;ll hit another growth spurt at some point in the next year or two (my dad&#039;s biggest spurt was when he was 18+). I can be insecure although it&#039;s improving a lot as I mature. Because I am very religious, I won&#039;t have sex until marriage, but I manage to attract a decent amount of women (what exactly defines a Chad?)<br><br>I guess the reason the cartoon is so concerning is because I fear it&#039;s true. I know anons here on pol push the narrative that white manlets are constantly getting cucked, but is it true? Is there any hope for manlets? Is there even any hope for me? <br><br>Is MGTOW just a meme, or is it truly the best way? <br><br>What about continuing the white race?

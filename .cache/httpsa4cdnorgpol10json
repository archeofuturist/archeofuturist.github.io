Today (and going forward), however, young people can choose to discuss their beliefs only with others who think the same way, which not only fortifies their convictions, but as we&#039;re seeing right now, can lead them to cultivate their entire adult identity with these convictions at the center.<br><br>Consequently, for a typical SJW to confront the notion of doubt in their convictions isn&#039;t as innocuous as &quot;getting wiser with age,&quot; it&#039;s a confrontation of the validity of his or her (or ze or zir or zem) entire conception of personal identity, which obviously can be a terrifying prospect. It&#039;d be much easier and enticing to recede back into one&#039;s echo chamber.<br><br>Another contributing factor is that these beliefs aren&#039;t coming exclusively from MSM and each other, but also very crucially from their humanities professors, who they&#039;ve been conditioned to regard as possibly the most trustworthy intellectual authorities in their lives.<br><br>So what do you guys think?

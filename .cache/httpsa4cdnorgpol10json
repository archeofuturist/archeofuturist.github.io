One thing he uses in his shows are trendy at the moment meme&#039;s of the current culture. He did 80&#039;s style rap songs in his show for example.<br><br>I am going to explain what I think the thought process to be behind this current &quot;downfall&quot; as we see it, and show how it was not really a downfall at all... Though a very cleaver plan to infiltrate the rankings of the left to spread science.<br><br>A few things you need to bite on first. You have to give Bill some trust and allow yourself to think that he actually wants to educate people using the best possible means of doing so.<br><br>If Bill want&#039;s to reach a target audience of people, science illiterate individuals, he would have to do that in a way that does not alienate them. The segment that we seen go viral was designed for just that, the Internet. Using the powers at be, people who crafted the show know&#039;s the Internet with it&#039;s viral capabilities is the best way to spread knowledge. They then crafted a show for a target audience, which is clearly not people who already know about chromosomes. In other words, if you find yourself questioning why Bill did what he did, thats good!! The show was not meant for you, but your reaction to it was perfectly designed.<br><br>1\/2","filename":"ThinkBig","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493245930965,"time":1493245930,"md5":"eAL5f5CSYeo\/QZxARONh0g==","fsize":41440,"resto":0,"id":"ctrqNUh1","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bill-nye-something-to-think-about","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":3,"omitted_posts":13,"omitted_images":1},{"no":122956185,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:17:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"OP, you may be onto something in that these publicity stunts are intended to get a bad public reaction.

They never caught up with planes (though they did have a bit of parity occasionally) and the Navy was never relevant in the first place, but USSR ground tech far outstripped NATO in several places. People have a tendency to compare the T-55 to the M1A2 SEP TUSK II when there&#039;s over 70 years separating those tanks, and &quot;conclude&quot; that the USSR was shit. In reality the M1 didn&#039;t even fucking exist in 1970, and it was M60s vs T-72s. M60s have thinner armour, worse guns, no autoloader, blah blah blah the list goes on. The T-72 had inferior electronics but they were easily upgradable and also less relevant considering the T-72 would have had a massive numbers advantage and also be operating with T-64s and T-80s. The T-80 series was the high point of Soviet tank design and far superior to the M1, and it came four years earlier.<br><br>This carries over to basically all land systems.<br><br>By the 1980s and 1990s the accrued rot was starting to show and the USSR could no longer keep up with the US military, but prior to that the USSR was a formidable enemy. The Soviet system did deliver strength and security for decades and it was a long, steep decline caused by politics, not economics, that ruined the USSR. In a war between the US and the USSR nobody would have won - and that&#039;s not &quot;paper tiger&quot; tier.

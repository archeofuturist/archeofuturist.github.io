Lots of your females are hooking up with proud neanderthals, like me, and are speading new meme: &quot;When you&#039;ve fucked in a cave, you can&#039;t fight the crave.&quot; lol. You can&#039;t blame neanderthal though. Have you seen neanderthal female? Look same as neanderthal male! <br>Your females are soft magical creatures, don&#039;t grow moustache. Have smooth skin, soft like petals of flower. Our females have hard skin, like hide of auroch lol. When neanderthal wife hit me, it hurt, but when your female hit me, I laugh loud. Not so hard to rape lol. Your women prefer big neanderthal cock, and male who can fight sabretooth tiger with bare hands. Homo sapiens sapiens have cock like giant rat and get BTFO by small bear lol.<br>Even better is mixed species child. Child have brain even better than father, but keep best neanderthal traits; sharp focus; hardiness; determination; love to craft mines; make funny cave art; and count. But brain also better than human brain. Mixed child can tame beast, make it pet until family is hungry. Can make stick weapon even better than rock weapon. Best of all, mixed child have skin like snow, and female look even more magical than human women, who have skin color of rhinoceros shit. They have eyes like ocean, or grass; hair like sand, or sunlight, or even like fire! <br>Don&#039;t be mad lol, but our children with human females will rule entire world, and make humans their pet.

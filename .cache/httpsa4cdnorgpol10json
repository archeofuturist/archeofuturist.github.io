Niggers are carrying guns in your country, giving a nigger a gun is like giving a baby abo some weed. Why do you even need guns? bows and arrows are more effective at killing anyway. Guns are loud, bows are almost completely silent but it depends how much force you apply to the string. Actually, boomerangs are the most efficient, effective ranged weapon known to mankind. If you&#039;re skilled with a boomerang you practically have infinite ammo, also, boomerangs rarely kill unless you apply a lot of force into the throw and it hits your targets head. Another great thing about boomerangs is that they&#039;re surprisingly easy to make, all you need is wood and something to carve the wood and if you want you can get some paint and paint a huge penis on it too make it all the more humiliating to get boomaranged. Also, boomerangs have almost 50 thousand years worth of history, do you know what that means you pathetic american pig? it means that boomerangs have gone through 50 thousand years worth of EVOLUTION, they&#039;re the perfect weapon because they have evolved so much.","filename":"boomerang1","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1536,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491021459656,"time":1491021459,"md5":"CiQ3fD2jLliNW\/o6cUnTbA==","fsize":1013574,"resto":0,"id":"TYNfQ64S","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"american-gun-laws","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":119119228,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)20:12:37","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Kim Jong Juan","com":"Why haven&#039;t Venezuelans taken this faggot out yet?","filename":"image","ext":".png","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491005557513,"time":1491005557,"md5":"YAo6Mi5aFE5iFaRjwSxNOA==","fsize":287666,"resto":0,"id":"yYQbFbwC","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"kim-jong-juan","country_name":"United States","replies":71,"images":11,"omitted_posts":66,"omitted_images":10},{"no":119143579,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:24:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119142821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119142821<\/a><br>that&#039;s a good point, i bet the nigger influence in the genetics made things a lot worse than they had to be","time":1491020650,"resto":119119228,"id":"Co0nu9\/V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119143691,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:25:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119119228\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119119228<\/a><br>and why the old fucking cunt pope Francis haven&#039;t yet condemned the coup","time":1491020721,"resto":119119228,"id":"acLdrDDP","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":119143841,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:26:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119142821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119142821<\/a><br>iberians came to loot and pillage not to settle. they didnt bring their families with them, if they even had one. they got as rich as they could and went back to europe, leaving behind their mixed race bastard children. by the time they decided to settle the damage had already been done.","time":1491020813,"resto":119119228,"id":"gt4dPqQk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119144189,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:30:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119143841\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119143841<\/a><br>to be fair though, north americans came to settle only to have their descendants hand over the farm. <br><br>future america is not going to be the past america, demographically speaking. whether that&#039;s good or bad depends on who you ask, but i&#039;m feeling quite negative about it.","time":1491021018,"resto":119119228,"id":"Co0nu9\/V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119144870,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:36:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119144189\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119144189<\/a><br>demographically we might survive if we close the borders tomorrow, but economically were completely fucked. its going to be 90s russia tier poverty when the dollar finally gives up the ghost.","time":1491021418,"resto":119119228,"id":"gt4dPqQk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119141597,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:04:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"I dont think ive ever wanted to punch a guest on Tucker Carlsons show more than this dumb ass... holy shit this guy is a retard, how is he a professor? apparently anyone can be one these days...seriously fuck this guy","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-03-31 at 8.07.29 PM","ext":".png","w":537,"h":245,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":114,"tim":1491019445374,"time":1491019445,"md5":"U0lVofRxAo6Xl5yDUIDzWg==","fsize":218223,"resto":0,"id":"cDcDZ2NE","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-dont-think-ive-ever-wanted-to-punch-a-guest-on","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":2},{"no":119142098,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:09:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yeah it was pretty bad.

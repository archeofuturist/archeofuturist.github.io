The natural way to rely heavily on emotion (even if they don&#039;t know it) and anecdotal evidence and storytelling. <br><br>The political left actually exploits this to great degree, and I&#039;m convinced they do it on purpose. The left&#039;s main ideas all have to do with things that make people feel good and don&#039;t require tough decisions. It always has to do with &quot;compassion&quot; and letting government &quot;solve problems&quot;. Forget about the problems with too much compassion, forget about all those nasty details that go into the government &quot;solving&quot; things, let alone the unintended consequences. Just feel good about yourself and vote for progressive policies!

Another one is that trying to do good sometimes makes things worse. The effects are what matter, not your intentions.

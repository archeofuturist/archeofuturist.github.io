Over the last few months, however, we&#039;ve seen Congressman Schiff, James Comey, etc., who are suggesting there are such connections and that further investigation is necessary. These two premises could be reconciled if we assumed the IC only began investigating Trump after Jan 20, as that would explain why Clapper wouldn&#039;t be privy to any evidence of a Russian-connection. BUT, we now know that isn&#039;t true: the intelligence agencies &amp; Obama administration were investigating\/monitoring Trump for nearly a year (or more). [For reference, here is Clapper on March 5: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ycZ<wbr>j5-5KJwA]<br><br>The way I see it, 1 of 3 things must be the case, but none of them makes sense: <br><br>1. Clapper lied on Mar 5. Clapper actually had seen evidence of a Trump-Russia connection, but he lied by saying he had seen no evidence. If so, then why would he lie? Clapper would&#039;ve lied on Meet the Press, but also in the DNI&#039;s report to Congress.<br><br>2. Clapper was telling the truth on Mar 5 (i.e. the IC had seen no evidence of collusion before Jan 20) BUT, since that time, they HAVE FOUND some new piece of evidence. If so, how could that be? The objectionable conduct would&#039;ve occurred when Clapper was still in office (i.e. before the inauguration) during a time when the intelligence agencies were already monitoring Trump. Wouldn&#039;t this info have been available to Clapper?<br><br>3. Clapper was telling the truth on March 5 (i.e. the IC had seen no evidence of collusion before Jan 20) AND, since that time, they HAVE NOT FOUND any additional piece evidence. If so, then why would the Dems\/Media push a narrative so hard knowing that evidence of a connection, if it existed, should have surfaced by now? Why would Comey undertake this investigation with nothing to go on?","filename":"Clapper March 5","ext":".png","w":1224,"h":704,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":143,"tim":1491291830265,"time":1491291830,"md5":"KmCESRAYfodxs2zmc174bA==","fsize":724930,"resto":0,"id":"c8ACZ32h","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-doesnt-make-sense-james-clapper-back-on","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":3,"omitted_posts":8,"omitted_images":1},{"no":119455840,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)06:27:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119451218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119451218<\/a><br>please explain flynn and mannafort though?","time":1491301624,"resto":119445655,"id":"WKYoMqhB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119455864,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)06:27:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119445655\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119445655<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/worl<wbr>d\/national-security\/blackwater-foun<wbr>der-held-secret-seychelles-meeting-<wbr>to-establish-trump-putin-back-chann<wbr>el\/2017\/04\/03\/95908a08-1648-11e7-ad<wbr>a0-1489b735b3a3_story.html?utm_term<wbr>=.fca0aaa3a089","time":1491301641,"resto":119445655,"id":"WKYoMqhB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119456802,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)06:42:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119455864\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119455864<\/a><br>So?","time":1491302541,"resto":119445655,"id":"GjgyPjWM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119458239,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)07:03:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119455840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119455840<\/a><br>The first thing I would point out is that Flynn was cleared of any actual wrongdoing by the DOJ.

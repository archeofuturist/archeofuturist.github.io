Senator Lee\u2019s plan is to forbid the FCC from even being able to declare internet service providers (ISPs) as Title II common carriers \u2013 essentially negating the Open Internet Order from 2015. Senator Lee also sponsored an identical bill in 2016 during the 114th Congress with the same 8 cosponsors.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Of these 9 Senators, Sen. Cornyn, Sen. Cotton, Sen.

All 9 cosponsors of this bill voted to do away with internet privacy in the 50-48 party line vote to dismantle FCC online privacy rules.

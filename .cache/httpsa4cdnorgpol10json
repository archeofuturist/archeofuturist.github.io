In it, Schmitt attempts to establish and justifies what he believes to be the defining act of politic, the distinction between friend and enemy. In a context in which the West is infected by the virus of humanity, I found this reading particularly pertinent. Indeed, the whole idea of humanity lies precisely in the idea that all human beings are au fond the same, and that thus if they were to have proper understanding of their true interests and of their proper relationship toward one another, the very possibility of discord of will, and thus of conflict, of a friend, enemy distinction, would disappear.<br><br>Bruno Gulli states as such in the introductory section of his book &quot;Human and the Enemy: How ethic can rid politics of violence&quot;.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;However, it makes sense to think of the unity of politics and ethics as an alternative to a world that seems unable or unwilling to deliver conditions of social justice and the good life for all\u2014 where \u201cfor all\u201d means a humanity that has surpassed the friend-and-enemy impasse, having perhaps eliminated the very concept or possibility of the enemy.<\/span><br><br>Of course, in order to assume that humanity should ever be able to overcome the very possibility of enmities between different people, Gulli as to appeal to a notion of the &quot;good life&quot; which I suspect many people would reject, to the point where they would be ready to define Gulli and his ilk as an enemy in the political sense.","filename":"2dc11cb20d910fe05b70de4c5c45c994","ext":".jpg","w":3083,"h":4001,"tn_w":192,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490659199738,"time":1490659199,"md5":"x2eev4qpckiEiNXcZlymjA==","fsize":3034232,"resto":0,"id":"0hUcfvwW","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pols-reading","country_name":"Canada","replies":4,"images":4},{"no":118582417,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:00:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118582333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118582333<\/a><br>This was foreseen by Schmitt, who writes:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Humanity as such and as a whole has no enemies.

As Robert Lane wrote a long time ago, liberal politics requires \u201ca touch of anomie\u201d about the public sphere. Most important, liberal politics take the form of claiming that politics should never be about identity and that to the degree that policy decisions affect what it means to be a person those decisions are divisive and dangerous.<\/span><br><br>Here we see that was is being designated as &quot;liberal&quot; is not necessarily the liberal in the sense in which we understand this term, as a general designation of a whole spectrum of left wing activists engaged in identity politics, but rather denotes the so called &quot;classical liberal&quot;, for whom politic is a mean through which human freedom is secured.","filename":"04readin","ext":".jpg","w":1211,"h":1500,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490659448084,"time":1490659448,"md5":"KpVg\/3V07f7IRZFzVU6rnQ==","fsize":237372,"resto":118582333,"id":"0hUcfvwW","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118583257,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:07:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"This passage is rather pertinent given the current condition of the West.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Schmitt writes somewhat chillingly in The Concept of the Political that \u201cif a people no longer possesses the energy or the will to maintain itself in the sphere of politics, the latter will not thereby vanish from the world.

Against a fundamentally procedural approach to politic, in which is tolerated what respects the established procedure, Shmitt seems to have wanted to argue that such an attitude consisted in the negation of the very possibility of an enemy hell bent on destroying one&#039;s way of life. Against such an attitude, Schmitt assert his view of the political as the ability to reject, and to do so violently.

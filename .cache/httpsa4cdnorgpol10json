Lim of Walnut Creek, California, has purchased five bidets over the last seven years \u2014 two for each house he owns and one for his elderly parents. In Taiwan, where Lim was born, all of his siblings have bidets as well. \u201cIt looks strange if you don\u2019t have it,\u201d Lim told Fox News.<br><br>A bidet is a plumbing fixture or sink used for washing genitalia and, while widely used in places like Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, they are not customary in the United States.<br><br>A bidet to put it simply is a what should clean your rear end after the food you ate exits your body. Instead of toilet paper a bidet shoots a stream of water in order to clean your butt. If you had mud on your driveway would you rather wipe it off with newspaper or take out the pressure washer?<br><br>The idea of using a bidet may be foreign to many Americans but it the norm in many countries. Did you know that 97% of homes in Italy have a bidet? Other European countries and Japan also has a very high rate of bidet use.<br><br>Many countries are just starting to widely use toilets, in fact 70% of people in India do not have access to a toilet.

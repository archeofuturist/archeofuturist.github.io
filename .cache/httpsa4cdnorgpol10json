Prior to 2015, ISPs were regulated by the Federal Trade Commission, so privacy regulations were &quot;consumer expectation&quot; focused. In 2015, the FCC voted to reclassify broadband providers as &quot;common carriers.&quot; The FCC privacy regulations have a &quot;carrier-centered&quot; approach. This created two opposing sets of regulations for ISPs - the FTC &quot;consumer expectations of privacy&quot; policy and the FCC&#039;s &quot;carrier determines data usage&quot; policy. To remedy that, the FCC voted to regulate ISP privacy solely through FCC carrier-driven regulations. Meanwhile, NADA went into effect, and, since the FCC regulations are carrier-based, the carriers had the right to determine how they applied the NADA rules to data. In other words, the carriers had the power to censure. Yesterday&#039;s S.J. 34 ruling disapproved the FCCs regulation of ISPs. My understanding is that jurisdiction of broadband carriers will be moved back to the FTC where they will, again, be based on &quot;consumer expectations.&quot; The good news is we&#039;ll have a choice in if\/how our data is used, as well as legal recourse if it&#039;s used without our permission. The bad news is, there will probably be a fee for opting out.

Doctrine was preserved in the Scriptures, Hymns, Liturgies, manuscripts, epistles, and sermons. The Church itself, as a whole, preserved knowledge about God (to the extent that humans are capable of understanding). <br><br>However, the Western (or Latin) part of it began to liberalize theologically and ecclesiologically. By the 11th Century AD, the prerogatives of the Pope of Rome were changed to include universal jurisdiction, and the Nicene Creed was modified. Through the centuries, the changes to doctrine continued: The Immaculate Conception, Created Grace, Papal Indulgences, Purgatory, Papal Infallibility, etc. <br><br>Then, the Protestant Reformation was initiated by people who had lost confidence in the fidelity of the Roman Church. The Reformation was essentially a scholastic movement that sought to establish doctrine exclusively (and in some cases almost exclusively) from the Scriptures. This approach to theology is a redefinition of what the Christian Scriptures are, and furthermore seeks to interpret those Scriptures using purely scholastic and rationalistic methods, devoid of the original context, and the broader Tradition, of which the Scriptures are a part. <br><br>Only the Orthodox Church maintains fidelity to the Apostolic Faith.

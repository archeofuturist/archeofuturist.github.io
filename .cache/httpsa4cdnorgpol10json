You&#039;ll notice that virtually any college campus is filled with leftists, whereas older people tend to be more conservative. The reason for this is because leftist indoctrination says things like &quot;blacks are good people they&#039;re just oppressed&quot; and &quot;Islam is a religion of peace&quot; and people who haven&#039;t seen much of the world (younger people) believe it because they&#039;re idealistic and naive. <br><br>But as you get older, you see that niggers aren&#039;t oppressed, they&#039;re violent stupid thugs who are responsible for their own shitty lot in life, and mudslime savages are anything but peaceful, as they commit acts of terror all over the world and after hearing &quot;they&#039;re peaceful!&quot; after each attack you gradually stop believing it. Now take your (you) and get the fuck out of here","filename":"IMG_2172","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493453763102,"time":1493453763,"md5":"Xd+nvn3R7WEc2HgPUd3ucg==","fsize":175045,"resto":123302206,"id":"RZ3xdKJa","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123313212,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)04:25:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/pol\/<\/span><br> <span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;POLITICALLY FUCKING INCORRECT aka HELICOPTER RIDES FOR LEFTISTS&quot;<\/span><br>op = faggot","filename":"1490706259193s","ext":".jpg","w":107,"h":125,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493454352196,"time":1493454352,"md5":"+hYUTrcCxuIGZp7Ae3PxUw==","fsize":3070,"resto":123302206,"id":"IgDkiwzB","country":"KW","country_name":"Kuwait"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123311841,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)04:03:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Buy a shirt, \/pol\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.iamhistory.co.uk\/<\/span>","filename":"WE_WUZ","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493452983391,"time":1493452983,"md5":"tmkoIN5HdeOoMUE2IJyHpg==","fsize":17836,"resto":0,"id":"12uunYmb","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"buy-a-shirt-pol","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":123305952,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)02:38:01","name":"Anonymous","sub":"why does leftism make women ugly pol?","filename":"hqdefault","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493447881535,"time":1493447881,"md5":"rHtpBcXbQeXXS\/JHDul4cg==","fsize":9127,"resto":0,"id":"VN+zx03c","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-does-leftism-make-women-ugly-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":38,"images":10,"omitted_posts":33,"omitted_images":10},{"no":123310971,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)03:49:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123310495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123310495<\/a><br>That&#039;s the thing with the very far left, it&#039;s actually led by spiteful, angry dykes<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Wp2<wbr>K1e2Fd4Q#t=130","time":1493452171,"resto":123305952,"id":"GNG2CL8w","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":123311403,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)03:56:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123305952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123305952<\/a><br>liberalism is a mental illness","time":1493452579,"resto":123305952,"id":"ob9zqVo4","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":123311458,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)03:56:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123306572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123306572<\/a><br>Cute Cute!!","filename":"jp cute anon","ext":".jpg","w":326,"h":324,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493452608988,"time":1493452608,"md5":"Q4KGj9cDzhIEU1kAkGoRfQ==","fsize":16708,"resto":123305952,"id":"x4hJprbL","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123311722,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)04:01:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123307396\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123307396<\/a><br>Ive actually never felt so much hatred for individuals in a photo; disgusting!","time":1493452862,"resto":123305952,"id":"ByLxdzHr","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123311830,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)04:02:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"it&#039;s because the left wants to destroy mankind","time":1493452977,"resto":123305952,"id":"YfDSEY7G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123311785,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)04:01:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why didn&#039;t they just build parachutes out of their clothes and officer supplies?<br><br>Americans are stupid.","filename":"retards","ext":".jpg","w":468,"h":683,"tn_w":171,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493452907485,"time":1493452907,"md5":"LWoug1vfPw45UgIfTHmENQ==","fsize":68184,"resto":0,"id":"1ONAtV9T","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-didnt-they-just-build-parachutes-out-of-their","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":123311695,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)04:00:11","name":"Anonymous","sub":"You criminal, need to lauder money?

If only people would understand the history of mutual aid before the Great Depression then this topic would not come up as much. Also with the services provided by Medicare and the VA being sub par, do you really want the entire healthcare system run by them? Look at HCAHPS, when hospitals are now being limited on reimbursement based on patient satisfaction scores you know their is a major problem. I have seen patients admitted in as an inpatient status for shit unrelated to pain such as COPD, CHF, or Acute Renal Insufficiency, and with no recorded use of pain medications at home demanding from the physicians to be placed on Dilaudid. And of course the doctors order it because they do not want to get a bad score for themselves or the hospital. This shit is ridiculous, hospital staff should not be in business as 5 star hotels because the government says so by reimbursement. Hospitals should compete by saving the most lives and having the least complications from surgery and care, that is it. The government wants hospitals to compete by who has the fluffiest pillows now.

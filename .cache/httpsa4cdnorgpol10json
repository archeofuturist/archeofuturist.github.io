I think thats a very superficial understanding of what is going on. The girl portrayed in the series experiences stressor after stressor, with no real support system to help her get through tough times. Cries for help are met with finger-pointing and shame. Every friend betrays her. She loses status amongst her peers. A strong feeling of hopelessness is very clearly demonstrated. Yes, she seems like a vindictive bitch at times, but as someone who lost a friend to suicide, this show does not look romanticized at all. Even violent episodes are met with warnings at the beginning of them.<br><br>Again, this was a very fast binge through to understand what the fuss was about. I had it playing in the background while I was working, but I think I&#039;ve seen enough to say this silencing of speech that is taking place at school is BS. Do I think it is a good show? Not really. But I get why its become so popular amongst the younger generation.

I have made many white men and women aware of what is happening to our society, I will tell you that the best way to initially get someone to realise what is happening is to tell them that immigration is pushed by international corporations to create a surplus of workers to stagnate wages. They will retort about getting an education and you will respond by saying most of our immigration (In America) are H1-b visas for skilled workers who then have children here and nationalize themselves. This harms our native population by decreasing wages,demand and in result motivation for natives to get educated in that area.You must also mention the cost of having children has inflated to the point that you either have to lower your living standard (Skilled Immigrants don&#039;t have to as there living standard is much lower) or receive government aid (Affirmative action favor&#039;s under represented minorities) in order to raise and rear (Stay at home parent) strong children. I usually follow up with demographic displacement statistics, our debt, welfare spending and already failed multicultural society&#039;s (Central and South America).

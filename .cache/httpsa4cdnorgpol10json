A small refresher, if you wish: https:\/\/support.google.com\/youtube\/<wbr>answer\/7124238?hl=en<br>It was naturally criticized by many people, as it is an obvious attack against freedom of speech. It also caused an outrage, since quite a few videos were taken down because of their (right-wing) viewpoints, partially thanks to this system. And, also naturally, it was praised by SJWs for obvious reasons (&quot;I can finally report all those videos I don&#039;t like and disagree with!&quot;)<br>However, just today I stumbled upon this (and similar) articles: http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/tech\/2017\/03<wbr>\/20\/youtube-under-fire-for-hiding-l<wbr>gbt-videos.html<br>Basically, YouTube&#039;s restricted mode is a mode that is designed to screen out objectionable content, but it&#039;s been wrongly hiding LGBT videos as well. Many are blaming YouTube itself for being homophobic, but doesn&#039;t this contradict their pro-SJW viewpoint, using YouTube Heroes as reference?<br>Upon reading that article, one particular sentence got my attention: &quot;The video sharing service uses community flagging, age-restrictions and other signals to identify and filter out potentially inappropriate content, according to its website.&quot;<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;community flagging<\/span><br>As soon as I read this, I immediately remembered of YouTube Heroes - that one system that rewards people for flagging YouTube videos. Didn&#039;t take more than a few seconds to draw a conclusion from this - apparently, non-SJWs can flag videos too, and it most likely affected Restricted Mode&#039;s algorythm to detect what should be filtered out or not.<br>Isn&#039;t it ironic how the same system praised by SJWs is (at least partially) the true culprit to what is enraging those same SJWs? And how they&#039;re literally unable to realize that? That an attack against freedom of speech can go both ways?","filename":"asd","ext":".png","w":617,"h":397,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":160,"tim":1490122661448,"time":1490122661,"md5":"Sydlyor9ciADeLoRnxEfpQ==","fsize":53493,"resto":0,"id":"8nWOkpES","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-pretty-sure-many-of-you-remember-youtube","country_name":"Brazil","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":117656355,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)14:57:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Daily reminder that Common Filth is always right.<br>IGNORE SODOMITE ORDERS","filename":"1472143037367","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490122655271,"time":1490122655,"md5":"4EhUo2TzntINEfETWjxDvg==","fsize":20905,"resto":0,"id":"\/AHMr3YA","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"daily-reminder-that-common-filth-is-always-right","country_name":"Poland","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":117651928,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)14:16:55","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Japanese aren&#039;t happy with homogeneous society","com":"Do you guys think homogeneous society is good for the members of society?<br><br>If you think so, you are wrong, DEADLY wrong.<br><br>According to U.N report, Japanese are 51th happy among155 nations. we are same tier with Nicaragua, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.<br><br>Wow, SUCH amazing society.

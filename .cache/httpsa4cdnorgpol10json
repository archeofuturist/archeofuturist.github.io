It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490448071385,"time":1490448071,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"vbgRRdwG","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":6,"images":0,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":118224189,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)09:29:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118223528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118223528<\/a><br>could it be because the majority of atheists are chinese and the number of chinese is pretty much stagnant or declining because of the one child policy?","time":1490448599,"resto":118223528,"id":"VVo4STKj","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":118224244,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)09:30:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118223528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118223528<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;% of world population is evidence that my ideology is right<\/span><br><br>That&#039;s retarded, anon.","time":1490448637,"resto":118223528,"id":"pGctCLxW","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118224536,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)09:34:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"No I would call you and your wife idiots.<br>Captain Sweden in that image.","time":1490448857,"resto":118223528,"id":"KuZ+PYb4","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118225760,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)09:49:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118223528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118223528<\/a><br><br>Atheism is only effective in countries where Christianity has become the money-loving pharisaic cult of the Jews. <br><br>Atheism cannot stand in the face of true belief, which is why it is always the most rabidly vocal atheists in the west that are also the most vocal supporters of Islam. <br><br>Deep down atheists aren&#039;t atheist.

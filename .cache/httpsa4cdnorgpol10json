In Al-Tabari we read that Muhammad derided the people of mecca&#039;s traditional values, insulted their gods, abused their forefathers and caused division among them, upon which he was expulsed. <br><br>So we read in the quran: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Quran 2:217 &quot;They ask you about the sacred month - about fighting therein. Say, &quot;Fighting therein is great sin, but averting [people] from the way of Allah and disbelief in Him and preventing access to al-Masjid al-Haram and the expulsion of its people therefrom are greater evil in the sight of Allah .

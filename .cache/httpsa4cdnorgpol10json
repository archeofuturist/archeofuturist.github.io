Nationalization is redistribution of wealth among people of native country. You are thinking capitalistic logic where you need a lot of money to buy things. Socialism doesn&#039;t needs a lot of money to buy things, since everything costs much less. Inflation is a monetary trick, taxes are monarchy trick. Socialism fully controls its own money. There should be no foreign currencies in Socialism, there should be no foreign companies in Socialism. Million used to be a lot more, GDP doesn&#039;t applies to Socialism, since it&#039;s not part of international system. If i buy house in Socialism for 5000 Euro it won&#039;t be worth much at first capitalistic glance, but it might be worth more than your capitalistic million dollar house. Nowadays the worth of money and salaries of some region are decided by international elite, basically where they move their companies. Socialism doesn&#039;t moves companies, it doesn&#039;t needs migration, because it has even redistribution.","filename":"chart","ext":".png","w":361,"h":519,"tn_w":86,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492781564672,"time":1492781564,"md5":"ri8ZpUSshNNb9XfckodNcw==","fsize":59280,"resto":122116756,"id":"LU6Y0tcW","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":122136879,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)09:45:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122116756\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122116756<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying<\/span>","filename":"13620082_661530890687685_219317113108694602_n","ext":".jpg","w":460,"h":431,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1492782308317,"time":1492782308,"md5":"2IekhhDPOBmRYEehCdqizg==","fsize":34807,"resto":122116756,"id":"+5tqUO+N","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122137038,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)09:46:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122116756\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122116756<\/a><br>people who post threads with leads containing &#039;not welcome on this board&#039; are not welcome on this board","time":1492782414,"resto":122116756,"id":"0VP97Zz2","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122137714,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)09:54:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"fascism is the same gay bullshit statist faggots larping masculinity.","time":1492782871,"resto":122116756,"id":"UeANgvEu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122137093,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)09:47:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Are polans slav or aryan?","filename":"ohkurwa","ext":".png","w":999,"h":662,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1492782444879,"time":1492782444,"md5":"lmODFvtQeW5Gs1l0S8K8Jg==","fsize":955889,"resto":0,"id":"bWERDMdK","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-polans-slav-or-aryan","country_name":"Australia","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":122137671,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)09:54:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Slavs are the missing link between niggers and humans","filename":"1491899080423","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":711,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492782840167,"time":1492782840,"md5":"\/rFKXeh3EELtdfW1FyrowQ==","fsize":51572,"resto":122137093,"id":"G8GUkErW","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"}]}]}

Anyone here in the hospitality industry with experience with dine and dashers who can fill me in?<br><br>--<br><br>Bar staff at The Queen Vic had roughly $250 walk out the door Sunday night courtesy of a group of diners that brazenly exited the neighborhood pub \u2014 with their meals and dinnerware in tow.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s really odd. In my 30 years of doing this in the business, I have never seen this,\u201d owner Ryan Gordon, who wound up posting security camera footage of the head-scratching heist on social media, said of the bizarre exodus. \u201cIt caught me off guard.\u201d<br><br>The crime occurred at 11:05 p.m. on Sunday, he reports; the offenders did the deed while the bartender went into the kitchen to get food for someone else.<br><br>Gordon estimates the loss at $100 for food, plus drinks, and $150 for the plates \u2014 which \u201care expensive,\u201d he sighs.

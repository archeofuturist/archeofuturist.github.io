Its all way too overrated. I dont think we should get rid of all of it but they could tone it down. Maintenance on roads and things like bridges is crucial but we dont need more. We could implement more things like concrete roads vs asphalt and even maglev trains. Every houshold doesnt need a suv per person. Its at least encouraging to know Tesla surpassed Ford this year. People commuting more with bikes wont hurt either. Also consider we have the internet so commuting to work for many jobs is fairly redundant.

The cost, including shipping, came to just over $200, but the question remained: Was this the real thing? Ms. Coeytaux passed the envelope around the table. Inside was a blister pack bearing the names of the medicines. <br><br>\u201cWe knew that to really get the word out about this technology,\u201d Ms. Coeytaux said, \u201cwe needed to talk about it in terms familiar to an American audience \u2014 and especially to millennials.\u201d Most young women she and her colleagues meet don\u2019t know how the drugs work, she said, and many have never even heard of them. But they have heard of the morning-after pill, or Plan B, a form of emergency contraception made available over the counter in 2013. Plan C piggybacks on that popularity, and hints at how the pills can be used: not necessarily after a pregnancy is certain, but as a medicine a woman can take if she misses her period, without being sure of the reason. In other words, just in case.<br><br>Women on Web, a Netherlands-based nonprofit collective that pioneered the practice of putting the pills directly into women\u2019s hands, has provided abortion medications to more than 50,000 women in 130 countries. While Women on Web focuses on serving women in countries where abortion is legally restricted, Safe2Choose, a social enterprise formed in 2015, sends nearly half of its shipments to countries where abortion has long been legal and widely available.","filename":"abortion2","ext":".jpg","w":788,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":190,"tim":1493355953454,"time":1493355953,"md5":"Z1Wrqc5kd0CnE5YqCYl4KQ==","fsize":136810,"resto":0,"id":"pHp8KsHS","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"plan-c-abortion-pills-on-the-internet","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":123152609,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)01:22:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123150875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123150875<\/a><br>bump","time":1493356931,"resto":123150875,"id":"UpJCL3KY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

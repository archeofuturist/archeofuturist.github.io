Science says there are only two genders!\u201d in response to Bill Nye covering gender and sexuality on Bill Nye Saves the World.<br><br>\u2026Like, did they even listen to what he said? Have they read any peer-reviewed literature about the subject? Is their understanding of \u201cgender\u201d limited to a middle school understanding of X and Y chromosomes? Bill Nye addressed chromosomes, hormones, genitalia and secondary sex characteristics when talking about how some of us don\u2019t fit into the male\/female sex dichotomy, and brought up psychology and neuroscience when talking about gender and its difference from sex, and also sexuality. The actual science of sex, gender and sexuality across the animal kingdom and across human behaviour is far more interesting than \u201clol nope science says there are only two genders.\u201d <br><br>It honestly makes me angry when people say \u201clol I thought this was about science\u201d whenever a scientist says something about topics like gender, sexuality, climate change or evolution that annoys someone. You can\u2019t just pretend science is on your side when your understanding of science is based on a grade school textbook.","filename":"Bill_Nye_Saves_world_poster-1492470090","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":645,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":157,"tim":1493188736971,"time":1493188736,"md5":"mltW2sHke+vX9DzAHnTDLg==","fsize":110208,"resto":0,"id":"D5NGfWQQ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"it-bothers-me-to-see-how-many-people-are-saying","country_name":"United States","replies":182,"images":37,"omitted_posts":177,"omitted_images":36,"tail_size":50},{"no":122876391,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)08:01:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122875634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122875634<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Most of the world still thinks you&#039;re men<\/span><br>If you&#039;ve actually undergone HRT its pretty hard to tell the difference<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So women literally aren&#039;t women unless they wear lipstick?<\/span><br>As well as do and look like a myriad of other things<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Judith Butler.

The word here should really be IF and not WHEN you discuss politics, don&#039;t force a conversation about politics ever, let it happen naturally if at all. Not everyone cares about politics or even have the capacity to understand it, and that may be frustrating given you have an interest in it and they don&#039;t, but it&#039;s fine. You don&#039;t sperg out about people not knowing anything about your other interests, so don&#039;t sperg out about them being clueless about politics either (if they are).<br><br>Just talk about normie shit in the start, like &quot;ugh these pointless wars in the middle-east, am i right?&quot; and stuff like the one percent and all that, the general agreed upon injustices.

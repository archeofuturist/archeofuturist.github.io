The worst threat was a cop who broke the first rule of use of a firearm. YOU ALWAYS CHECK YOUR BACKGROUND!!!! The fucking dumbass cop fired a round at the chest of a kid who had a backdrop FULL of other kids. If the kid had moved even slightly too much that shot could have struck anyone behind him. If that round had passed through his body it could have still hit another kid. This cop was the most dangerous thing out there that day. There is no shooter out there who has had even a remote amount of training that will say this cop was following proper safe use of a firearm.

We want to offer a new way of being patriots, one that can&#039;t be shamed with the usual buzzwords and won&#039;t scare regular people. We&#039;re not nat-socs, we&#039;re not fascists, and we\u2019re not skinheads. We&#039;re Europeans and proud.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What politics do you promote?<\/span><br>To each people its homeland. Multicultural societies are a failure, Europe is for Europeans and non-Europeans will have to be remigrated back to their countries. Globalisation is also a problem, as we don&#039;t want our culture to become americanized, though we have nothing against Americans. We are against immigration, islamisation and globalism, because they&#039;re all threats to our people and our way of life.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What do you actually do?<\/span><br>We&#039;re basically a right-wing, pro white Greenpeace, and we&#039;re really good at happenings and getting media attention. Agit-prop, leaflets, protests, building occupations, creating white communities, carrying on our traditions... We occupied a mosquee in Poitiers (some here may better know about the battle of Tours), we clamb on the BrandenburgerTor, we deployed a large banderole over Vienna&#039;s turkish embassy to say fuck off to Erdogan and his Turks... many other things I could talk about.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Are you pro-Trump? Pro-Putin? Pro-Israel?<\/span><br>We&#039;re pro Europe and pro white. We&#039;re vassals to no one, and nobody owns us.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I\u2019m non-white\/non-European, can I join?<\/span><br>No. This is a European organization, and that means being white and living in Europe. Impossible to open chapters overseas because that would be in conflict with the ideology we\u2019re pushing. Still, we believe whites from everywhere are brothers.","filename":"17814203_1619573468060706_8460657730906949545_o","ext":".jpg","w":990,"h":660,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492169242243,"time":1492169242,"md5":"F0IiUkB9mu\/LcMiey1gObA==","fsize":130502,"resto":0,"id":"d6pPYMo6","country":"BE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"since-there-are-regularly-some-successful-threads","country_name":"Belgium","replies":2,"images":2},{"no":121049670,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:27:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Are you against nations, do you want a European empire?<\/span><br>No. We believe that even though a French, a German, an Italian, a Swede or a Pole are all Europeans and should band together against our common enemies, they\u2019re still not the same and they should stay different.

In East Asian societies, Tiger moms help the child adapt to the hyper-competitive culture. But in the West tiger moms are maladaptive since success is more affected by social connection than individual merit. In other words you have hapa kids who spend a lifetime being domineered and drilled by their mothers, prevented from making real friends, finding romantic interests because of attempts by their mothers to cut off any influence aside from her own.","filename":"fec0905ee159451666ad300627a916d6","ext":".jpg","w":657,"h":1000,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490748577445,"time":1490748577,"md5":"5SnfFwQbWZRtMNEyAFqVFg==","fsize":150487,"resto":118712339,"id":"biQ2lVSt","country":"US","country_name":"United

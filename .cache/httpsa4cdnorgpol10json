It\u2019s not a fucking puzzle, all the history is on the sites. There you crossed ur nerdy hobbies with ur nerdy resentment. Bunch of fucking nerds with your dipshit teenage beefs probably started with a resentment of woman who won\u2019t speak to you and now you think you have become POI radicalized.<br>So how did it happen? How did you become a fucking nazi? A bunch of real Nazis whispered poison in your ears while becoming your only community, your only \u201cfriends\u201d. And they used multiple levels to make irony and bigotry and fascism more acceptable by drowning it in \u201coh we\u2019re just joking\u201d So you combine all this with capitalizing on isolated nerd dude resentment and even deeper isolation, BAM nazi.<br>You can talk to any former \u201cchan\u201d boy and they can tell you how it went from \u201cshotty shock humor\u201d to \u201cwhite supremacist recruitment\u201d. The \u201clol only normies care about hurting others attitude\u201d + the general nerd male resentment of these communities. Its prime fertile ground for actual Nazis to grow. People talk about pol, but you need to see the various communities converge. R9K\u2019s \u201cwho wont woman fuck me\u201d bs \u201canything goes and anyone who gets mad is just a normie\u201d vs endless outbursts of anger at everything. Pol here becomes less of an isolated phenomenon and more of a natural end point for all these circles crashing into one another. And pol, also being its own thing, emans it is rolled back into those communities amplifying your worst aspect then roll it back into pol.<br>So essentially you have an online pressure cooker to turn your typical teenage nerdy bullshit into honest to god fascism. The surrounding of hateful idedas, the detachment from the harm you do? Turning them into \u201cjust jokes\u201d becoming your only friends and that just your community you can see it in many others but again your not a fucking mystery.","time":1493090764,"resto":122684695,"id":"NAjz0ItX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122685636,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)23:26:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Just had my thread deleted on \/b\/ for posting this<br><br>they let fucking CP up but don&#039;t let me post this<br><br>absolute kikes.","filename":"Screen_Shot_2017-04-24_at_7.54.23_PM","ext":".png","w":836,"h":482,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":144,"tim":1493090761093,"time":1493090761,"md5":"Na1DUx9wfiHkzGj0sbfHpg==","fsize":688475,"resto":0,"id":"C5ecPTAm","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"just-had-my-thread-deleted-on-b-for-posting-this","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122685069,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)23:21:25","name":"Anonymous","sub":"My brother made a merchant","com":"What dess \/pol\/ think about my brothers clay merchant?<br>Also post rare merchants","filename":"IMG_9462","ext":".jpg","w":1190,"h":1139,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":239,"tim":1493090485685,"time":1493090485,"md5":"nB2MmhNqd5BqelnoG12l8g==","fsize":169489,"resto":0,"id":"\/bu8tfTm","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"my-brother-made-a-merchant","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1},{"no":122685142,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)23:21:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Terrifying just like the real thing","time":1493090519,"resto":122685069,"id":"NDQ\/XMqu","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122685408,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)23:24:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;You&#039;d better be a good goy!<\/span>","filename":"64244931-395C-4D84-90A7-1344C10DFD65","ext":".jpg","w":439,"h":414,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1493090649357,"time":1493090649,"md5":"iBKvOvMmBLATUN2hGNA7Hg==","fsize":60657,"resto":122685069,"id":"\/bu8tfTm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122685634,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)23:26:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122685069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122685069<\/a><br>Is he going to glaze it?","time":1493090761,"resto":122685069,"id":"QVJq2crU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122685938,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)23:28:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122685634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122685634<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is he going to glaze it?<\/span><br>Unfortunately no, its modeling clay that never hardens","time":1493090910,"resto":122685069,"id":"\/bu8tfTm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122661508,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)20:11:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why the fuck do millennials dress like this?<br><br>Everytime I go to the mall I see degenerates a niggers and nigger degenerates wearing these rags <br><br>Is there anything safe from the Jews reach?","filename":"IMG_20170220_225529","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":742,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":247,"tim":1493079112145,"time":1493079112,"md5":"w+jzI52w0b0rV1PZr74XsA==","fsize":125104,"resto":0,"id":"w\/KKURET","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-the-fuck-do-millennials-dress-like-this","country_name":"United States","replies":232,"images":46,"omitted_posts":227,"omitted_images":45,"tail_size":50},{"no":122683804,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)23:10:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122679179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122679179<\/a><br>delete this post so you may receive his benericktion","filename":"R I C K","ext":".jpg","w":1500,"h":1125,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493089858744,"time":1493089858,"md5":"uxg7NXiPFRrOz+MlfuDiZA==","fsize":187364,"resto":122661508,"id":"kzwexHLt","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122683861,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)23:11:22","name":"Anonymous","filename":"14718697_1267213083320076_2936967367900998597_n","ext":".jpg","w":638,"h":633,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493089882140,"time":1493089882,"md5":"jXqgWoOu\/ZzbUFXINLOmvA==","fsize":66172,"resto":122661508,"id":"MuKNgPZl","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122683904,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)23:11:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122661508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122661508<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dress like a hobo<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;complain that rich people rule the world<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;in truth, people who don&#039;t dress like dogshit that got vomited on by a cat&#039;s intestinal parasites rule the world<\/span><br><br>This is the true redpill","time":1493089909,"resto":122661508,"id":"nedXj0sW","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122684827,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)23:19:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122661508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122661508<\/a><br>People still dress in shitty copy pasted streetwear attire from the 2013&#039;s?

Liberals are very, well, liberal on which scientific evidence is enlightening or racist pertaining to this subject. Part of the reason is Boasian anthropology, a Jewish institution dictated by Franz Boas to make gentiles abandon Darwinism (due to racists like the Nazis using it to fuel their fascist endeavors) and supported by dishonest anti-scientific research in an attempt to show that even savage cultures are &quot;equal&quot; to Europeans&#039;, and there is no such thing as race. This was popularized in the 30s through Jewish media and peer reviewed by Boas&#039;s own students to give the ideas credence, and ever since then it&#039;s become taboo to talk in terms of protecting European culture or preserving the white race.<br><br>Liberals will tell you it sounds stupid, but people of a genetic background that didn&#039;t survive thousands of years of snowy wastes simply don&#039;t think the same way as Europeans. It&#039;s not a bad thing, but it means non-white people in white countries can exploit their democratic institutions to work against white interests (like the Jews have always done) or live off of their empathy and charity (guess).<br><br>The West has tried to fight off multiculturalism for this reason without sounding racist, but it&#039;s an impossible victory to attain.

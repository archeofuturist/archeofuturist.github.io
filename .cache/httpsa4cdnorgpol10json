How does this help the United States?\u201d he asked.<br><br>\u201cVery simply: because what we\u2019re talking about is the use of weapons of mass destruction against civilians,\u201d Gorka replied. \u201cAnd I\u2019m fully cognizant of the fact that people are very leery about prior engagements. The U.K. dossier you mentioned, specifically, will go down in history as a misuse of intelligence analysis. I understand that. But it doesn\u2019t mean that you throw away all intelligence analysis simply when somebody politicized it once a decade ago or more than a decade ago.\u201d<br><br>\u201cThe strategic imperative is very clear. These weapons not only are banned; they are being used against civilians. That is a global problem,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have sent a very clear message that when you do something as heinous, as evil, as using weapons of mass destruction against unarmed civilians, you will pay a penalty. That\u2019s why it\u2019s in the U.S. national security interest.\u201d<br><br>Gorka stressed it was important to \u201csend a very clear message that these weapons are not to be used anywhere.\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s a very clear national security message,\u201d he said. \u201cThe global context affects America as much as it affects the people who were killed in that attack on Tuesday. Weapons of mass destruction are a global phenomena that have to be dealt with by a global strategy. So yes, the two things are not mutually exclusive, but the moral imperative and the national security imperative can overlap, and in this case, they do.\u201d<br>http:\/\/www.breitbart.com\/radio\/2017<wbr>\/04\/07\/gorka-syria-not-full-throate<wbr>d-war-deployment-just-surgical-miss<wbr>ile-strike\/","filename":"U.S.-airstrike-vs-Syria-April-7-2017-ap-640x480","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491625914754,"time":1491625914,"md5":"E61oNxeACw68D3bELpeSzg==","fsize":34354,"resto":0,"id":"fNGn8vYu","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gorka-on-syria-this-is-not-a-fullthroated-war","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":120085684,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)00:26:06","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Clinton&#039;s missed op","com":"She missed her moment.

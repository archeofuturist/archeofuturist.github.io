I&#039;ll tell you.<br><br>Homosexuality is the result of a genetic disorder. Schizophrenia is also the result of a genetic disorder. Now, imagine for a moment, if you will, that the Government passed a law requiring you to indulge schizos in their delusions. Some homeless fuck on the street wobbles up to you one day and says he&#039;s Napoleon Bonaparte, and you have to agree despite knowing damn well that crazy bastard never once in his life conquered Egypt. But it&#039;s the law. How would you feel? What would this mean for society? How does it relate to gays? Because, despite homosexuality being a genetic disorder, everyone who is actually normal has to pretend homosexuals are good, normal people. Because it&#039;s the law. So what are gays doing about their disorder? Are they demanding Government funding for discovering a cure for their sexual abnormality? Of course not! But even the schizophrenic, who has absolutely no grasp on reality, will eventually seek treatment! How worse off are the gays, who are more deluded and confused than the mentally ill. No. The faggot rubs his abominable, unnatural sexuality in the face of society. When we otherwise wouldn&#039;t care about his sexuality, he rubs it in our faces and makes sure we know just how big of a queer he is. And lastly, what&#039;s worst than all, is the fact gays are more likely to catch sexually transmitted diseases, be raped, indulge in pedophilia, and get murdered than heterosexual people. But does this humble the gay community? Of course not! They hide their fear of AIDS by acting flamboyant, once again making sure you know they&#039;re gay, as they double-down on degeneracy.<br><br>That&#039;s why gays are bad and God will one day destroy them (by providing man with a cure for homosexuality).","filename":"gay stats","ext":".jpg","w":3099,"h":1854,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":74,"tim":1493097668439,"time":1493097668,"md5":"mZ9VVXYLT93i7zz340mlhg==","fsize":802200,"resto":122696374,"id":"0No8WmTd","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122697134,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:21:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122696374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122696374<\/a><br>I dunno.

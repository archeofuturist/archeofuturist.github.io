I met a Swedish girl in one of my classes at the engineering university we both study at. We&#039;ve been together for almost two years and moved in together six months ago. Recently I found a really old social media account of hers. It had a bunch of extreme right-wing propaganda and pictures of her at nazi parties. I love her to death, and she&#039;s never shown any signs of being racist. She was the one that hit on me, and asked me out on our first date. Most of her friends are feminists and left-wing women.

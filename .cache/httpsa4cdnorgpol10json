Cameras, Cops, General Security, Normies who want to help. Even dangerous conditions won&#039;t keep them in bed if they think there is a prankster to catch out there.<br><br>Take long breaks between areas that you prank. Give the area time to cool off before pranking it again. <br><br>Don&#039;t revisit an area right after you prank. It is at your discretion how long you wait but the sooner you revisit and area the more likely you are to be a suspect.<br><br>Play to the fears of the people you are pranking. If the media assures them that there are evil Trump supporters out there behind every tree and under every rock, they believe it as Gospel. In their minds the non existent threat is all too real and the fear of the illusion will eat them alive. If they so much as see a Whites Have A Right To Exist, poster somewhere they might fly into a demonic fit of rage and not sleep well for a long time.<br><br>Shut your mouth about what you are doing. <br><br>The mass media is very left wing. The Cops are not your friends if you are pro white. They will get promotions and fawning praise from the leftwing media if they bust an evil whitey.","time":1491189319,"resto":119266040,"id":"gSXmYB86","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119284037,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:19:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119266040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119266040<\/a><br>Have you taken the Homo Capensis pill yet?<br><br>(real life steve brule)<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Lv1<wbr>O2FF-EDI","filename":"giphykljlkj","ext":".gif","w":349,"h":555,"tn_w":78,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491189555208,"time":1491189555,"md5":"TLCW0s0Fxdmdwc+U4OtUoQ==","fsize":409357,"resto":119266040,"id":"pbOg5x7s","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119284151,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:20:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119280167\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119280167<\/a><br><br>Go on...<br><br>is it somehow linked to this?<br><br>http:\/\/www.soc.ucsb.edu\/faculty\/sch<wbr>eff\/2.html","time":1491189629,"resto":119266040,"id":"YucxWpaO","country":"CO","country_name":"Colombia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119283538,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:13:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"tell me leafs...does this make your blood boil??<br><br>http:\/\/en.cijnews.com\/?p=45923<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Syrian refugee with the pseudonym Akram has recently told CIJnews his immigration personal story since resettling in Turkey until finding a new home in the Greater Toronto Area<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;According to Akram, the Syrian refugees in Canada are \u201cvery pleased\u201d (\u0627\u0643\u062b\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0645\u0631\u062a\u0627\u062d\u064a\u0646) from their financial situation.

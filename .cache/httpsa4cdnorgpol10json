We also require that carriers inform their customers about customers\u2019 rights to opt in to or opt out (as the case may be) of the use or sharing of their confidential information. We require that carriers present their privacy notice to customers at the point of sale, and that they make their privacy policies persistently available and easily accessible on their Web sites, applications, and the functional equivalents thereof.

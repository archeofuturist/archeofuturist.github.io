In the intellectual culture, it is all taken quite seriously, an interesting indication of that culture&#039;s character.<br><br>There are good reasons why the Herrnstein-Murray sort of thing should be undergoing another one of its period revivals today. Social policy, particularly in the Anglo-American societies, has been designed over the past fifteen to twenty years to devastate families, children, working people, Blacks and vulnerable sectors generally, while directing resources to welfare for the rich.","time":1490182345,"resto":117749401,"id":"tTSECkgl","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117749558,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)07:32:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117749525\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117749525<\/a><br><br>Of course this leads to all kinds of \u201csocial problems\u201d (substance abuse, falling achievement, etc.).

Not to mention it&#039;s somewhat of a red herring seeing as how the Bell Curve was an analysis of \/overall\/ class life in America. The kind of upward redistribution he&#039;s talking about can only account for maybe %1 of the total obfuscation. His deflection cannot explain why IQ correlates with the rest of the middle to middle-upper class which encompass a MUCH higher percentage of the population than the super rich with banking connections. Chomsky has astounded me before with his intellectual absurdities, but this one really epitomizes his flawed thinking. One can make a claim that his anti-capitalism does pit him at fundamental odds, but this is just a blatant denial of facts! Nowhere at all does he justify his position, but instead operates entirely on the presumption that Murray and Hernsteinn are wrong.

That is: for Herrnstein-Murray and their elite cheerleaders the topic should not be, for example, how high-tech industry would collapse in a true free market where the crutches of publicly funded research and development and subsidies have been removed. Nor should it be how the geniuses on Wall Street regularly crash the system and have to run to the nanny state to be rescued.

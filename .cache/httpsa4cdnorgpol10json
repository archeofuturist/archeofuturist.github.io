She&#039;s developed an insatiable craving for your dick and you&#039;ve likewise developed a taste for her pussy. You\u2019re both cooped up in an attic all day have nothing better to do besides fuck like an unsustainable third world population. You lie down on your back, she strips off her almost comically too small clothes and kneels on top of you. She grabs a hold of your rock hard cock, inserts it deep inside of her, and begins to ride you like a stallion. You feel the pressure from her incredible weight and huge round belly bearing down on you but the indescribable pleasure of her tight pussy throbbing on you cock negates any discomfort. You sink into her beautiful soul, into that secret place where no one dares to go. After 30 minutes, you and her are both moaning with ever greater intensity, you know it won&#039;t be long now. Suddenly, you feel your cock shaking like a V-2 rocket and the orgasm reaches it&#039;s climax as your cum literally explodes like an 88mm AT round inside her Sherman tank, blowing the turret right off. You and her both join as one, souls screaming from the sheer ecstasy. As the elation wears off, she lies next to you. Too exhausted to do anything else, you simply hold her in your embrace. In that moment, there is no family squabbles, no Nazis, no war. Just you and her, watching the sky turn pink with the setting sun.","filename":"anne frank6","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":485,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":242,"tim":1493008562815,"time":1493008562,"md5":"bg+z2cDCTu6UKhlIZa+3mA==","fsize":33080,"resto":0,"id":"nK+7Ip6I","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-have-a-confession-to-make-to-all-of-you","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":3,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":1},{"no":122543236,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:37:24","name":"Jeff Mangum","com":"<a href=\"#p122543189\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122543189<\/a><br><br>Then a look of sharp pain shoot across her face.

You fear that she\u2019s gonna start screaming again, much to your relief, it seems that she\u2019s gotten better control of the pain, thanks to you. She begins to softly moan, it seems as if instead of experiencing excruciating agony, she\u2019s experiencing an orgasm. You can\u2019t help but grin as she keeps pushing. As more of the head becomes visible, her moaning intensifies. Finally a small head emerges from her vagina. You can see a face wrapped in an umbilical cord. A small pair of hands grab the head, she weakly tries to pull the head out. You put your hands around the head and begin to help her pull. Desperately, she goes into the next contraction with all of her energy, and pushed with everything inside of her. She feels everything. She feels shoulders and hips and feet all slide down inside of her and pop out in one long push, with a rush of fluid behind it, and it feels amazing. She throws her head back with a rip-roaring orgasm that penetrates the very heart of her soul.","time":1493008644,"resto":122543075,"id":"nK+7Ip6I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122543300,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:38:03","name":"Jeff Mangum","com":"<a href=\"#p122543236\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122543236<\/a><br>You look at the newborn now lying on the floor and see that it is a boy.

The baby quickly finds the breast is soon sucking happily. Semen, blood, amniotic fluid, breastmilk all mix and fill the air with a strange scent that while repulsive, is also extremely arousing. You can\u2019t resist the urge anymore. Your mouth land on top of Anne\u2019s opposite breast, sucking first your own cum, but then her tasty milk. You look into her eyes, she\u2019s somewhat annoyed, but too exhaust to really care. A gust of wind coming from a hole in the wall blows through, cooling both of your sweat-drenched bodies, but also disturbing the little one. You\u2019re afraid he\u2019ll start shivering. You look around the dusty attic for something to keep the baby warm. You settle on Anne\u2019s fur winter jacket, having sat unused for the past two years. You know Anne will definitely not be happy that you ruined her favorite coat, but it\u2019s for the best. She hasn\u2019t been able to fit in it for the past nine months anyway. You carefully wrap your little one in the coat and hand him to an exhausted Anne, she continues to quietly feed him. You notice the dead silence for the first time, not even the other occupants of the Annex, mere feet away in the next room, were roused. You feel a sense of relief. You\u2019re safe, for the moment at least. Eventually you curl up next to her quietly and begin to doze off. Your secret sleeps in winter clothes. Tomorrow, you can find a way to explain the night\u2019s events to your parents and hope they don\u2019t kill each other. You can somehow find a way to get your little bundle of joy to safety.

So that means a general education would be useless, if a child is just going to have one main profession when they&#039;re adult, so why not immediately start training them for their profession to not waste time? Also this division of labor would apply to the government as well. I don&#039;t think every doctor or coal miner has the skills needed to become a leader of a nation, so why would they vote for one if they couldn&#039;t even do the job well? The person in charge shouldn&#039;t be elected, but trained as a professional for their job in managing the country. Now the idea with subsistence pay and very hard work from everyone is towards making a great society. Low consumption and high production of industries will leave the nation with a high surplus and in a well off state to support its rapidly growing population.","time":1493007141,"resto":122529914,"id":"Szz4pr8W","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122542241,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:28:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122529914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122529914<\/a><br>stop posting on pol and go pilot a fucking Eva bitch","filename":"1486380466032","ext":".jpg","w":301,"h":377,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493008088685,"time":1493008088,"md5":"7eYdRm\/07tu81B0ipQi4xA==","fsize":28761,"resto":122529914,"id":"u9iTvI66","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122543078,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:36:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122542241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122542241<\/a><br>no","time":1493008565,"resto":122529914,"id":"Szz4pr8W","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122544248,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:47:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122529914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122529914<\/a><br>stop making me hard","time":1493009234,"resto":122529914,"id":"LWhJv7z4","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122544225,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:47:05","name":"Anonymous","sub":"be honest","com":"did you fall for this?","filename":"1492933422581","ext":".jpg","w":838,"h":771,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":230,"tim":1493009225872,"time":1493009225,"md5":"xoXuaFW5o5YwjbPhyNAIzg==","fsize":190024,"resto":0,"id":"q5YQWm99","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"be-honest","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":122545414,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:58:52","name":"Sage","com":"<a href=\"#p122544225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122544225<\/a><br>Holy shit stop making these threads you autist.

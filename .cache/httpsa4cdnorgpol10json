A society that allows many freedoms for their people to enjoy all the luxuries they want, and also not to work so hard, would allow a very happy population.

This competing society could probably dominate the other more decadent society in warfare, and conquer it. The people in this luxurious society wouldn&#039;t be happy then, they would be dead.

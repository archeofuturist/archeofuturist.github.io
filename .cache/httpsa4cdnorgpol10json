In the early 1900s the U.S. had some monopolies (Morgan, Carnegie and Rockefeller) these men created a mini depression in 1907 by seizing all of their bank held assets (which the banks had to give them in full by taking from their own reserves going bankrupt in the process) Everyone panicked, several companies and banks went bankrupt and millions lost their jobs, allowing them to swallow up more businesses and industries. They used their financial influence to convince the next presidential candidate (Woodrow Wilson) to sign a bill to ratify a new Central Bank of America. In 1913 the bill was signed by Wilson and the invisible government was born. They used their new power to create another depression lasting 10 years (known as the Great Depression) Suddenly there were flyers everywhere saying &quot;cash for gold&quot; and a law was passed stating that anyone who didn&#039;t turn in their gold for cash or for government validated bonds would be imprisoned under treason charges, allowing the fed to steal the entire nation&#039;s last bit of real wealth legally. They passed bill after bill and once the power to print money and regulate how much of it was in circulation was firmly under their command, they made the change from the gold standard to the debt standard. The gov and people needed money, so the Fed offered them (The gov) a loan, to be paid back, in full, with interest. By tacking interest on the end of the loan and stripping us of our ability to print our own money they created a situation where we will be permanently in debt. You would think the Government would realize the scam and try these men for treason, but what they actually did was go back and ask them for an even bigger loan to help pay off their already outstanding debt, creating more debt. The modern system was born -- with every dollar printed to try to pay off this debt, the debt gets higher and the value of the dollar gets lower.","filename":"FB_IMG_1492527892446","ext":".jpg","w":461,"h":350,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":189,"tim":1492675363217,"time":1492675363,"md5":"ok0xI1O14vZv4n7IDV12+A==","fsize":21747,"resto":0,"id":"rg6n9FQz","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"everyone-deserves-to-know-the-truth","country_name":"United States","replies":40,"images":8,"omitted_posts":35,"omitted_images":7},{"no":121984509,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:23:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121970333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121970333<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121971077\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121971077<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121973755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121973755<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121976988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121976988<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121981655\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121981655<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121982544\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121982544<\/a>","filename":"1481864412807","ext":".jpg","w":1197,"h":1600,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492687434530,"time":1492687434,"md5":"\/k93imYTEJHeXd\/8Slohcw==","fsize":518422,"resto":121970333,"id":"EpYMmyqN","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121984624,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:25:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121970333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121970333<\/a><br>Hey OP thanks for your Marxist KGB subversive propaganda","time":1492687522,"resto":121970333,"id":"xIezVFc1","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121985697,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:38:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121983947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121983947<\/a><br>GOY","time":1492688302,"resto":121970333,"id":"9vd8scGU","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":121985833,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:40:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121985697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121985697<\/a><br> haha what<br> thats my nickname at wells fargo","time":1492688413,"resto":121970333,"id":"GOY\/oi9I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121986297,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:46:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121970919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121970919<\/a><br>Fuck em up the ass with bitcoin.","time":1492688774,"resto":121970333,"id":"KPdVi1xA","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121985735,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:38:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"oy vey","filename":"18010527_428687734160479_5640604709099618505_n","ext":".jpg","w":225,"h":225,"tn_w":225,"tn_h":225,"tim":1492688329961,"time":1492688329,"md5":"qp\/15QBk8C3RdJRcr5rViw==","fsize":5818,"resto":0,"id":"Gsl6V\/Z9","country":"RO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"oy-vey","country_name":"Romania","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":121986296,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:46:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"My spidey senses are tingling<br><br>(((Rhino)))","time":1492688774,"resto":121985735,"id":"M5HNEXvt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121977522,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)05:53:34","name":"Anonymous","sub":"US SENDING TROOPS TO SOMALIA","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;America First<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We&#039;re not going to be the policemen of the world anymore<\/span><br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/BUXhjoOsIl0","filename":"4L_FmgbMv3w","ext":".jpg","w":1190,"h":750,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":157,"tim":1492682014143,"time":1492682014,"md5":"3lqMEU4iYwTuwMmYigcaow==","fsize":164567,"resto":0,"id":"jc8BZu2p","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"us-sending-troops-to-somalia","country_name":"Germany","replies":46,"images":13,"omitted_posts":41,"omitted_images":12},{"no":121984670,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:25:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"BLOMPF BLOMPFED THE FUCK OUT","time":1492687555,"resto":121977522,"id":"k8qC63Dr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121985088,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:30:56","name":"Somalibro","com":"<a href=\"#p121980055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121980055<\/a><br>Kek","time":1492687856,"resto":121977522,"id":"u\/gxiSsU","country":"SO","country_name":"Somalia"},{"no":121985809,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:39:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121977522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121977522<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The U.S. military command for Africa (AFRICOM) confirmed to Voice of America on Thursday that American soldiers from 101st Airborne Division had been deployed at the request of the Somali federal government to carry out a train-and-equip mission until September.<\/span><br><br>Wow, it&#039;s fucking nothing","time":1492688389,"resto":121977522,"id":"ZKA4DIn\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121986220,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:45:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121977930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121977930<\/a><br>Fantastic demoralization shillpost!

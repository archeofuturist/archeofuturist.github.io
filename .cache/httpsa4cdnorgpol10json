In those times of late imperialism, the state was amplifying its sphere of influence. He saw that after the bismark era, the well settled bureaucracy started to grab power, responding to its grow (mainly caused by the groth of social politics made as a contingency agianst socialism), and that brought to a decadence and stagnation in the empire.<br>He saw that the bigger the state (or capitalist enterprise) the bigger the dehumanization and the lack freedom of its citizens.<br>The thing is that he saw that behind the big state proposal of Marx there was a huge risk of bureacratization which would carry a huge threat to individual traits. Lets say the time proved his reasoning true.<br>He didnt live to see the emergence of fascism, but I can truly say that the same would had applied in an even more brutal manner, as fascism praised the machine alike behavior, and the obidience before individual traits.

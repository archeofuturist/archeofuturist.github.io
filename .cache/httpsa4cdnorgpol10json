Examples of post-ironic artwork include South African band Die Antwoord, the British television show Garth Marenghi&#039;s Darkplace and the Werner Herzog film Bad Lieutenant: Port of Call New Orleans.

His essays &quot;E Unibus Pluram&quot; and &quot;Fictional Futures and the Conspicuously Young&quot; describe and hope for a literature that goes beyond postmodern&#039;s irony. Other authors oftentimes described as postironic are Dave Eggers, Tao Lin, and Alex Shakar.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Whereas in postmodern irony something is meant to be cynically mocked and not taken seriously, and in new sincerity something is meant to be taken seriously or &quot;unironically&quot;; post-irony combines these two elements by either (i) having something absurd taken seriously or (ii) be unclear as to whether something is meant to be ironic.

Here is an illustration of the way in which the oversocialized leftist shows his real attachment to the conventional attitudes of our society while pretending to be in rebellion aginst it. Many leftists push for affirmative action, for moving black people into high-prestige jobs, for improved education in black schools and more money for such schools; the way of life of the black \u201cunderclass\u201d they regard as a social disgrace. They want to integrate the black man into the system, make him a business executive, a lawyer, a scientist just like upper-middle-class White people. The leftists will reply that the last thing they want is to make the black man into a copy of the white man; instead, they want to preserve African American culture. But in what does this preservation of African American cultura consist? It can hardly consist in anything more than eating black-style food, listening to black-style music, wearing black-style clothing and going to a black-style church or mosque. In other words, it can express itself only in superficial matters. In all ESSENTIAL respects most leftists of the oversocialized type want to make the black man conform to white, middle-class ideals. They want to make him study technical subjects, become an executive or a scientist, spend his life climbing the status ladder to prove that black people are as good as white. They want to make black fathers \u201cresponsible,\u201d they want black gangs to become nonviolent, etc. But these are exactly the values of the industrial- technological system. The system couldn\u2019t care less what kind of music a man listens to, what kind of clothes he wears or what religion he believes in as long as he studies in school, holds a respectable job, climbs the status ladder, is a \u201cresponsible\u201d parent, is nonviolent and so forth. In effect, however much he may deny it, the oversocialized leftist wants to integrate the black man into the system and make him adopt its values.","filename":"1486501570339","ext":".gif","w":225,"h":534,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490923424988,"time":1490923424,"md5":"trpsg+7ePVQttLr0lLd2zg==","fsize":52416,"resto":0,"id":"2g\/ooO\/Z","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"thread-i-httpsboards4chanorgpolthread118995036","country_name":"Spain","replies":12,"images":12,"omitted_posts":7,"omitted_images":7},{"no":119000967,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:37:42","name":"Don&#039;t mind me, just dumping","com":"<a href=\"#p119000736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119000736<\/a><br><br>AUTONOMY<br>42. Autonomy as a part of the power process may not be necessary for every individual. But most people need a greater or lesser degree of autonomy in working toward their goals. Their efforts must be undertaken on their own initiative and must be under their own direction and control. Yet most people do not have to exert this initiative, direction and control as single individuals. It is usually enough to act as a member of a SMALL group. Thus if half a dozen people discuss a goal among themselves and make a successful joint effort to attain that goal, their need for the power process will be served. But if they work under rigid orders handed down from above that leave them no room for autonomous decision and initiative, then their need for the power process will not be served.

It is true that some individuals seem to have Little need for autonomy. Either their drive for power is weak or they satisfy it by identifying themselves with some powerful organization to which they belong.

Any of the foregoing symptoms can occur in any society, but in modern industrial society they are present on a massive scale. We aren\u2019t the first to mention that the world today seems to be going crazy. This sort of thing is not normal for human societies. There is good reason to believe that primitive man suffered from less stress and frustration and was better satisfied with his way of life than modern man is. It is true that not all was sweetness and light in primitive societies. Abuse of women was common among the Australian aborigines, transexuality was fairly common among some of the American Indian tribes. But it does appear that GENERALLY SPEAKING the kinds of problems that we have listed in the preceding paragraph were far less common among primitive peoples than they are in modern society.<br><br>46. We attribute the social and psychological problems of modern society to the fact that that society requires people to live under conditions radically different from those under which the human race evolved and to behave in ways that conflict with the patterns of behavior that the human race developed while living under the earlier conditions. It is clear from what we have already written that we consider lack of opportunity to properly experience the power process as the most important of the abnormal conditions to which modern society subjects people. But it is not the only one. Before dealing with disruption of the power process as a source of social problems we will discuss some of the other sources.<br><br>47. Among the abnormal conditions present in modern industrial society are excessive density of population, isolation of man from nature, excessive rapidity of social change and the breakdown of natural small-scale communities such as the extended family, the village or the tribe.","filename":"1429021872182","ext":".png","w":624,"h":434,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1490924502662,"time":1490924502,"md5":"U5TlqQSElrbJl225CYNoPQ==","fsize":104975,"resto":118999289,"id":"2g\/ooO\/Z","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119001652,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:44:10","name":"Don&#039;t mind me, just dumping","com":"<a href=\"#p119001392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119001392<\/a><br><br>48. It is well known that crowding increases stress and aggression. The degree of crowding that exists today and the isolation ofman fromnature are consequences of technological progress. All pre-industrial societies were predominantly rural. The Industrial Revolution vastly increased the size of cities and the proportion of the population that lives in them, and modern agricultural technology has made it possible for the Earth to support a far denser population than it ever did before. (Also, technology exacerbates the effects of crowding because it puts increased disruptive powers in people\u2019s hands. For example, a variety of noise-making devices: power mowers, radios, motorcycles, etc. If the use of these devices is unrestricted, people who want peace and quiet are frustrated by the noise. If their use is restricted, people who use the devices are frustrated by the regulations. But if these machines had never been invented there would have been no conflict and no frustration generated by them.)<br><br>49. For primitive societies the natural world (which usually changes only slowly) provided a stable framework and therefore a sense of security. In the modern world it is human society that dominates nature rather than the other way around, and modern society changes very rapidly owing to technological change. Thus there is no stable framework.<br><br>50. The conservatives are fools: They whine about the decay of traditional values, yet they enthusiastically support technological progress and economic growth. Apparently it never occurs to them that you can\u2019t make rapid, drastic changes in the technology and the economy of a society without causing rapid changes in all other aspects of the society as well, and that such rapid changes inevitably break down traditional values.","filename":"1429112221792","ext":".jpg","w":338,"h":273,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1490924650992,"time":1490924650,"md5":"4QMBlSVh8l3bavGpR9W3SQ==","fsize":22687,"resto":118999289,"id":"2g\/ooO\/Z","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119001761,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:45:08","name":"Don&#039;t mind me, just dumping","com":"<a href=\"#p119001652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119001652<\/a><br><br>51. The breakdown of traditional values to some extent implies the breakdown of the bonds that hold together traditional small-scale social groups. The disintegration of small-scale social groups is also promoted by the fact that modern conditions often require or tempt individuals to move to new locations, separating themselves from their communities. Beyond that, a technological society HAS TO weaken family ties and local communities if it is to function efficiently. In modern society an individual\u2019s loyalty must be first to the system and only secondarily to a smallscale community, because if the internal loyalties of small-scale communities were stronger than loyalty to the system, such communities would pursue their own advantage at the expense of the system.<br><br>52. Suppose that a public official or a corporation executive appoints his cousin, his friend or his co-religionist to a position rather than appointing the person best qualified for the job. He has permitted personal loyalty to supersede his loyalty to the system, and that is \u201cnepotism\u201d or \u201cdiscrimination,\u201d both of which are terrible sins in modern society. Would-be industrial societies that have done a poor job of subordinating personal or local loyalties to loyalty to the system are usually very inefficient. (Look at Latin America.) Thus an advanced industrial society can tolerate only those small-scale communities that are emasculated, tamed and made into tools of the system. [7]<br><br>53. Crowding, rapid change and the breakdown of communities have been widely recognized as sources of social problems. But we do not believe tbey are enough to account for the extent of the problems that are seen today.","filename":"1430438926248","ext":".png","w":624,"h":434,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1490924708687,"time":1490924708,"md5":"OFDAdG1nlHV\/QgRg3XVAEQ==","fsize":83637,"resto":118999289,"id":"2g\/ooO\/Z","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118999237,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:23:13","name":"Anonymous","sub":"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

We went to high school together and both went same near Ivy university. She majored in Russian and got a desk job as an intelligence analyst. I saw her a few years ago and asked her about it. Her response was it almost entirely consisted of reading Russian newspapers and making summaries about the daily events. Unsurprisingly, if you want to find out what&#039;s happening in Russia, then consume Russian media.<br><br>Maybe she was lying to me, but I doubt it. She isn&#039;t the type of person who seems duplicitous or conniving. Politically, she&#039;s very blue pilled and strongly supported Hillary. CIA recruitment, at least for analyst positions, appears designed to only get very straight laced people. For example, people who partied in college are disqualified because lie detector tests are used to weed out anyone who has used drugs.<br><br>The best comparison I can think of is that the CIA mostly recruits hall monitors. At least for the people doing the brunt of the intelligence work, their goal is to get bright, but submissive people. You can find plenty of information about Mormons being everywhere in US intelligence agencies and I think it&#039;s because they fit that description so well.","time":1490952298,"resto":119036426,"id":"vbpr+Gbc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119001327,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:41:10","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Trump pupper...","com":"I think Trump should adopt a dog from a shelter instead of spending thousands on some pure bred...

I like syria general, I do. But why is it that all the Syrian refugees turn out to be raving savages in every country they go to. Assad is good for Syria in that he rules with an iron fist and keeps terrorists down and hates Israel. But im pretty sure he is still Muslim and Syria is still full of inbred crazies, so I like Assad too. I don&#039;t have any delusions he is a good guy, but what does that matter, memeing him is fun and seeing him btfo of Isis and the crazies in his own people is great. I also don&#039;t like seeing UN and other internationals project Human Rights onto how he rules when he rules mostly savages. If it truly was in Americas best interests to bomb the shit out Assad how can you not. But I don&#039;t think it is, I think trump made a military strike in a fast and unpredictable manner, in response to a percieved overstepping of bounds, perhaps china took note. And while I wiuld prefer trump go directly after the cia niggers that fund Isis or funnel chemical weapons etc etc. every time Trump has made an action that seems wrong at first the shills pop out screaming drumpf is an actual retard, but in the end he is always vindicated. Wiretapping being the latest.... I mean time and time again. Lewandowski, Manafort, Pence, etc etc. How do you not at the very least give him the benefit of the doubt.","time":1491741727,"resto":120273254,"id":"JuWaHolm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120276641,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)08:21:58","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Happy-go-lucky Jews","com":"Explores the links between Chabad and Trump, Jared, Ivanka and Putin.

Roof, was sentenced today in U.S. District Court in Charleston by Judge Richard M. Gergel.<br><br>Meek faced a standard sentencing range of 27 to 33 months after pleading guilty last April to misprision of a felony and lying to federal investigators.<br><br>He was indicted in September 2015, three months after Roof went on a racially-motivated shooting spree, killing nine people on June 21 at the predominantly black Emanuel AME Church in downtown Charleston.<br><br>The sentencing judge said by not alerting authorities to Roof\u2019s shooting plans, which the two had discussed during drug and alcohol binges in the weeks before the mass killing, Meek exposed the community to \u201cextraordinary\u201d danger.<br><br>\u201cCertainly defendant\u2019s failure to make an earlier report is tragic and deeply regrettable, but his failure to report was not a violation of federal criminal law,\u201d the judge said in an order denying prosecutors attempts to give Meek a longer term, The New York Times reported.<br><br>Meek has sent handwritten letters of apology to the victim\u2019s families, the newspaper reported. He also thinks about his friend\u2019s killing spree everyday and has trouble sleeping. <br><br>\u201cI truly in my heart didn\u2019t take him seriously and I wish I would have,\u201d Meek said at his sentencing hearing, the newspaper reported. \u201cI didn\u2019t believe he could do something so awful and cruel.\u201d<br><br>Last December, Roof was found guilty of 33 charges, including federal hate crimes, for fatally shooting nine people he met on June 17, 2015, at a Bible study session at Charleston\u2019s Emanuel AME Church. Roof hoped that his decision to kill the black worshippers would start a race war.<br><br>Baptized into the world of hate through the Internet, Roof was sentenced by the same jury in January to be executed for his murderous gun rampage.","filename":"joseph_meek2","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":1166,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":145,"tim":1490220860581,"time":1490220860,"md5":"SI4t1VkowUxkdg2+7Gxtlw==","fsize":2257675,"resto":0,"id":"pyDCmYbc","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"joseph-c-joey-meek-jr-22-a-friend-of-convicted","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":117835910,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:08:19","name":"Anonymous","sub":"#prayforlondon Christian + Muslim friendship thread","com":"Hey \/pol\/<br>I just thought today is a day we must put the memes aside and all unite together in solidarity of the tragedy in London. <br>Whether you are Hindu, Christian, Muslim, Jewish or Buddhist you are welcome to show your support for our British friends today.","filename":"tmp_31363-muslim_christian_love_dialogue_by_my_artworks-d4rca971596842646","ext":".jpg","w":586,"h":600,"tn_w":244,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490220499295,"time":1490220499,"md5":"4gesIkyg\/9VTJIMA+1+Cjw==","fsize":57132,"resto":0,"id":"DIgopJHs","country":"CH","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"prayforlondon-christian-muslim-friendship-thread","country_name":"Switzerland","replies":3,"images":1},{"no":117836504,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:12:10","name":"Anonymous","filename":"tmp_31363-prc_341940401285409623","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":274,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1490220730515,"time":1490220730,"md5":"HHhxC6Z3eNtsLKnHvneAjA==","fsize":38068,"resto":117835910,"id":"DIgopJHs","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":117836802,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:14:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117835910\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117835910<\/a><br>Fuck right off with that shit.

I was having an extremely bad couple days, and I was seriously considering having a personal DotR the next day, to put it bluntly. To try to get my mind off that line of thinking, I decided to play some modded Grim Dawn (ironically a game where you start by surviving being hanged). In this mod, the number of classes was bumped up to 30, and (same as the base game) you get to dual-class, so I decided to let an online dice roller I&#039;ve used for \/tg\/ stuff pick what 2 classes I&#039;d mix. I rolled a 1 (Soldier, a base game class), and 30 (Mercenary, one of two modded class slots that are apparently changed by the mod dev on occasion). That alone was a bit odd, but I picked my classes, and then went to see what that somewhat redundant class combo was named. See, when you pick your second class, your class on your stat screen changes to reflect the combo, for example &quot;Necromancer&quot; and &quot;Arch Necromancer&quot; becomes &quot;Demi Lich&quot;. I figured it&#039;d be something like &quot;Weapon Master&quot;, &quot;Man at Arms&quot;, or even a coy reference like &quot;Ultimate Warrior&quot;, but nope... It was &quot;Billy Badass&quot;... And that made me laugh, hard, when laughing was the last thing I ever expected to do again. I spent a good chunk of the rest of the night sperging out and checking the class combos after that, and when I woke up the next morning, Rockefeller was dead, Soros is being investigated, the wiretaps were reconfirmed, and the world seemed a lot brighter. I know a lot of you will call me a fag, and tell me to kms, but I couldn&#039;t let this go untold. I believe with all my heart that Kek saved my life through randomized numbers.","filename":"IMAG0009","ext":".jpg","w":3264,"h":1840,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490219566864,"time":1490219566,"md5":"wSKCKSH\/lP9NDQWxLeWuLg==","fsize":2117726,"resto":0,"id":"GVyPvgUF","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-have-an-experience-to-share-pol-i-think-kek","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":117834121,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:56:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117833483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117833483<\/a><br>weird<br>it&#039;s good you&#039;re okay now though, buddy","time":1490219793,"resto":117833483,"id":"p6zjl3tb","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117836103,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:09:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"we&#039;re all gonna make it bros :^)","time":1490220566,"resto":117833483,"id":"p6zjl3tb","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117836373,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:11:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117834121\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117834121<\/a><br>For once, you ARE my buddy, guy.","time":1490220672,"resto":117833483,"id":"GVyPvgUF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117821395,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)16:36:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"Find a flaw.","filename":"berlin nazi victory","ext":".jpg","w":4076,"h":1896,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":116,"tim":1490215016776,"time":1490215016,"md5":"7lqvijYDWf0PNOH1yn5KgQ==","fsize":1591582,"resto":0,"id":"4qYXN2ns","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"find-a-flaw","country_name":"United States","replies":112,"images":25,"omitted_posts":107,"omitted_images":24,"tail_size":50},{"no":117833808,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:54:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117821395\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117821395<\/a><br>It&#039;s too &quot;industrial&quot;.

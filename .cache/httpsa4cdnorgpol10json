This really says to me that it&#039;s important propaganda that is being pushed by parties with an agenda.","time":1493055985,"resto":122606770,"id":"MNAEIZqj","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122613441,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:46:18","name":"Anonymous","sub":"The Rights winning","com":"They&#039;re backing down.<br><br>Muh poetry reading will bash the fash!","filename":"d937d9329722e7c08f3ed885335e54077367ae85ef3454a03647ddd7f3362f97","ext":".png","w":838,"h":393,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":117,"tim":1493055978207,"time":1493055978,"md5":"as7raWvgMCtUTeR5JEABMg==","fsize":272953,"resto":0,"id":"kVgmUf4Z","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-rights-winning","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122613152,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:44:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Introducing the next first lady of the Fifth republic.","filename":"Emmanuel-et-Brigitte-Macron-leur-couple-ce-sont-eux-qui-en-parlent-le-mieux-!-zapping_exact540x405_l","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":405,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493055846990,"time":1493055846,"md5":"gepugoH\/CfTKxB7qvkXqkg==","fsize":37783,"resto":0,"id":"19WlSjOk","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"introducing-the-next-first-lady-of-the-fifth","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":2,"images":1},{"no":122613368,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:45:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Cutie","filename":"C1f1pMNXEAI3QM8","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493055948901,"time":1493055948,"md5":"YQQtzMJnGDi74XKZ+b+0Rg==","fsize":162135,"resto":122613152,"id":"19WlSjOk","country":"RU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":122613431,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:46:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122613152\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122613152<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Be French<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Make fun of Sweden and Canada<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Elect a bisexual cuck married to a 64 y\/o witch<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Da Fuck?<\/span>","time":1493055974,"resto":122613152,"id":"J95frfUP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122613405,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:46:02","name":"Anonymous","sub":"USA medical is way better than single payer, who owe USA","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YKq<wbr>P5MQzLfs","filename":"statesGDPnew-1","ext":".png","w":959,"h":973,"tn_w":246,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493055962546,"time":1493055962,"md5":"rfU8uAM6pji5cl1Eaac\/Sw==","fsize":69226,"resto":0,"id":"LBWnXVR6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"usa-medical-is-way-better-than-single-payer-who","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122611215,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:28:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"You know this ballot would win if these two ran against Trump right?","filename":"tmp_25065-1493003549201m28806765","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493054914826,"time":1493054914,"md5":"va14+eiGvnbVvyRnIvijXQ==","fsize":132935,"resto":0,"id":"zeusFKxx","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-know-this-ballot-would-win-if-these-two-ran","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1},{"no":122611334,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:29:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Only the Hillary voters would vote for that, so it would be a repeat of 2016","time":1493054975,"resto":122611215,"id":"j6YFWfJL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122613396,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:45:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122611215\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122611215<\/a><br>Dwayne the rock Johnson and John Cena 2020","filename":"download-30","ext":".jpg","w":311,"h":162,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1493055959539,"time":1493055959,"md5":"vOCYiGlz4PGxDkiZfUpjsg==","fsize":8203,"resto":122611215,"id":"NFrdm2Mn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122612691,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:40:18","name":"Anonymous","sub":"BOOK THREAD FAGGOTS","com":"What&#039;s \/pol\/ reading right now? <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic related<\/span><br><br>I&#039;m very ignorant on middle eastern history, so i picked this up.

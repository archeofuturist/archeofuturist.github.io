It happens everyday and the ape is exposed (among some more than others, because some are better at daydreaming under more circumstances. Some barely daydream at all).<br><br>Take &#039;global terrorism&#039; for example. Its not about religion. It was a technological inevitability that the majority of humanity was going to fall behind others and then once they had access to technology, they would use it to aggres upon those who have, just like it is inevitable that those who have would have to simultaneously defend while advancing themselves.<br><br>Perhaps you are confusing the narratives with reality. Hope this was at all helpful. Do what you like and feel is natural and you will be fine.

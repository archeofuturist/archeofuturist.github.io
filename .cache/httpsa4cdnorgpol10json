Moab, and its people, the Moabites, had entered a war of the Israelites - the contemporary Jews. Though we find that Israel had friendly relationships with Moab, that soon ended forever. The Israelites went to war with Moab. The war ended with a decisive Israelite victory, and Moab became a tributary of Israel. <br><br>What was Moab is now Jordan, which shares a border with Syria.

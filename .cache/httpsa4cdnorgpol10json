Maybe you should shut the fuck up before you make retarded threads like that. You know why? Because you&#039;re going to be embarrassed when Le Pens wins and someone bumps this topic. Oh look at that, Le Pen is now leading in the national polls, just like Macron did. Are you a fucking drunk? Are you retarded? Are you autistic? You guys are fucking idiots and you should never make such topics on this board again and I&#039;m fucking serious. I almost have a feeling it&#039;s the only one guy making all these anti-Le Pen topics because you&#039;re a faggot hater who doesn&#039;t like her because they&#039;re good. Fuck you, be good at something in YOUR life and then maybe try to troll these saviors on the board, like I give a fuck. It&#039;s so easy to spot out these threads now, bunch of retards. Always doing stupid shit like this. Why don&#039;t you guys try to be a good poster? Just for once? For once in your fucking life try not to make topics like this. That&#039;s just you, you&#039;re always right at getting it wrong. Fuck you. You are nothing.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493052902276,"time":1493052902,"md5":"ITODGUMhdTJW+qDrJcj6IA==","fsize":40921,"resto":0,"id":"P0oxGunf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-sick-of-you-french-surrender-monkeys","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122607251,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)12:55:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Identifying, Bill Nye?

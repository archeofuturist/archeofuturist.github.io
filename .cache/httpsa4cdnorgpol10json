Literally a sect of narcissists and very annoying dealing with them. This thread is proof.<br>There are plenty of shops where you can buy gym drugs in Spain, so I&#039;d say the problem is bigger than it seems. Usually gyms stay away from doing that business themselves (selling the complements) because it&#039;s a good way to scare all the normies and get the police knocking at your door.<br>In general, outside those &quot;sects&quot;, it&#039;s frowned upon. No physiotherapist worth a dime would recommend such products outside of professional high performance circuits.","time":1492211208,"resto":121097013,"id":"n8tZL59j","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":121131288,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:23:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121098673\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121098673<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;me<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that gay shit<\/span>","time":1492212210,"resto":121097013,"id":"QXFvDUv7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121134229,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:47:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121113117\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121113117<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;10\/10<\/span><br>By which you mean you&#039;re exactly 10 pounds heavier than him?","time":1492213673,"resto":121097013,"id":"\/mh2tde0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

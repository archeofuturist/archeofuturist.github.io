Alt-right speakers turn against Trump, out of either desire for money, or else under threat from Democrats. Alex Jones proved this, when he denied Donald Trump three times before the shills crowed. These speakers do not have our interests at heart. A poll said that a maximum of 2% of Trump supporters say they regret voting for him, and this has a possible deviation of up to 3.5%, meaning it is possible that no one is mad at him. This proves that the Fakebase is trying to plant seeds of rebellion amongst us, against Trump. The widespread Democrat support after Trump did this proves this further. Trump won&#039;t speak of this because he doesn&#039;t think he has his real base. Consider the difference of him laying out ObamaGate vs. now. He&#039;s afraid he&#039;s lost his base, and that any attempts to explain himself would make him lose it further. We must not fall for Democrat and Fakebase tactics.

That poor nations are poor because of bad trade deals like the TPP, the Restrictions on their own industries, red tape procedures, and local economies being based off of foreign goods.

I used to be a liberal cuck in high school, but ive been drifting right. The professor said I was racist because I said &quot;for the sake of discussion, we will not discuss historical factors like colonization, but rather modern things affecting poorer nations.&quot; Is that racist? If thinking that countries are being held back because of inept bureaucrats and backwards ideologies is racist, am I racist \/pol\/?

Chemical Forces General Ochsner reported to German command in June 1942 that a chemical unit had taken part in the battle.[40] After the battle in mid-May 1942, roughly 3,000 Red Army soldiers and Soviet civilians not evacuated by sea were besieged in a series of caves and tunnels in the nearby Adzhimuskai quarry. After holding out for approximately three months, &quot;poison gas was released into the tunnels, killing all but a few score of the Soviet defenders.&quot;[41] Thousands of those killed around Adzhimushk were documented to have been killed by asphyxiation from gas.[40]<\/span><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chemi<wbr>cal_warfare#Nazi_Germany","filename":"bigstock-thoughtful-man-question-mark","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":572,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":158,"tim":1491994196006,"time":1491994196,"md5":"voqhErHk\/hu7SJRn1TfLCw==","fsize":255980,"resto":0,"id":"Xds1fnk4","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-nazis-did-use-chemical-weapons-in-combat-on","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":120743591,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:09:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120742308\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120742308<\/a><br>just orwelled history by CIA homos..

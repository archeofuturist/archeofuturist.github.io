Donald blumpf was on the cover of one of the magazines in the stand, and zhe pointed to the magazine and exclaimed &quot;look at that orange bafoon, he flips on issues more than a fry cook! Let them in!&quot;. Immediately everyone started clapping and cheering, tipped me and my wife&#039;s son, and the cashier even paid for my groceries and zhe&#039;s hormone therapy! <br><br>#neverbeenprouder","time":1493496027,"resto":123370701,"id":"vET3wQzE","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123373758,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)16:00:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123370701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123370701<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;my nephew started crying when I told him that trump would rape and kill his family<\/span>","time":1493496028,"resto":123370701,"id":"jPi\/c1Ls","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123373897,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)16:01:29","name":"SAGE","com":"WOW HEY SHILLS, DO YOU JERK EACH OTHER OFF AND THEN BATHE IN EACH OTHERS SHIT?<br><br>SAGE","time":1493496089,"resto":123370701,"id":"WTrqf\/1h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123373938,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)16:01:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;le genius 8-year old meme<\/span>","filename":"4HgSpk3","ext":".jpg","w":598,"h":792,"tn_w":94,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493496109564,"time":1493496109,"md5":"qUB6H3voDSVd6aQuci0Q4A==","fsize":235718,"resto":123370701,"id":"lzIoYV5M","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123356596,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)13:34:51","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Wife&#039;s talking husbands last name after marriage?","com":"Hi \/Pol\/ I was having a conversation with a friend of mine the other day and was wondering your opinions on the matter<br><br>With Feminism being so extreme nowadays do you think the practice of wives taking the husbands last name after marriage will deteriorate as feminists may see it as oppressive or sexist that the mans name being taken?<br><br>What are your thoughts? would it bother you if your wife wouldn&#039;t take your last name after marriage?","filename":"Last name","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493487291741,"time":1493487291,"md5":"SlmR83uLkbgTThl7dN2mFA==","fsize":71447,"resto":0,"id":"qJVF4uY6","country":"IE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wifes-talking-husbands-last-name-after-marriage","country_name":"Ireland","replies":100,"images":13,"omitted_posts":95,"omitted_images":12,"tail_size":50},{"no":123372640,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)15:51:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123356596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123356596<\/a><br>Honestly, this is one area of feminism where I think they sort of have half a point. From a simple practical perspective I can see why a woman wouldn&#039;t want to be bothered with going through the hassle of changing her name, and I don&#039;t think it reflects badly on the man if she keeps her name and he keeps his (although men who take their wife&#039;s surname should neck themselves).<br><br>Still, as an ideological thing it&#039;s kind of stupid to try striking a blow against the PATRIarchy by keeping the name you inherit from your FATHER.<br><br>This flips on its head when children become involved though.

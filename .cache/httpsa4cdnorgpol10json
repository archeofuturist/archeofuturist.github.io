They were behind many of the viral photos\/videos that the MSM has tried to push to get people against Assad. The kikes in Hollywood just gave an Oscar to this propaganda film about them. An organization of Swedish doctors have gone after them after watching their videos and noticing they are not performing any standard medical procedures and appear to be harming and even killing the people they&#039;re supposed to be saving.

This unpleasant truth has been solidifying for quite some time, but only now does it become truly tangible enough to be grasped by the average person. Very soon the average American will wake up and realize that he is not a Citizen in his Republic, but a Denizen in a faltering Empire being run by the confused old man who tottered his way over to putting the final few nails in the Republic&#039;s coffin. He lacks the privileges in a court of law that the Citizen can afford, a mitigation of financial responsibility and a segregation of assets between fictitious persons for legal purposes. He lacks the contacts and finances to pay to play in his state, which he thought for the people and by the people. He lacks even the educational standing to recognize what has happened, though he can sense that something is amiss.<br><br>I have to say that while a lot of people knew it was coming in one form or another, nobody quite saw it going down like this. Rome&#039;s Republic rotted until Caesar seized power, was murdered, and then in turn his murderers were murdered by his heir. The American Republic though, it falls to an upjumped used car salesman acting as the catspaw of a Russian autocrat. No one in history will remember this as a play of great men facing tragedy, it will instead be remembered as something of a joke and in a few hundred years people will laugh about it as a witty anti-republican quip when the idea of elective representation is brought up.<br><br>Well, ave imperium.

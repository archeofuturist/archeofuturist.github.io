The anti-Trump director was targeting Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan when he referred to the young women who beat cancer during their childhood as &quot;Not a 10.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ryan apparently caught the eye of Whedon on Thursday, when the speaker posted a photo of the meeting he and the young girls had in Washington. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Advocacy is not limited to adults. These Wisconsin teens shared some powerful stories with me about their fight against childhood cancer,&quot; wrote Ryan. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The teens lending their hands to fight against childhood cancer belong to One Step Camp, which offers &quot;camp experiences and other programs throughout the year that allow children with cancer to just be kids. Our programs offer fun, friendship and support in a safe and nurturing environment,&quot; according to the camp&#039;s official website. &quot;Through the magic of childhood experiences, we help kids diagnosed with cancer reclaim their lives.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Soon after the despicable post, Whelen was hit with condemnation from both sides of the aisle.

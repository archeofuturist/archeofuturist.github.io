Colloids such as jello or glue are readily explicable: colloidal Jews have a weakness for jello and similar squishy, greasy foods; the super-Jew content (see below) of such snacks is exceedingly high, so they themselves soon end up pretty fat and<br>squishy, too.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gravity<\/span><br>Jews throw minute ropes (see string theory), invisible to the goy eye, to the ground. These ropes attach to unseen hooks that enable muscle-toned Jews to pull themselves towards terra firma. There is minimal gravity far from planetary bodies (i.e. in space) because no known Jews have access to cables of sufficient length. All bodies experience gravitational attraction to each other quite simply because Jews are, to put it mildly, sociable creatures who practically invented what they like to call the Communist Party. Jew all-nighters are where gravity waves meet Mexican waves.","filename":"A Bomb","ext":".gif","w":672,"h":864,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492745246759,"time":1492745246,"md5":"gvFi0B1j\/hAskH3NyuZq6Q==","fsize":26669,"resto":122088928,"id":"r1\/eiI7T","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122089543,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)23:30:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122088928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122088928<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122089176\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122089176<\/a><br>So THAT&#039;S why I failed out of physics and became a NEET faggot.

Potential energy is when Jews don&#039;t want to be separated (see Gravity). Kinetic energy is the movement of Jews. Energy is always conserved so fundamental Jews (Haredis) are only ever transferred and never made or destroyed. Energy caused by nuclear fission is when you make a hyper-Jew very angry, and when it gets angry enough it explodes, causing an enormous explosion. But Jews are very amiable creatures, so this never happens. Nuclear energy is a lie.","filename":"bigjoe3","ext":".png","w":552,"h":429,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":97,"tim":1492745508842,"time":1492745508,"md5":"zYHQXNS3cG3GAOCryuahnw==","fsize":343328,"resto":122088928,"id":"r1\/eiI7T","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122090469,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)23:38:11","name":"Physics, The Truth","com":"<a href=\"#p122089678\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122089678<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pressure<\/span><br>Pressure is simply the Jew density per given cubic unit.

Mental illness of any kind basically excludes you from service, so how the fuck can someone with ADHD be turned away while a guy who feels the need to remove his penis surgically in order to not kill himself be admitted with open arms? And be given a weapon on top of that. It&#039;s already like walking on eggshells with the PC police infesting the ranks, destroying careers thanks to snowflakes who can&#039;t handle banter. We need private citizens to point out these issues and put a fire under congressional asses to do something about this, or we&#039;re going to be left with nothing but a bunch of literally neutered nutcases and uniformed politicians to defend western civilization from the religion of peace and other undesirables.

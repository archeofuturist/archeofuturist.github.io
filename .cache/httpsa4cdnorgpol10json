Hero","com":"A greenie leb poof University of Melbourne lawyer professor and asylum seeker advocate was teaching a class on immigration policy.<br>&quot;Before the class begins, you must get on your knees and worship asylum seekers and accept that they are honest and legal refugees and the most dinkum Aussies that the world has ever known, even greater than the Anzacs.&quot;<br>At this moment, a brave, true blue, anti-immigration SASR Digger who had been on 1500 overseas deployments and understood the joy of war and fully supported all military decision made by the Commonwealth stood up and held up a uranium rock.<br>&quot;Who owns this uranium?&quot;<br>The arrogant professor smirked quite wogishly and smugly replied &quot;The traditional Aboriginal land owners, you stupid Australian&quot;<br>&quot;Wrong. It&#039;s been 240 years since Captain Cook claimed it for Great Britain, If it was owned by Abos, and asylum seekers are, as you say, legal refugees... then the Noongah tribe would be a nuclear power and our Immigration Detention Centres wouldn&#039;t be fuller than a state school now.&quot;<br>The professor was visibly shaken and dropped his copy of &quot;Fighting for the Republic&quot; by Malcolm Turnbull. He stormed out of the room, his eyes full of those unAustralian tears.<br>The students applauded and became KAP members that day. A slouch hat named &quot;Mateship&quot; blew into the room and fell atop the Australian flag. He reminded the students of the necessity of strong Industrial Relations law and encouraged them all get a southern cross tattoo. Waltzing Matilda and Khe Sanh were sung several times, and Albert Jacka&#039;s ghost appeared and re-enacted the White Australia Policy across the country. Billy Hughes watched all of this with great joy, smiling from the heavens.<br>The professor was fired and mysteriously lost his life that year and the coroner found that he died from chronic unAustralianism. The uni used the money saved from his pay to demolish the School of Indigenous Studies building and erect a statue of the Anzac in its place.","filename":"ab","ext":".jpg","w":223,"h":246,"tn_w":223,"tn_h":246,"tim":1490702317257,"time":1490702317,"md5":"8oKdsDAPabuFqCwLv8SgxA==","fsize":4628,"resto":0,"id":"r4I95dkk","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"australian-hero","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118641592,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)07:58:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"SHILLS!","filename":"goynammu","ext":".png","w":1017,"h":697,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":171,"tim":1490702294181,"time":1490702294,"md5":"QgIDEh7YmXZnpxW0nISpdg==","fsize":1370904,"resto":0,"id":"xiqflhyI","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"shills","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0}]}]}

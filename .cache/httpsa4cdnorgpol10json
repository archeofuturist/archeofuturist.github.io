Stock market is over valued, demographics are fucking up (thanks baby boomers) and output will decrease due to the rise of socialism\/communism in the west. What many people don&#039;t know is that Africa was able to support an explosion in it&#039;s population solely from the subsidies and charities of the west. Once the west starts falling apart the shipments will stop and the hundreds of millions of Africans will either starve or move onto better places. AKA Europe. Illuminati understand that this would basically drown the European continent so they are slowly shifting the predominant ideology to be right wing and totalitarian. This way they will be able to effectively make a second iron curtain across the Mediterranean. But how can they do that with na\u00efve liberals (which they also created) still in power? Easy, bring in a small portion of the worthless savages, let them rape and kill a few innocent people here and there and boil the nationalist and ethnic pride\/hatred of the European people. This will in the process also exterminate the 3rd worlders already in Europe and conveniently place utter tyranny on the European population effectively hitting two birds with one stone.","filename":"community_image_1426902802","ext":".png","w":500,"h":566,"tn_w":220,"tn_h":249,"tim":1493079965568,"time":1493079965,"md5":"v8SRfqMz\/11DAtOsVeCepA==","fsize":175630,"resto":0,"id":"6aDAATpT","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"heres-a-thought","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":122664353,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)20:33:37","name":"k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a","com":"<a href=\"#p122663328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122663328<\/a>","filename":"15095736","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":280,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493080417646,"time":1493080417,"md5":"BEybermZgSXccWP+RvRTPA==","fsize":758890,"resto":122663328,"id":"Ig2FhpBb","country":"GB","trip":"!!8ulOY0Lj8qr","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122663277,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)20:25:43","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Free speech rally in Boston","com":"All ethnic Kekisanis in the Boston area should join us to aid in the destruction of the Antifa","filename":"FullSizeRender","ext":".jpg","w":381,"h":492,"tn_w":193,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493079943328,"time":1493079943,"md5":"V5XcqXxEjkXI4yS2ppguvA==","fsize":46655,"resto":0,"id":"APXeD2D8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"free-speech-rally-in-boston","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122657477,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)19:39:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is \/pol\/ planning on getting married?","filename":"marriage","ext":".png","w":1198,"h":1288,"tn_w":232,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493077178446,"time":1493077178,"md5":"jsp4O\/O6XzJRvOrXOfKZGQ==","fsize":1018608,"resto":0,"id":"YtWneFec","country":"AR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-pol-planning-on-getting-married","country_name":"Argentina","replies":29,"images":6,"omitted_posts":24,"omitted_images":5},{"no":122661865,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)20:14:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122659857\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122659857<\/a><br>hasn&#039;t your government somehow made paternity tests illegal?","time":1493079276,"resto":122657477,"id":"F4i2zkKd","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":122662324,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)20:18:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122659242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122659242<\/a><br><br>one of the more rowdy black kids at my school studied real hard his last 2 years of high school and is now finishing his internship at one of swedens top law firms.<br><br>Another one is in and out of jail though, so.","time":1493079489,"resto":122657477,"id":"1+6Kdsej","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122662649,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)20:20:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122658798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122658798<\/a><br>and why not both","filename":"1427858623569","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493079640378,"time":1493079640,"md5":"3TNS4hweHHEjNYX2AKwddA==","fsize":107451,"resto":122657477,"id":"vfRj+la\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122662710,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)20:21:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122659242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122659242<\/a><br>Black skin isn&#039;t enough, you have to be an ooga booga dipshit thug nigger.

SNL, Stephen Colbert, Samantha Bee, John Oliver, even Conan Obrian have been funnier than ever. Good old CNN is now extremely entertaining to watch (always though it was boring). My more right leaning friends are embarrassed and think Republican representatives are kind of jokes as well. I thank Trump voters for making yourselves the brunt of endless jokes. I thank my president Donald Trump for damaging the Republican party. It is so nice that the Obama hate has stopped. It&#039;s nice to watch those who said they could do better fall flat I their faces. Lastly I&#039;d like to thank \/pol I can read exerps from here to friends for easy laughs.

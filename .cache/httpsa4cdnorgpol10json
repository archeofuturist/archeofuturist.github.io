We need to actively attempt to sentationalize this, like we successfully did with so many things during the campaign until CNN and MSNBC can&#039;t help but to take it seriously. We need to push this so far down the throats of normies that they&#039;re calling for apologies from the media for their blatant attempts to kill this story. <br>Right now, they&#039;re trying to dismiss it and ignore it until it goes away like they successfully did with the debate questions scandal so the only thig we can do is stay as outraged as we are now until they concede. They expect us to burn out and forget it but we can&#039;t. We need make Susan Rice General threads to inform and update, need to make jokes outlining the media&#039;s lies and need to make Rice meme creation threads to make something digest-able for normies. This is the biggest political scandal in a decade and CNN is effectively telling the people it&#039;s nuffin by ignoring it. If you&#039;re typically a lurker like me and you never make threads, then go out of your comfort zone for something important and take the 2 minutes it takes to contribute to the place that&#039;s given you so much entertainment. <br>Right now they&#039;re trying to blow up the Seychelles\/Blackwater unverified nonsense to distract us and put us on the defensive when we should be hammering this story into the skulls of every American.<br><br>Don&#039;t let them distract from it. Don&#039;t let them ignore it. Don&#039;t let them down play it. Don&#039;t let them escape from it.","filename":"Rice","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":355,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":138,"tim":1491344177800,"time":1491344177,"md5":"QmqOVq9bTfF9fioDqAgLag==","fsize":93553,"resto":0,"id":"Ad4w8QVI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"rice-general","country_name":"United States","replies":277,"images":66,"omitted_posts":272,"omitted_images":63,"tail_size":50},{"no":119583594,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)04:06:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119541960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119541960<\/a><br>Fox is becoming much more popular now, especially among boomer Trump supporters.

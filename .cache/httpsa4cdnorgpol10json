You folks don&#039;t seem to understand the difference between gender and sex. I&#039;ll break it down for you! Sex is your parts (usually incorrectly described in binaries). Gender is harder to explain. Like, you pop out of your mom&#039;s womb, doctor slaps your ass and says &quot;it&#039;s a boy\/girl!&quot; and if the doctor says you&#039;re a boy, and you agree then your gender is boy. If the doctor says you&#039;re a boy and you go &quot;nah, I feel more like a girl,&quot; your gender is girl. Basically, gender isn&#039;t biological and is more of a way to categorize people (also usually in binaries) even if they don&#039;t want to be categorized that way.<br><br>I&#039;m agender (I don&#039;t identify as either male or female) so if you have any non-invasive, non-gross questions go ahead and ask.","filename":"7b4b4006-9773-47f8-90cc-14b849ff1b68","ext":".png","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493393541836,"time":1493393541,"md5":"2soc+99jbo6ywqlGqCOl7A==","fsize":1661,"resto":0,"id":"7s8ubgji","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-pol-there-seems-to-be-confusion-over-here-you","country_name":"United States","replies":48,"images":10,"omitted_posts":43,"omitted_images":10},{"no":123213434,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:37:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;so if you agree with your doctor? <\/span><br><br>So your feelings override reality? <br>&quot;I feel like a girl so I am a girl&quot; <br><br>Your emotions change nothing.

It is sufficient to see the number of likes on YouTube this year to understand that fans are happy to see the Nazi army as bad guys killed. The evening of April 26, 2017 was also an opportunity for developers to take the floor to explain the whole process of development, but also to present the players who have been chosen in the game. In 2013, Sledgehammer Games had chosen Kevin Spacey to play Jonathan Irons, the great Machiavellian villain; This year, the studio appealed to less well-known actors but that moviegoers will recognize without penalty.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;There is indeed Josh Duhamel who will embody the Sergeant William Pierson, described by the actor as being a man who thinks of his mission before his men. An &quot;asshole&quot; in bulk but which play a major role in the single player campaign. Less known, Jonathan Tucker (Virgin Suicides, in the Valley of lah) takes on the role of the soldier Robert Zussman, while Jeffrey Pierce will play lieutenant Joseph Turner. On the German side, we can tell you that among the Nazi SS, we find Robert Knepper (T - Bag in Prison Break, Hitman, the transporter 3) which will have an important role in the game. Information that has not been communicated by Activision and Sledgehammer Games, but we still confirm for seeing him in artwork at our reveal in London on April 21.&quot;<\/span><br><br>Hyped!!!!!","filename":"IMG_0867","ext":".png","w":630,"h":945,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493396736719,"time":1493396736,"md5":"+a\/4Fjv1GqJLKEXWkeqXfA==","fsize":1149604,"resto":0,"id":"VOwQmXwV","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"robert-knepper-will-play-the-german-ss-officer-in","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":1,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":1},{"no":123213673,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:39:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123212037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123212037<\/a>","filename":"download (20)","ext":".jpg","w":281,"h":179,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":79,"tim":1493397593273,"time":1493397593,"md5":"ekDdudWcPZCLCvJOX5MtRw==","fsize":5086,"resto":123212037,"id":"hSztkz5e","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":123213819,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:41:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123212037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123212037<\/a><br>How did he contract AIDS?","time":1493397674,"resto":123212037,"id":"j\/0ekRBR","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123213826,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:41:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123212037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123212037<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Brown eyes<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;German SS officer<\/span>","time":1493397678,"resto":123212037,"id":"br4gA+dd","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123213841,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:41:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/strawpoll.com\/xxecz49","time":1493397692,"resto":123212037,"id":"VOwQmXwV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123213876,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:41:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123213826\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123213826<\/a><br>I meant the his voice","time":1493397709,"resto":123212037,"id":"VOwQmXwV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123213451,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:37:58","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Essential New Right Reading Thread","com":"Pic related","filename":"1492879419568","ext":".jpg","w":3672,"h":3024,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":205,"tim":1493397478236,"time":1493397478,"md5":"LGriHjXBTzX4js82DaQq8w==","fsize":4036782,"resto":0,"id":"2Ltkn3Nd","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"essential-new-right-reading-thread","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":2,"images":1},{"no":123213787,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:40:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123213451\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123213451<\/a><br>give me the bog pill reading list.","time":1493397659,"resto":123213451,"id":"NLgviTuc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123214708,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:49:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"Might I also recommend reading some Adorno.

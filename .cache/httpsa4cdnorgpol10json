In 1956 Soviet leader Joseph Stalin\u2019s crimes were revealed and in the 1970s the violent aspects of Chairman Mao\u2019s dictatorship became more widely known, resulting in many people losing their faith in \u201ccommunism.\u201d Nonetheless, whether in Europe or globally, communism was more than these dictatorships, and we need to allow for complexity and contradictions when we study its history. Many millions of women and men gave their lives in the struggles to establish or defend socialist or communist states. These states provided their male and female citizens with legal, social and economic rights and security that many people are lacking nowadays. For millions of people around the world, the Soviet Union was a land of hope. The Soviet Union had achieved impressive economic growth by the 1950s, it promoted women\u2019s emancipation, anti-racism and anti-colonialism, and supported progressive movements worldwide. An understanding of either the Soviet Union or China as one-dimensional totalitarian and patriarchal states cannot explain their achievements in promulgating and implementing women\u2019s rights nor does it allow us to even begin to understand where their \u201cwomen-friendly\u201d legislation and policies came from. In addition, in Asia, Latin America and Africa, the USA waged military and economic campaigns against (alleged) communism.","filename":"12783903_1566097193704259_1592729455_n","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1350,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491335191966,"time":1491335191,"md5":"rg1oqj94BEQFwepj9jM+MQ==","fsize":127088,"resto":0,"id":"x6c+Q2RJ","country":"AR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mainstream-narratives-about-communism-in-europe","country_name":"Argentina","replies":23,"images":8,"omitted_posts":18,"omitted_images":7},{"no":119510022,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:11:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119507218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119507218<\/a><br>Both systems seem to have the chosen people at their reins!","time":1491336708,"resto":119507218,"id":"ZDM1hTo4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119511483,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:25:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119507218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119507218<\/a><br>Shut the fuck up you upper class shitstain, I worked with criminals, drug dealers, drug makers, carjackers, deadbeat dads, violent thugs, thieves, women abusers, drunkards and thieves, but there is no bigger scum than a communist.<br><br>85 percent of population in my country was stealing during communist regime, everything we could get our hands on.<br><br>When your economical shit failed due to being utter drivel without any basis in reality, you just switched to gender and race and continue to spread the cancer to bring more ruin, because that is all that a communist do - ruin.<br>Communists don&#039;t create they just destroy, they even say so in their pathetic rhetoric - they don&#039;t create means of production, they just &#039;seize&#039; it.<br><br>Absolute irredeemable vermin and that whore you are posting would be a recipient of a steel tipped boot to the face if xe came here.","time":1491337510,"resto":119507218,"id":"kk427CaP","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":119511961,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:29:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119509999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119509999<\/a><br>Checked","filename":"1485766752809","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491337773273,"time":1491337773,"md5":"7wp6BVya67\/TnteF+sXWZQ==","fsize":55117,"resto":119507218,"id":"wbvh5Lf0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119514172,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:47:34","name":"Anonymous","filename":"14294800_1708117696180353_1412470704_n","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":750,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491338854050,"time":1491338854,"md5":"PRCYmIivLgR5SVCWcfyU8g==","fsize":68358,"resto":119507218,"id":"x6c+Q2RJ","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":119516649,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:08:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119507218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119507218<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mainstream narratives about communism in Europe or China depict it as oppressive, gloomy, and a failure.<\/span><br><br>The people who lived through it depicted it that way as well<br><br>Go away you dirty communist<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/3B0joNsmWUQ<br><br>Shh what&#039;s that sound<br><br>Better run commienigger","time":1491340119,"resto":119507218,"id":"Bet3jlCu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119505826,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:34:46","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Labour MP claims it&#039;s &#039;highly probable&#039; Russia interfered with Brexit","com":"Is there anything that Russia isn&#039;t meddling with?<br><br>It seems more and more like Russia is leading a soft coup of every major nation on the planet.

The worst part is the flags that play up to their stereotypes, like Canadians making abhorrent posts. I don&#039;t know if you unironically thought they made the community better or not but quite frankly I thought they were a one time meme addition as a joke. If you really want to include flags then have a drop down menu of selectable ideological flags, like it used to be.<br><br>Increase post timers. This one&#039;s a no brainer. Again, I thought it was a one time joke but you kept it, you literally gave spammers the tools to shit the board up and then are surprised when they do it. Along with this, make sure someone can only have one, maybe two active threads at a time. This will slow down the people spamming BLACKED threads.<br><br>Legitimize generals. The best threads on \/pol\/ right now are brit\/pol\/ and \/sg\/, and this is largely because they have both a sense of community and don&#039;t have flagposters baiting for (You)s. The best thing you could do is increase the post limit for these, to 700, like \/vg\/.

Those sanctions only served to push Japan to war.<br><br>Take for instance China. We trade with China. If we put sanctions on China, China would probably be more aggressive towards us and probably start a war. <br><br>Now, this is clearly a hypothetical, but I think its important to take from history what exactly is going on right now. It seems to me that the U.S. is pushing for a possible nuclear war and is being rather cavalier about it... As if, to build up support to use nukes without the natural horror involved with such an action. Now, perhaps nukes will protect the rare earth from being mined immediately in N.

The father supports the wife and kids, the wife does work the father doesn&#039;t, work that wouldn&#039;t pay as much as the father&#039;s job (i.e. maid-work, nanny, cook, tutor) but is still valued nonetheless. The children don&#039;t contribute anything, at least in the early years, yet the entire purpose of the father and mother is to raise the children properly. <br>Communism\/socialism is similar in some ways, but it attempts to treat the ENTIRE WORLD as one&#039;s family, instead of your biological\/racial family, which is why it doesn&#039;t work. People are genetically designed (and rightly so) to care more about people similar to them than to people dissimilar to them. People care about their immediate family before they care about their extended family. About their extended family before they care about their neighbor with the same ethnic\/racial background. About their neighbor more than they care about a stranger living on the other side of town. About a stranger living on the other side of town with same racial background before someone living in a completely different country. Etc. <br>Communism works backwards: they care more about people completely dissimilar first, and last and least care about your immediate family member. It is why communism fails to induce people to work, or to put forth quality in their work, because the fruits of their labor are NEVER seen by those the worker loves and cares for most. It is always some random, dissimilar stranger that receives the benefit, and feels no love for receiving said benefit.<br>National socialism is the macrocosm of the family, in that it is essentially a banding together of thousands\/millions of families with similar ethnic\/racial background. It is the best form of gov&#039;t, just like having a traditional family is better than having a modern &quot;family&quot; where no one cares about each other, let alone about complete strangers.","time":1492659020,"resto":121940413,"id":"NLf8hamo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121945797,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)23:33:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121940413\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121940413<\/a><br>Oh socialism, a single word that describes 75% of the political spectrum.

Nearly all western thought since the last war, certainly all &quot;progressive&quot; thought, has assumed tacitly that human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security, and avoidance of pain. In such a view of life there is no room, for instance, for patriotism and the military virtues. The Socialist who finds his children playing with soldiers is usually upset, but he is never able to think of a substitute for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won\u2019t do. Hitler, because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional strength, knows that human beings don\u2019t only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not to mention drums, flag and loyalty-parades. However they may be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of life. The same is probably true of Stalin\u2019s militarised version of Socialism. All three of the great dictators have enhanced their power by imposing intolerable burdens on their peoples. Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a grudging way, have said to people &quot;I offer you a good time,&quot; Hitler has said to them &quot;I offer you struggle, danger and death,&quot; and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his feet. <br><br>--George Orwell","filename":"3706","ext":".jpg","w":179,"h":266,"tn_w":168,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492177945713,"time":1492177945,"md5":"bI3OesaMOlURs6dBpYDtKw==","fsize":19264,"resto":0,"id":"zN5Hzpx8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"thoughts-on-this-quote","country_name":"United States","replies":97,"images":15,"omitted_posts":92,"omitted_images":13},{"no":121089656,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:53:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Best and worst days of my life were at war.","time":1492192407,"resto":121062088,"id":"1P7uAr7y","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121090107,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:57:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121089656\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121089656<\/a><br>care to expand on that?<br><br>which war? have any stories?","time":1492192631,"resto":121062088,"id":"OTllyp7I","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121090303,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:58:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121062088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121062088<\/a><br>Perfect quote","filename":"1490704145152","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492192726656,"time":1492192726,"md5":"TACTxE8u3Dod6GYKHUImog==","fsize":168648,"resto":121062088,"id":"JOxvdjiJ","country":"BG","m_img":1,"country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":121090382,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:59:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121089023\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121089023<\/a><br>\/leftypol\/ can leave","time":1492192766,"resto":121062088,"id":"JOxvdjiJ","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":121091971,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:13:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121089023\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121089023<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;<\/span>","time":1492193587,"resto":121062088,"id":"Txf4SvHT","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121059766,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:26:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"REDNECKS GET IN !<br><br>So i&#039;m a nonwhite from the east.

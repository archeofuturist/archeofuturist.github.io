Putnam conducted a nearly decade long study on how diversity affects social trust.[91] He surveyed 26,200 people in 40 American communities, finding that when the data were adjusted for class, income and other factors, the more racially diverse a community is, the greater the loss of trust. People in diverse communities &quot;don&#039;t trust the local mayor, they don&#039;t trust the local paper, they don&#039;t trust other people and they don&#039;t trust institutions,&quot; writes Putnam.[92] In the presence of such ethnic diversity, Putnam maintains that<br><br>[W]e hunker down.

For example, the degree of ethnic homogeneity correlates with the government&#039;s share of gross domestic product as well as the average wealth of citizens. Case studies of the United States ... find that multi-ethnic societies are less charitable and less able to cooperate to develop public infrastructure. ...

Alex Jones pushing the narrative that Sandyhook was staged is one of the most frightening stories to enter the main stream. That&#039;s one of many.

I don&#039;t think these outlets are all are this way and I&#039;m not trying to blanket them all of them in this category, just to be clear. I believe there is are some shades of truth to what they are saying in some cases. We&#039;re at a place in history where the scholars and scientists are being pushed aside by brutes who lack the intellect, curiosity, and inability to listen to scientific facts or remember history. This administration and it&#039;s toxicity will continue to pollute and erode this democracy, paralleled is this erosion are the irreparable effects it will have on the environment. Now that the EPA has been gutted and Obama era regulations have been rolled back. So, you think he&#039;ll bring us peace and prosperity?

My suggestion to you, if you haven&#039;t already been doing so, is to really get a well rounded appetite of information and facts as they come in, be at the alt right, be at the radical left and everything in between.

Do not dress in black. tactical mistake. That is the garb of communists. Wear whatever you can protest in comfortably. Business casual is fine. Ballcap (trumphat) and sunglasses are fine. Masks are okay but that will make you look like antifa. Skull cawadoody ghost masks are fine. Bring helmets if you want to be a badass (also safer)<br><br>2. No guns. Yes alabama is a progun state. But guns are not allowed on college campuses. Leave your gun at home. There will likely be fights. Boys will have your back at all times. A shooting justified or not will hurt everything we are trying to do.<br><br>3. No crazy signs. Memes are fine. But try to keep it topical to free speech on colleges , anti communism , and anti antifa. Stuff that people will see on the news and agree with.<br><br>4. Bring medical supplies to help your friends out. Stuff like gauze and whole milk for pepper spray (and chugging infront of minorities). baking soda and water is great for pepper spray too. So is maalox. If you want to go full prepper and bring your EMS bag its up to you.<br><br>5. Have fun, bring\/make friends, and get phone numbers.

Hence it is that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths.

It came to me when I tried to classify muslim species and I realized that they are not actually mammals. Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment but muslims do not. They move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way they can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Muslim beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. They are a plague and we are the cure.","filename":"agent_smith","ext":".jpg","w":1279,"h":548,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":53,"tim":1492512628529,"time":1492512628,"md5":"vurumF6NdwfH5ZflKMs2CQ==","fsize":73619,"resto":121664588,"id":"pZVUbxbr","country":"FI","m_img":1,"country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121669786,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)06:53:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121664588\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121664588<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Why does pol\/ hate immigrants from the middle east so much when all they&#039;re doing is seeking a better life?<\/span><br>Because we have already found a relatively good life here, in our own countries.

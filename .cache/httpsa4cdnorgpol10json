The man, who has been named as Ziyed Ben Belgacem, is seen struggling with a soldier for more than a minute before help arrives. Belgacem, a 39-year-old French citizen, held an air pistol to the soldier&#039;s head and used her as a shield. Police believe he intended to use the soldier\u2019s weapon to shoot members of the public. The soldier\u2019s colleague intervened and fired three bursts, shooting Belgacem dead.","filename":"20170321001300822738-original","ext":".jpg","w":704,"h":396,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490064800520,"time":1490064800,"md5":"4b4rRU83Ay9SCrM7dWeHIQ==","fsize":40208,"resto":0,"id":"o4JYsdnl","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"orly-airport-muslim-terror-attack-footage","country_name":"Australia","replies":2,"images":1},{"no":117576507,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)22:54:37","name":"Anonymous","filename":"orly[1]","ext":".jpg","w":413,"h":384,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":116,"tim":1490064877710,"time":1490064877,"md5":"NObpgkwmU64whqTHfTirMQ==","fsize":21646,"resto":117576375,"id":"nnf17m7B","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117576650,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)22:55:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;female<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;soldier<\/span>","time":1490064958,"resto":117576375,"id":"oLVs1gZ6","country":"PH","country_name":"Philippines"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117575396,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)22:44:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"The Ultimate Black Pill<br><br>I went through this whole conspiracy theory shithole of a phase when I was a teenager after watching Zeitgeist and 9\/11 was an inside job bullshit.

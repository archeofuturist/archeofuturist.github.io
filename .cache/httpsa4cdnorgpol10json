Money and Fun killing religious cosplayers.","time":1493429100,"resto":123269103,"id":"C0XCLxCl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123277117,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:26:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123276887\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123276887<\/a><br><br>More understandable than the Obama Foreign Policy, sadly.","time":1493429216,"resto":123269103,"id":"3lbi7tJg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123277531,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:30:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123275587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123275587<\/a><br><br>And the US knows where every single field is.","time":1493429439,"resto":123269103,"id":"3lbi7tJg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123276495,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:21:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Anyone ever heard this masterpiece?<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Tzu<wbr>vfy4jFwE","filename":"1369879385174","ext":".png","w":497,"h":594,"tn_w":209,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493428887425,"time":1493428887,"md5":"tPW+vSs3jsF7IWdQM1+fmA==","fsize":180176,"resto":0,"id":"fHi2Ws\/l","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"anyone-ever-heard-this-masterpiece","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":123277071,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:26:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"At least she keeps her pussy clean.","filename":"1492606901223","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493429194853,"time":1493429194,"md5":"KbGCE6VewJYWPk0zweI9Lg==","fsize":85036,"resto":123276495,"id":"bPbCqeU\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123271059,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)20:36:22","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Assad names the kikes and Trump","com":"Time to change another chemical attack.","filename":"1493373958422","ext":".png","w":589,"h":442,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493426182636,"time":1493426182,"md5":"kpsXlzjwN03HYK94Gjmt7g==","fsize":319527,"resto":0,"id":"DhgmPIsb","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"assad-names-the-kikes-and-trump","country_name":"United States","replies":25,"images":4,"omitted_posts":20,"omitted_images":4},{"no":123276091,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:18:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"Watch the NRA speech he gave today, it&#039;s the same Donald Trump we watched at rallies and elected on election day.","time":1493428696,"resto":123271059,"id":"DCYhDYst","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123276126,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:18:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123271059\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123271059<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;russia today<\/span>","time":1493428714,"resto":123271059,"id":"eaxqkV1d","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123276483,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:21:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123276091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123276091<\/a><br>fuck plumpf","time":1493428881,"resto":123271059,"id":"oBYsm7R8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123276899,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:25:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123276483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123276483<\/a><br>Klumpf eternally BTFO","time":1493429107,"resto":123271059,"id":"3otTTM0T","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":123276958,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:25:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123271209\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123271209<\/a><br><br>I don&#039;t think he really cares.

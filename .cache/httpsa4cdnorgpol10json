His name is Ali Banat and he runs the Muslims of the World non-for-profit from Australia. He claims to be dying of cancer but it looks very dodgy. His bank accounts were also frozen by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia the other day. He has raised nearly $700,000 on a Gofundme page and I&#039;m told by sources in the Aus Government the true figure is closer to $2 million when factoring in direct payments. The problem is Ali Banat does not have to disclose the donations in the same way a charity does because he is not registered as a charity. The money is going overseas and I am told the reason his bank accounts were cancelled was because the bank suspected money was eventually heading to fund Islamic Extremism. His Instagram account is here https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/alibanat_<wbr>muslim\/?hl=en and he posts videos of him coughing up what appears to be fake blood. If someone has any ideas on how I can expose this guy or find out exactly where the money is going I would really appreciate it. <br>I know it would be a tricky one but if you guys can find that stupid &quot;He shall not divide us&quot; flag in a day I know you can help!","filename":"ali banat","ext":".jpg","w":1558,"h":814,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":130,"tim":1491446419558,"time":1491446419,"md5":"mrIDl8ZU+BoGWSbVGl7aWQ==","fsize":129952,"resto":0,"id":"Ld\/4shok","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"muslim-pretends-to-have-cancer-to-raise-millions","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":119693391,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:41:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Well, Islam can be considered a form of cancer, right?","time":1491446495,"resto":119693257,"id":"PyyjQFlc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119693587,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:43:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"haha - Indeed","time":1491446607,"resto":119693257,"id":"Ld\/4shok","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119693614,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:43:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119693391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119693391<\/a><br>FPBP","time":1491446624,"resto":119693257,"id":"jlbDvTTw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119688516,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)21:52:40","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Thoughts on Sam Harris","com":"Split 50\/50 on him.

Ivanka has that &quot;female prez&quot; arrogant twinkle now. And American policies like the wall and healthcare will be set aside for neocon policy if Syria explodes in coming weeks. <br><br>Kushner has made enemies on both sides. He&#039;s a straight climber at 35. Old guard will stick it to him, too. The only upside is that Kushner will redpill anti-war youth on both sides to Greater Israel.<br><br>But today is shitty. It&#039;s a coup unless Bannon fires back. I&#039;m at 30% optimism right now. It&#039;ll be fun to see Alex Jones and Roger Stone go nuke on Kushner. And Putin will call Trump&#039;s bullshit. He&#039;s had plenty of time to prepare with Obama being a lame duck, same for Assad. How can these men not be woke af to the coming power grab. <br><br>Not a shill.

He also put the letter of James, the letter to the Hebrews, the letters of John, and the book of Revelation from the New Testament in an appendix. He did this for doctrinal reasons (for example: 2 Maccabees 12:43-46 supports the doctrine of purgatory, Hebrews supports the existence of the priesthood, and James 2:24 supports the Catholic doctrine on merit). Later Lutherans followed Luther\u2019s Old Testament list and rejected the Deuterocanonical books, but they did not follow his rejection of the New Testament books.<\/span>","time":1493476217,"resto":123331724,"id":"M744hqUC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123338234,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)10:30:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;33<\/span><br>This","time":1493476244,"resto":123331724,"id":"AvcfaveS","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123335508,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)09:58:06","name":"Anonymous","sub":"this kid","com":"He needs his shit packed up so we can insert a red suppository.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lets use kids so they cant argue the other side<\/span>","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-29 at 8.56.56 AM","ext":".png","w":850,"h":621,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":182,"tim":1493474286706,"time":1493474286,"md5":"1Z6Bf8e2x33YCjoJrFqL+A==","fsize":512816,"resto":0,"id":"M32PJyhr","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-kid","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":123337406,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)10:21:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123336616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123336616<\/a><br>someone needs to break down carbon taxes for these kids. i hope trump fucks their shit up in court","time":1493475680,"resto":123335508,"id":"M32PJyhr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123337505,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)10:22:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"They are going to be in for a real surpise when they get their shit kicked in at court.","time":1493475755,"resto":123335508,"id":"+EqbN2bD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123337666,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)10:24:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123335508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123335508<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He needs his shit packed up so we can insert a red suppository.<\/span><br><br>I don&#039;t understand.

Numales have this look too, as do many other lefty individuals. Its the look of knowing they are a wimp, but they counter it by assuming that the words of their most hated enemies (republicans, for some reason) are the complete opposite of reality. So they believe shit like: dangerous ghettos are safe, hitchhiking through turkey alone is a good idea, and the media has no bias. She has the look of forced, blissful ignorance.<br><br>Some may say that many of the autists on this site have this problem, but since many of the people on here are antisocial, they rely on themselves for many of their tasks. We may look at the ground, but we understand the world won&#039;t reach its hand out to aid us, and we definitely know the world is a cruel bitch. It makes us more prepared for reality than many of the people who have that fake smile on their faces. The second it suits their needs, they will drop the act and go completely feral, as if their entire worldview and civilization has crumbled and all they can do is throw a tantrum.<br><br>If you look at this picture of a bernie sanders rally, you can see a lot of soft faces; no firm chin lines or confident men, just timid folks who look like they never faced adversity ever in their lives, and a trust in any authority figure that tells them they are special just the way they are. Ultimately, it proved their downfall in both Brexit and the 2016 election, yet admitting that would require questioning their current thought-process, which is impossible.","filename":"bernie in iowa","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":427,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493953222037,"time":1493953222,"md5":"kQYkfgQHG0GO5FZuuTaDsw==","fsize":95310,"resto":124123025,"id":"R+vdfaMw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124154859,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:01:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124123025\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124123025<\/a><br>:)","time":1493953268,"resto":124123025,"id":"TIP9jHVa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124156143,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:12:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124131836\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124131836<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124134833\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124134833<\/a><br>sounds more like she convinced herself that it was just an isolated incident and not all mudslimes are like that, and that she was just unlucky enough to have it happen to her","time":1493953956,"resto":124123025,"id":"BjHBLi5n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124156427,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:15:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"can we pay to send her to syria?","filename":"1484373010667","ext":".jpg","w":440,"h":457,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493954109545,"time":1493954109,"md5":"NC03a46S78chm0EWXDYIqw==","fsize":174106,"resto":124123025,"id":"0lW6yGfZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124154594,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:58:36","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Can you guess the country?","com":"What country is this?<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Yfm<wbr>HI2lvuHY","filename":"capture31816","ext":".png","w":1024,"h":740,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":180,"tim":1493953116704,"time":1493953116,"md5":"naQDqVelqQogUJub+\/t\/Cg==","fsize":353881,"resto":0,"id":"6N+UV+hP","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-you-guess-the-country","country_name":"Canada","replies":7,"images":1,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":1},{"no":124155054,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:02:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124154594\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124154594<\/a><br><br>Brampton mmhhh?!?!<br><br>guess its turkey","time":1493953373,"resto":124154594,"id":"s+nTSZ8x","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":124155075,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:03:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Austria-land","time":1493953380,"resto":124154594,"id":"Nac4VbS3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124155181,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:04:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124155075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124155075<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124155054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124155054<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124154972\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124154972<\/a><br>Brampton, Ontario <br><br>It&#039;s Leafland.","time":1493953446,"resto":124154594,"id":"ebUR9Y6h","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124155862,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:10:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124154594\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124154594<\/a><br>all these retarded pajeets are buying at the worst possible time<br><br>once interest rates spike they&#039;re going to have their homes foreclosed because their under the table $8\/hr kebab job can&#039;t sustain the mortgage","time":1493953811,"resto":124154594,"id":"WzUvExpR","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124156398,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:14:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124154594\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124154594<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BRAMMMMMMMMMMMPT<\/span><br>What the hell were they trying to accomplish there?","filename":"xpgYX01qa4kw5o1_500","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":274,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1493954092693,"time":1493954092,"md5":"dlnhlxrgbJAqYA1AjcqxVA==","fsize":255420,"resto":124154594,"id":"boxMZXGP","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"}]}]}

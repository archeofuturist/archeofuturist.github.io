We inculcate the flower of our male youth with the myth that being good comes with a reward. That he, just like any little girl, is valuable for who he is on in the inside. We are taught that we carry intrinsic value within us.<br><br>But we grow up into men. Maybe it is the day we get our draft cards in the mail and the women don\u2019t (despite hearing how women are on the losing side of equality our whole lives). Or we wake up to a news headline reading \u201c500 killed, including three women\u201d in an international newspaper.

The traitors wanted this false flag to push Trump into war, and Trump knew this. Instead he destroyed an airfield and killed a measly 6 people. Not the reaction the establishment had hoped for... but it was something. The reason it is important that Trump actually conducted a military strike on Syria over this information is because now he has a hot situation where intel can be gathered about who was involved in planning this. This is all connected to the ongoing investigation of Obama wiretapping him, as well as the investigations into the Clinton foundation.

order all things which the Master commanded us to perform at appointed times. He commanded us to celebrate sacrifices and services, and that it should not be thoughtlessly or disorderly, but at fixed times and hours. He has Himself fixed by His supreme will the places and persons whom He desires for these celebrations, in order that all things may be done piously according to His good pleasure, and be acceptable to His will. So then those who offer their oblations at the appointed seasons are acceptable and blessed, but they follow the laws of the Master and do not sin. For to the high priest his proper ministrations are allotted, and to the priests the proper place has been appointed, and on Levites their proper services have been imposed.

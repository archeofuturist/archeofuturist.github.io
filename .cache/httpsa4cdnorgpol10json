Yesterday, the Venezuelan Supreme Court declared all Senators in contempt of court, and dissolved the entire legislative branch of government in a desperate bid to quell the political unrest that is quickly spreading across the country. Riots and large scale lootings engulf the capital. Food supply has completely broken down and millions starve. There have even been cases of cannibalism in some parts of the country. Refugees are pouring into neighborhooding countries. <br><br>What is the US planning to do to stop this before it gets out of control and ends in a civil war?<br><br>There is still time.

Long time lurker here. <br><br>So I was on a local paper&#039;s face book page trying to set the record straight on this psycho muslim who killed a couple of people in my town. He has an extensive network of family members who have completely taken over the narrative and turned it into some kind of self-defense thing. They have a ton of people fooled. They don&#039;t have the prosecutor or the judge fooled though, so I was posting transcripts and court documents to make sure people knew what was really going on. <br><br>Anyway, a few of them had my account flagged as fake and I got locked out. It wanted a mobile number, which I don&#039;t have, so I used the google voice thing on my gmail to get around that.<br><br>They just kept doing it though, and now face book wants me to send them a scan of my ID. Can&#039;t do it. Don&#039;t have a scanner. Sucks I&#039;m gonna lose 5 years of photos and memories, but whatever. Wife might be upset though.<br><br>Not the point. Don&#039;t care about getting the account back. What I am doing here though- did you guys know you can totally erase someone&#039;s facebook page from existence? It wipes out everything, including all comments they&#039;ve left anywhere using the account. All you do is report them for having a fake account. <br><br>Now, if you do have alt accounts- if that&#039;s your thing. You can use them all to report someone else&#039;s account and get rid of it almost instantly. You keep doing it until face book asks the person for proof they can&#039;t provide, and then it&#039;s all gone forever. Could be a useful bit of information.

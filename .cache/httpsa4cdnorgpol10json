I think if anything socialism is today faced with a threat much more insidious than its fascist enemies (who to be honest are at least a good adversary) and it is Identity politics. The right wing does not understand that true socialists have no alliance with liberals and they have nor communists (read Orwells Homage to Catalonia for more info on how the USSR helped Franco win) Liberals today, with their voracious love of global capitalism and exponential economic growth have weaponized identity politics and it is more damaging by far to Socialists than it is to the right wing even. Notions such as LGBT and feminism generally, as well as various ethnic identity struggles, divide the working class into a motley, ungainly morass--incapable of even organizing in terms of labor. If Socialism is ever to be &quot;comfy&quot; as one anon said in the thread earlier, we must risk being politically incorrect; even Zizek has pointed this out.","filename":"IMG_0400","ext":".png","w":500,"h":511,"tn_w":122,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491172141098,"time":1491172141,"md5":"5kfR4ctd83yTJ+nEyrrvtw==","fsize":184051,"resto":119245534,"id":"+n9Ro7b6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119255145,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:30:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119255024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119255024<\/a><br>Sorry for the fucky grammar in that post I just got done having sex.","time":1491172202,"resto":119245534,"id":"+n9Ro7b6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119242337,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)16:32:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"Have you folks accepted reality yet?<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Bwk<wbr>B_Qy8ppQ","filename":"kekkers","ext":".jpg","w":980,"h":723,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":184,"tim":1491165176251,"time":1491165176,"md5":"3akU0dFU2s\/xyG9GLctK6Q==","fsize":98593,"resto":0,"id":"oAgP4UKJ","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"have-you-folks-accepted-reality-yet","country_name":"Sweden","replies":26,"images":8,"omitted_posts":21,"omitted_images":8},{"no":119253326,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:13:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"If the earth is flat, then how do chemtrails work?","filename":"Faith Unstoppable","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":851,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":106,"tim":1491171235640,"time":1491171235,"md5":"mN9b2FDy1qXHjxlWGB5MVA==","fsize":983053,"resto":119242337,"id":"pnfvOCBK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119254364,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:23:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119242337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119242337<\/a><br>you&#039;re a fucking idiot. when you calculate the trajectory of a bullet or projectile you have to take into account THE CURVATURE OF THE EARTH <br>GET IT? <br>CURVE OF THE EARTH<br>BECAUSE IT&#039;S A FUCKING SPHERE <br>DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE PLEASE WALK OFF THE EDGE OF THE FUCKIN EARTH IF IT&#039;S A FUCKIN DISK","time":1491171806,"resto":119242337,"id":"9kCN+ecl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119254787,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:26:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119254364\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119254364<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;trajectory of a bullet or projectile<\/span><br>You&#039;re talking to a Swede about bullets.

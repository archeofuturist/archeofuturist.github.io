Jesus said, &quot;Those who seek should not stop seeking until they find. When they find, they will be disturbed. When they are disturbed, they will marvel, and will reign over all. [And after they have reigned they will rest.]&quot;<br><br>3. Jesus said, &quot;If your leaders say to you, &#039;Look, the (Father&#039;s) kingdom is in the sky,&#039; then the birds of the sky will precede you. If they say to you, &#039;It is in the sea,&#039; then the fish will precede you. Rather, the (Father&#039;s) kingdom is within you and it is outside you.<br><br>When you know yourselves, then you will be known, and you will understand that you are children of the living Father. But if you do not know yourselves, then you live in poverty, and you are the poverty.&quot;<br><br>28. Jesus said, &quot;I took my stand in the midst of the world, and in flesh I appeared to them. I found them all drunk, and I did not find any of them thirsty. My soul ached for the children of humanity, because they are blind in their hearts and do not see, for they came into the world empty, and they also seek to depart from the world empty.<br><br>But meanwhile they are drunk. When they shake off their wine, then they will change their ways.&quot;<br><br>29. Jesus said, &quot;If the flesh came into being because of spirit, that is a marvel, but if spirit came into being because of the body, that is a marvel of marvels.<br><br>Yet I marvel at how this great wealth has come to dwell in this poverty.&quot;<br><br>30. Jesus said, &quot;Where there are three deities, they are divine. Where there are two or one, I am with that one.&quot;","filename":"Untitled-1","ext":".png","w":853,"h":345,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":101,"tim":1492575242051,"time":1492575242,"md5":"+qJ+o6IGcYfj9L4ojJ1lhg==","fsize":26817,"resto":0,"id":"4OrPbDBy","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"daily-reminder-that-pol-should-be-a-gnostic-board","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":2,"omitted_posts":4,"omitted_images":1},{"no":121802652,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:40:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"man i don&#039;t care what jewsus said because i&#039;m not of the house of israel","time":1492576826,"resto":121799576,"id":"BNGlxeAu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121803156,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:44:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121799576\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121799576<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121799734\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121799734<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121800114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121800114<\/a><br>I understand one of the books of thomas and because of it, thomas put a curse on me.

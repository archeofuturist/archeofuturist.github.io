My son came out as gay and I told him I didn&#039;t want him living under my roof anymore. He moved in with his sister and he&#039;s dead to me. But I have no shame in saying that I visit TS escorts and have blown my load many times in their tight asses. I even have a couple of beautiful TS babes who do dom work and they throatfuck me, let me rim their holes and come all over my face. This has nothing to do with being gay. They are women with penises. The penis itself is not male, it&#039;s attached to a woman.<br><br>A PENIS IS A PIECE OF MEAT. A piece of meat does not affect my sexuality.

A beautiful lady having a different shape of flesh will not change my sexuality. No matter how many of them I let inside me or how many I beg for their seed.

Reginald Buckner, 23, said the situation escalated when one of his attackers flashed a gun.<br><br>Buckner said the incident started when two women asked him if they could borrow his cell phone. He told them &#039;no&#039;.<br><br>&quot;They just asked all of us were we gay and we were like &#039;yeah&#039; and they say &#039;you know you&#039;re going to hell right?&#039; and I said &#039;wow&#039;,&quot; Buckner said.<br><br>He said the women then joined up with a couple of men and that&#039;s when he said the derogatory comments started and were followed by several punches.<br><br>&quot;They just started out of nowhere physically assaulting,&quot; Buckner said. <br><br>According to the police report, someone in the crowd shouted &#039;gun&#039; as Buckner&#039;s friends came to his defense against the man who punched him.<br><br>After hearing someone shout &#039;gun&#039;, zoo visitors started scrambling. <br><br>&quot;That&#039;s what made everyone start running away when they had the gun,&quot; Buckner said. &quot;When she lifted up the gun everybody just started running.&quot;<br><br>The pain from the beating landed Buckner in the emergency room. His back was bruised and his face was swollen with a black eye.<br><br>Memphis police officers responded to the zoo, but those accused of punching and attacking Buckner were already gone.<br><br>Buckner said his frustration is focused on the zoo and why the person was allegedly able to bring a gun in the zoo.","filename":"harambe","ext":".jpg","w":742,"h":742,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492706302951,"time":1492706302,"md5":"Ze96OkgnxGRq7pWoeU7zHg==","fsize":130189,"resto":0,"id":"TnD\/npBO","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"visitors-flee-memphis-zoo-after-attackers-pull","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0},{"no":122012320,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:41:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122011952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122011952<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why the person was allegedly able to bring a gun in the zoo.<\/span><br>just in case he ran into some fags","time":1492706503,"resto":122011952,"id":"HCgNIGWV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122012943,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:47:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122011952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122011952<\/a><br>bump","time":1492706876,"resto":122011952,"id":"N29Gh0J0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122013104,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:49:36","name":"S H A D I L A Y","com":"Sounds like some homos made up some story cuz some based rednecks made fun of them.","time":1492706976,"resto":122011952,"id":"vjbSdCnS","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122013358,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:52:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122013104\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122013104<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rednecks<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Based<\/span><br><br>One of those things is not like the other.","time":1492707129,"resto":122011952,"id":"Zhumr7Ph","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122006870,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)11:48:08","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Homeschooling","com":"What is \/pol\/&#039;s experience with home schooling?<br><br>Anyone been homeschooled?<br><br>Any parents currently homeschooling or have homeschooled in the past?<br><br>We all know that public schools are terrible but is homeschooling any better?","filename":"home-school","ext":".jpg","w":1542,"h":1024,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492703288616,"time":1492703288,"md5":"j1CSnvrVlw+ePzgv2MbJiQ==","fsize":234611,"resto":0,"id":"lLC\/dYPQ","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"homeschooling","country_name":"Canada","replies":29,"images":5,"omitted_posts":24,"omitted_images":4},{"no":122011195,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:31:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122007682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122007682<\/a><br>I think this is the typical homeschooling experience desu","time":1492705875,"resto":122006870,"id":"tXK2mt7v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122012531,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:43:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"I know some Bible bangers that raised all 3 of their kids through homeschooling.

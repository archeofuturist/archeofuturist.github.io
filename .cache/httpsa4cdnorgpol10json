Were Alexander the Great or Cecil Rhodes misogynistic, racist, patriarchal bigots or are those just labels used by weak-minded and weak-willed individuals? Back in those days (before jews invented the whole concept of social justice) the West still had its balls intact and were the masters of their own destinies. To achieve greatness it was believed sacrifices would have to be made. <br><br>Russia had fallen to Bolshevism where millions were already dying of starvation, and the jews wanted to bring the same sickness to Germany. It was acknowledged that Germany would have to strike first if they were to preserve Germany&#039;s culture, traditions, and racial homogeneity. At that critical juncture it was a choice between keeping Germany &#039;German&#039; or letting the jews enslave the German population, as they&#039;d already done to Russia and China (and are currently in the final stages of doing to Europe and the United States). <br><br>It&#039;s commonly assumed that if Germany had won the world would have been a dark and oppressive place ruled by tyrants. On the contrary, the world would be much more civilised. Germany would have built a new global empire and the German people (a proud and noble race) would have been its curators. No more sickness, no more degeneracy, no more racial mixing, and much less conflict caused by ethnic, religious and cultural diversity. Nazism was a true intellectual movement. <br><br>Hitler will come to be viewed as the Socrates of the 20th century. A man who spoke the unvarnished truth but was brought down by the naysayers and marionettes of the established order.

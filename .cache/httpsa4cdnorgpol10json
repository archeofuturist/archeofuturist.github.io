The package would wrap up $1.1 trillion in unfinished spending bills and address the Trump administration&#039;s request for an immediate $30 billion in additional Pentagon spending.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The latest Trump proposal, disclosed Tuesday, would eliminate $1.2 billion in National Institutes of Health research grants, a favorite of both parties. The community development block grant program, also popular, would be halved, amounting to a cut of $1.5 billion, and Trump would strip $500 million from a popular grant program for transportation projects. Some of that money would help pay for parts of the wall.<\/span>","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":765,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":149,"tim":1491145093733,"time":1491145093,"md5":"5UU4Egd2EXR6qDzwKTweIw==","fsize":145508,"resto":0,"id":"ubMxyuQq","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-calls-for-cuts-on-medical-research-and","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":1,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":0},{"no":119208458,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)11:11:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"fake news intensifies<br>Unless you got a source straight from the white house website or Trump&#039;s own mouth, go back to the oven","filename":"1465863030762","ext":".gif","w":180,"h":180,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491145900526,"time":1491145900,"md5":"\/5Q6Mdc9Y5JO4x6Ck0L19g==","fsize":1093482,"resto":119207118,"id":"N\/got8LU","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119209518,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)11:22:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;H-h-h-h-he&#039;s m-m-m-m-making A-a-a-a-merica G-g-great Again!<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Surely this will not have negative repercussions <\/span><br><br>Seriously Trump fags, just admit he&#039;s a total and utter failure and was never fit to be president.

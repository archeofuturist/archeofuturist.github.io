While these hair stylists do not generally think of what they do as mathematical, Dr. Gilmer detailed the many mathematically-based patterns in these and other types of braiding and how they are found in nature, such as the tessellating hexagons found in braids that resembles the flesh of pineapples and the honeycombs in beehives. As an educator, Dr. Gilmer used these results to create classroom activities for students to understand the mathematics of hair braiding.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nigger poetry<\/span><br><br>Twas mercy brought me from my Pagan land,<br>Taught my benighted soul to understand<br>That there&#039;s a God, that there&#039;s a Saviour too:<br>Once I redemption neither sought nor knew.<br>Some view our sable race with scornful eye,<br>&quot;Their colour is a diabolic dye.&quot;<br>Remember, Christians, Negroes, black as Cain,<br>May be refin&#039;d, and join th&#039; angelic train.<br><br><br>Why do niggers always wanna talk about nigger shit?","filename":"bill","ext":".jpg","w":1240,"h":696,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493520376514,"time":1493520376,"md5":"jznHd2vnObVy5lrMq59SYQ==","fsize":38156,"resto":0,"id":"u6FpdBJc","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nigger-math","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":123424630,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)22:45:40","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Can we put politician in prison?","com":"I mean can we find enough evidence to put corrupt politician in prison from the weakest to highest corrupt politician in a time that sources like WikiLeaks still exist cant we!? well its an idea I want it to share","filename":"C-CAig2XcAAtrCU","ext":".jpg","w":508,"h":720,"tn_w":176,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493520340583,"time":1493520340,"md5":"NhwyqMJ9zO+uRYim6VOmmw==","fsize":54709,"resto":0,"id":"84jgEs7n","country":"AE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-we-put-politician-in-prison","country_name":"United Arab Emirates","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":123422552,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)22:27:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"What&#039;s with all this &quot;our guy&quot;?

covering it up, questions about the blast radius etc etc<br>I found this info online just now, hopefully it should answer the only real question anyone cares about right now:<br>HOW MUCH DOES MOAB RAPE?<br><br>FACTBOX: &quot;THE MOTHER OF ALL BOMBS&quot;<br><br>* Dropped from rear of cargo plane at about 10,000 feet.<br><br>* Falls with a parachute so the plane can get away, then bomb directed to its target by a global positioning system device.<br><br>* Has a device similar to Doppler radar that tells it when to explode, usually igniting several hundred feet in the air to create maximum effect.<br><br>* Explosives inside are called Fuel Air Explosives, which spread a mist of flammable gases that then ignite creating a powerful explosion.<br><br>BOMB RADIUS DAMAGE<br><br>* Up to 1,000 yards: Obliterates everything.<br><br>* Up to 1 mile: Knocks people, tents, light buildings, cars and jeeps over within 1-mile radius.<br><br>* Up to 1.7 miles: shock wave kills people, causes severe damage to buildings, equipment, blows trucks, tanks off road.<br><br>* Up to 2 miles: causes deafness.<br><br>* Up to 5 miles: shakes ground, breaks windows.<br><br>* Up to 30 miles: 10,000 foot high mushroom cloud visible.<br><br>[Source The Lexington Institute and Globalsecurity.org]","time":1492107048,"resto":120935725,"id":"RmkKJIRv","country":"GB","country_name":"United

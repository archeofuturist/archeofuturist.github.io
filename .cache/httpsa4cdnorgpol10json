People who lived around those city states were often named after the capital of their kingdom. Romans were initially called Latin but their name changed after their introduction of Romulus\u2019 myth (the legendary founder of Rome) in the Etruscan capital of Alba Longa. Hittites were named after their capital Hattusas and their deified king was called Hattus-ili. Similarly Athenians were named the champion of their city, goddess Athena. Albanians (as one of innumerous Illyrian tribes) were named after their city state Albanopolis near a mountain called Alp &#039;mountain&#039;, Hittite alpa &#039;white&#039;. The most spectacular name belonged to Dardanus (founder of Troy) because it is related to the myth of the Great Flood (which allegedly took place after the last ice age) hence it should be one of the oldest tribal names among Illyrians who like Greeks, Celts and Romans were obsessed with their divine ancestry. The origin of gods and myths of creation were not pure fantasy but instruments for survival. Ancient people were divided into two categories - those who were condemned to be slaves and those who were born to rule. Those people who failed to come up with a convincing divine lineage were often condemned to be slain, mutilated and exterminated. There was no mercy for godless ancestors. That is why Greeks embraced Hellen, Illyrians adored Hyllus and Romans worshiped Romulus. People even altered the myths, changed the names, ignored their real ancestors and abandoned inherited names to adopt new idols which were more fashionable at that time. It seems that the name Albania &#039;white&#039; was not attractive enough to Albanians since it didn&#039;t carry any significant weight.<br><br>...HeH...<br>HALT!","time":1492404670,"resto":121449689,"id":"tkz4MPlv","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121481530,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:52:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121458614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121458614<\/a><br>Tested my genealogy, only 0.4% nigger, so make like a leaf and hang from a tree :^)","filename":"1486058281137","ext":".gif","w":320,"h":242,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1492404741531,"time":1492404741,"md5":"3yrctwlv9L86cf5dkAuoYA==","fsize":1824949,"resto":121449689,"id":"CnR4Wo3Z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121482067,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:57:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121481530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121481530<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Implies he tested his genes with mindfulness.<\/span><br>He actually tested his genes...hahah...","time":1492405047,"resto":121449689,"id":"tkz4MPlv","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121482204,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:58:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121457995\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121457995<\/a><br>Asians are cool, fuck off.","time":1492405137,"resto":121449689,"id":"l6NELgG7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121482283,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:59:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;thinks when the time comes, they&#039;ll be proper test.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Implies tricks, unworthy of trust.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Proof.<\/span>","filename":"horror-express7-e1404226970299","ext":".jpg","w":299,"h":323,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492405180186,"time":1492405180,"md5":"h\/HFRK8T+zKCVId5m6c3IA==","fsize":24849,"resto":121449689,"id":"tkz4MPlv","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121477928,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:16:40","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/pol\/ will defend this","com":"learn basic economics","filename":"1_image","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1119,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":136,"tim":1492402600632,"time":1492402600,"md5":"ZQsMC6DdQ169GW\/xGXWB2w==","fsize":1103943,"resto":0,"id":"YOzsIrP0","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-will-defend-this","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0},{"no":121478080,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:18:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Leave it to a democrat to defend slavery again.","time":1492402690,"resto":121477928,"id":"Wc+OJEgt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121478145,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:18:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121478080\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121478080<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not saging slide threads<\/span><br>You&#039;re not wrong, but you&#039;re still behaving like a newfag.","time":1492402727,"resto":121477928,"id":"1zvaiKhu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121478250,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:19:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121477928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121477928<\/a><br>More like a loss of brown people funded by who gives a shit, loss of brown people","time":1492402783,"resto":121477928,"id":"7p+YQDdV","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":121478909,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:26:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121477928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121477928<\/a><br>Donde Esta hospital clinic","time":1492403177,"resto":121477928,"id":"gp071M8v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121478962,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:26:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;free labor<\/span><br>It isn&#039;t free.

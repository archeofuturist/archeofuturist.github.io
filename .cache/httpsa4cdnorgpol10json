Concerning that \/pol\/ was about to be kill, the original users made a discord and advertised the discord on the thread. Month after month hundreds and thousands of users flocked to the discord for a more structured and organized place for politically incorrect discussion. There were raids against many foes and friendships were founded with other discords. Many famous autists and kameraden from the board passed through the doors of the server. There was drama, too much fucking drama holy shit.Over that time the community grew and grew. New channels were introduced to represent the growing community and the mod group was expanded. Happenings happened, memes were memed, and there was autism on a scale that had never been seen before. A lot of fun times are had in this discord, and every night when you hop on you; will see channels full of people talking in text. You hop on voice chat in the general channels and you hear \/pol\/, in all its grandeur.

My ancestry is southern Italian and I grew up in an Italian neighborhood in NYC. all I saw was incredibly hard-working Italians, small business owners, busting their asses so their kids could get a good education. me and my firends all went to college, got degrees and have great jobs. we&#039;re all married with kids. I visit my family that is still in Salerno, and they are all well-educated, teachers, principals, farmers. virtually my entire experience (with few exceptions) with southern Italians is that they (we) are a top tier people. so what gives? where does this perception come from?","time":1492741737,"resto":122066176,"id":"cTh+sTgK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121978617,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)06:08:03","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/lrg\/ LIBERTARIAN RIGHT GENERAL - DUDEWEED EDITION","com":"This thread is for Discussion of Libertarianism, Capitalism, Anarcho-Capitalism, and the PHYSICAL REMOVAL of COMMUNIST FAGS from our board of peace.

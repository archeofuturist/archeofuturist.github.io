In my view, it&#039;s a decayed country. And they have their racial problem, and the problem of social inequalities. Those were what caused the downfall of Rome, and yet Rome was a solid edifice that stood for something. Moreover, the Romans were inspired by<br>great ideas. Nothing of the sort in England to-day. As for the Americans, that kind of thing is non-existent. That&#039;s why, in spite of everything, I like an Englishman a thousand times better than an American. It goes without saying that we have no affinities with the Japanese. They&#039;re too foreign to us, by their way of living, by their culture. But my feelings against Americanism are feelings<br>of hatred and deep repugnance. I feel myself more akin to any European country, no matter which. Everything about the behaviour of American society reveals that it&#039;s half Judaised, and the other half negrified. How can one expect a State like that to hold together\u2014a State where 80 per cent of the revenue<br>is drained away for the public purse\u2014a country where everything is built on the dollar?

Subjecting your kids to daily torment is arguably a form of torture or negligence. Homeschooling cooperatives and unschooling movements are more important than ever. K-12 education can be condensed in a fraction of the wasted time. More can be learned about real world skills outside of concentration camps.<br><br>The only area public schools excel is for giving kids a temporary dose of &quot;the real world of public schools&quot; in experiencing being victims so they have PTSD to draw on in the future. But frankly that&#039;s cruel and not the direction considerate parents should tread in.","filename":"war-zone1","ext":".png","w":588,"h":350,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":74,"tim":1492233146800,"time":1492233146,"md5":"wNLuD1Mgc07dryHxBgXNTw==","fsize":82590,"resto":121132081,"id":"JqsqQ6yj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121173636,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:13:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121171007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121171007<\/a><br><br>I think you would like to see the CCSS for 9-12 English, since that&#039;s pretty much what you want.

They read low level things like snap chats or tweets but nothing of any substance. Independent reading does more for a kid&#039;s grammar, vocabulary, creativity, and reasoning than pretty much anything else. You often see the strongest, most successful minds also being voracious independent readers. I myself suffered under horrible grammar instruction, but I read books far beyond my grade level, so that pushed my literacy more than anything else. I think if there&#039;s a cultural shift to read high quality fiction and nonfiction we will see better results.","time":1492233185,"resto":121132081,"id":"kP5P097X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121173685,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:13:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121173435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121173435<\/a><br>What you&#039;re doing is unnecessary.

It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492227836702,"time":1492227836,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"f3nQIH54","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":18,"images":4,"omitted_posts":13,"omitted_images":4},{"no":121167909,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:15:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"i dont believe in any form of god <br>doesnt mean im some autistic atheist always religion bashing <br>believe what you want, never bothered me <br>from what ive seen around me it was more of a lack of faith and laziness then atheism anyways<br>i had a friend who always claimed to be an atheist be when her grandma died she said she believed in god because she wanted to know that her grandma was in a better place","time":1492229701,"resto":121164345,"id":"9BduqYJ7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121168390,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:19:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"If you grow up without religion in your life you completely lack the emotional investment needed to truly have faith - if you &quot;convert&quot; to any religion at all it would be a secular religion such as Buddhism and so on.","filename":"memegod","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":1200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492229965283,"time":1492229965,"md5":"LHDLXJV5PXyu5EMxk8lPlQ==","fsize":509907,"resto":121164345,"id":"XO3rR78E","country":"SE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121168741,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:22:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121165555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121165555<\/a><br>IQ averages cant shift retard. 100 IQ is a mean average of humanity.","time":1492230172,"resto":121164345,"id":"HH7ZO3n\/","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121170563,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:39:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121168741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121168741<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a fucking leaf<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;80iq shitposter<\/span><br>Not surprised.

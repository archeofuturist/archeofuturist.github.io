All articles need to be vetted by an editor who needs to send them to legal council who verifies if they can be published. This often means calling a govt official and getting approval, which is why 99% of domestic news is propaganda.<br>2. Making media costs tons of money. Govts are 80% of the media industry&#039;s money funds and so, specific wealthy groups use their investment funds to push propaganda which supports their cause. They straight up say this on many film producer websites (Weinstein for example)<br>2a, You can look at any film credit and find who finances the films. Look up their financial backers and you will trace nearly all the media money in the world back to 7 banks who are co-owned by Israeli pension funds or Israeli intelligence officers. This is not even a theory, its a google fact.<br>3. Israel has confirmed their nukes and the Gideon Protocols are a real thing. They were declassified in 1998 and to this day Israel can nuke all of Europe in 20 min. flat should Tel Aviv ever fall. They stole the USSR&#039;s deadman hand program which is an analog failsafe launch system. This pissed off the Politburo for over 30 years, its a documented open secret from the old KGB archives, now open for public access.","time":1493421056,"resto":123257835,"id":"nSOuFEF5","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}]}

There were 4,483,810 votes in California for Donald Trump, roughly 31.5% of votes. I&#039;m leaving third parties out of this because they are irrelevant.<br><br>But maybe it was just that election? Not really. The 2012 election results were roughly 60% to 37% in favor of Obama. Only a few percentage difference.<br><br>So there are a few solutions to this problem. We either need to somehow push liberals out of California and move conservatives in. But how do we do that? I have a few ideas.<br><br>Note that I will only list 100% legal options.<br><br>Pushing them out:<br>-Methood 1: Annoyance<br>While this may not be very effective, it should do something. We could start protesting, posting propaganda, etc. all over the state and annoy liberals into other states. Some possible backlash may come from groups like AntiFa, but we&#039;ve already shown how to deal with that. We just need to annoy the absolute shit out of people and see if they will leave. As I have stated, this may not be very effective.<br><br>Now onto the good stuff. Taking conservatives in:<br><br>-Method 1: Relocation<br>If the liberals in California do not want to move, then we will have to move there an change the political field by living there.We will need roughly 4,3000,000 conservatives to move to California to change the political field. Even less than that will at least bring it closer to a swing state. It might also be a good idea to move some conservativs to swing states to help ensure it stays conservative. I have created a list of states that we can use to relocate people.<br>Alabama<br>Alaska<br>Arkansas<br>Idaho<br>Kentucky<br>Nebraska<br>North Dakota<br>Oklahoma<br>South Dakota<br>Tennessee<br>West Virginia<br>Wyoming<br><br>These states have a noticable conservative lead according to the 2016 election results.

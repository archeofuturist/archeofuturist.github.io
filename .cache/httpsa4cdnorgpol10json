I was working for this pre-stressed concrete company for over 15 yrs until this past December, when the manager used layoffs as an excuse to axe. I say excuse, because during previous layoffs, the newest employees would be the ones to get the axe, but as said above i&#039;ve been there since January 2001.<br><br>So here&#039;s the thing, about 2 yrs ago we got a new yard manager. He was an asshole from day 1, but he stayed out of my way. This past summer however he found out I was a Trump supporter when he saw a MAGA hat in my car. He actually confronted me about it asking if it was a joke or something. Did I mention this guy was big time liberal faggot? Anyway after that he was kinda of an asshole to me. Finding faults in my work that I needed to work on, and always quick to mention how Trump was doing so badly in the polls.<br><br>Then came the day after election. I couldn&#039;t help myself, after biting my tongue all summer and early fall I had to rub it in his face a little. He was pissed, but tried to act like he wasn&#039;t that upset.<br><br>Anyway December rolls around, and the company says they have to layoff about 10 people for the winter, which is normal as we are slower during the winter. However for the first time I find myself getting laidoff. Ofcourse he says we are all welcomed to re apply come spring (which is now), but I said fuck that. I&#039;m not starting over from the bottom. So I apply at various good paying jobs. Problem is i&#039;m not getting too many calls, or I don&#039;t get a 2nd interview. WTF is going on, its been over 2 months, and I can&#039;t get a job.<br><br>to be continued....<br><br>tl;dr asshole liberal ex boss is costing me employment.","filename":"7827807450621","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490109824656,"time":1490109824,"md5":"sSDoi9eMsQsfUbOAdUnZVA==","fsize":221234,"resto":0,"id":"xqM\/bPzW","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"need-some-advice-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":2,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":1},{"no":117635675,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)11:41:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117634907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117634907<\/a><br>Can&#039;t afford a lawyer (cause i&#039;m unemployed now), but do you think a harshly written letting warning legal action would work?

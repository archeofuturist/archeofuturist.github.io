The average width of a mans chest is 20 in, so even if he is standing completely still facing right at you and there is absolutely no wind, under standard atmospheric conditions, at 1600m you have to be shooting within 1 MOA and that&#039;s assuming you&#039;ve calculated spin drift and the Coriolis effect perfectly.

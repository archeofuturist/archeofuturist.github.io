TRUMP IS JEWISH.<br><br>In his biography The Art of the Deal, Trump lied about his grandfather&#039;s country of origin, stating it was Sweden instead of Germany. So if you think these people wouldn&#039;t lie about their ancestry, you need to explain that whopper.<br>Trump was brought up in Jamaica Estates, Queens, which has a large Jewish population. He went to Kew-Forest School, ditto. Its other notable alumni include Katherine Weber, Jewish, Gideon Yago, Jewish, and Hank Azaria, Jewish. Googling on \u201cattended Kew-Forest\u201d brings up mostly Jewish names. Trump&#039;s father was on the Board of Trustees at Kew-Forest. By the way, it is very expensive. <br>His genealogy is a total mirage. I&#039;ll show you where to look. First go to his mother at Geni.com<br>She is Mary Anne MacLeod. So they want you to think she is Scots. Then click on her father, Malcolm MacLeod. Then click on his mother, Anne MacLeod. She is the wife of Alexander MacLeod, so that is her married name. What is her maiden name? Whoops, it is also MacLeod, because her father is also named Alexander MacLeod. So both her father and her husband have the same first and last names? Did she marry her own father? Also, her birthyear is given as 1833. Note the 33. [Geni also fails to mention what we have to learn from the DailyMail: the name Trump = Drumpf.]<br>That can&#039;t be right, can it? So let&#039;s check the other genealogies. The second listed on a Google search is at About.com<br>The largest source for Expert content on the Internet that helps users answer questions, solve problems, learn something new or find inspiration.<br>.But it has nothing to say about this. It stops just short of the Anne MacLeod problem. <br>But it does tell us something interesting: both Trump&#039;s parents died at Long Island Jewish Medical Center.<br>Wikitree matches Geni. <br>So let&#039;s return to Friedrich Drumpf, Donald&#039;s great-grandfather. Two of his sisters are listed as Elisabetha Freund and Syblia Schuster.<br><br>[rest in link]","filename":"3555322","ext":".jpg","w":1010,"h":1036,"tn_w":243,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491801193566,"time":1491801193,"md5":"gyxGsx7+WN0LHdkfzK5ibQ==","fsize":85602,"resto":0,"id":"ddDixASs","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-the-fuck","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":2},{"no":120397165,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)01:16:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"that would explain a lot","time":1491801414,"resto":120396793,"id":"YmMVI8Of","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120397188,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)01:17:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"My ID<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;DixASs<\/span><br><br>kek","time":1491801432,"resto":120396793,"id":"ddDixASs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120397316,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)01:18:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;DixASs<\/span><br><br>lmao@u right now","time":1491801515,"resto":120396793,"id":"3ibAHxyt","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120397349,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)01:18:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"Holy shit, bump!

Here&#039;s why: <br><br>1. Seth was the Voter Expansion Data Director at the DNC, which means that he would have had access to the computers that the DNC\u2019s emails were on. <br><br>2. Everything about his murder on June 10th, 2016, is fishy. At 4:20 AM, Rich was about a block away from his house in D.C., when he was shot twice in the back by two men dressed in all black. Newsweek reported that police said he may have been killed in an attempted robbery, but the shooters didn&#039;t take his watch, wallet, phone that he was actively talking on when he got shot, or gold necklace. <br><br>3. In fact, the police reported that they found him conscious, which would mean that the shooters didn\u2019t even go near the body. However this contradicts with the fact that Rich&#039;s girlfriend told NBC Washington, &quot;There had been a struggle. His hands were bruised, his knees are bruised, his face is bruised, and yet he had two shots to his back, and yet they never took anything...They didn&#039;t finish robbing him, they just took his life.&quot; The police closed the case, calling it a \u201cbotched robbery.\u201d The police have a surveillance tape that they claim gives a glimpse of his killers\u2019 legs, but they have declined to show this tape to the parents or to the public. <br><br>4. Wikileaks seems to hint that Seth Rich was their source. Wikileaks revealed that the leaked emails came from a Bernie Sanders supporter who was frustrated that the DNC rigged the primaries for Hillary Clinton, which fits with Seth Rich\u2019s persona. In August 2016, WikiLeaks offered a $20,000 reward for information leading to a conviction. During an interview with a Dutch television station, Assange brought up Seth Rich and stated, \u201cour sources, ah, take risks, and they, they become concerned to see things occurring like that.\u201d He then neither confirmed, nor denied, that Rich was their leaker.","filename":"36C83CC200000578-0-image-a-1_1470071579344","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":634,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492664025200,"time":1492664025,"md5":"\/489dMWI2ja0dMq4PKVydg==","fsize":60874,"resto":0,"id":"5gmdZYiD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"his-name-was-seth-rich","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1},{"no":121954452,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:53:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121954425\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121954425<\/a><br>5. The January 6th, 2017 intelligence report claimed that the Russian military intelligence agency known as the GRU used the \u201cGuccifer 2.0\u201d persona to release material to influence the election and related material to WikiLeaks. Leaked messages between \u201cGuccifer 2.0\u201d and a female actor revealed that Guccifer source\u2019s name was \u201cSeth\u201d.<br><br>6. One of Seth\u2019s friends commented when the story about the leaked emails broke, \u201cHe was so upset. It was crazy. He said, \u2018Oh, my God. We have a foreign entity trying to get involved in our elections?\u2019 That made him so angry.\u201d This could mean that Seth didn\u2019t know that Guccifer 2.0 worked for Russia, since Guccifer 2.0 has repeatedly stated that he is a Romanian and does not work with Russia.<br><br>There are only two scenarios for this:<br>1. Seth gave the emails to Guccifer 2.0, who was a middle man for Russia, who in turn gave them to Wikileaks. The DNC had him assassinated because he knew too much.<br>2. Russia hacked the DNC, and Seth Rich found out about it. Russia had him assassinated because he knew too much. This seems to be the generally accepted theory, but it doesn\u2019t line up with point \u2018a\u2019 (because Seth Rich wouldn&#039;t have the technological proficiency to recognize the hacks) or point \u2018f\u2019.<br><br>Did I miss anything?","time":1492664036,"resto":121954425,"id":"5gmdZYiD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121955002,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:59:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121954452\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121954452<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Did I miss anything?<\/span><br><br>Guccifer 2.0: Game Over<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Metadata suggests it took only 30 minutes to go from a DNC tech\/data strategy consultant creating documents to Guccifer2.0 tainting them - all occurring on a date that Guccifer2.0 claimed to be after he was locked out of the DNC Network - occurring on the same day that Guccifer2.0 emerged.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Data found deeper in files now also demonstrates there was a misdirection effort, that, in it&#039;s larger scope - seems to have been intended to discredit leaks by having leaks blamed on Russian hackers<\/span><br><br>www.g-2.space<br><br>WL tweeted this page last week.","time":1492664346,"resto":121954425,"id":"zEvI9OtY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121955320,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:02:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121954425\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121954425<\/a><br>ask the grocer across the street what happened.","filename":"vey","ext":".png","w":354,"h":504,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492664549513,"time":1492664549,"md5":"4VZmYIdYqsA84SL39Chdag==","fsize":141322,"resto":121954425,"id":"rDeaj5B0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121957187,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:22:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121955002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121955002<\/a><br>Thank you for this link.","time":1492665736,"resto":121954425,"id":"5gmdZYiD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121957427,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:24:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121954425\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121954425<\/a><br>Yes Seth Rich deserves justice but so does Eric Clanton.

The tagline reads &quot;Re-civilize yourself&quot; and the man appears to be about to vigorously throw away his so-called uncivilized self.

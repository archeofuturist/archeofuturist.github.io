Alejo Garza, 77, refused to turn him in. He gathered the workers of his ranch and ordered them not to report to work the next day. That morning the vehicles of the delinquents entered the ranch and stood in front of the house. The assassins descended, fired a blast into the air and exclaimed that they would seize the ranch. Garza Tamez responded by shots and the armed group responded against the house. The thieves increased the attack and went from the long arms to the hand grenades . In spite of the numerical difference the criminals did not take it off the ranch, they fled before the arrival of the military. Don Alejo stole himself at his estate, killing four of the attackers and wounding two more.<\/span><br><br>Elements of the Mexican Navy arrived at the ranch of Alejo, denominated &quot;San Jos\u00e9&quot;, located to 15 kilometers of Ciudad Victoria , Tamaulipas .

In the interior of the house they found only the body of Alejo Garza Tamez, with two arms to its side and fined by the shreds of the grenades.<br><br>Inspecting the ranch revealed that all windows and doors were broken guns and shells.

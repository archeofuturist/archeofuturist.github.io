By not masturbating\/edging it allows your body to build up sex hormones that if abstained long enough, can do all kinds of kinds from helping you lose weight to giving you huge confidence boosts and a roaring sex drive.<br><br>2. While your hormones are building up make an effort to improve yourself and the space around you, if I told you to go to the gym regularly at least 70% of you would stop reading at this point. So instead I say do like exercise like walking outside and lifting weights in your room. <br><br>Also have a strict diet plan of no sugar (If you must then use natural unprocessed sugar), no bread, low salt, and low fat, lots of fruits and vegetables. Stick to lean chicken, and if you must eat any junk\/fatty foods perform and extra strenuous workout and use that as your rewards (only once a month recommended).<br><br>3. If you listen to these instructions your body will start to change and you are on your way to breaking the curse you put yourself in. You will start to get lots of energy and a huge boost of confidence around women. <br><br>3.Now that you have done that you should clean yourself up, dress like an adult, and go out and look for a wife to marry and have children with. 4chan extremely exaggerates how terrible women are but most are actually pretty decent if you stay out of bars.<br><br>My advice for socially awkward bros is to practice talking to yourself while alone or driving, even if you aren&#039;t confident in your abilities just fake it.

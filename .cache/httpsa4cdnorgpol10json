It is why with great esteem and passion I come here today to honor a brave Mexican patrito named Don Alejo Garza Tamez.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Members of the organized crime group ( Los Zetas ) demanded Alejo&#039;s ranch on November 13, 2010 and warned him that he had 24 hours to abandon his property. Alejo Garza, 77, refused to turn him in. He gathered the workers of his ranch and ordered them not to report to work the next day. That morning the vehicles of the delinquents entered the ranch and stood in front of the house. The assassins descended, fired a blast into the air and exclaimed that they would seize the ranch. Garza Tamez responded by shots and the armed group responded against the house. The thieves increased the attack and went from the long arms to the hand grenades . In spite of the numerical difference the criminals did not take it off the ranch, they fled before the arrival of the military. Don Alejo stole himself at his estate, killing four of the attackers and wounding two more.<\/span><br><br>Elements of the Mexican Navy arrived at the ranch of Alejo, denominated &quot;San Jos\u00e9&quot;, located to 15 kilometers of Ciudad Victoria , Tamaulipas . The elements found the main house partially shattered by bullet impacts and grenade explosions. They found on the outside of the estate six abandoned bodies, four dead and two unconscious. In the interior of the house they found only the body of Alejo Garza Tamez, with two arms to its side and fined by the shreds of the grenades.<br><br>Inspecting the ranch revealed that all windows and doors were broken guns and shells. It was finally understood that Alejo had designed his strategy to fight alone, placing weapons on all doors and windows.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JkM<wbr>Mrdxsy5I","filename":"948209482039","ext":".jpg","w":200,"h":300,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490592734847,"time":1490592734,"md5":"0ZkN5OHN2ja4QXK8Xuajqg==","fsize":25283,"resto":0,"id":"WQBQQcOr","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"when-it-comes-to-true-patriots-no-country-and-no","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118477051,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)01:32:08","name":"Anonymous","sub":"CANADA IS OVER","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; no threads about Canada<\/span><br><br>Wow, I really hate nupol","filename":"1469770191037","ext":".png","w":630,"h":610,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":242,"tim":1490592728920,"time":1490592728,"md5":"vF5ZuUIeOOfOo4I0J1UPvg==","fsize":23284,"resto":0,"id":"RNetKPqW","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"canada-is-over","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118460861,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)22:49:32","name":"Anonymous","sub":"How will stormfags ever recover","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;T-the Romans waz White<\/span><br>POL BTFO<br><br>How does it make you feel knowing that Middle Easterners\/Meds created this world ?

Personally, I think that &quot;people&quot; - as in collectively, the masses - have no free will, which if why a whole society can be ideologically controlled. But individuals have free will imo, a single individual has single-handedly changed the narrative many times in History. Alienation, as you put it, can be viewed in Bezmenov&#039;s terms as the &quot;demoralization&quot; phase o the socialist takeover. But whether or not you think that alienation is a cause of marxist social engineering is up to you.","time":1490592257,"resto":118469046,"id":"RfEIcKck","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}]}

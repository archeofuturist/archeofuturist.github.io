They function as a group consciousness rather than as individuals, and they live by the \u201cLaw of One\u201d or global oneness. They are also advocates for love and peace on this planet.<br><br>They are mostly born into the Gold Ray of Incarnation and Evolution, which means they have access to gifts of clairvoyance and healing.

They have beautiful pastel hues to them. To the untrained eye, it appears to be without color at all, therefore Crystal, but the extremely high frequency of the energy field is what gives it away.<br><br>The first thing you will recognize about Crystal children is their forgiving nature.

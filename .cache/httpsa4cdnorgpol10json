The Parasol Foundation is a philanthropic organization that was primarily founded by billionaire Warren Trepp. Warren Trepp is best known for being the one player who escaped jail time in the junk bond scandal of the 1980\u2019s that made Michael Milken infamous. (see the book \u2018Barbarians At The Gate\u2019) Warren Trepp also happened to be my former father-in-law Tom\u2019s main \u201cbro\u201d in a nauseatingly dysfunctional group of nouveau riche butt plugs in and around the Lake Tahoe Basin. Trepp and his much younger wife, J\u2019ale, played hosts to this yearly event, which featured an often amusing lineup of D-list celebrities and athletes. Occasionally, they would snag a good one, and this year was the best so far, with Dennis Hopper and Cheech Marin heading up the bunch.<\/span>","filename":"slots","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":400,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":161,"tim":1490670599813,"time":1490670599,"md5":"4U6CAGdG\/Yz4iAE2rT9INg==","fsize":75865,"resto":0,"id":"xGUdrcNi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-man-who-fooled-the-government-appletinis","country_name":"United

Spicer Green Jewelers took to Facebook to apologize on Thursday.<br><br>\u201cTo whom we have offended with our recent billboard, please accept our apologies. We do not condone violence of any kind toward any being,\u201d the company said in a statement on Facebook. \u201cWe did not intend to cause controversy and our billboard communicated something we did not intend. We intended the billboard as a play on words to encourage the loving act of gift giving and are deeply saddened that it offended anyone.\u201d<br><br>Eva Michelle-Spicer, who owns the business with her husband Elliot, said the sign was not intended to be an endorsement of domestic violence.<br><br>\u201cThe billboard was intent (sic) to be a nostalgic thought of a childhood teaching,\u201d Spicer told WLOS. \u201cThat it\u2019s not ok to throw rocks at girls, it\u2019s not ok to throw rocks at anyone\u2026 It saddens me that it was taken that way because it certainly wasn\u2019t intended.\u201d<br><br>The store promised to donate 10 percent of its sales to a domestic survivors\u2019 shelter in Asheville through Sunday.<br><br>For some, the apology was not enough.<br><br>Ellen Perry, a literature and humanities teacher, said she organized a group to protest the sign on Sunday, and she plans to hold future protests until it is taken down.<br><br>\u201cWe are not going to stop until we see that billboard come down because it\u2019s doing damage, even if we want to laugh it off and say it\u2019s just a joke,\u201d Perry told WAVY.","filename":"Screenshot_2017-03-27-08-02-05","ext":".png","w":1080,"h":1920,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490662478276,"time":1490662478,"md5":"eHCLJ21+KJ3pICGySVSOTg==","fsize":762361,"resto":0,"id":"ipwzEEM6","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"throwing-rocks-at-girls","country_name":"United States","replies":43,"images":14,"omitted_posts":38,"omitted_images":13},{"no":118602426,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)23:03:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118598283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118598283<\/a><br>easy there moonman","time":1490670209,"resto":118588205,"id":"uYzve4R2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118602770,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)23:06:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118589265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118589265<\/a><br>Coincidence detected","filename":"1480551354413","ext":".jpg","w":563,"h":821,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490670408164,"time":1490670408,"md5":"IYOmwCrzbA7s+84x2arPfg==","fsize":167772,"resto":118588205,"id":"6lvZtO6N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118602903,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)23:08:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118588205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118588205<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;JEWelry store<\/span>","filename":"1469830775056","ext":".gif","w":452,"h":523,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490670492531,"time":1490670492,"md5":"PnQsCSVXGfL0h0CykX2OHQ==","fsize":3887,"resto":118588205,"id":"VNhtqDpz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118603628,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)23:15:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118589265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118589265<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Goldman<\/span><br><br>Every fucking time","time":1490670928,"resto":118588205,"id":"Fsu8IZxr","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118603895,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)23:17:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118600651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118600651<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118601778\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118601778<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118601957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118601957<\/a><br><br>WHY HAVE I NEVER NOTICED THAT COINCIDENCE BEFORE?","filename":"1393207691546[1]","ext":".jpg","w":890,"h":742,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1490671074996,"time":1490671074,"md5":"vLaRtTRWlLIGbdbwEkMPyw==","fsize":152944,"resto":118588205,"id":"7sAyLBmV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118567524,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:52:32","name":"polfag","sub":"HAPPENING: @PolNewsnetwork1 Killed On Twatter","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; How Long Until Next Incarnation?<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/Pol_4_Infinite9<wbr>\/status\/846473423672918016<br><br>We TwitterFags are waiting.

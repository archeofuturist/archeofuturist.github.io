These people are always going to be seeking a vendetta against us, and have been for centuries. The only things that&#039;s changed between now and about 50 years ago when we didn&#039;t have the problem with terrorism that we have now is that the Muslims have (((enablers))) that bring them here to our shores to exact their revenge and make sure the cycle of violence between we non-Jews continues in perpetuity. We fight each other while the Jews sit back and watch.<br><br>So for practical purposes let&#039;s call the MOAB what it was. A legitimate game changer. Escalation. They killed Staff Sgt. Mark De Alencar, a Green Beret. We dropped a 21,000 pound bomb on them. We just gave them a message. If you HURT us, we will fucking KILL you.<br><br>Some perspective: ISIS killed a Green Beret, and in response we dropped the largest single piece of ordinance dropped on any single target since Nagasaki.","filename":"hqdefault (5)","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492119593170,"time":1492119593,"md5":"SE3QjX4JRgzF1EbmdlnvgQ==","fsize":35697,"resto":0,"id":"f6MMSJiE","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-people-who-believe-the-moab-is-merely-going","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Res. 69, a joint U.S. House and Senate resolution nullifying Obama-era regulations banning the use of certain \u201cpredator control\u201d hunting methods on the 76.8 million acres of federally-protected national preserves across Alaska.<br><br>The repealed restrictions were enacted in 2016 by the Fish and Wildlife Service after years of disputes between the U.S. government and the state of Alaska over the legality of such practices as bear baiting, hunting via aircraft, killing hibernating bears, and \u201cdenning\u201d (killing wolves, coyotes, and offspring in their dens) on or near federally protected lands.&quot;<br><br>This &quot;if Obama enacted it, it&#039;s going away&quot; is beyond petty and I&#039;d be fucking ashamed if this were my son (I&#039;m sure this had something to do with it).

Chicks get really wet so the only way to enjoy sex is to plow it in or be rough enough so that they stop enjoying it, that makes them dry and it pulls my skin back, sex with condoms is practically not an option since my cock is inside a condom with my skin covering it, i feel nothing and it sucks.<br>So i decided to get cut. <br><br>I wonder about a few things. <br>Should i keep the frenulum? Will i feel less without it? Is there anyone who has both experiences sex uncut and cut. Whats better? <br>High&amp;tight or normal cut?<br><br>Pic is high&amp;tight i belive.<br><br>INB4 Jewish propaganda","filename":"IMG_6031","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490865539365,"time":1490865539,"md5":"FEuANwHpqJpRO1URK2WLrQ==","fsize":269156,"resto":0,"id":"RfWv5HF6","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"about-to-get-cut","country_name":"Germany","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118907342,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)06:08:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118904824\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118904824<\/a><br>do it faget","time":1490868511,"resto":118904824,"id":"rcnduzxg","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

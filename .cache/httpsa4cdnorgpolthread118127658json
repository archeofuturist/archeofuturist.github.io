Ryan is also going to take at least the majority of the blame for the bill&#039;s failure since it was his baby and he&#039;s suppose to be getting his party to fall in line on their agenda. Combined with the division in the GOP Ryan now not only owes Trump but needs to have him on his side to avoid splitting the GOP a third way which is basically a doomsday scenario for the Republicans when 2018 comes around. While I&#039;m sure he would have preferred it passed Trump set himself up for a no lose scenario where he either gets his Obamacare repeal or ends up with Ryan kissing the ring for his efforts.","time":1490390336,"resto":118127658,"id":"\/dp10Kkg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

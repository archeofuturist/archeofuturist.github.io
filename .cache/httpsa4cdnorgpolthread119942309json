Trump&#039;s campaign was EXPLICITLY isolationist. AMERICA FIRST. In his inaugural address, Trump said every decision he made would be with AMERICA FIRST in mind. In what warped dimension does attacking the Syrian Air Force constitute a benefit to America? Assad was fighting ISIS. How does this do anything but weaken his efforts? If he is ousted, I have no doubt ISIS will seize power.<br><br>And why? Because Trump saw some &quot;dead&quot; kids on TV? How does that effect America at all? It&#039;s RETARDED. How can anyone in their right mind support this decision? How is this anything but the penultimate tear in the quickly unraveling canvas of international relations?<br><br>I honestly can&#039;t believe Trump went back on such a huge campaign promise. He was supposed to make friends with Russia and keep his nose out of the business of other sovereign nations. He rightly shamed Hillary for going into Afghanistan and Iraq, and now (as soon as Kushner replaced Bannon) he&#039;s playing into the hands of the neo-cons.<br><br>I honestly can&#039;t believe this, and if he continues to foolishly destabilize the Middle East, I will not be voting for the Republicans in the midterms, and I will not be voting for Trump in 2020.","filename":"3mLydMU","ext":".png","w":243,"h":200,"tn_w":243,"tn_h":200,"tim":1491569856554,"time":1491569856,"md5":"vO5D1RuRoSWSzB+H5CV4nw==","fsize":71580,"resto":0,"id":"chuxNZPf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-should-have-stayed-the-fuck-out-of-syria","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119942534,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:59:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119942309\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119942309<\/a><br>Stay mad, libfag<br>MAGA!","time":1491569985,"resto":119942309,"id":"HehoO4u7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119942543,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)08:59:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119942309\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119942309<\/a><br>From here on out he is no different than the Clintons, Pelosi, Obama, Bushes, McCain and other such Israeli puppets.","time":1491569991,"resto":119942309,"id":"xhiaEwgd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

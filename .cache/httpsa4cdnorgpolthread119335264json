We won&#039;t, for a while. We have no idea what she accessed, and why. We don&#039;t know if it was legal, or not. And, predictably, that&#039;s the spin they&#039;re going for. <br><br>Remember, this woman got on 6 talk shows and lied through her capped teeth about a video being the cause of Banghazi. Our Ambassador was killed, possibly tortured, and she fucking lied to the US and the world about it.<br><br>She was so tainted, her guaranteed job replacing Hillary as SecState was withdrawn.<br><br>Now she&#039;s involved in another scandal involving carrying the Clinton&#039;s and Obama&#039;s water. Shocking, I know. <br><br>Don&#039;t let the spin get to you. Just laugh at it. They know this is bad, really bad, and they&#039;re going to twist logic, time, and space to spin this.","time":1491245046,"resto":119335264,"id":"2b7tml6\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119362842,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:44:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119362108\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119362108<\/a><br>National Parks guy.","time":1491245068,"resto":119335264,"id":"2b7tml6\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119362911,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)14:44:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119362201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119362201<\/a><br>Spin, dervishes, spin....","time":1491245098,"resto":119335264,"id":"2b7tml6\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

TOPOFF theorized the covert release of an aerosol of Y. pestis in the Performing Arts Center in Denver, Colorado. By noon on the third day of the drill-the third day following release of the Y. pestis-there were an estimated 3060 cases of the pneumonic plague, 795 of which resulted in death. The (theoretical) plague spread throughout the United States and to London and Tokyo, and travel in or out of state was prohibited in an attempt at limiting further spread of the disease. Colorado officials expressed concern about their ability to obtain food and supplies. Medical care in Denver began to shut down, as hospitals were understaffed, with insufficient antibiotics, ventilators, and beds to meet the enormous demand.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Beyond the hardiness of the spore form, anthrax, as discussed above in &quot;Clinical Diagnosis and Response,&quot; is an extremely potent and deadly bacteria with mortality rates as high as 80%.

They concluded that in the event of an aerosolized release of 100 kg of anthrax spores upwind of Washington, DC, an estimated 130,000 to 3 million casualties would result.<\/span>","filename":"1491410976938","ext":".jpg","w":350,"h":532,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491414209768,"time":1491414209,"md5":"a1+IixBc0u5aEHFcpdeEKw==","fsize":83941,"resto":119630414,"id":"YYQ8Josm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119631403,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:43:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119631380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119631380<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Borulinum neurotoxin (BoNT) - the agent of botulinum - is the most poisonous substance known.

For example, it seems unlikely that respirators will be made available to the general public until after we have suffered a major attack using gas or an aerosolized pathogen. It would therefore be wise for individuals to take precautionary measures and to advise others to do the same. The following is a list of measures to be taken and key items that individuals might procure to protect themselves and family members.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1. Because most serious pestilences can be aerosolized, we must have protection against unfiltered air during a bioterrorist attack. Direct contact with outside air should be avoided in the first 1-2 days after an attack. Second, and of the utmost importance, at least one respirator should always be on hand. This means either carrying it around if you have only one or keeping one at home and the other at your workplace. A half mask covers the nose and mouth; a full mask protects the eyes as well. The mask should have replaceable filters that do not permit the passage of bacteria such as anthrax. Several filter replacements should be on hand for each mask. Consult the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) at...http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/niosh for information on proper masks and filters.<\/span>","time":1491414241,"resto":119630414,"id":"YYQ8Josm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119631450,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:44:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119631380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119631380<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. A portable radio will help you stay informed. Maintain a supply of extra batteries.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3. A flashlight is important, in case of a power outage. Again, keep extra batteries on hand.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4. In an emergency, elevators or other forms of transportation that rely on electricity should not be used.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5. For nourishment, water is the most important commodity. Enough should be kept on hand to satisfy your needs for at least 2 weeks, as well as food stores, especially canned food that can be eaten without cooking.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;6. You should have a good idea where your family members are at all times. Also, have a plan in the event of a situation in which you cannot communicate with one another.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;7. In an attack, roads will probably be jammed, so don&#039;t attempt to go anywhere by car, especially if you live in a city. Since it may be impractical to stay where you are, have a plan for getting to a safe location promptly and efficiently.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;8. A special whole-body suit would be helpful to protect against serious contact poisons such as nerve gas, but they are expensive. Watch for the availability of approved suits in the near future.<\/span>","time":1491414249,"resto":119630414,"id":"YYQ8Josm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119631458,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:44:10","name":"Gunshotta","com":"<a href=\"#p119630414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119630414<\/a><br>Shiiiiieeet!<br>I proud!<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rawr<\/span>","filename":"14879157620590","ext":".jpg","w":2560,"h":1755,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1491414250233,"time":1491414250,"md5":"V5kkwjOWEdjid0+Se8CY7Q==","fsize":874118,"resto":119630414,"id":"ADqTbLEe","country":"LT","m_img":1,"country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":119631484,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:44:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119630602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119630602<\/a><br>How can they keep getting away with that?<br>Irgendwann wird unsere Geduld zu Ende sein...","time":1491414264,"resto":119630414,"id":"Q4BaqhTT","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119631487,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:44:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119631380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119631380<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;9. It has been highly publicized that plastic sheeting and duct tape could be used to seal off a room against the outside air. Keep in mind, however, that you need fresh air to breathe properly. Another complication is that many buildings have circulating air that is replenished by outside air. It would be advantageous to know the location of switches that control the circulating air so that they could be turned off during an emergency.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;10.

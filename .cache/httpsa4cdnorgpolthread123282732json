Black music,media, and community are toxic and perpetually drag down any fellow negro that sees their flaws and wants to escape. Black music and TV make thug&#039;n seem normal and something to aspire to causing more drugs and gun offences. The black community will never fix it&#039;s self and day by day steps closer to an edge from which they won&#039;t return. Is it time we force change upon them and submit willingly or be eradicated?","filename":"purge","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":642,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1493432285236,"time":1493432285,"md5":"ezLQIEqOCMKIWlA6FYeZJA==","fsize":143911,"resto":0,"id":"nABXYlM9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-it-time-to-purge-black-culture-and-community","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123282857,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)22:19:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"What war\/battle does that pic depict?","time":1493432354,"resto":123282732,"id":"Pnuq3q8F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123283011,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)22:20:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123282857\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123282857<\/a><br>Haitian Rev.","time":1493432435,"resto":123282732,"id":"nABXYlM9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123283031,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)22:20:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123282857\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123282857<\/a><br>Haitian (((revolution)))","time":1493432442,"resto":123282732,"id":"QSsWItvD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

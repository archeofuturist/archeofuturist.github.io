Decent people send their kids to private schools. The plebs don&#039;t really need to be educated by the state.","filename":"IMG_4993","ext":".jpg","w":588,"h":710,"tn_w":103,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492925765027,"time":1492925765,"md5":"NdiaarbZDccpjrWTSz9dDQ==","fsize":69499,"resto":122378084,"id":"4ilrHciT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122386258,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)01:39:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122385416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122385416<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How did most of them get to America?<\/span><br>My ancestors arrived on this shitty desert island in chains. Today, we are free men. How? Through hard work. Niggers have had 100 years to work on their situations, but they have somehow regressed. At least the blacks in the civil rights movement back in the 50s wore ties and didn&#039;t throw bricks through shop windows.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;most poor people are born poor. so there ya go, question answered.<\/span><br>Because their parents are poor, because they&#039;re shit cunts. The only solution is to take the children away from the parents. Welfare will not help.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That is half the reason they get such shitty loans in the first place.<\/span><br>No, it&#039;s because they can&#039;t read fucking contracts. My cousin got a huge TV through one of those rental companies, but then went full dindu nuffin when they came to take it away from her. Her excuse was that it wasn&#039;t in the contract. She didn&#039;t even read it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; So why give them more incentive to keep doing crime and give them fewer opportunities and the mental toolbox needed to clime out of that life? <\/span><br>The solution is in their heads. They are the only ones that can start saving, they are the only ones that can remove cancerous people from their lives. You can&#039;t fix them with welfare. Welfare makes it worse. Forced education doesn&#039;t help, as putting a dumb nigger into MIT doesn&#039;t make an educated nigger, it just makes a nigger who has gone to MIT.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Crime seems like an easy answer. Giving better social services (including, but not limited to, decent education) alleviates the issue considerably.<\/span><br>They will take advantage of free shit. They always have. The only solution is genocide\/eugenics.","time":1492925980,"resto":122378084,"id":"WRcjlf9d","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

And there is this large, crazy subset of the community that goes into fits of autistic screeching whenever someone dares bring up the idea of a cure for autism.<br><br>Keep in mind, almost all these anti-cure nuts are VERY high functioning, in that they have mild forms of aspergers. They have wives, girlfriends, friends, jobs and all that. Their autism only manifests as &quot;quirkiness&quot;. That is all their experience of autism is. They don&#039;t even think about the profoundly autistic people and their families who are really struggling.<br><br>That is the main problem with the autistic community. The ONLY voices are from the &quot;aspies&quot; who can&#039;t see past their own experiences. I&#039;m aspergers myself, and I can see how we have a tendency to almost &quot;appropriate&quot; autism from the actual autistics.<br><br>I remember an incident where a mid function autistic author who struggled through autism his whole life mentioned in an interview that a cure for autism would be a blessing. The aforementioned aspies threw a fit and bullied him out of the community, denying him from speaking events and all that.<br><br>These people are selfish and insane. they are shameful to the community.","time":1491177683,"resto":119263059,"id":"cG55sl2B","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119265330,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)20:03:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119265141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119265141<\/a><br><br>Well, someone is trying to take away their victim card and in the course of super autism, their legit autism super power.","time":1491177788,"resto":119263059,"id":"yn0HnQM4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119265903,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)20:08:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119265141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119265141<\/a><br>That&#039;s pretty fucked up, I have asperges too but i&#039;m not going to stop a cure for all those who have extreme autism.

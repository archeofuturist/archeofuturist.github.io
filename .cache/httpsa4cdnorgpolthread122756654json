But here&#039;s the thing: that IS how it works, that&#039;s how that guy discovered microwaves in the first place with the chocolate bar melting in his pocket. The greenhouse analogy is easy to understand because you can see what happens in a greenhouse. but a greenhouse only works because it keeps the atmosphere stable inside the greenhouse. The actual atmosphere isn&#039;t stable and never has been. If you open all the windows on a greenhouse and let all the wind in, it stops working.","time":1493143623,"resto":122756654,"id":"pbvbkLLw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122763915,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)14:08:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122758034\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122758034<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;California drought worst ever clearly climate change omg<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;California dams about to burst from heavy rains clearly increased extreme weather from climate change<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Least hurricanes on record sorry not that type of extreme weather<\/span>","time":1493143715,"resto":122756654,"id":"ogr3pAMq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122763955,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)14:08:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122762824\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122762824<\/a><br>Don&#039;t try to argue with these retards they think Bill Nye the Science Goy saying something makes it automatically false.","time":1493143732,"resto":122756654,"id":"8lCU6V1r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122764126,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)14:10:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122757957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122757957<\/a><br>Think hard for a moment about why.

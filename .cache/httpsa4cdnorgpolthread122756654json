I&#039;m sure you have, but that&#039;s another point I&#039;d like to make. Our earth is constantly changing and will continue to do so, things must adapt just like we have. I&#039;m not saying its right to continue on the path we are on, no I&#039;m agreeing with you. Carbon emissions are a serious problem, but more for the health issues they are causing and not because our ice caps are melting (something that has been occurring constantly). And our reefs will survive anon, if you ever get a chance go diving off of Belize (off topic soz), life will always find a way, just like it has for millions of years. Also back to your ice core samples, you can see that our carbon ratios are nowhere close to the highest they&#039;ve been in our history. ( I think the core samples record the end of the Pleistocene but I&#039;m not entirely sure) The end of the Permian Period saw a HUGE increase in carbon levels which was caused by volcanoes and marine microbes emitting huge levels of methane, and this ridiculously dangerous combination of effects caused the largest mass-extinction in earth&#039;s history (sorry to lecture you this is for the people that aren&#039;t marine aquarists), but we are not even close to being at these levels of methane and carbon emissions, and it would be practically impossible for us as humans to create this same effect. Anoxia is another cause of this, but as we can see, there are many marine environments that are flourishing and surviving and not being killed by dangerous microbes. There are flares of these sure, but this is normal and is something that recurs throughout history.","time":1493148482,"resto":122756654,"id":"JTLTeLpx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122774417,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:29:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122773794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122773794<\/a><br>We&#039;ve been warming for the last 20,000 years.","filename":"2000px-All_palaeotemps.svg","ext":".png","w":2000,"h":583,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":36,"tim":1493148579841,"time":1493148579,"md5":"LwWJABEnZuH92lxw88xabQ==","fsize":183335,"resto":122756654,"id":"9Nn0sTrd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122774446,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:29:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122756654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122756654<\/a><br>The evidence is in several published papers you don&#039;t care to understand, lol.","time":1493148594,"resto":122756654,"id":"kRSC0DYX","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":122774726,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:32:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122756853\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122756853<\/a><br>underrated fpbp","filename":"ihavitunjepa","ext":".gif","w":480,"h":270,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493148734921,"time":1493148734,"md5":"xvkJFCVdkob7laGyqA4Chg==","fsize":3228780,"resto":122756654,"id":"dAtFfBhJ","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122774832,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:33:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122771912\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122771912<\/a><br>Sure humans are contributing to climate change, but at what rate you can&#039;t quantify.

I&#039;m not saying its right to continue on the path we are on, no I&#039;m agreeing with you. Carbon emissions are a serious problem, but more for the health issues they are causing and not because our ice caps are melting (something that has been occurring constantly). And our reefs will survive anon, if you ever get a chance go diving off of Belize (off topic soz), life will always find a way, just like it has for millions of years. Also back to your ice core samples, you can see that our carbon ratios are nowhere close to the highest they&#039;ve been in our history. ( I think the core samples record the end of the Pleistocene but I&#039;m not entirely sure) The end of the Permian Period saw a HUGE increase in carbon levels which was caused by volcanoes and marine microbes emitting huge levels of methane, and this ridiculously dangerous combination of effects caused the largest mass-extinction in earth&#039;s history (sorry to lecture you this is for the people that aren&#039;t marine aquarists), but we are not even close to being at these levels of methane and carbon emissions, and it would be practically impossible for us as humans to create this same effect. Anoxia is another cause of this, but as we can see, there are many marine environments that are flourishing and surviving and not being killed by dangerous microbes. There are flares of these sure, but this is normal and is something that recurs throughout history.","time":1493148482,"resto":122756654,"id":"JTLTeLpx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122774417,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:29:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122773794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122773794<\/a><br>We&#039;ve been warming for the last 20,000 years.","filename":"2000px-All_palaeotemps.svg","ext":".png","w":2000,"h":583,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":36,"tim":1493148579841,"time":1493148579,"md5":"LwWJABEnZuH92lxw88xabQ==","fsize":183335,"resto":122756654,"id":"9Nn0sTrd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122774446,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:29:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122756654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122756654<\/a><br>The evidence is in several published papers you don&#039;t care to understand, lol.","time":1493148594,"resto":122756654,"id":"kRSC0DYX","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":122774726,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:32:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122756853\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122756853<\/a><br>underrated fpbp","filename":"ihavitunjepa","ext":".gif","w":480,"h":270,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493148734921,"time":1493148734,"md5":"xvkJFCVdkob7laGyqA4Chg==","fsize":3228780,"resto":122756654,"id":"dAtFfBhJ","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122774832,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)15:33:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122771912\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122771912<\/a><br>Sure humans are contributing to climate change, but at what rate you can&#039;t quantify.

Go to the wikipedia article for the subject, and read it. Every time you see a citation, click it and read and try your best to understand. Maintain high skepticism of every single source. The most important source is scientific publications. They are technical but if you take the time you can come away with a good understanding of the author&#039;s reasoning, what they found empiricaly, and their conclusions, and what they mean together. I think sources like news articles, and books are no where near as good. What you have to do for every source is to understand what the source is, who wrote \/ said it and why. Anytime someone is telling you something and the details aren&#039;t clear, or its something you have to take their word for, before you do that, make sure you understand who they are and where they are coming from. Think about where scientists are getting their funding, look at their other publications to determine their motivations, see where they have worked and who they have worked with. For journalists and anyone else, its the same thing. <br><br>Once you are done with wikipedia thats not the end. I have just found wikipedia to be a good jumping off point of useful summaries and the citations for the information in those summaries, that is also fairly comprehensive. Think about your findings on the subject and actively seek out people who would oppose your conclusion, but do the same investigation of what they are saying.<br><br>People want to know everything and act like they are authorities on the world, but want it to be easy. Many people only want to create the impression in themselves and others trhat they are &quot;smart&quot; and knowledgeable, and dont want to work for understanding. Useful idiots. I promise you if you have the drive to know truth, aren&#039;t content to be told, and remain mindful of the limits of your understanding, you will come to understand things as they are by doing this.","time":1493153506,"resto":122756654,"id":"HQSCr\/92","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122786567,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:00:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122785427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122785427<\/a><br>I&#039;m interested in your opinion anon, you actually seem to have a background in research and not the media.","time":1493154003,"resto":122756654,"id":"JTLTeLpx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122786701,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:01:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122784491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122784491<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122783036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122783036<\/a><br><br>Hey anon I made a graph, It&#039;s not as good as yours but it doesn&#039;t compare two unlike things, its just a lil timeline of what data we actually do have in our history....Er well part of our history I couldn&#039;t fit all that in the graph.","filename":"WhatWeKnow","ext":".jpg","w":758,"h":707,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":116,"tim":1493154074036,"time":1493154074,"md5":"M2mjXBWABb844d5rClE4GQ==","fsize":49532,"resto":122756654,"id":"JTLTeLpx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122786715,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:01:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122784491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122784491<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also I&#039;ll say it again, you can&#039;t compare temperature and carbon dioxide levels whilst ignoring everything else.<\/span><br><br>But we&#039;re not ignoring everything else.

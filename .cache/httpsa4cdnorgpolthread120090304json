The skin around his belly and backside sagged where muscle and fat had once been. <br><br>White shouted &quot;no!&quot; after she was sentenced and was led back to a holding cell. She could be heard wailing from inside the courtroom. <br>Her family threw themselves on the floor weeping outside the courtroom, and her mother said, &quot;How could they give my baby life?&quot; <br><br>Defense attorney Sindhu Alexander said White couldn&#039;t understand that her baby could die. Alexander asked the court for leniency. <br><br>She said that White&#039;s parenting skills worsened after the father of her three children went to prison, leaving her to work and care for the kids by herself. <br><br>If Kary had been taken to a hospital, she said, he could&#039;ve been saved. He would have gained weight, and his growth would have been that of a normal, healthy child. <br><br>And he would have turned 3 later this month.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-08 at 1.04.30 AM","ext":".png","w":464,"h":682,"tn_w":170,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491628047640,"time":1491628047,"md5":"yczJSc7Lfv0TXs4CVNloDw==","fsize":321900,"resto":0,"id":"dXzoXW2Y","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"did-she-do-anything","country_name":"United States","replies":25,"images":3,"unique_ips":16},{"no":120090463,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:08:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120090304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120090304<\/a><br>remember this is a politics board, this isnt politics <br><br>go back to stormfront you wannabe nazi","time":1491628136,"resto":120090304,"id":"6Mr3EedX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120090538,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:09:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120090463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120090463<\/a><br>I&#039;m literally Jewish.

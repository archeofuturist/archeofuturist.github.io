It&#039;s incredibly dangerous. It&#039;s no exaggeration to say that minds can be changed. Behavior can be predicted and controlled. I find it incredibly scary. I really do. Because nobody has really followed through on the possible consequences of all this. People don&#039;t know it&#039;s happening to them. Their attitudes are being changed behind their backs.&quot;<\/span><br><br>Ever read how Scott Adams says Trump is the best &quot;master persuader&quot; he&#039;s ever seen? Here&#039;s why. It&#039;s not him. It&#039;s an AI telling him what to say.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There&#039;s nothing accidental about Trump&#039;s behavior, Andy Wigmore tells me. &quot;That press conference. It was brilliant. I could see exactly what he was doing. There&#039;s feedback going on constantly. That&#039;s what you can do with artificial intelligence. You can measure every reaction to every word. He has a word room, where you fix key words. We did it. So with immigration, there are actually key words within that subject matter which people are concerned about. So when you are going to make a speech, it&#039;s all about how can you use these trending words.&quot;<\/span><br><br>Trumples on this very board could be bots.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are quite a few pieces of research that show if you repeat something often enough, people start involuntarily to believe it. And that can be leveraged, or weaponized for propaganda. We know there are thousands of automated bots out there that are trying to do just that.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;There are multiple pieces of evidence. Look at this, &quot; he says and shows me how, before the US election, hundreds upon hundreds of websites were set up to blast out just a few links, articles that were all pro-Trump. &quot;This is being done by people who understand information structure, who are bulk buying domain names and then using automation to blast out a certain message. To make Trump look like he&#039;s a consensus. That requires organisation and money. And if you use enough of them, of bots and people, and cleverly link them together, you are what&#039;s legitimate. You are creating truth.&quot;<\/span>","filename":"robert mercer 2","ext":".jpg","w":3019,"h":2276,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1490180379880,"time":1490180379,"md5":"ljne+Oo\/bVYaiiDsYfhIaA==","fsize":1928971,"resto":117747404,"id":"iRB4AeP9","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117747523,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)07:01:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s only OK when we brainwash with media people, goy<\/span>","filename":"1474343972961","ext":".png","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490180477643,"time":1490180477,"md5":"XzxpqSHlXqRDEBgKNkuWHg==","fsize":147349,"resto":117747404,"id":"mPaD2\/BJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117747682,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)07:03:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117747523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117747523<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mimimi my shitty opinion is not on tv<\/span>","filename":"less than one kb lyl","ext":".jpg","w":125,"h":112,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":112,"tim":1490180634331,"time":1490180634,"md5":"uYy5YcRGmFE+VbffoK44DA==","fsize":956,"resto":117747404,"id":"5RbqABPB","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117748006,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)07:09:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117747404\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117747404<\/a><br>so it wasn&#039;t the Russians?","time":1490180955,"resto":117747404,"id":"JiFEWDO0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117748038,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)07:09:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Garbage","time":1490180983,"resto":117747404,"id":"gCwKYVYy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117748919,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)07:22:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;believing anything out of a newspaper<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;believing the mainstream media<\/span><br><br>Fucking kill yourself.

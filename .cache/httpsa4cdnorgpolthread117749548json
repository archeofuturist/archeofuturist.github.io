This state used to be brilliant in weather, education, and quality of life. Now its a dirty shithole with too many people, and the only &#039;good&#039; thing is that we have industry in the form of silicon valley and the damn ports bringing in money and preventing us from becoming Detroit 2.0 (although places like San Bernardino run pretty damn close to that already).

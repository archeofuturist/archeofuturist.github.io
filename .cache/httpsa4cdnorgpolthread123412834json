Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493514133529,"time":1493514133,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"MBNOx+75","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":19,"images":11,"unique_ips":12},{"no":123412930,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)21:02:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"kys","time":1493514175,"resto":123412834,"id":"+V4f0wT8","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":123413076,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)21:04:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Kys","time":1493514251,"resto":123412834,"id":"v1H42km\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123413359,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)21:06:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123412930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123412930<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123413076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123413076<\/a>","filename":"56d27dc1c78ada188851c2b9724e87031fd0e86cf4bb394a1f4eaea0d5044365","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":784,"tn_w":63,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493514396579,"time":1493514396,"md5":"xa1c6dbGm3VKDKM37Vz67g==","fsize":48496,"resto":123412834,"id":"MBNOx+75","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":123413702,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)21:09:34","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1490816757794","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":750,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1493514574104,"time":1493514574,"md5":"5N7Kfw4jjXXSHPe5lNQM1w==","fsize":57665,"resto":123412834,"id":"MBNOx+75","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":123415124,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)21:21:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"FAQ for washed liberal-morons and normal people who simply do not know much about communism:<br><br>1. Communism is the USSR.<br>The USSR is a socialist state, not a communist state.<br><br>2.1.

What about the dictatorship of the proletariat?<br>The dictatorship of the proletariat is a temporary form of political power called upon to ensure the observance of the rights of the proletariat during the transition from capitalist society to communism.<br><br>4. But Stalin ...<br>With regard to the period of Stalin&#039;s rule, we can identify a lot of positive and negative aspects of his activities. But unfortunately, all-round propaganda has distorted the history of this period too much, therefore, without a comprehensive historical analysis of this period, it is impossible to draw unambiguous conclusions on the basis of ALL declassified documents.<br><br>5.

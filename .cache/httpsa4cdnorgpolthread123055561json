That would mean leaving the school system of surrounding Jefferson County, where black students outnumber whites.<br><br>Backers of secession have said that they are seeking local control over schools, not racial segregation. But opponents say that the separation is deeply tied to race and should not be allowed in a place that has been struggling to desegregate its schools since black families first sued half a century ago.<br><br>Judge Madeline Haikala of the U.S. District Court in Birmingham \u2014 who oversees Jefferson County\u2019s desegregation efforts \u2014 issued a ruling late Monday that fully satisfied neither side, charting a path forward for a breakup that she said had been \u201cdeplorable\u201d in some ways.<br><br>Haikala\u2019s 190-page decision recounts the decades-long battle over school desegregation in Jefferson County, including multiple efforts by affluent, majority-white cities to splinter off and form their own school systems. It is a history that has left the county with a shrunken tax base and a growing percentage of low-income and minority students.<br><br>Against that backdrop, the judge offered a blistering critique of those who organized Gardendale\u2019s effort to split from the county system. Pointing to Facebook posts and public statements, Haikala concluded that they clearly saw secession as a way to control the demographics of city schools, erecting a barrier to black students who transferred from other parts of the county.","filename":"alabama","ext":".jpg","w":225,"h":225,"tn_w":225,"tn_h":225,"tim":1493311521636,"time":1493311521,"md5":"akhyDw7tbVZXMMSROoiURQ==","fsize":14155,"resto":0,"id":"QR+Bt4wb","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"judge-rules-alabama-school-district-can-be","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123056137,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)12:50:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123055561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123055561<\/a><br>Well perhaps if black &quot;children&quot; weren&#039;t violent detestable racist apes who rape and beat other kids daily whatever their color may be, the actual human beings (whites) wouldn&#039;t be so desperate to get away from them.","time":1493311820,"resto":123055561,"id":"X7EN3kIB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123057014,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)12:58:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123055561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123055561<\/a><br>i went to highschool in alabama. thank god i was in a &#039;city school&#039; instead of a public county school. <br>videos on theync and worldstar of nigger children chimping out and causing mayhem are just the tip of the iceberg; niggers really are animals.<br>i can&#039;t blame these people for wanting to create their own city school district. <br>white people down there really don&#039;t want to be racist, but when these out of control animals act the way they do every damn day it&#039;s impossible not too.<br>niggers aren&#039;t the only problem, though, some of my friends still down there are teachers at county schools and each year more and more mexicans enroll, not knowing how to speak a lick of english, acting like cholo gangbangers, and not giving a shit about education.","filename":"8c377207be812277eb3972e0b93695db","ext":".jpg","w":366,"h":274,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493312310281,"time":1493312310,"md5":"+MqX+uzdEmR2YTO+q4L1VA==","fsize":18041,"resto":123055561,"id":"Loi2vh\/i","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

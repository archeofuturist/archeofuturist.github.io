Do the same to the opposition.<br><br>Music, parties, girls, etc. That essentially made Antifa marketable. People like the punk aesthetic Antifa has. People also liked how girls got involved, specifically alternative girls. People liked how bands played music and got people together to socialize. Then, there&#039;s the few who followed for the drugs. <br><br>Do the same for Nationalism. Make Nationalist punk rock, give it a hip aesthetic, get the girls to join and make the guys follow.<br><br>Imagine this. You make a Nationalist punk band that looks so cool, with a swank-looking logo, an attractive vocalist, and the apparel looking rather appealing. Give it a millennial vibe too, and hipsters would follow. Eventually, being Nationalist would be hip and appealing.<br><br>This is how the Jews work. They market things. It&#039;s not about products on TV or Facebook anymore. It&#039;s lifestyles. Take Instagram glam gold-digger sugar daddy shit.

After downing the SU 24, the RuAF -in coordination with the Kurds- cut the Azaz-Aleepo supply road that had been under the direct protection of the Turkish air force since the beginning of the conflict. Later, Russia helped the Kurds to block Euphrates Shield expansion, first west of Al Bab (with direct coordination with the SAA), and then as we have seen recently in Manbij.<br>5- after establishing a base in Efrin to prevent Erdogan from conducting military operations there, Putin seems to be planning on using the Kurds to take over the Bab Al Hawa border crossing (the largest border crossing point with turkey) as a part of a possible Idlib operation in the near future.","time":1490728512,"resto":118683057,"id":"yGkMF1er","country":"SY","country_name":"Syria"},{"no":118683973,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)15:17:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118658583#p118683192\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118683192<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i&#039;d assume it&#039;s hard to hit the area of the same RA panel twice with individually launched rockets.<\/span><br>Certainly, but with both, or more people aiming at the exact middle, just below the turret, there&#039;s a good chance of a solid hit.

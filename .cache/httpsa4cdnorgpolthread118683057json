After downing the SU 24, the RuAF -in coordination with the Kurds- cut the Azaz-Aleepo supply road that had been under the direct protection of the Turkish air force since the beginning of the conflict. Later, Russia helped the Kurds to block Euphrates Shield expansion, first west of Al Bab (with direct coordination with the SAA), and then as we have seen recently in Manbij.<br>5- after establishing a base in Efrin to prevent Erdogan from conducting military operations there, Putin seems to be planning on using the Kurds to take over the Bab Al Hawa border crossing (the largest border crossing point with turkey) as a part of a possible Idlib operation in the near future.","time":1490728512,"resto":118683057,"id":"yGkMF1er","country":"SY","country_name":"Syria"},{"no":118683973,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)15:17:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118658583#p118683192\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118683192<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i&#039;d assume it&#039;s hard to hit the area of the same RA panel twice with individually launched rockets.<\/span><br>Certainly, but with both, or more people aiming at the exact middle, just below the turret, there&#039;s a good chance of a solid hit.

You just aim at the tank for a bit, then the missile tracks and kills it, only it&#039;s shoulder fired, so it&#039;s a lot easier than the TOWs or Russian equivalents. It&#039;s more like the US Javelin, but with a shorter range.<br>Against the RPGs, it&#039;s superior, being a missile with a horizontal top-attack mode, ie. it flies over the tank and explodes down. It&#039;s basically a truly modern squad level AT weapon.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=byR<wbr>9EfOTeZg","time":1490733481,"resto":118683057,"id":"Xsqgf\/kq","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118693300,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:39:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118692342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118692342<\/a><br>\/sg\/ is quality oc machine and has a certain charm to it","filename":"1490639940528","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1152,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490733590172,"time":1490733590,"md5":"kPsXJ8Bhdw+F1rluH1mxJA==","fsize":714346,"resto":118683057,"id":"2ik7LAAK","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118693366,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:40:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118693057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118693057<\/a><br>Im waiting for some shill to somehow explain this as being Assad&#039;s fault","time":1490733624,"resto":118683057,"id":"wycYDcsm","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118693547,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:41:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118693300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118693300<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;high quality<\/span>","filename":"848995568586","ext":".jpg","w":240,"h":232,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1490733712146,"time":1490733712,"md5":"xo2h\/fjt3sd0h2T8J9DXCA==","fsize":6767,"resto":118683057,"id":"3ODuVAw2","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118693569,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:42:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Did anyone else spot that yellow car ?","time":1490733721,"resto":118683057,"id":"Anxk07TQ","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":118693762,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:43:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118692114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118692114<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;These things are made of solid concrete.<\/span><br>pressure from the water plus structural damage<br>you dont need a complete fail to have a flood.<br>there is 52.012 bar of presure on the dam at the base ((density)x(gravity)x(depth) +atmospheric pressure)=P=52.012 bar or 50 tons mass force","time":1490733817,"resto":118683057,"id":"TsFDHo+E","country":"MK","country_name":"Macedonia"},{"no":118693846,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:44:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118693366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118693366<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ASSads SHIA kuffar militias stole all the vaccines and prevented new to be supplied!!!!<\/span><br><a href=\"#p118693547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118693547<\/a><br>You&#039;re sure not adding any quality either lately","filename":"1486684292130","ext":".jpg","w":922,"h":915,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490733855386,"time":1490733855,"md5":"IJruVnoPBXUt3w8vFzSsKA==","fsize":682501,"resto":118683057,"id":"Ixt53v9u","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":118693921,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:44:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118693547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118693547<\/a><br>at least its not a crying wojakedit like on \/v\/ or \/g\/","filename":"1490086995903","ext":".webm","w":960,"h":960,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490733893989,"time":1490733893,"md5":"lH2yhlcuJSLTE+7BX5aH2A==","fsize":1151445,"resto":118683057,"id":"2ik7LAAK","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118693974,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:45:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118692114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118692114<\/a><br>Single bunker buster, preferably horizontally should do it.

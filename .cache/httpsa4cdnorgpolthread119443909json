The vast bulk of this place is utter shit, between the racism, fascism, and shitposting. However, every once in a while there will be a truly well thought out post that is above the baseline of crap u always hear. People that post here have no reward for what they are posting, no up votes or any personal gain at all. In a way it is more free than traditional free speech because it isn&#039;t constrained by social norms. In addition it gives a window to see what the peoples opinions are from the ground level. A window into what regular laypeople are thinking when nobody is looking. Its a visceral and real angle you cannot get from thousands of harvard educated journalists, and what comes from it is a combination of fascination and disgust. I think what pol teaches is that politics at the level of the individual is a much more complicated issue than right vs left, but rather a melting pot of ideas. That and this place is where the best developed thoughts can be right next to the stupidest shitposting. There&#039;s really nothing out there like this. I&#039;m here more for entertainment to see the crazies flame war each other than anything else","time":1491308918,"resto":119443909,"id":"S+wUEf7K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

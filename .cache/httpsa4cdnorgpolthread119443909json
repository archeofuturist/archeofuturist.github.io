I think many \/pol\/acks are convinced they hone their debate skills on here. They don&#039;t. Nobody does. Intelligent posts get zero recognition and &quot;banter&quot; or knee-jerk country puns get a massive amount of replies.<\/span><br>I have a fair amount of experience debating people in and out of \/pol\/, and intelligent posts get little recognition anywhere. It never works that way anywhere. The blind ideologues that you&#039;re debating will never admit that you are right. The point of a debate is to convert the audience, and intelligent posts can achieve that (although the audience rarely speaks up). I see this on many other forums too, I write well researched and argued posts, and libtards dogpile on me, shouting me down as a racist. But after a long debate, some of the onlookers start to see things my way, even if not that many of them want to take part in the debate shitstorm","time":1491296704,"resto":119443909,"id":"WHYhYkc4","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":119450720,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)05:05:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119450230\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119450230<\/a><br>Like I said, you are literally using the board wrong.

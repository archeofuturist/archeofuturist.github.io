Canada, on the otherhand, prefers to destroy it&#039;s baseline culture and allow the creation of as many schisms as possible. We all thought the original Trudeau was talking about Anglo-French-Native multiculturalism when he was in. We didn&#039;t realize he actually meant shit even browner and more worthless than natives, who at least have their own reserves to fuck off to. And Quebec, which has it&#039;s own culturally protected territory. Only Anglos seem to have enforced enrichment and no sanctuary.","time":1490463175,"resto":118246502,"id":"4XaZWQuW","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

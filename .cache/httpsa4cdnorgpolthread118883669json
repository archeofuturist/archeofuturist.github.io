The question was: What does it look like when a woman is cooked and eaten? And then the question becomes: What does it feel like to be cooked? And if you knew, after you were dead, that you had been eaten, what kind of humiliation and devastation would you feel?<br><br>Those are the questions I assume I\u2019m looking for answers to when I dig my way through search results into the disgusting depths of BestGore and LiveLeak to watch James Foley\u2019s decapitation and Muath al-Kaseasbeh\u2019s immolation. I turn my laptop away from my husband, mute the volume, and let the horror make my head go dizzy and my stomach turn upside-down. Sometimes he catches me.<br><br>Last night he said, \u201cWhat is wrong with your face? Why do you look like that?\u201d<br><br>I guess that\u2019s what I look like when I watch a man beaten brutally with a tire iron, then moved on to his side to be stabbed dozens of times around his spinal cord, which will not immediately kill him (the snarky commentary explains in the video description) but will leave him conscious for more torture before he eventually succumbs to his bludgeoning.<br><br>Why do I do this to myself?","time":1490848936,"resto":118883669,"id":"ESw3oXds","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118883963,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:44:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118883785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118883785<\/a><br>Are you smoking meth dude","time":1490849045,"resto":118883669,"id":"yHqTYy3H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118884257,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:47:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118883785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118883785<\/a><br>That&#039;s the kind of woman who divorces her husband at forty to start a relationship with a drug-dealer","time":1490849239,"resto":118883669,"id":"N2UBb2Gt","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118884492,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:49:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118883669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118883669<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118883963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118883963<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118884257\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118884257<\/a><br>I like to think I\u2019m not like the commenters on BestGore\u2014who call murdered women \u201cbitches who deserved it\u201d and LOL at \u201cincompetent\u201d Mexican drug lords who have to switch knives partway through a decapitation because theirs aren\u2019t sharp enough to cut through the neck tendons of their victims.

I\u2019m just scared.<br><br>There\u2019s a part in the Muath al-Kaseasbeh video, just before the fire reaches the cage, when al-Kaseasbeh puts his hands together in what I assume was prayer. If it was prayer, did it help him through the agony and the terror of his death? I hope it helped. And for the people who loved him who also watched the video\u2014and God I hope they didn\u2019t\u2014I hope it brought them some small comfort.<br><br>I know I am contributing to the humiliation and dehumanization of the victims whose deaths are caught on video. Knowing that millions of people\u2014 including your family and your friends and your enemies\u2014will watch what should be your private, natural death must be an added psychological torment. And I can\u2019t apologize enough to them for contributing to it. My guilt doesn\u2019t absolve me of my voyeurism. It only makes me more a part of these victims\u2019 abuse and pain.

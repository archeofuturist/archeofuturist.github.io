You can&#039;t have one without the other. You can&#039;t redistribute without taking money from someone and therefor impacting their ability to use the market. And you can intervene without someone losing money, almost always at the cost of those either in charge, or paying off those in charge. <br><br>So you find it more morally acceptable to force people into your own notions of a perfect society and what they should do, than to allow them to live in one where gov&#039;t has no say over what you can do so long as it doesn&#039;t damage another person. I&#039;m not sure you&#039;re in a position to argue morals if that&#039;s your stance. <br><br>It always starts with SOME economic intervention and then gets bigger, and bigger. That&#039;s exactly why I hate it so much. I&#039;m a business owner and it cost me almost 20K in legal fees just to open because of all the gov&#039;t costs. It costs roughly another 3-4k a month in taxes, insurance, and licensing just to keep my business legal. I make just over half of what I should be making thanks to socialism. The big companies I&#039;m competing against love it though. They own the media and push it hard, because they can buy a building in the Cayman Islands and say they&#039;re company is technically from their and not pay taxes. God bless socialism eh? Always helping the needing, and taking from the wealthy. All it really does is rob the middle class and give it to the poor so the rich can stay on top, and the poor feel like they have economic mobility.","time":1492675478,"resto":121958729,"id":"ZR+lQmIN","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121970485,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)04:05:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121969361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121969361<\/a><br>still more useful than socialism.","time":1492675556,"resto":121958729,"id":"ZR+lQmIN","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121970583,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)04:07:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121969787\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121969787<\/a><br>no its not, all you need is one amendment saying that gov&#039;t isn&#039;t allowed to grow past point X and there becomes no need for collusion because their is nothing to gain from colluding.

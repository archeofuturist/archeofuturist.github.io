The middle class exists, and the more literate it becomes the closer it gets to panemiming the behavior of the upper class. Acting as a translation layer the middle class facilitates cultural growth and exchanges between the other two classes. The assumption that subverting the post enlightenment foundation of liberty with information warfare and communism is somehow beneficial to the lowest class is false. It&#039;s beneficial to the upper class, by limiting exchanges between the classes and thus allowing the upper class to isolate power. These limitations are created by marxist political doctrine and are detrimental to the poor, not benificial to the poor.<br><br>Your post is a textbook example of psychological subversion. Tell the poor that what the rich want, the isolation of information and power in the upper class, is somehow good for them. You say that a logical person would be suspicious of liberty, Project Mockingbird in a nutshell! Tell poor people they are stupid if they don&#039;t want to be enslaved by a communist government!

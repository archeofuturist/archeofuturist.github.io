Oh, that&#039;s right. Coulter&#039;s talk hasn&#039;t even been scheduled yet. In fact, it&#039;s several days away at least. Does not having a plan to deplatform her now count as a loss? Is that what you&#039;re saying? Because if you&#039;re saying that I can assure you that you&#039;re wrong. Why would you make this topic when Coulter&#039;s talk hasn&#039;t even been officially scheduled? Antifa is still planning on being there and they&#039;ve been on the right side of history for how many years now? They&#039;re going to one of the worst Nazi infested areas in California who just happen to have more support because they&#039;re feeding off the energy of having Blackwater security this time. But you know what? They still fucking suck. Antifa is one of the best fucking organized protest groups in the US, they went 1000-0 last year in protests and Hillary wont the popular vote. Maybe you should shut the fuck up before you make retarded topics like this. You know why? Because you&#039;re going to be embarrassed when Antifa stomps the shit out of Ann Coulter and someone bumps this topic. Oh look at that, nobody that got arrested at the last protest is getting charged, just like at the one before. Are you a fucking drunk? Are you retarded? Are you autistic? You are a fucking idiot and you should never make a topic on this board again and I&#039;m fucking serious. I almost have a feeling you&#039;re the only guy making all these fascist topics because you&#039;re a faggot hater who doesn&#039;t like Antifa because they&#039;re good. Fuck you, be good at something in YOUR life and then maybe try to troll these fucking organizations on the board, like I give a fuck. It&#039;s so easy to spot out your threads now, you&#039;re a retard. Always doing stupid shit like this. Why don&#039;t you try to be a good poster? Just for once?

This is a diversionary tactic by shills to make it seem like the US is only against one side in the multi-faceted Syrian war which is a hodgepodge of warring factions. We killed more ISIS than Russia. We also kill terrorists in Iraq, while Russia just sticks to Syria.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If you start up trouble in Syria there&#039;ll be more refugees coming to Europe!<\/span><br>The only reason - drill this into your head, shills - the ONLY REASON refugees come to Europe is because Europe gives them free gibs to live there. European countries like Poland, Hungary and Czech Republic don&#039;t give them any gibs, and look at how many refugees they take: barely any. I have never seen a shill attempt to argue against this point.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I don&#039;t wanna sign up to die in Syria! I&#039;m dodging the draft!<\/span><br>Another shill tactic that thinks the US is still in 1960s mode during Vietnam. Nobody is going to Syria, much less any of you overweight autistic NEETs. Did you faggots get sent to Libya when we bombed it? How about Yemen? How about Serbia in 1999?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We should stick our nose out of the middle east and focus on our own issues<\/span><br>This is the only valid criticism. Non-interventionism would work in an ideal world but sadly we do not live in that time. The US has made it clear anyone using chemical weapons will be dealt with. If we stand on the side and do nothing, we look weak. And countries will begin using chemical weapons willy nilly without the threat of US retaliation hovering over them.","filename":"joepesci","ext":".jpg","w":459,"h":402,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":218,"tim":1491670832538,"time":1491670832,"md5":"AhE\/LB2RBbfnRDk6i+DJCw==","fsize":48204,"resto":0,"id":"LVG39Jon","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"deconstructing-shills-in-one-post","country_name":"United States","replies":15,"images":3,"unique_ips":12},{"no":120153678,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:02:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120153441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120153441<\/a><br>great thread, quality Pesci, I like the way you type anon","time":1491670963,"resto":120153441,"id":"DMATADT7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120153743,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:03:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"(holy fuck slid down from 1 to 6 in like a few minutes)","time":1491671007,"resto":120153441,"id":"DMATADT7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120153943,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:05:08","name":"Anonymous","filename":"turn it back on them and call them a the_donald redditor","ext":".jpg","w":1281,"h":562,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":54,"tim":1491671108598,"time":1491671108,"md5":"bbcLfPQ8ie9T+q\/j30nOQw==","fsize":140971,"resto":120153441,"id":"DMATADT7","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120154093,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:06:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Trump fucked up.

Trade is beneficial for both parties but if tariffs were to be incurred it would be European suppliers and manufactures who would miss out, especially if the UK were to organise FTA(s) with other nations like the USA, China and Japan. <br><br>Granted the UK has significant interests in the EU trading bloc, however it&#039;s only with other post-industrial nations like the Netherlands, France, Germany and Italy. Trade with the EU has been falling year on year since 1999. This doesn&#039;t even take into account how the UK has essentially been locked into this trading bloc, unable to organise their own trading arrangement independently. In addition to this, with emerging markets in India and China growing we&#039;ll see the balance of trade move further away from the current massive deficit we have with the East. So as their middle classes grow the UK will be in a much better position to take advantage of this than the EU as it&#039;s far more politically mobile and adaptable (26 nations needing to agree, rather than 1 nation pulling in the same direction). For more information on this, look at how long it&#039;s taken for the EU to organise a FTA with Japan. Oh wait, they still haven&#039;t yet. <br><br>It would be nice if all parties realised the advantages of continuing trading relations as they are. However if they&#039;re adamant they want to &#039;punish&#039; the UK for leaving, then they&#039;re cutting their nose to spite their face.","filename":"1485290986013","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492183029867,"time":1492183029,"md5":"20lDgoNcGQH09jZUZ+Y2Xw==","fsize":76301,"resto":121052129,"id":"yccW0IEL","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121071397,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:17:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121052129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121052129<\/a><br>because if you don&#039;t bow down to the mentally deranged merkel you&#039;ll be punished","time":1492183061,"resto":121052129,"id":"ufrd\/4UW","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121071610,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:19:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121071337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121071337<\/a><br>Beagle 2 makes me sad, really was so close to being a success.<br><br>It&#039;s great that the US has actually got some good photos and video back.","time":1492183173,"resto":121052129,"id":"2dlXU24d","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121071620,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)11:19:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"The ESA sucks major ass though and never really achieved anything great by themselves (remember beagle II).

Firstly, we are not in the White House. One could compare us, rather, to footsoldiers on the battlefield. We can\u2019t see the big picture of how things are going, or what the general\u2019s overall plan is \u2013 the only thing we can do is trust the man we chose to follow.<br><br>Just think for a moment about how the leaders of the \u201cAlt-Right\u201d is reacting to this situation. Controlled opposition such as Paul Joseph Watson and Richard Spencer are already condemning Trump before they even know where he\u2019s going with this, and they\u2019re trying to get you to do the same. Yes, I agree that Trump\u2019s actions seem strange, but at the end of the day the American people chose him to be their leader, and so it seems he deserves our faith the first time he does something we don\u2019t understand.<br><br>And if you still feel betrayed over this developing situation, remember that he\u2019s still going to be the leader of the free world for the next 4 years. You can\u2019t change his decisions by throwing down your weapons and going home. What would that achieve? It would just give leftists and the media real evidence to say that Trump is a failing president. I say we stand behind him now, whatever he does, and only at the end of his four years to we step back, look at what he\u2019s done and think, \u201cdid he do what he promised\u201d.","filename":"flag","ext":".jpg","w":251,"h":242,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":241,"tim":1491561794292,"time":1491561794,"md5":"TxBACC1kfLlB9fz6c+BM\/g==","fsize":14196,"resto":0,"id":"M18dbb2O","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"would-you-people-calm-down","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Just make sure that they are not tying the discussion of theistic ideals to religion. <br><br>You can set the foundation for your argument by discussing what your theistic ideology is, and depending on which you chose, you can elaborate on it and show what proof there is for said thing. Note, people frequently assume &quot;God&quot; has a limit in what God can be\/is, so if you were to say that you believe that naturalism is God, you&#039;ll run into the situation where the other person says &quot;That&#039;s just science, not God.&quot; This&#039;ll show a misunderstanding on their behalf for the various theistic ideals.","time":1490398720,"resto":118136469,"id":"5LjuGr13","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118152624,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)19:45:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118151829\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118151829<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A Lesson in Obfuscation: the post<\/span>","time":1490399111,"resto":118136469,"id":"eJKZmNK\/","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118152654,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)19:45:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118141730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118141730<\/a><br>Dont use your heart, use your brain. You are worshipping a evil god. No one can say their god is a good good since people are starving and worse. The bible is brutal and mercyless. For me Christianity seems like satanism. Isnt that something lucifer would do? Either way we cant know for sure, so the logical way to go trough life is not worshipping anyone unless youre sure. I just hope for my Grandma&#039;s sake im wrong on the satanism part.","filename":"1489504831724","ext":".jpg","w":345,"h":383,"tn_w":112,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490399127882,"time":1490399127,"md5":"McNgKCR3hpZX4iWLnMlNTg==","fsize":115834,"resto":118136469,"id":"47N9fs+d","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":118154194,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)19:57:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118152624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118152624<\/a><br>I&#039;ll make it simple for your simple mind:<br><br>There are many ways to define god, and just because someone uses that word doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re using it in the way you have been conditioned to use it","time":1490399834,"resto":118136469,"id":"V0otxfbm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

They don&#039;t let just anybody direct Godzilla movies. I&#039;d recommend watching Tokyo Decadence first for a thematic foundation, however finding that movie in its uncut form can be difficult. And the cut isn&#039;t just a couple of seconds of ass or something, entire scenes are missing and the story is left with a couple of holes and inconsistencies in many versions.<br><br>Hideaki Anno is very good at dealing with introspection in a visual way rather than just having characters monologue like they&#039;re in a book. I really like that. The movie has a very unique and intimate look to it because it&#039;s all filmed with handheld cameras with lots of awkward closeups, fisheye shots and other unusual techniques. And despite being an autist he seems to have a very good grasp on the inner workings of women, he supposedly reads trashy romance novels in his spare time to learn how they think.<br><br>Very cool movies both of them.","filename":"Tokyo_Decadence_DVD","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":427,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491223342097,"time":1491223342,"md5":"b7UsRVd0bC6TUeM2mtAZRQ==","fsize":61067,"resto":119321909,"id":"+08OOQm6","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119323750,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:42:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;UN failed by not supporting American interventionism and regime change<\/span>","filename":"1490500106172","ext":".png","w":1372,"h":917,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491223347155,"time":1491223347,"md5":"PiORPqMiCIVltiVDyhjV4Q==","fsize":1025165,"resto":119321909,"id":"CNT4sSOH","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119323752,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:42:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"(((AFRICA)))<br>WE NEED TO HELP THEM!!!<br>BRING THEM IN!!!!<br><br>KEKED!!!!","time":1491223349,"resto":119321909,"id":"xrwJ\/rBr","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119323758,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:42:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119323711\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119323711<\/a><br>Not really that cheap but definitely doable.","time":1491223353,"resto":119321909,"id":"kDx\/DqXe","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119323776,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:42:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fucking Africa","time":1491223362,"resto":119321909,"id":"a+cj8d79","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119323798,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:42:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119323343\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119323343<\/a><br>Hey man.. that was pretty hard to watch..","time":1491223374,"resto":119321909,"id":"VS7o\/iFz","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119323800,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:42:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119323704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119323704<\/a><br>they wouldnt have randomly taken your dog, take care of your dog you dickhead","time":1491223376,"resto":119321909,"id":"u\/yIIBzs","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119323808,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:43:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"threadly reminder","filename":"qanda thread essential","ext":".png","w":670,"h":71,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":13,"tim":1491223383280,"time":1491223383,"md5":"Qglbca\/Y8M3QCp+1iWJcPg==","fsize":6797,"resto":119321909,"id":"Pny2SE2U","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119323835,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:43:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;giving this shit leftist tv show viewer numbers<\/span><br><br>Shame on you all","time":1491223407,"resto":119321909,"id":"HS+Syjhx","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119323848,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:43:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119323752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119323752<\/a><br>gibs them all ur money!","time":1491223413,"resto":119321909,"id":"YUgbQuPw","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119323850,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:43:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Thats it for another week, anyone gonna call in on the radio show?","time":1491223415,"resto":119321909,"id":"\/zYQJ9p7","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119323856,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:43:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119322844\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119322844<\/a><br>WE WUZ ENLIGHTENED SEAFARERS N SHIEET","time":1491223419,"resto":119321909,"id":"+08OOQm6","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119323863,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:43:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;that veiled threat<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if we don&#039;t do anything they&#039;ll have to come here<\/span>","time":1491223428,"resto":119321909,"id":"8+63JRZe","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119323880,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:43:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119323798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119323798<\/a><br>those are the so called &quot;rebels&quot; who the Turks and Saudis are funding.<br>USA used to train them and give them TOW missiles","time":1491223437,"resto":119321909,"id":"CNT4sSOH","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119323888,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:44:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119323711\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119323711<\/a><br>Ooooh who knows, are you going to be in the qanda thread next week?

For family, for someone you love, for someone who is genetically like you.<br>All other empathy is not only WEAKNESS but a LIE. Liberal political empathy is a cunning ploy on many levels, but at its root it is pure weakness. Liberals are people who are either afraid or incapable of feeling strong emotions, and use &quot;empathy&quot; as a cover for their true feelings.<br>I have come to terms with the fact that my empathetic feelings for the &quot;other&quot; in the past were a lie and a cover as well. Contempt, disgust, and hatred are very unpleasant to experience. In the past, I would have rather felt pity and even empathy for a pathetic, abominable creature than to be honest. That was a self-protective, defensive move on my part - I didn&#039;t want to have to face my own disgust, contempt, and hatred for the &quot;other&quot;.<br><br>The &quot;empathy&quot; people use as a front is their own weakness in being unable to face their TRUE emotions. However, your HATRED will serve you much better as defense than your &quot;EMPATHY&quot; ever would. Embrace your true senses - they are their to help you. Empathy (and accompanying (((guilt)))) are false constructions that will end up hurting you.<br><br>Empathy is immature. Be honest.<br>There is NO INTERSECTION, by definition, between the SELF and the OTHER. Empathy is a false construction that the weak use to protect themselves from the truth.","filename":"empathy lie","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491840877684,"time":1491840877,"md5":"8c2hM6PCtU2iJmBsd0gWVA==","fsize":150166,"resto":0,"id":"b5+CcG1t","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"empathy-is-a-lie","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120454406,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)12:21:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120453660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120453660<\/a><br>Yeah, okay, miss anthrope","time":1491841293,"resto":120453660,"id":"P5SKpqZX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

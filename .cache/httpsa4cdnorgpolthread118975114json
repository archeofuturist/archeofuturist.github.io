I happened to stumble on my state&#039;s Republican Senator&#039;s official page <br><br>I noticed something strange about the comments. Not only were they all negative, but they all seemed to follow a similar script. A lot of the comments on unrelated posts were admonishing him for supporting DeVos and Pruitt and giving the same values for money he supposedly took. If it was something he did that was bipartisan, the script looked like &quot;That&#039;s great, but [liberal issue I&#039;m outraged about.&quot; I know leftists like to repeat the same tired talking points they hear from their favorite dyke commentators, but this was different in the sheer amount of comments that were almost exactly the same. <br><br>It was obvious that there was more to it than people acting on their own behalf. Gardner already got in trouble for saying that the people demanding he hold town hall meetings for them to disrupt were paid protestors from out of state. He made the same statement about the flood of phone calls his office received. I did a little digging to see where these people were finding their scripts, and I came across something called &quot;Indivisible Guide.&quot;<br>https:\/\/www.indivisibleguide.com\/<br>Lo and behold, they not only had a full guide for disrupting and harassing anyone who disagreed with them, which they claim is based on Tea Party activists, but also a page dedicated to scripts for various issues","filename":"1490318529608","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":778,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":243,"tim":1490911263466,"time":1490911263,"md5":"7zZtgngLtiD7hsRfE7ohuw==","fsize":246433,"resto":0,"id":"MCRFr+BV","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"indivisible-guide-fight-back-against-leftists","country_name":"United States","replies":21,"images":2,"unique_ips":11},{"no":118975155,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)18:01:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s clear that this is coming from someone higher up.

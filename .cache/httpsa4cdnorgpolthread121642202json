One of the primary reasons this is believed is because of the animal imagery very common in early Roman mythology, art, culture, and even armor designs. Wolves, for example, played a central role in Roman society and religious belief all the way until the fall of the Roman Empire, with wolf pelts commonly being worn by Roman officers and high ranking Roman officials. Animal worship, idolizing animals, etc, especially wolves (who were far more common in the Northern Germanic regions at the time than they were in Italy), was common mostly with Germanic cultures and societies. Most Italian societies did not idolize animals - this was thoroughly a Germanic practice at the time and it clearly sets the Roman society apart from other Italian societies. <br><br>For this reason,

Blacks like to point to the muslim invasion of North Africa, but if you look at the hundreds of portraits of Egyptians from around year 0 (700 years before Muhammed), they&#039;re all identical to modern day Egyptians. Was the entire black population of Egypt magically wiped out during some unknown event that no ancient historian thought was worth mentioning?<br><br>I mean, in the countless examples of conquests throughout history, there are virtually no examples of the conquerors actually wiping out or supplanting the natives, with the exception of the European conquest of the Americas, New Zealand and Australia. Even in Spain, which was occupied by moors for almost a century, the admixture is only about 7%.<br><br>Also, during the massive migration period in Europe in the final days of the Roman Empire, the northern and central European migrants rarely made up more than 10% of the population in the areas they conquered or settled in. Likewise, the Roman and Greek admixture in central Europe rarely makes up more than 10-15%.<br>If we ignore the mass migration over the past 50 years or so, most countries have the same genetic composition as they did thousands of years ago. Even the Jews, who everyone has tried to wipe out for thousands of year, still exist and can trace most of their genetics back to the middle east.","time":1492501820,"resto":121642202,"id":"XKv7uw3\/","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121655639,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)03:51:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121654645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121654645<\/a><br>I actually couldn&#039;t stand the art style used in that movie.

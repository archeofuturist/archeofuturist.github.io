I notice a shitload of people on 4chan get INTJ yet its supposedly the forth\/third rarest type and also most INTJs are intellectual alphas. I think the reason for this is because fags keep picking the middle answer without actually &quot;believing&quot; it because they either don&#039;t understand the question or can be bothered to actually meditate on a particular question. Ever since i became aware that i was an INTJ and really understood what it meant to be an INTJ my life changed, i always thought i was wrong for not fitting in with people but its just that i&#039;m too logical.

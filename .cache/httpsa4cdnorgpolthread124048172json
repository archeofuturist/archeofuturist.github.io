The answer to that question is noone. You might think the elites might use it to rid the earth of their enemies and reduce population, but even for them this way of doing it a) causes to many side effects and influence on nature and b) has too many variables, since you can&#039;t be sure who nukes where and you can&#039;t plan the outcome good enough to be able to stabilize a new society afterwards.<br><br>I mean look at the war zones we have today, war isn&#039;t what it used to be and the war in those countries is neverending. In a land where the infrastructure is destroyed, economics don&#039;t exist anymore and people lost all good belief there will be only chaos. This chaos would last for at least some decades and again the outcome would be very unstable and hard to plan for.<br><br>Second we have to ask ourselves why everyone keeps their bombs then. This one is simple and you heard it before: So no madman can push the button without killing himself. And there is a second answer: You can use nuclear weapons on a smaller scale for tactical combat. Small rounds with nuclear parts that wreck a lot of devastation will come, will be in use and will not influence nature too much. You can predict the outcome. This is very dangerous and unsettling, but won&#039;t lead to an all out nuclear war.<br><br>And there there is someting else people don&#039;t think about enough: Having an all out nuclear war only occurs when it is clear who shot first. All scenarios are like &quot;A attacks B who is partners with C, they shoot back but A is partners with D and will retaliate.&quot; and so on. Have you ever thought about that the &quot;new&quot; nuclear danger is not countries nuking it each other, but CovertOps looking like terrorist action? If you are Putin you could easily set up a CovertOps of Pseudo-Terrorists getting a quite small bomb into NY for example. You could blow up the city, and the US could not react.","filename":"1491895215258","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493894903531,"time":1493894903,"md5":"pRjhfHES9WqEZXiEPeEJLg==","fsize":61326,"resto":0,"id":"jJcL5u9h","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"will-there-be-nuclear-war","country_name":"Germany","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":124048201,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:48:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"In this scenario you would be able to influence politics on a large scale. Just imagine a US where NY got nuked but noone knows where it came from. They only thing the US could do without being the madman who pushes random nuke button they would have to do the same as with 911: Attack countries they wanted to attack anyways with regular warfare. They would HAVE to do that since the public wouldn&#039;t be able to deal with the fact that you have no clue what to do. But again: This won&#039;t cause an all out nuclear war. It could lead to WW3, and possibly would shake every society on earth, but it won&#039;t end in nuclear holocaust.<br><br>So given all this, is nuclear holocaust even possible? Yes it is. But only if someone with much power and no regard for himself and the outcome is able to push the button without other people verifying it. Right now I&#039;m not aware of a country that a) HAS nukes b) is that radical and c) has a president with so much power that he can push the button alone, without his staff killing him before he can.<br><br>So my answer: Don&#039;t hope for it or be afraid, it just won&#039;t happen. Noone would profit.","time":1493894924,"resto":124048172,"id":"jJcL5u9h","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":124048217,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:48:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Not this year and not very soon.","time":1493894939,"resto":124048172,"id":"OnGjvcjD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124048221,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:49:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Also a bit I want to add about MAD - Mutual Assured Destruction, since some people seem to not really get the concept:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mutual assured destruction or mutually assured destruction (MAD) is a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender (see pre-emptive nuclear strike and second strike).[1] It is based on the theory of deterrence, which holds that the threat of using strong weapons against the enemy prevents the enemy&#039;s use of those same weapons. The strategy is a form of Nash equilibrium in which, once armed, neither side has any incentive to initiate a conflict or to disarm.<\/span><br><br>The whole idea behind this is that not only can two nuclear powers not nuke each other without themselves ceasing to exist, but this also implies that no major war of any kind can take place between those powers, since it would lead sooner or later to a nuclear war and again both countries would cease to exist. You can see the resulting behaviour in countries like Pakistan \/ India: They hate each other but they can&#039;t do shit. The only thing they do is bee stings, mutilating soldiers, stealing stuff and in general just being a pain in the ass for the opposing country. There will never be war between those two because it is impossible. Same goes for all nuclear powers on the planet.<br><br>In fact nuclear power become more moderate, not more aggressive.

You people think your opinions are so important and that you possess some natural-born expertise. But take it from ME, a REAL expert, when I say your comments are even more stupider than you people making them. Now I have a lot of experience, so when I say something, it counts. That&#039;s because I&#039;m very important and I know what I&#039;m talking about, unlike feeble-minded you. I see you want to retort by posting a reply, do you? PSHAW!!! You can&#039;t post a reply to me because you&#039;re speechless, and you&#039;re too AFRAID. Besides, no one wants to hear your stupidness anyway.<br><br>Do you know who I am? I have 9 black belts, 15 Masters degrees and a PhD in Applied Arithmetic. That&#039;s right, you know I&#039;m way better than you, and all my fans and supporters will gladly tell you how great and awesome I am! Have you seen my power level? It&#039;s over 9000! You know what that means? It means I have more than 9000 units of POWER. It also puts my total adjusted force rating at 22000! That&#039;s more than triple, so you don&#039;t want to make me mad because anger is my middle name, and I give love a bad name, which only makes me angrier.<br><br>Remember: He who laughs last, laughs last. So, go ahead, I dare you to write a reply to my comment. I DOUBLE dare you to write a reply to my comment. But I know you won&#039;t reply to my comment because YOU&#039;RE ALL TOO AFRAID.","filename":"m437","ext":".jpg","w":1238,"h":937,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":94,"tim":1493892688889,"time":1493892688,"md5":"lFsre6t6Rt6CvL1L2SG+mg==","fsize":326016,"resto":124043942,"id":"8KMx2I35","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124046199,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:20:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124043942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124043942<\/a><br>Also Tobirama best Hokage.

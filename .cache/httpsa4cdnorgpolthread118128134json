Even with other Republican presidents, the (((media))) wasn&#039;t so single-mindedly hell-bent on destroying them. And the polls are all conducted at the behest of those same (((media))) conglomerates. The outcome of any given poll tends to be very much in line with the narrative of whoever paid to conduct it. Funny coincidence, that.<br><br>Here&#039;s an example. Less than a month from the election, a poll claimed Hillary would win Pennsylvania by a comfy 8 points or so. Having done grassroots work for the campaign, that just didn&#039;t match what I was seeing on the ground. So I dissected the raw data in the poll (the stuff they&#039;re required to publish, but put all the way at the bottom, expecting no one will read it). The demographic weighting was completely absurd, effectively doubling the black population of the state, and tripling the Hispanic population. I adjusted their formulas to reflect the actual demographics of the state, based on the most recently available data. The result I got was Trump winning by a tight margin, shockingly similar to the actual outcome.<br><br>Herein lies the black magic of polling. You can take any given set of raw data, apply some arbitrary &quot;sample correction&quot; formula to it, and get whatever output you want. This is a much more effective method of obfuscating your shenanigans than the old method of deliberately oversampling a specific demographic - i.e. if you are doing an opinion poll regarding a Republican and only question people in San Francisco, no one is going to care that you found him to have a 12% approval rating. That is far too transparent. But take a more legitimate sample, hide it behind a few layers of algebra, and suddenly it becomes completely opaque as only a truly weaponized autist will ever bother to reverse your formulas and reveal you as the charlatan you are.","time":1490390361,"resto":118128134,"id":"LrCcBkV4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

It is based on the relative \u201cwhole number of persons in each state,\u201d as outlined in the 14th Amendment. When this language was inserted into the U.S. Constitution, the concept of an \u201cillegal immigrant,\u201d as the term is defined today, had no meaning. Thus the census counts illegal immigrants and other noncitizens equally with citizens. Since the census is used to determine the number of House seats apportioned to each state, those states with large populations of illegal immigrants and other noncitizens gain extra seats in the House at the expense of states with fewer such \u201cwhole number of persons.\u201d<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This math gives strongly Democratic states an unfair edge in the Electoral College. Using citizen-only population statistics, American University scholar Leonard Steinhorn projects California would lose five House seats and therefore five electoral votes. New York and Washington would lose one seat, and thus one electoral vote apiece. These three states, which have voted overwhelming for Democrats over the latest six presidential elections, would lose seven electoral votes altogether.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The GOP\u2019s path to victory, by contrast, depends on states that would lose a mere three electoral votes in total. Republican stronghold Texas would lose two House seats and therefore two electoral votes. Florida, which Republicans must win to reclaim the presidency, loses one seat and thus one electoral vote.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The 10 House seats taken away from these states would then need to be reallocated to states with relatively small numbers of noncitizens. The following ten states, the bulk of which lean Republican, would likely gain one House seat and thus one additional electoral vote: Iowa, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.politico.com\/magazine\/st<wbr>ory\/2015\/10\/illegal-immigrants-coul<wbr>d-elect-hillary-clinton-213216","filename":"734987538495935","ext":".png","w":1182,"h":808,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1492798613188,"time":1492798613,"md5":"mVLhBK6CnabCNfHVw2HE5A==","fsize":844596,"resto":122164852,"id":"ruHLEd5u","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122165004,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:16:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122164852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122164852<\/a><br>Been a while for a few hours.

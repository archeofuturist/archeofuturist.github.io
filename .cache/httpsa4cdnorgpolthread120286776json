However, they also live in societies with very little social trust.<br><br>What does this mean?<br><br>This means that whereas in the West we sort of have a relative &quot;mutual disarmament&quot; when it comes to petty competition, our yellow cousins are fucking ALWAYS switched on.<br><br>Every iota of energy and wealth must be consumed in a struggle to avoid being outcompeted in ANY way by fellow members of society.<br><br>This produces a runaway effect where competition spirals into what by white standards appears to be complete madness.<br><br>Any &quot;wasting&quot; of effort or energy on anything which would benefit society at the expense of the individual becomes a &quot;defeat.&quot;<br><br>You can&#039;t have any public rubbish bins because ruthlessly competitive individuals would abuse them and dispose of their waste in them to save a few dollars on rubbish bags.<br><br>You can&#039;t have traffic safety because the few minutes waiting for the lights to change are weighed against the &quot;wasted&quot; time.<br><br>You can&#039;t accept having even slight physical defects like slight weight gain or unideal genetic inheritences like a big nose or a slightly wonky chin because you know that every employer asks for photos and your competition are all on diets surgery and photoshop too <br><br>You can&#039;t have clean air because Manager Kim wanted to save expense at his factory and the official in charge of air safety is in debt.<br><br>Basically when everyone is hypercalculating and trying to obtain advantages over one another the result is a miserable dystopia. Ironically, the fact that whites often seem a little duller and less self-aware than Asians is a boon to both their quality of life and their sanity. The &quot;just right&quot; porridge of intelligence without the misery that hyperawareness and the consequent hypercompetition brings.","filename":"IMG_1969","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":804,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":196,"tim":1491747558921,"time":1491747558,"md5":"G0eePlN7mQYKkHzoc0fd5A==","fsize":220446,"resto":0,"id":"Sa0G8jyl","country":"KR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-asia-as-a-place-sucks-despite-asians-being","country_name":"South Korea","replies":17,"images":6,"unique_ips":11},{"no":120286931,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)10:21:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120286776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120286776<\/a><br>India is the best country in Asia","filename":"dalermehndi","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491747664942,"time":1491747664,"md5":"zQu22N0LOuDnz7rLA43I6Q==","fsize":77403,"resto":120286776,"id":"O7f8WlSU","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120287040,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)10:22:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120286776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120286776<\/a><br><br>Simple, you&#039;re not intelligent.","filename":"1480717108880","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":481,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491747736549,"time":1491747736,"md5":"5xIQVEBU1U45a8rm6AXf7Q==","fsize":32814,"resto":120286776,"id":"3ynXwQTG","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120287206,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)10:24:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120286776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120286776<\/a><br>population density","time":1491747849,"resto":120286776,"id":"D3FltXBM","country":"SG","country_name":"Singapore"},{"no":120287277,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)10:24:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120286776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120286776<\/a><br>Asians are slightly better at certain logical thought processes.

He has to go out of town for a 2 day training. The gov is filling empty Selective Service Board seats that have not been filled for decades. Draft is coming. <br><br>Here&#039;s a definition of the local board:<br>A Selective Service local board is a group of five citizen volunteers appointed by the Director of Selective Service on behalf of the President, based on recommendations made by their respective state governors or an equivalent public official.. These men and women play an important community role closely connected with our nation&#039;s defense. If a military draft becomes necessary, approximately 2,000 local boards throughout the United States, territories, and the District of Columbia would decide who among the registrants in their community will receive deferments, postponements, or exemption from military service based on the individual registrant&#039;s circumstances and beliefs.&quot;<br><br>Today this post was made by another user:<br><br>&quot;I have been volunteering as a board member of the SSS for over ten years. All correspondence up until today has been with the State Director and\/or the RFO (Reserve Force Officer). The military handles the administration of the Selective Service System UNTIL it becomes activated. At that point, a civilian administrator takes charge.<br><br>Today, I received an email from the Operations Manager of the Selective Service System for our region asking to confirm contact information. Not typical! Is this system gearing up?<br><br>I believe there is an effort to include women in the draft in the 2017 NDAA. I volunteered to serve but never hoped to have it go hot. I am very unsettled about this development.&quot;<br><br>Links:<br><br>http:\/\/www.godlikeproductions.com\/f<wbr>orum1\/message3502961\/pg1<br><br>http:\/\/www.godlikeproductions.com\/f<wbr>orum1\/message3510639\/pg1<br><br><br>North Korea war when?","filename":"sss","ext":".png","w":225,"h":225,"tn_w":225,"tn_h":225,"tim":1493242781560,"time":1493242781,"md5":"IZ\/0sItpx\/Dh1T5D8P\/r2A==","fsize":16885,"resto":0,"id":"vW8vAS0I","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"draft-incoming","country_name":"United States","replies":19,"images":3,"unique_ips":13},{"no":122943877,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:41:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;godlikeproductions<\/span>","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493242893599,"time":1493242893,"md5":"sPasy3LqXokR2MzoOpACvQ==","fsize":51072,"resto":122943633,"id":"WrtsOHps","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122943970,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:42:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122943877\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122943877<\/a><br><br>It&#039;s the baby boomer version of \/pol\/.","time":1493242938,"resto":122943633,"id":"vW8vAS0I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122944282,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:44:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;glp<\/span><br>You have to go back","time":1493243082,"resto":122943633,"id":"OiTezcTD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122944569,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:46:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122943633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122943633<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;glp<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pardon us while we hijack your browser window and force you to close a bunch of ad Windows.

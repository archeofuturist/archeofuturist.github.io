Trump was never going to save us, he is a vehicle for our ideas and a means to legitimize our movement to a greater degree. This has already happened.

No, which means we aren&#039;t going to be. <br><br>Do kikes still run the country? Yes, but they&#039;re not totally in control, that much is definitely true. We&#039;ve won a partial victory.

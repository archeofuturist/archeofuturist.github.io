Gay and transgender activists in Europe have argued for years that the sterilization requirement was an institutionalized violation of human rights, and last week the European Court of Human Rights agreed.<br><br>On April 6, it issued a ruling in favor of three transgender people in France who had been barred from changing the names and genders on their birth certificates because they had not been sterilized. In so doing, activists said, the court set a new legal standard that calls for changes to laws in 22 countries under its jurisdiction.<br><br>The European Court of Human Rights, in the French city of Strasbourg, ruled that the sterilization requirement was a violation of Article Eight of the European Convention on Human Rights, which states \u201ceveryone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.\u201d<br><br>The case was filed by three French citizens, identified in the ruling as \u00c9mile Gar\u00e7on, St\u00e9phane Nicot and by the initials A.P., and the decision is legally binding only in France, where the issue has already been settled by legislative action: Last October it did away with the sterilization requirement and adopted revised procedures for legally changing a name and gender.<br><br>But the ruling set a new legal standard for all 47 countries that have signed the European Convention, many of which did not require sterilization in the first place and some of which \u2014 like Russia and Turkey \u2014 are not members of the European Union.","filename":"tranny","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":465,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492093013322,"time":1492093013,"md5":"dsuEHj7Rxf0g\/toYPRqLgA==","fsize":32586,"resto":0,"id":"vkjjdlqF","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"european-court-strikes-down-sterilization","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120915086,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:27:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120914045\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120914045<\/a><br>bump","time":1492093629,"resto":120914045,"id":"JjBbX0Rl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

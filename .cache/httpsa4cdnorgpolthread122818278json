Fillon voter can be turned and vote Le Pen, but Melenchon supporters will never vote for le Pen. However, these Melenchon supporters are already planning on not voting. There is a hashtag going on #SansMoiLe7mai, calling for abstention on their side. We need to push that. If they don&#039;t go vote then the balance is going stronger on Marine Le Pen side because people already voting for her will definitely go and vote for her. So basically, turn Fillon supporters to le Pen, and make Melenchon and Hamon supporters disgusted by the election so they stay home. <br>Example of meme: a split image of a banker and of a nzi parade

Results claiming that mixes result in depressives, mental illness, defects, etc. are very much potentially flawed as they take a small, recent population and compare it against the masses.<br>Mixed people are selectively created rather than created at random across social class, and the poor tend to be more likely to racemix as a result of diversity in low income areas. This means we are comparing a de facto largely poor group against groups of varying class, and in many instances the data does not get scaled to account for this. People just report raw information comparing mixed people to non mixed people. At the same time, the poor are also more likely to be afflicted with defects, ugliness, and medical conditions across all races. This means this may be more of a result of bad traits further manifesting themselves than it specifically being a problem of racemixing itself. It&#039;s akin to taking a bike made from broken parts of two already broken bikes, comparing it to a good bike, and then blaming the problem on the fact that you mixed the bikes, rather than the fact that you took broken bike parts.<br><br>A proper way to alleviate this problem would be to test batches of mixed children and compare the number of issues they have specifically against their own parents and close relatives. This way, we can see if mixing is the problem, or if it&#039;s more just children inheriting the problems of their parents and that the poor people who tend to racemix more also tend to have more problems.","time":1491657889,"resto":120129441,"id":"mt8ndwTs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120131103,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:27:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120129807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120129807<\/a><br><br>This is only true with breeding a small breed to a large breed.

Just got back from it, the girlfriend wanted to see it.<br><br>Thought it was decent, true to the original for most of it but I noticed some additions that were blatant Hollywood political additions. <br><br>1. Multiple interracial relationships in 18th century France.<br>2.Lefou breaks from the original gaston song to announce that he is illiterate. <br>2. Librarian is black, makes confused face when the illiterate and uneducated whites go off to kill the beast. <br>3. Scene where a man tells belle to stop teaching a little girl to learn how to read. <br>4. Lefou has a homosexual crush on Gaston<br>5. Castle attacker forcibly dressed 3 men in women&#039;s clothes. One attacker smiles flirtatiously seeming enjoying cross-dressing.<br><br>I know why, but I still have to ask, why does Hollywood want to ruin great movies by adding garbage to them in the name of diversity, current political ideologies, etc?<br><br>The original Beauty and the Beast is a great movie, and actually the first movie I ever saw in theaters as a kid. This one was decent, but these small additions really turned me off.<br><br>Thoughts?","filename":"beast","ext":".jpg","w":186,"h":271,"tn_w":171,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490067973664,"time":1490067973,"md5":"grXXQsaG+BvsrCzffNLRYw==","fsize":12830,"resto":0,"id":"KxHcaj3a","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"beauty-and-the-beast-politically-correct-edition","country_name":"United States","replies":32,"images":2,"unique_ips":17},{"no":117582541,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)23:47:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"I fucked up on the bullet points but you get the idea...","time":1490068071,"resto":117582360,"id":"KxHcaj3a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117582639,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)23:48:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117582360\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117582360<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thoughts?<\/span><br>Leave this place and never come back","time":1490068125,"resto":117582360,"id":"dnqKq7LZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117582860,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)23:50:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117582360\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117582360<\/a><br>Im surprised the beast wasnt a nigger after the change.","time":1490068250,"resto":117582360,"id":"VoMHOqlY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117582939,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)23:51:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117582860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117582860<\/a><br>haha that would have really been a plot twist.","time":1490068297,"resto":117582360,"id":"KxHcaj3a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117583221,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)23:54:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117582360\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117582360<\/a><br>do us a favor and pirate it or dont watch that shit","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490068453443,"time":1490068453,"md5":"0u+f9KJYeRP5fvhPA+yaZw==","fsize":312035,"resto":117582360,"id":"IIoQpvWn","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117583288,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)23:54:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117582860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117582860<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;beast is black<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there is no spell, the townspeople just call him a beast because they&#039;re evil racist whites<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;belle who is an enlightened young womyn ignores the townspeople and starts a forbidden relationship with the beast<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;townspeople go to attack the beast but are confronted by belle and the beast together who enlighten the townspeople and break their racism<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;townspeople admit they have no problem with the beast or belle and the beasts relationship, they were just scared of changing times and they have no learned to accept all cultures now<\/span>","time":1490068490,"resto":117582360,"id":"OTX1yQpB","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117583423,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)23:56:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Movie has gay moments which has nothing to do with the story<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We hold the movie to be released for a while<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We decided to release it anyways, but we&#039;re gonna cut that scene on cinema<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Disney throws a hiss fit and decided to outright refuse to release the movie here.<\/span><br><br>Feels good man.","time":1490068574,"resto":117582360,"id":"ZeQgVBso","country":"MY","country_name":"Malaysia"},{"no":117583554,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)23:57:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117582360\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117582360<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;4.

Beast had blue eyes the entire time, not a nigger.<br>2. Beast was rich, well educated, well dressed. Not a nigger.<br>3. Belle was still only attracted to his wealth (his library sealed the deal), and without the quirky talking appliances, she never would have fallen in love with him. Typical thot.<br>4. Masculinity was celebrated. Belle asked the beast to grow a beard at the very end because she realized he now looked feminine. Belle likes manly man. <br>5.

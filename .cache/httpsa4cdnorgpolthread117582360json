Just got back from it, the girlfriend wanted to see it.<br><br>Thought it was decent, true to the original for most of it but I noticed some additions that were blatant Hollywood political additions. <br><br>1. Multiple interracial relationships in 18th century France.<br>2.Lefou breaks from the original gaston song to announce that he is illiterate. <br>2. Librarian is black, makes confused face when the illiterate and uneducated whites go off to kill the beast. <br>3. Scene where a man tells belle to stop teaching a little girl to learn how to read. <br>4. Lefou has a homosexual crush on Gaston<br>5. Castle attacker forcibly dressed 3 men in women&#039;s clothes. One attacker smiles flirtatiously seeming enjoying cross-dressing.<br><br>I know why, but I still have to ask, why does Hollywood want to ruin great movies by adding garbage to them in the name of diversity, current political ideologies, etc?<br><br>The original Beauty and the Beast is a great movie, and actually the first movie I ever saw in theaters as a kid.

It tends to come down to &quot;how easily and how likely can two animals produce offspring&quot; to separate 2 animals into subspecies. Because any kind of research into that is considered scientific racism, and therefore pseudoscience, an official answer is unlikely. Africans and Europeans&#039; last common ancestor is Homo Erectus, they had about 2 million years to evolve in separate conditions. Europeans lived in a cold environment, and therefore had to evolve to be &quot;smarter&quot; to survive the winters, grow crops, etc. Africans live in an environment that provides for them. They don&#039;t need to adapt to survive the seasons. Basically, they&#039;re closer to Homo Erectus than other races, which explains a lot. In my opinion, blacks are a subspecies of Homo Sapiens, but what do I know, it&#039;s just pseudoscience.","time":1491410852,"resto":119618171,"id":"ALp7JpLl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119625367,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)12:47:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119618171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119618171<\/a><br>Bruh","time":1491410871,"resto":119618171,"id":"QCJalZ1x","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119625496,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)12:49:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119618171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119618171<\/a><br>YES","filename":"539942_1120392784734019_2733329544665752992_n","ext":".jpg","w":684,"h":960,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491410941527,"time":1491410941,"md5":"c9hT6Dy7bfCK\/6e8ipzo4Q==","fsize":92939,"resto":119618171,"id":"DuqkljoD","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":119625936,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)12:53:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119620420\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119620420<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not true<\/span><br>just because there are examples to the contrary doesn&#039;t make what is more of a standard or definition &quot;not true&quot;. it&#039;s not a concrete fact, it&#039;s what scientists agree on as a measure of what defines a species. <br><br>if you have a better definition of species i&#039;d love to hear it.","time":1491411197,"resto":119618171,"id":"RwCa+Ft9","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119626640,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:00:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119625936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119625936<\/a><br>Are you retarded or just trolling?<br>He said that the simple fact of generating fertile offspring excluded the possibility of different species.

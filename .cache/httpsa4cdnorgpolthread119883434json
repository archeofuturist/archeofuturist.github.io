This attack on Assad and Russia would have happened no matter who won in November.<br>I can only come to a few conclusions.<br><br>1) Trump did this attack to differentiate himself from do-nothing Obama, to send a message not so much to Putin and Assad, but to the rest of the world, particularly North Korea and China, that we&#039;re not kidding around and their shenanigans need to stop now. Not coincidentally he was with the Chinese President today.<br>1.a) Somebody inside is still leaking and got the word about the attack out to Hillary and others, and somehow the word got all the way to ISIS and Trump is playing 648956239xD Chess to find the leakers. <br>1.b) (FYSA: Bill Clinton and every other former President can still get a classified daily intel brief any time they want, meaning Hillary has access too.)<br><br>2) The Deep State decided long ago that Assad must go and was going to ensure that it happened no matter what and no matter who the president was, and they just proved that they&#039;re in charge and they control ISIS. This is the end of the sham of democracy in America. The Deep State is more than just Obama&#039;s holdovers and the 7th Floor Group, it includes all the PNAC\/Neocons\/ZOG, Neoliberals and others who have been burrowing into the establishment for AT LEAST the last 30 years, and all hope is lost short of armed revolution. <br><br>God how I wish it were 1, but given that McCain met with the rebels last month... How did South Park get it so right eight years ago?","filename":"Isisoffensive","ext":".png","w":613,"h":148,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":60,"tim":1491540273167,"time":1491540273,"md5":"J6bhOmIzW2qbXzsRPJwWTw==","fsize":22107,"resto":0,"id":"zYjACMln","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"knife-in-the-back","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Which is usually gimped. But \/ourguys\/ who are behind enemy lines hid the good guns and keep them tucked away for just such an occasion. <br><br>Just look at new york my home state(fuck this place). Because of the safeact so many people said fuck it and stashed their guns away. The registry only has like 25k names and most of them are cops\/retired cops and those guns are actually pistols. Meanwhile there could be up to 2 million unregistered guns in the state and not only do they not comply with cuomo&#039;s tyranny they probably have proper 30 round magazines and hidden pistols aswell. Also they could be importing guns into the state as we speak. Do you know easy it is to bring guns across state lines? Fuck the atf and state troopers. Are they gonna search every single car no? If they catch you and you say you were going to vermont what can they do? <br><br>My uncle in scranton knows of a guy who sells guns to new yorkers. At twice the price mind you but still he doesn&#039;t give a fuck. And lets say that antifa wants to buy from him?

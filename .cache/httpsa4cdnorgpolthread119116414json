And we will stand strong on the new reclaimed land.<br>We will try to always converse in the universal language of the almighty mongolian goat herding forum (English), or the mighty mods might smite us again (no seriously, fuck you mods). If you want something translated, we will do that for you. All \/pol\/acks are very welcome.<br><br>We are now past the TK2017 elections, and although the right and \/ourguys\/ have won, the battle has just commenced.

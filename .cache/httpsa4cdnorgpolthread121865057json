There was an uprising in Judea around the time of his birth, and these uprisings were often put down brutally, with rape by the occupiers being commonplace. This would explain the virgin birth rather neatly. Women who were preganant out of wedlock were at risk of being stoned to death (something that still happens in parts of the Middle East). That Joseph stepped up, and sacrificed to save Mary and Jesus, makes him the archetype of the kind and generous father. Dare I say it, generous Jews do exist. <br><br>Following this line of thinking, no one knows if Jesus&#039; father was a European Roman or a possibly a Roman conscript of local extraction. Tiberius Pantera, claimed very early (even in the Talmud) as the man who may fit the role, was possibly Semitic himself. He was a Roman archer and his gravestone was found in Germany in the 1800s. Even without looking any different from the rest of his community due to having European genes, Jesus probably felt himself an outsider, and this contributed to the chip on his shoulder and his willingness to criticize the religious and monetary authorities of his day.<br><br>It is indeed strange that the first writings mentioning Jesus come from Paul more than 20 years after his death. Paul was a Pharisee who zealously persecuted early followers of Jesus until he had a spontaneous conversion in a vision. He was also a Roman citizen. Most of the fantastic, hard-for-modern-atheists-to-accept parts of Jesus&#039; story come from Paul.<br><br>Of course it would only take a couple hundred years for Christianity to become the official religion of Rome and for Jesus&#039; birth to be &quot;officially&quot; moved to line up with the Pagan celebration of Saturnalia, as Rome sought to bring under its control the Germanic Pagan tribes. <br><br>There are certain parts of the story that are almost too neat.

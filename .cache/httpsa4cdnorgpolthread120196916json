Stop calling them liars, none of the falsehoods or glaring omissions in this propagandised fairy tale originate from Vox, and they never claimed to be investigative journalists. That said though, this video is making the rounds on social media and misleading a whole new wave of previously uninformed folk who don&#039;t generally keep up with the news. If you literally think the American military is in Syria due to outrage over crimes against humanity and not as part of a geopolitical chess game, I feel sorry for you. Please don&#039;t be the type of person that sees a Syrian child crying on CNN and thinks an American bombing campaign will cheer them up.","filename":"6c0caf65d7364ae0f68b7830989c3d005600a55628ebdbc5f2c7895e3edbc089","ext":".jpg","w":1156,"h":1056,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1491693168345,"time":1491693168,"md5":"6\/00AOsGrM34k8oqqbZfyA==","fsize":354494,"resto":120196916,"id":"6B8yjnGX","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120198658,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:13:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"At 30 seconds; &quot;up until now, the US has only been fighting ISIS&quot;, is beyond wrong. If the inorganic CIA\/twitter\/mercenary\/ jihadist origins of this conflict are brushed aside, that&#039;s still wrong. I suppose nobody in need of a run-down from Vox has a clear memory of the last time the CNN war drums were beating for a bombing campaign in Syria in response to a depressingly contrived &quot;Assad regime sarin gas attack&quot;. This video mentions that the American fleet, in position to bomb Assad, was forced to abandon their plans by a Russian fleet threatening confrontation is their ally Assad was attacked. This video makes no mention of that incident at all, but essentially what Trump is doing now was scheduled for 2012.","filename":"e289235c0ae41f0f4364324995719be4fe53aeb349e1f5ca219011c0d82ce39b","ext":".png","w":1572,"h":870,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1491693190683,"time":1491693190,"md5":"6xO7aaLYTjgFlTkP1p3J6g==","fsize":348496,"resto":120196916,"id":"6B8yjnGX","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120198733,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:13:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"The implication around 1:00 that there was one single united Syrian rebel faction called the Free Syrian Army until the maniacal dictator Assad deliberately infused the rebellion with jihadists is cartoonish. There have been a myriad of infighting rebel factions since day 1, and to this day I&#039;m unaware of one that is not jihadist. America directly arms, funds, and trains specific rebel groups that film themselves beheading children in the street, this is no exaggeration. The claim at 4:30 that the Americans only funded and trained rebels who fight ISIS, not Assad, is absolutely outlandish. Go have a look at what happened to all of Assad&#039;s tanks, they were smashed with brand new, extremely expensive TOW missiles they could only have got from America.","filename":"6c0847a7dedc9f468d856759fa1943c6ef48edba7004c1c626f655d102904f66","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":452,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1491693221616,"time":1491693221,"md5":"WBG61nZul8BaIs7TwTiQ5A==","fsize":34970,"resto":120196916,"id":"6B8yjnGX","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120198782,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:14:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Thanks for admitting at 1:50 that the Saudis and gulf states export Wahhabiism and fund jihadists, that was pretty mature of you. American funding suspiciously omitted. Remember that rebel training program the Americans ran in Turkey, where the trained rebels had a 100% defection rate to ISIS immediately after entering Syria?

You know who ISIS really suspiciously doesn&#039;t attack? Israel! Somehow ISIS managed to pop up on both sides of Israel in Syria and Sinai simultaneously, and they haven&#039;t laid a finder on Israel to date, odd for jihadists! Perhaps it has something to do with the well documented treatment of Syrian jihadist rebels in Israeli hospitals, the Israeli bombing of Assad&#039;s positions (also omitted from this video), and the Israeli annexation of the Syrian Golan heights?","filename":"0a7dffe700d060b2d1e32d44816871da8c2bdb9d64a719bdc291a660555400a3","ext":".png","w":1528,"h":788,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":64,"tim":1491693283796,"time":1491693283,"md5":"rzKIB9fP2BwekzaSJWZmkg==","fsize":1062577,"resto":120196916,"id":"6B8yjnGX","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"}]}

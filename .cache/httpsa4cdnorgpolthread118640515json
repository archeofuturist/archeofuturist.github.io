YBOP is a cherry-picked archive of anecdotal evidence, which means sweet fuck all in scientific and academic terms. For every single success story on that website, there are a dozen posts online from people who have tried nofap and seen no benefit, posts from people stuck in a never-ending cycle of win streaks and &quot;&quot;&quot;relapse&quot;&quot;&quot; that results in significantly more distress overall than masturbation alone ever did, and even some posts from people who have dropped masturbation and seen negative changes with regard to their sex drive.<br><br>Ask yourself some basic questions to get a fresh perspective on your underlying assumptions:<br><br>1. Why does a large volume of cherry-picked anecdotal evidence give you any more reason to believe in something than you otherwise might have had? There&#039;s more anecdotal evidence out there for the existence of UFOs, ayy lmaos, and Mary Magdalene than masturbation addiction. Does that mean little green men are real? Would Gary Wilson, the man behind the YBOP site, think that a similar site instead collating alien abduction reports gives him any more reason to believe in UFOs than he otherwise had?<br>2. Why would difficulty stopping masturbation necessarily indicate addiction? 80% of New Year&#039;s resolutions fail by February. Would you say that a guy who had trouble sticking to guitar practice is addicted to not practicing guitar? Or would you say that he had a self-control and willpower issue that needed some work?<br>3. Is it not a little bit suspicious that Gary Wilson&#039;s wife, Marnia Robinson, runs a freaky new age tantric sex woo-woo website at https:\/\/www.reuniting.info\/ (pic related)? Might this give Gary an ulterior motive for shilling so-called porn addiction so hard?<br>4. If porn is so addictive, why don&#039;t you see bums on the street begging you for money to finance a broadband connection?","filename":"Capture","ext":".png","w":1170,"h":669,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1490702564077,"time":1490702564,"md5":"xV15Ixr9prWzTvlIXIUIYQ==","fsize":713243,"resto":118640515,"id":"65ZUagGr","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118641971,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:03:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118641676\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118641676<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118641797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118641797<\/a><br><br>how do you plan on satisfying a women if you cum with one stroke?","time":1490702585,"resto":118640515,"id":"6Wi5EsCI","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118641988,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:03:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118641527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118641527<\/a><br>a real person","time":1490702600,"resto":118640515,"id":"Gq\/rG\/M4","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":118642040,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:04:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118640515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118640515<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118640554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118640554<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118641936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118641936<\/a><br>5. Do you not think that some of the difficulty arising from nofap could be self-fulfilling prophecy or nocebo effect? If someone tried to stop masturbating without any further context, do you think they would have an easier time of it than someone whose expectations had been influenced by countless posts about how impossible it was to stop masturbating before going into it?<br>6. Gary Wilson says that porn owes its addictive nature to it being a superstimulant. How do you feel about the fact that Gary Wilson&#039;s conception of superstimulants also includes food? Are you man enough to say that fat people are food addicts on \/pol\/?<br>7. If you believe that they exist, have you considered the possibility that other mental health problems might be responsible for what you think is porn addiction? People with depression, for example, are naturally going to have a harder time sticking to almost anything than the average person. People with ADHD will likely jerk it more because of the lower impulse control that results from EF impairment.<br>8. What does the world population of 7 billion human beings say about our level of control over sexual behaviour throughout history, before &quot;high-speed internet porn&quot; ever even existed? Do you think people regularly went 90 days without masturbating in the Victorian era? Is your difficulty abstaining from masturbation indicative of addiction, or does it just come from the frequent need for sexual release that resulted in the proliferation of our species?<br>9. If porn is addictive because we wouldn&#039;t normally have such a wide range of vaginas to choose from, and because their artificial abdunance acts as a superstimulant to our primitive brains, then why didn&#039;t kings and conquerors throughout history, who had literally every vagina in the land at their disposal, become non-functioning sex addicts who did nothing but fuck all day while blaming all their problems on sex addiction?","filename":"t3_3njtgg","ext":".jpg","w":780,"h":1170,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490702653670,"time":1490702653,"md5":"PuASQHsppYLn\/YLL2mfNGQ==","fsize":473911,"resto":118640515,"id":"65ZUagGr","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118642053,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:04:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118641971\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118641971<\/a><br>Dude i&#039;m gonna buy a sexbot","time":1490702663,"resto":118640515,"id":"7ayfapoS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118642201,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:06:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118641936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118641936<\/a><br>Well said Anon-san","time":1490702771,"resto":118640515,"id":"oDh7OW8b","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118642207,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:06:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118640515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118640515<\/a><br>I don&#039;t have a porn addiction, I have a 2D addiction.","time":1490702781,"resto":118640515,"id":"OPLPwEPa","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118642217,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:06:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"Maybe theyre paired with landwhales in RL","filename":"1353349204743","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":720,"tn_w":86,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490702789584,"time":1490702789,"md5":"ReGa\/NhFWUBjZDW17rpPiw==","fsize":70641,"resto":118640515,"id":"U98vPXhO","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118642272,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:07:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Huh.

She is transgender.<br><br>She graduates in May \u2014 but the war over how to accommodate transgender students is far from over in her Chicago suburb.<br><br>A new legal challenge is making its way through the courts. And a coalition of insurgent school board candidates, an evangelical church and conservative parents are looking to reshape district policy. The goal: preventing transgender girls and boys from sharing the bathrooms and locker rooms of their choice with other girls and boys, on the grounds that they are \u201cthe opposite biological sex.\u201d Their presence, the opponents argue, violates community standards of decency.<br><br>They cast the issue as one of basic modesty, but the transgender student says it goes far deeper than that.<br><br>\u201cReally, nobody\u2019s getting naked,\u201d said the girl, who is identified as Student A in court papers and asked not to be named to protect her privacy. \u201cThis fear that trans people exist and should not have the right to exist. That\u2019s the driving force here.\u201d<br><br>The school board election is set for Tuesday, only days after lawmakers in North Carolina, mired in a battle of its own, repealed a state law restricting bathroom use in public buildings. In February, after a dispute among his own cabinet officials, President Trump reversed federal protections allowing transgender students to use the bathrooms of their choice, leaving those decisions to state and local authorities. That in turn prompted the Supreme Court not to take what advocates had hoped would be a defining transgender bathroom case.","time":1491250493,"resto":119374180,"id":"87wT9ysd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119374350,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)16:15:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119374261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119374261<\/a><br>The repercussions are still playing out here.

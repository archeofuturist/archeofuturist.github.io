I&#039;d much rather just give the NHS the funding it needs. We spend less on healthcare than the vast majority of Western countries, spending around 8% of our GDP on medical care. Other comparable western countries spend around 11%. Not only is there no evidence that it&#039;s a money pit, there&#039;s relatively good evidence of the total opposite: that it&#039;s remarkably efficient relative to other nations.<br><br>I don&#039;t necessarily have a problem with the NHS being reformed so that it&#039;s more Euro-styled. The problem is that the government will obviously rather go down the American route than replicate Europe.","filename":"1493852153410","ext":".jpg","w":165,"h":221,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493928444447,"time":1493928444,"md5":"S901t4cTgN9W06YSezF0Fw==","fsize":43027,"resto":124098768,"id":"frftqg3k","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124103038,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)16:07:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124102354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124102354<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I BTFO of hers.<\/span>","filename":"ann widdecombe hideous must burn from hard drive","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":387,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":78,"tim":1493928447796,"time":1493928447,"md5":"kL+OoK1wYwTfH95UgjN3MQ==","fsize":75196,"resto":124098768,"id":"s8t4iOU4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124103042,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)16:07:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124102354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124102354<\/a><br>her saggy arse and he will tear it open as he pounds her and snatches the keys too No10 as she wimpers\/crying lil victim cunt","time":1493928452,"resto":124098768,"id":"v6VP1qK6","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124103071,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)16:07:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"who here \/workingclassracistbrexitvoter\/?","filename":"1252","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":420,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1493928467827,"time":1493928467,"md5":"fPBC643DriZJ6Joemj7Xww==","fsize":111213,"resto":124098768,"id":"vHN92koS","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124103105,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)16:08:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Labour would be ok without diane abbo<br>It&#039;s a shame too since I really care about the NHS","filename":"IMG_1555","ext":".jpg","w":1598,"h":848,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":66,"tim":1493928486052,"time":1493928486,"md5":"PLD9qq0WgAvBvX63IQZTxg==","fsize":212785,"resto":124098768,"id":"gXSrZSdi","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124103115,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)16:08:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124102554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124102554<\/a><br>????","filename":"1466730117675","ext":".png","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493928490141,"time":1493928490,"md5":"JqRtNy0uaPW6HI8EtaSDyA==","fsize":2126333,"resto":124098768,"id":"Rzg9jnV4","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124103122,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)16:08:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124102554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124102554<\/a><br>Fuck off yank we don&#039;t want to be lectured to by you.","time":1493928494,"resto":124098768,"id":"9OQz9l0x","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124103175,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)16:08:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124102389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124102389<\/a><br>Last bit is Great first bit is kill self lol","time":1493928517,"resto":124098768,"id":"v6VP1qK6","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124103178,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)16:08:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124102763\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124102763<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124102765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124102765<\/a><br>I was the one who suggested that Trump &quot;&quot;endorse&quot;&quot;

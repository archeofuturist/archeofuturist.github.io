I see how that is a problem. But I don&#039;t see how he would deserve all the hatred that goes his way. Having done a significant amount of research all the things that are being held against him are basically that he pushes for an agenda which makes the far right upset. I&#039;m wondering if the reason he isn&#039;t being thrown out is actually that he is popular with the eastern european left. Nothing about him makes him seem like a demon or a monster.","filename":"asasdasdasd","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":168,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490691021706,"time":1490691021,"md5":"YiG01wD30ogfNxyIMNAC+Q==","fsize":7616,"resto":0,"id":"\/CQVTnhi","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"having-done-some-research-i-see-that-he-is-a","country_name":"Sweden","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Friend of mine back in college used to eat entire apples, including the core, the seeds, and the stems. I think of myself as pretty much of a skinflint, but I could never do something like that.<br><br>They&#039;re survivors, if not necessarily thrivers. Whether or not it&#039;s their own innate traits that leads to them being persecuted, they HAVE been persecuted. And yet despite this they have spread to all corners of the globe.<br><br>Let me ask you a question, anons. Americans (?) that you are, how do you think your people would fare if a cataclysmic event drove you from your homes, spread you across the world, diverging you among other populations that soon your groups don&#039;t even look like each other anymore? Would even after that, you could still conceive of each other as American? and be able to find common ground and rebuild your society?<br><br>Because that&#039;s what the Jews did. And now, well, with no lack of help from the gentiles, Jews are now the richest and highest IQ population of people in the world, reclaiming the nation that was lost to them for 2000 years. It is a fantastical success story.<br><br>Why hate them?","filename":"jewish-family-celebrating-hanukkah-menorrah","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":399,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490169106775,"time":1490169106,"md5":"qqnn35fSTqIuUTjgDygEwg==","fsize":98010,"resto":0,"id":"rXuKaZnn","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"honestly-i-like-jews-a-lot-love-em-really","country_name":"Australia","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":117736447,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)03:52:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117736396\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117736396<\/a><br>stop posting","time":1490169160,"resto":117736396,"id":"klbcsOVD","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117736943,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:00:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"I agree. The Nazis were definitely a more destructive and murderous force than the Jews ever were, ruined many more human lives in the most savage way. So what if they complain a little too much, watch their spending and occasionally act a bit arrogant.","time":1490169625,"resto":117736396,"id":"zLSZyERT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117737243,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:05:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117736943\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117736943<\/a><br>I agree. It&#039;s obviously not a commonly expressed opinion here, but Jewish people have done a lot more for the advancement of society than anyone that ever browsed this board. They made America a cultural powerhouse in our prime with their great films. They have given us some of our greatest scientific achievements, including the fucking atomic bomb, our most power weapon ever created. They&#039;re really a fantastic reasource and great citizens. They do tend to lean left and whine though.","time":1490169911,"resto":117736396,"id":"zKArKdob","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

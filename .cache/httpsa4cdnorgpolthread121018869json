In 1852, with the support of Horace Mann, another strong advocate of the Prussian model, Everett made the decision to adopt the Prussian system of education in Massachusetts. Unfortunately for the children and poor Irish Catholics of Massachusetts and elsewhere, the system produced a willing, cheap labor force with minimal reading and numbers skills. The Everetts of the world understood that people who could read and understand are dangerous because they are intellectually equipped to find out things for themselves, thus becoming a threat to already established power elites.<br><br>Shortly after Everett and Mann collaborated to adopt the Prussian system, the Governor of New York set up the same method in 12 different New York schools on a trial basis. Incredibly, within two weeks he declared the system a total success and took control of the entire education system in the State of New York. In a &quot;blitzkreig&quot; action with no debate, public hearing, or citizen involvement, government forced schooling was on its way in America.","filename":"1461024599144","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492172266293,"time":1492172266,"md5":"4Zbfo9C2VvzNwWuqMBoiVQ==","fsize":546890,"resto":121018869,"id":"YsFHn\/Lw","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121053709,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:18:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121053632\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121053632<\/a><br>The Results of the Prussian System<br><br>The history of American education since the acceptance of the Prussian system is checkered with failure and elitism.

We can track the five different stages that American education has gone through: 1750-1852\u2014The idea of government controlled schools was conceived; 1852-1900\u2014It was politically debated in state legislatures; 1900-1920\u2014We had government controlled industrialized factory modeled schooling; 1920-1960\u2014Schools changed from being academically focused to becoming socialized; and 1960 to the Present\u2014Schools became psychological experimental labs.","time":1492172317,"resto":121018869,"id":"YsFHn\/Lw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121053728,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)08:18:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121053709\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121053709<\/a><br>In the year 1941 the Defense Department was preparing for World War II. In testing 18 million men between 1941 and 1944, the Defense Department found 96 percent of those tested were literate. During this same period, among African Americans who were tested\u2014the majority of whom had only three years of schooling\u201480 percent were found to be literate. By literate we mean that Americans, both white and black, could read with understanding.<br><br>During the Korean War the Department of Defense tested three million men for service and only 19 percent were found to be literate. In less then 10 years there had been a 500 percent rise in illiteracy. Perplexed, the Defense Department investigated and found that the same test had been used during the two wars and the only difference was that those men and women tested during the Korean War had more schooling\u2014at a significantly higher cost.<br><br>Twenty years later, around 1970, the same test was used at the time of a new war. Among the Vietnam draftees and enlistees who were tested for literacy only 27 percent were found to be capable of reading with understanding the material which they needed in order to serve in the armed forces. Again the major difference between American soldiers in the 1940\u2019s and the 1970\u2019s was more schooling for the latter group at a higher cost to the taxpayers.<br><br>Consider that the billions of taxpayer dollars were spent over the time period from the 1940\u2019s to the present increased by some 350 percent with totally unacceptable results despite all the increased spending. In 1996 statistics prepared by the National Association of Education for Progress showed that some 44 percent of African Americans can not read at all.

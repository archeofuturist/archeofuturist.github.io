During these two global cataclysms, the virtuous members of the Hopi tribe were guided by an odd-shaped cloud during the day and a moving star at night that led them to the sky god named Sotuknang, who finally took them to the Ant People\u2014in Hopi, Anu Sinom . The Ant People then escorted the Hopi into subterranean caves where they found refuge and sustenance. <br><br>t is interesting to note that the Babylonian sky god was named Anu. The Hopi word for \u201cant\u201d is also anu, and the Hopi root word naki means \u201cfriends.\u201d Thus, the Hopi Anu-naki, or \u201cant friends,\u201d may have been the same as the Sumerian Annunaki\u2014the beings who once came to Earth from the heavens.","time":1493617617,"resto":123508969,"id":"Pib5BXew","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123585172,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)01:49:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"okay, how do i join?","filename":"1493262829207","ext":".gif","w":400,"h":230,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1493617799846,"time":1493617799,"md5":"oKPEWX1ZXppfhJL4XO2bUg==","fsize":2094378,"resto":123508969,"id":"NNbHkWLl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123585388,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)01:52:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123584938\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123584938<\/a><br>interesting indeed. while your scenario about the fire cataclysm seems plausible, another theory could be nukes. <br>http:\/\/www.theepochtimes.com\/n3\/236<wbr>30-ancient-atomic-bombs\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Seven years after the nuclear tests in Alamogordo, New Mexico, Dr. J.

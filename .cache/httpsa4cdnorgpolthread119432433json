That is it. From little tiny shows, to big massive festies like Ultra Music Fest in Florida.<br><br>Metal\/Rock\/Country are legit, but all nigger music and EDM are drug front operations. Allow me to explain.<br><br>So in EDM, we have promoters. These are the annoying fuckers you see handing out flyers at the doors at the end of the shows. These people serve 2 purposes. To promote the show to normies, and to advertise which crew is selling at the show.<br><br>So lets say I was throwing a show. I pick up a few keys of MDMA, coke, and some M1. My promoters who you saw at every door promoting, are my drug runners. So we&#039;d give them about 200$ worth at a time, all split into 10-20 bags. They&#039;d go out on the floor and move it, come back with the cash, reup and move it again. Now to any police in the building these people look like normal employees (yes, fire laws means cops come and chill out. But they stay in front and do rounds very little). But the entire time they&#039;re just running drugs to the crowd. All that drug money, then gets laundered at the front in the form of &quot;ticket sales&quot;. Nothing fancy needs to be done, just drop the cash off, and mark how many &quot;tickets&quot; just got sold. This is so you can legally put the money into a bank, and have records for the IRS.<br><br>Now, since its impossible for anyone to actual tell how many you have attending, no one can ever dispute the number of tickets, officially speaking. And bam, you just laundered 10k in drug money.<br><br>This is how festivals are done as well, except we&#039;re talking about $100,000+ in drug money in a single day. And every year they just grow, and grow, and grow. <br><br>Ultra music festival is actually run by Cuban gangs. Most festivals out of Baltimore(Moonrise, formerly Starskape), Detroit (Electric Forest), etc are all run by black gangs from those cities.

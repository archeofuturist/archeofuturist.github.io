While most of the political class and the media is engaged with dissecting Trump\u2019s chances in the General Election and our side covers the full spectrum from unabashed jubilation (she has this!), to full-blown alarm (we are in for a surprise because everyone has underestimated Trump at their peril), it would seem to me, not enough is being said about the underlying significance of this election.<br><br>I will make the case briefly.<br><br>Trump, far from an exception to the rule, represents the culmination of several aspects (trends) in American politics. Aspects that we, as Democrats would love to get rid of.<br><br>First, he is the quintessence of the anti-intellectual tradition that has gripped the GOP for a generation. Used to be a person could be proud of their intellectual and educational accomplishments. But today\u2019s GOP, in continuing denial about climate change, up in arms against the Theory of Evolution and generally of anti-scientific collective mind, makes the likes of Sarah Palin and Donald Trump their champions. Trump is the ultimate bloviator \u2014 has an opinion on everything without any actual knowledge or experience, pulls facts out of his\u2026 you know what, and is adamant that he is basically an expert on everything. This is a person who is intellectually incurious (George W anyone?) and temperamentally hostile to people with knowledge.<br><br>WOULDN\u2019T IT BE GREAT to defeat him with our champion, Hillary Clinton, whose educational and intellectual accomplishments make her uniquely qualified for the presidency? By all accounts, she absorbs knowledge like a sponge and studies all sides of every issue so she is familiar with the nuances and the fine print. It will be enormously satisfying to do that. (Nerds vs Jocks lol). Nerds win in the end.","filename":"1461968997146","ext":".jpg","w":780,"h":438,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490799885276,"time":1490799885,"md5":"JkY+zjrpHcr5ruryrJoLKA==","fsize":71290,"resto":0,"id":"Zz\/yxqq\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-sweeping-statement-perhaps-but-if-anything-i","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

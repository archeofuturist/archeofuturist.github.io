They&#039;ve even went so far as to remove China&#039;s symbols from their vocabulary, unlike South Korea, China fucken hates North Korea and is beginning to understand they are a loose cannon that is right next to them and can start making outrages territorial claims. If you know anything about Chinese politics you would understand that the previous president was friends of Kims father but China threw his ass in jail, and they have Lil Kim running around killing everyone that had anything to do with China. So China really dislikes him and I believe killing his brother was seen as the last straw.","time":1491969100,"resto":120707973,"id":"JsSvLPc\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120709467,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)23:52:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120708599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120708599<\/a><br>That massive dip in 2009 was because the real state bubble?","time":1491969129,"resto":120707973,"id":"ZvkiLlso","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120709745,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)23:54:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120707973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120707973<\/a><br><br>My best guess is that they will most likely be on their own side and invade NK from the North to prevent a complete takeover of the peninsula by the US and SK. After that they will pressure the US and SK to relinquish any taken territory over the 38th parallel and install a pro-chinese puppet government. The US and SK will happily accept these terms because neither wants to spend the resources to reintegrate NK. So, effectively the balance of power is maintained.","time":1491969268,"resto":120707973,"id":"mD8LjkG5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120709984,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)23:56:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Whichever side they think will &#039;win&#039; so, you know the answer.","filename":"obvious","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":495,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":77,"tim":1491969394724,"time":1491969394,"md5":"Zv+DNXnBMOuRbG3f7mkT+g==","fsize":93407,"resto":120707973,"id":"vg+Xg1vt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120710009,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)23:56:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120707973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120707973<\/a><br>I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if they sent weapons and cannon fodder to best Korea but nothing else.<br><br>But we won&#039;t be going to war with North Korea because they do this shit every year.

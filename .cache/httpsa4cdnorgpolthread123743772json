His presidency was a mistake and one very easily made. Wisdom proclaims we learn from past events to forgo similar ones in the future. Yet what got Obama elected was not us applying lessons learned, instead opting to usurp them and place ourselves in a volatile circumstance out of guilt and redemption. <br><br>By electing a radicalist to the most powerful position in our country we have intentionally thrown the political balance out of equilibrium which had breed the dissent we&#039;re witnessing now. Skewed towards libertine policy Obama had subverted more fundamental ideologies that this country was established upon than of kept, tipping the scale greater to one side than the other leaving nationalists (rationalists) alienated.<br><br>This led to the rise of Trump--a great man, but a radicalist on the opposing side--which is to be the counterbalance for the prior shift in policy. Hoping to undo leftist geared policy of the previous administration, much like Obama had done, is breeding similiar alienation on the left.. albeit well warranted. A return to fundamental ideologies was needed, but radicalism begetting radicalism only enabled the country to continue its divide.<br><br>Next election cycle (eight years from now), I foresee a strong case for an independent candidate making waves. People will stir again for balance and elect a second coming of Theodore Roosevelt to reset the counter and quell the seething passion and hated on both sides to a dull tolerance and a return to stability.","filename":"the_balance","ext":".jpg","w":475,"h":316,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493711789453,"time":1493711789,"md5":"OH\/oJCLTDduDSqdUO07lbw==","fsize":27784,"resto":0,"id":"8nVG7Tfd","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"political-volitility-begets-extreme-civil-dissent","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Rather than a visa, under Trudeau&#039;s administration, Mexicans are now only required to have a so-called Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) which can be purchased online for CAD $7.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As one media outlet praised, the move &quot;provides a stark contrast to proposed policies from the US president-elect Donald Trump, who has said he will immediately deport between two and three million illegal immigrants and will build a wall along the US-Mexican border.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not surprisingly, news of the rule changes in Canada quickly made the rounds in the migrant community with one recently-deported Mexican nationalist declaring that &quot;For those without documents, I think (the United States) is over.

Again..","com":"What the hell is he doing now? <br><br>Mike Cernovich said Alefantis served him court papers but they were all redacted and he didn&#039;t back away from pizzagate. So I&#039;m not buying the whole theory of him doing this to avoid a lawsuit.<br><br>Alex has changed his mind on this 4 times now but this was the first time he&#039;s been so clear that it&#039;s all fake and how sorry he is etc. <br><br>I personally prefer David Seaman and Mike Cernovich&#039;s opinions to Jones&#039; but this is really bothering me. What do you guys think? pizzagate literally robbed me of sleep for about a week but we haven&#039;t seen the big arrests we&#039;ve been promised. BUT it&#039;s a long process if it&#039;s real and if Sessions is really going for grand jury indictments we wouldn&#039;t necessarily know.","filename":"alex-jones-image-2","ext":".jpg","w":694,"h":377,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":135,"tim":1490392545087,"time":1490392545,"md5":"XmwigMFd+VCgJ98DBWlo7Q==","fsize":74315,"resto":0,"id":"eCxKEJsa","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-alex-jones-flip-flops-on-pedogate-again","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

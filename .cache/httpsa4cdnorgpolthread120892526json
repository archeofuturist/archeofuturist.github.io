I&#039;ve worked in low income areas my whole life, and you&#039;re completely ignorant on the subject.<br><br>In my city there&#039;s a large HUD housing project for supposedly &quot;poor&quot; families. I worked with an AC company at the time and had to go into every dwelling. Nearly every single unit had not only Satellite TV, but also large flatscreen TVs. This was in the early 2000&#039;s when those TVs cost at least $1500 and satellite TV was $150 or more per month. <br><br>You should actually interact with the so called &quot;poor&quot; in this country. You&#039;ll discover quickly that they are most often poor because they make terrible decisions and have nearly no long term planning skills. Not because they are just &quot;unlucky.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What about middle\/lower class people who are suddenly diagnosed with cancer or some shit and can&#039;t get on insurance after the fact?<\/span><br>Those are called &quot;Pre-existing conditions&quot; and have nothing to do with Universal Healthcare\/Singlepayer. Yes, once upon a time if people didn&#039;t buy health insurance (a commercial product to insure you against the costs of an unexpected injury or illness) and then were struck by an unexpected injury or illness were then required to pay the full bill for their healthcare. S H O C K I N G ! ! ! But since 2009 pre-existing conditions coverage has been mandated by the federal government, effectively negating the logical purpose of &quot;insurance.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Poverty shouldn&#039;t be a death sentence<\/span><br>Google the word &quot;EMTALA.&quot;<br><br>You seem to be working with a pre-1980 version of both the healthcare industry and vision of society.

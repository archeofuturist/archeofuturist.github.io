The US Government is basing their entire claim the Russians were responsible off this company&#039;s findings. Crowdstrike has been caught falsely blaming the Russian government for hacking Ukraianan weapons systems during the invasion of Crimea. The founder of Crowdstrike is on the Altantic Council an anti-russian think tank that contributed to Clinton&#039;s campaign. AC is funded by a Ukranian billionaire who ousted the Pro-Russian President. Why is all this important? It was an attempt to do something similar to the &quot;yellow cake&quot; report prior to the invasion of Iraq. It was assumed at the time that Clinton would easily win, they used this as an opportunity to push for war with Russia. When Trump one , you saw the media quickly accept that Russia was behind it because the FBI said so. The FBI based this not off its own findings but a 3rd party . Right now they&#039;re trying to cover their ass by trying to disrupt any investigation into the actual facts of the hacking by pushing a Trump is a Russian spy narrative, but if Russia never did the hack, then how could Trump be a spy?","filename":"download","ext":".jpg","w":1160,"h":629,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":135,"tim":1490546036567,"time":1490546036,"md5":"xgRUf+XgjSN3jYVhrGXiEQ==","fsize":137180,"resto":0,"id":"IpnHEG1v","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"most-important-part-of-comey-testimony","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118381002,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)12:42:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118379859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118379859<\/a><br>usually working against authorities means you are dishonest","time":1490546571,"resto":118379859,"id":"fsd5X92R","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

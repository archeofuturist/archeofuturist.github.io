People tend to belive that *religion_name* is their ethnic identity. That&#039;s why it&#039;s hard to change their opinion on subject.<br>2. If state doesn&#039;t try to limit religion in every possible way, religion growes bold and starts to become fearless cause they start to belive that they&#039;re more important than state (that perfect example what is happening to Kringestan: bolsheviks managed to turn us into secular people and silenced clerics but after fall of the Soviet Union government was too busy stealing money that they just gave all the freedom to clerics, especially to extremists. Now Bishkek is look like a Mosquetown(picrelated) only because state is incompetent enough to let clerics do whatever they want) thus why it&#039;s important to control spreading of the religion on the government level.","filename":"we don&#039;t need education if we can pray","ext":".png","w":1003,"h":719,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1492282076771,"time":1492282076,"md5":"0SaTF+ScD4PZzf9gGm56NA==","fsize":301176,"resto":121236333,"id":"OR3VmMXj","country":"KG","country_name":"Kyrgyzstan"},{"no":121243354,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)14:48:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121242897\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121242897<\/a><br>Funnily enough there was a Rothschild in the family.

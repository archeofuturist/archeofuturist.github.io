This might be high level but stick with me. <br><br>Currently, money is created simply by creating debt, which is in turn just the promise to repay even more money than has been originally created. <br><br>In a closed economy, this is essentially grand scale theft. The federal reserve bank (a private entity) loans money at interest to the government, which is then dispersed through loans or funding etc. <br><br>From there the government taxes the population to pay back its debt to the federal reserve. If an economy was closed, this simply amounts to a cycle of pushing x amount out and getting x + interest back from the population through taxes. <br><br>Where does the money come from? Well the only place funding outside of a closed economy can come from is net positive trade from external economies. <br><br>If have done Econ 101 you&#039;ll know that if a perfect scenario trade is just a result of exchange in which an economy may receive a better suited allotment of goods based on their needs, the net value is still equal to the production of the economy. <br><br>Of course, one may profit off the trading of goods by exchanged at rates which favour their trade. <br><br>But given that all countries exist within the same system of debt based money, they are essentially funnelling cash around the world, hoping that their strategy will result in a net positive inflow and make their country rich. (This is of course overly simplistic, but you get the drift)<br><br>All the while the actual profiteers of the entire global economy is the initial lender of debt. That means on an infinite timeline, all money is siphoned to back to those lenders. <br><br>Hitler based the German economy off publicly funded labour, as in labour from the German people generated the basis for value.

This includes the big media conglomerates. Supercomputers were used to analyse a database of the top 37 million corporations and individual investors worldwide. Shockingly, only 737 corporations controlled a network that was earning 80% of all the world&#039;s profits. This information was deeply hidden within the data and required supercomputer power to discover. These 737 entities enjoyed power in the system that was ten times greater than they should have had from their wealth alone. With even greater number-crunching, this web of ownership could be further narrowed down to a superentity of only 147 companies. An astonishing 75% of the corporations within this superentity are financial institutions. The top 25 financial institutions within this highly covert group include Barclays, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Merrill Lynch, UBS, Bank of New York, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America - all of which are allegedly members of the Federal Reserve. The actual banks running the Federal Reserve have never been openly and officially revealed - ostensibly for their own safety and privacy.

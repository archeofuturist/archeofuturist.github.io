This might be high level but stick with me. <br><br>Currently, money is created simply by creating debt, which is in turn just the promise to repay even more money than has been originally created. <br><br>In a closed economy, this is essentially grand scale theft. The federal reserve bank (a private entity) loans money at interest to the government, which is then dispersed through loans or funding etc. <br><br>From there the government taxes the population to pay back its debt to the federal reserve. If an economy was closed, this simply amounts to a cycle of pushing x amount out and getting x + interest back from the population through taxes. <br><br>Where does the money come from? Well the only place funding outside of a closed economy can come from is net positive trade from external economies. <br><br>If have done Econ 101 you&#039;ll know that if a perfect scenario trade is just a result of exchange in which an economy may receive a better suited allotment of goods based on their needs, the net value is still equal to the production of the economy. <br><br>Of course, one may profit off the trading of goods by exchanged at rates which favour their trade. <br><br>But given that all countries exist within the same system of debt based money, they are essentially funnelling cash around the world, hoping that their strategy will result in a net positive inflow and make their country rich. (This is of course overly simplistic, but you get the drift)<br><br>All the while the actual profiteers of the entire global economy is the initial lender of debt. That means on an infinite timeline, all money is siphoned to back to those lenders. <br><br>Hitler based the German economy off publicly funded labour, as in labour from the German people generated the basis for value.

This includes the big media conglomerates. Supercomputers were used to analyse a database of the top 37 million corporations and individual investors worldwide. Shockingly, only 737 corporations controlled a network that was earning 80% of all the world&#039;s profits. This information was deeply hidden within the data and required supercomputer power to discover. These 737 entities enjoyed power in the system that was ten times greater than they should have had from their wealth alone. With even greater number-crunching, this web of ownership could be further narrowed down to a superentity of only 147 companies. An astonishing 75% of the corporations within this superentity are financial institutions. The top 25 financial institutions within this highly covert group include Barclays, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., Merrill Lynch, UBS, Bank of New York, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America - all of which are allegedly members of the Federal Reserve.

Well the only place funding outside of a closed economy can come from is net positive trade from external economies.<\/span><br>You&#039;re right debt being created by central banks and &#039;loaned&#039; to Governments (via Treasury Depts). However, the money doesn&#039;t &#039;come from&#039; anywhere. It&#039;s simply an electronic book keeping entry. That goes for National Debt as well as Private debt (car loans, mortgages, etc). <br><br>In the UK for example, although this is a similar ratio in other countries, 97% of &#039;money&#039; is electronic money created as debt - out of thin air. 3% Cash and Coins. Money is not &#039;backed&#039; by anything since gold backed money ended the &#039;gold standard&#039;. FIAT money system is what we&#039;ve got.<br><br>There are two main types of debt... National Debt and Private Debt. Private Debt is an even bigger problem than National debt. The whole banking and monetary system is a giant scam when you think about it. (((they))) benefit by creating money out of nothing while we, in the productive economy, work most of our lives to pay them interest. Debt slavery. <br><br>Worth mentioning Quantitative Easing (QE) too. This is Central Bank created money used, so far, to bail out &#039;too big to fail&#039; private banks - no debt involved. Incredible when you think about this also... Private banksters run dodgy Ponzi schemes that lead to boom bust cycles. In the boom times, (((they))) get richer. In the bust times, which they create, they get bailed out and this makes them richer too. Of course, they should be jailed but they are enriched instead. The effect of increased debt and QE is to debase the currency. For example, a Dollar can literally only buy a few Cents worth compared to 50 years ago or whatever. Who suffers from a debased currency? We do, not the banksters.","time":1490863369,"resto":118892499,"id":"VJBFdp+s","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118902807,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)04:43:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118902700\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118902700<\/a><br><br>I think its important also to acknowledge that muslims and christians don&#039;t lend money at interest historically but jews do, and usury is essentially economic theft as it profits off the value creation of others. hirsotically I believe this to be one of the sole reasons that the Jewish people are financially so powerful.

What we call &#039;reality&#039; is holographic in nature and is made of vibrational information fields. The base state of everything in &#039;reality&#039; is ENERGETIC WAVE-FORM INFORMATION. EVERYTHING! The energetic wave-form information level of &#039;reality&#039; is THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL LEVEL of &#039;reality&#039;. Spoken words are vibrational information fields generated by vocal cords and you hear them when they are decoded by your brain. You consciously hear what they say as long as they are loud enough. Symbols are the same in every respect except that we don&#039;t hear them. They are energetic information fields just like words, but they enter the brain through the sight processes SUBLIMINALLY without us even consciously noticing them (most of the time, that is). This is why symbols are so powerful in infiltrating and manipulating &#039;reality&#039;. They are gateways to the psyche. Chinese philosopher Confucius said: &quot;Signs and symbols rule the world, not words nor laws.&quot;<br><br>If you can be manipulated to focus on a symbol, that is even better for the Cabal, because the frequency of the symbol&#039;s energetic information field reflects the frequency of whatever it is symbolising. Focus on a symbol makes an energetic connection and you connect not only with the symbol, but also with what the symbol represents. Human perception is mostly constructed in the sub-conscious part of the mind - and images\/symbols are the major gateway. From here, perceptions and reactions filter through to the conscious part of the mind as thoughts and emotional responses.","filename":"lights","ext":".png","w":640,"h":279,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":54,"tim":1490863470791,"time":1490863470,"md5":"BGlY3NT\/XaiLgtaxbmmLcQ==","fsize":360783,"resto":118892499,"id":"SDJNa4Gw","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118902974,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)04:45:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118902885\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118902885<\/a><br><br>* Symbols (and, in the context of \/pol\/, memes) are holographic projections of vibrational information fields.","time":1490863549,"resto":118892499,"id":"SDJNa4Gw","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118903023,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)04:46:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118902763\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118902763<\/a><br>so can we nationalist use magic in our favor ?","time":1490863593,"resto":118892499,"id":"ZhczaSth","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":118903024,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)04:46:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118902578\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118902578<\/a><br>Its not all magic.

There are LITERALLY HUNDREDS of 9\/11 examples of predictive programming, but BY FAR THE BEST 9\/11 example of predictive programming (in my opinion, of course) is an album cover from the English rock band Supertramp that was released in 1979 (pic related). If you flip the album cover in the other direction, you can see &#039;9\/11&#039; being spelled out (in the red square I made). On its own, this could be dismissed as a mere coincidence, but what makes this example so striking is that 9\/11 is being spelled out ON THE TWIN TOWERS. Could that ALSO be a mere coincidence? NOT A CHANCE. Now, I&#039;m not saying that Supertramp were in on prior knowledge of 9\/11. I don&#039;t think that&#039;s what happened at all. What happened was that whoever designed that album cover had prior knowledge of 9\/11 because that information was given to him or her via a network of secret societies that actually exists and has control over not only the entertainment industry, but also the media (both the mainstream media AND the alternative media - yes, they have infiltrated the alternative media community too), politics, banking, the military, the education system, multi-national corporations and the judicial system.","filename":"supertramp","ext":".png","w":470,"h":928,"tn_w":63,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490864766693,"time":1490864766,"md5":"BBWgqBamLMbJ3Inuh+5HnQ==","fsize":812254,"resto":118892499,"id":"SDJNa4Gw","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118904147,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)05:06:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118904026\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118904026<\/a><br>Free energy. <br><br>Feds arrest people who try to sell devices that (seem to) ,for our purposes they do, produce more energy than they consume","time":1490864780,"resto":118892499,"id":"QsP3OEds","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118904177,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)05:06:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118902807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118902807<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They lend to nations.<\/span><br>It&#039;s worse than that really. &#039;To lend&#039; implies that (((they))) have something of value to lend.

Her party, Le Front National has a really bad reputation. Her dad was convicted because he said that the Soah wasn&#039;t real. And as you know the french don&#039;t like Hitler. So yeah, really shitty reputation. But since Marine is the president of FN, it&#039;s getting better but people still hate the FN. She will win the first round and that&#039;s all. Because it will be Marine \/ Macron or Fillon. Macron is &quot;lefty&quot; and Fillon is casual right but this year he is far more conservative. So people who want a strong France choose him and not Le Pen. And there is many small candidate who want to leave the EU.

I grew up Democrat. Because my mom is a hard core liberal and my dad kind of doesn&#039;t give a fuck. Since I live in Mass obviosuly I don&#039;t know many conservatives who I could bounce topics off of. And i feel like I have a biased upbringing so I hope maybe you can change my mind or maybe I can change yours. So because of that I come to you and here are some starting points for reference.<br><br>Besides shaking up the leadership of many foreign nations and being all around based, what has Trump done for people on the homefront besides cut important institutions like the EPA (Which I think is very annoying because he&#039;s killing the planet he&#039;s not too long for anyway, and handing the problems to my generation) and then blowing stupid money on a wall.<br><br>And then the health care bill, being a kid who doesn&#039;t care enough I have not personally read it, but many sources are calling it a complete disaster even on the right. <br><br>And lastly I know I&#039;m gonna get called a cuck boy straight off the bat because I identify as a liberal, and that&#039;s okay. I don&#039;t see republicans as the extreme super racist idiots as the left paints them as and I hope you understand I&#039;m not like the extreme of my party either. If you want to debate something else with me I&#039;ll respond with my opinions.","filename":"bluemass","ext":".png","w":304,"h":166,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":136,"tim":1490733085945,"time":1490733085,"md5":"WYE+4J7Nw0GCRZlKYWkhMQ==","fsize":4206,"resto":0,"id":"8jjpGDhH","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"democratic-and-republican-debate-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118692973,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:36:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118692337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118692337<\/a><br>Trump has saved many jobs from leaving the country already.

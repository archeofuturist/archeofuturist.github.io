They literally fit the description. They use intimidation and violence to silence anyone they don&#039;t agree with, disrespect law enforcement, have numerously assaulted them, and as we&#039;ve seen, use illegal weapons on both civilian and law enforcement such as m80&#039;s and firebombs. They constantly threaten to do just about everything that would normally get a SWAT team kicking in your door\/stomach online andirl, most of whom without so much as a crappy proxy. How and why the hell haven&#039;t the UN or at least the US declared them one and bring the boot down on them?","filename":"C24-ByTXgAExDyz","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":501,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493789349699,"time":1493789349,"md5":"9Hmfcuw7OHuGLfJ7DCxZdw==","fsize":68592,"resto":0,"id":"wOmPlfHx","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"antifa-alive-how","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123879378,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:56:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"the same reason dylan roof didnt make the FBI bustr down the doors of you stormfaggots","time":1493791010,"resto":123876929,"id":"mTJ9OucW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

We are so far from any definitive, empirically based truths on consciousness, morality, or free will that it&#039;s impossible to even attempt to discuss them within the confines of science. It&#039;s all speculation, that will probably be continue to be fundamentally altered long after our deaths. Science cannot answer all questions, it has never been able to and it&#039;s possible it never will be able.<br><br>And yet humans have progressed and managed for hundreds of thousands of years without science all the same. And a lot of that is thanks to the religions and mythologies we have constructed\/evolved alongside us to instruct us of lessons from the past and how we should live our lives, and why we should tolerate the suffering.<br><br>And as Sam Harris said, none of this means you should treat religion any different to Dostoevsky, it&#039;s a good book that holds some great truth within it, no need to worship it or deify the author.<br>But Dostoevsky got there before Nietszche, the storytellers and artists get there long before anyone comes along who is capable of articulating it, there is something to that, and it says something about the massive importance that art, story and religion holds to societies and individual humans. If we lose that who knows what will come, it&#039;s naive to think we&#039;re at some forefront of human history where everything is so different and new. The weakening of religious belief is not a new phenomena, it&#039;s old and has been seen countless times, and the consequences of it are well known.<br><br>We cannot dispense with it, it&#039;s fundamental to our being, it always has been. Right now we need to modify it and reconcile it with the modern world, yet again.","filename":"peterson sunshine","ext":".png","w":600,"h":444,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1490786429070,"time":1490786429,"md5":"7\/3UjgesJeYne2Wccr40VA==","fsize":127461,"resto":118769947,"id":"f0NYRd2i","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118775264,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:21:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118774849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118774849<\/a><br>If you &#039;sort everything in your life out&#039; you will have an extremely solid base within yourself. <br>Make everything that bothers you in your immediate vicinity and that you are actually capable of fixing, right, be it things in your home or you family. <br>On top of such a fundament you can build something very powerful.","time":1490786509,"resto":118769947,"id":"RtvvpCpa","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118775448,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:24:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118770271\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118770271<\/a><br><br>Post that over at r\/Jordan_Peterson_Memes for mad upvotes.","time":1490786677,"resto":118769947,"id":"g8z4rD2W","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118775499,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:25:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118771565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118771565<\/a><br><br>&quot;your father&quot; is a symbol for the masculine force in life - chiefly it is the order that civilization and culture that imposes order onto chaos.<br><br>rescuing your father is restoring the old traditions anew, thereby maintaining order against an uncaring and chaotic universe. <br><br>sort yourself out.","time":1490786718,"resto":118769947,"id":"jsfaWPM+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118775792,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:29:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118771804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118771804<\/a><br>t. bucko","time":1490786979,"resto":118769947,"id":"06tdeZib","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118775813,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)07:29:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118775448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118775448<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;admitting to browsing reddit<\/span><br>Fuck off already. 4chan is a different website with a different culture.","time":1490786996,"resto":118769947,"id":"l3CEa7RO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

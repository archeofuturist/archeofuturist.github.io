We are so far from any definitive, empirically based truths on consciousness, morality, or free will that it&#039;s impossible to even attempt to discuss them within the confines of science. It&#039;s all speculation, that will probably be continue to be fundamentally altered long after our deaths. Science cannot answer all questions, it has never been able to and it&#039;s possible it never will be able.<br><br>And yet humans have progressed and managed for hundreds of thousands of years without science all the same. And a lot of that is thanks to the religions and mythologies we have constructed\/evolved alongside us to instruct us of lessons from the past and how we should live our lives, and why we should tolerate the suffering.<br><br>And as Sam Harris said, none of this means you should treat religion any different to Dostoevsky, it&#039;s a good book that holds some great truth within it, no need to worship it or deify the author.<br>But Dostoevsky got there before Nietszche, the storytellers and artists get there long before anyone comes along who is capable of articulating it, there is something to that, and it says something about the massive importance that art, story and religion holds to societies and individual humans. If we lose that who knows what will come, it&#039;s naive to think we&#039;re at some forefront of human history where everything is so different and new.

This level of autism makes very little sense, and it also makes very little sense to derail talking about Peterson. It&#039;s not like the Harris kids who actually have a legitimate gripe with him.

We are so far from any definitive, empirically based truths on consciousness, morality, or free will that it&#039;s impossible to even attempt to discuss them within the confines of science. It&#039;s all speculation, that will probably be continue to be fundamentally altered long after our deaths. Science cannot answer all questions, it has never been able to and it&#039;s possible it never will be able.<br><br>And yet humans have progressed and managed for hundreds of thousands of years without science all the same. And a lot of that is thanks to the religions and mythologies we have constructed\/evolved alongside us to instruct us of lessons from the past and how we should live our lives, and why we should tolerate the suffering.<br><br>And as Sam Harris said, none of this means you should treat religion any different to Dostoevsky, it&#039;s a good book that holds some great truth within it, no need to worship it or deify the author.<br>But Dostoevsky got there before Nietszche, the storytellers and artists get there long before anyone comes along who is capable of articulating it, there is something to that, and it says something about the massive importance that art, story and religion holds to societies and individual humans. If we lose that who knows what will come, it&#039;s naive to think we&#039;re at some forefront of human history where everything is so different and new.

He was enormously frustrated that Jordan wouldn&#039;t engage him in his moral thought experiments, and for him that is truly a deathblow to the theory of morality. In other words, Truth and Morality need a fundamentally formal representation and should be applicable to technical thought experiments. He treats human thought like science and does not care that the theories so far leave him hopeless.

You can only speculate that nothing but the empirically true is true, and that&#039;s all any scientist has ever done.<br><br>You speculate that because some empirically true things seem to be always absolutely true, on some levels, ALL seemingly empirically true things ARE always absolutely true. Huge leap.<br><br>In practice, comparatively little is provable empirically. E.g. there&#039;s evidence for Relativity and evidence for Newtonian physics and evidence for Darwinism, but all it takes is a couple of anomalies to render them non-absolute and you&#039;re thrust back into chaos. The old black swan problem.<br><br>See, you claim that truth is ONLY what we can prove empirically true. But in practice what that means is that ONLY what we CAN prove empirically is true, and nothing else, which is actually a different claim. <br><br>E.g. there might be empirical truths that we cannot prove, so we cannot consider them as a truth because of our limitations. It&#039;s a distinction that dogmatic materialists can really handle, which is what confuses you. <br><br>E.g. you have incomplete empirical evidence for historical events, because you haven&#039;t got absolutely all empirical evidence for those events, so there&#039;s no such thing as truth outside of lab conditions where all possible empirical evidence is known.<br><br>The failure to make this distinction between empirical reality and socio-economic reality resulted in communism etc. and is what&#039;s leaving us wide open to the muz-flood.<br><br>Science is wide open to non-empirical dogma, and that definition of truth is so narrow that the majority of &#039;science&#039; IS simply fashion and dogma.","time":1490796527,"resto":118769947,"id":"PeMSL7D2","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118789128,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)10:09:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118787428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118787428<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118787625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118787625<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118788394\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118788394<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118788714\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118788714<\/a><br><br>Yeah I have ignored him in 50 threads and then talk to him in a handful.

I meant &quot;autism&quot; as a half-insult, referring to the obsessive way some people need that world view. Still, it seems strange to me because even Philosopher King Atheists like Dawkins are clear on the fact that they believe in transcendent human experiences. They can&#039;t describe it and resort to religious language to do so, but deep down they are trying to formalize even their impressions and experiences. Evolutionary psychology (through statistics on genetics) is a good example of that. It&#039;s a very strange perspective, since they would agree that for example rules of thumb can be useful, but then proceed to ALSO say that those things can not be &quot;Truth&quot; precisely to the degree that your personal perspective is involved.<br><br>As an aside: I sometimes wonder if militant atheists would get destroyed if they came into contact with postmodernism and deconstruction in particular.

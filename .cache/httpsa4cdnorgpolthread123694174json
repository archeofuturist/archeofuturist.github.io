Prohibition creates a black market with associated violence far worse than the problem it pretends to solve. Also, the consequences of being arrested for weed are greater than the consequences of using weed. Wanna take crocodil? No, it&#039;s illegal as you might go on a murdering spree. Legalizing weed is the logical step. Decreased associated crime, tax dollars, jobs, freedom. Seriously, is no brainer.","time":1493683706,"resto":123694174,"id":"oxLh5MOj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Even in England, about 64 per cent of people are descended from these Celts, outnumbering the descendants of Anglo- Saxons by about three to one. The proportion of Celts is only slightly higher in Scotland, at 73 per cent. Wales is the most Celtic part of mainland Britain, with 83 per cent.

The Brexiteers in Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s administration are living in a fantasy world. And although May herself comes across as sensible and pragmatic, it now appears that she is as deluded as they are.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Last Wednesday, April 25th, May met the President of the European Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, for dinner in London. Senior members of the British and EU negotiating teams were also present.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The dinner was a total disaster. But just how badly it went, at least from the European Commission\u2019s point of view, has only just been revealed.<\/span><br><br>...<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;EU side felt May was seeing whole thing through rose-tinted-glasses. &quot;Let us make Brexit a success&quot; she told them. Juncker countered that Britain will now be a third state, not even (like Turkey) in the customs union: &quot;Brexit cannot be a success&quot;.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;May seemed surprised by this and seemed to the EU side not to have been fully briefed. She cited her own JHA opt-out negotiations as home sec as a model: a mutually useful agreement meaning lots on paper, little in reality. May&#039;s reference to the JHA (justice and home affairs) opt-outs set off alarm signals for the EU side. This was what they had feared. I.e., as home sec May opted out of EU measures (playing to UK audience) then opted back in, and wrongly thinks she can do same with Brexit.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;The more I hear, the more sceptical I become&quot; said Juncker (this was only half way through the dinner).<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;May then insisted to Juncker et al that UK owes EU no money because there is nothing to that effect in the treaties. Her guests then informed her that the EU is not a golf club. Davis then objected that EU could not force a post-Brexit, post-ECJ UK to pay the bill. OK, said Juncker, then no trade deal.<\/span>","filename":"methode%2Ftimes%2Fprod%2Fweb%2Fbin%2F26bf839a-26c4-11e7-bbe5-53dfe0d91782","ext":".jpg","w":758,"h":505,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493643268354,"time":1493643268,"md5":"cb+aXMn6TkU3jz658JQ7fA==","fsize":98042,"resto":123610061,"id":"lHPcYDwG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123617528,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)08:54:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123612963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123612963<\/a><br>IS is a US-UK-Israeli intelligence operation, he&#039;s being quite patriotic.","time":1493643278,"resto":123610061,"id":"u0B+XBvj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123617605,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)08:55:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123615247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123615247<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if you bake a cake, you could say, &#039;ingredients are a good thing&#039;, unless you specify what those are specifically it&#039;s a meaningless statement, eggs, sure, flour, yeah great, sugar, why not, arsenic, NO !

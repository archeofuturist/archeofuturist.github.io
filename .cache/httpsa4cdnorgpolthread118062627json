Muslims have no right to force another land to become Islamic. It says so in the Qur&#039;an that WE should assimilate peacefully and respect the laws and traditions of that land. I agree the Europe thing is F&#039;d up.<br>3. Extra tax wtf. hilarious... FAT people should pay more tax.<br>4. If you leave Islam, whatever. I personally would beat my kid if he left Islam. But its similar in other religions, imagine if you found your son was a flaming homosexual, most fathers would get pretty fucking angry. This is similar because I raised him to be a certain way and he just goes ahead and lets me down. Parenting 101.<br>5. The man HAS to be Muslim. That&#039;s a given, but there are requirements: he&#039;s a non-shitty Muslim, is educated, has a decent job, isn&#039;t a cuck and my daughter likes him.

But then comes an uncomfortable question from the driver: &quot;Isn&#039;t it difficult living in a country with so many black people?&quot;<br><br>A question that highlighted another issue: while non-Chinese nationals can have trouble getting a cab, it can be even worse for those with darker skin.<br><br>Project manager Kris Derban has lived in China for eight years. He long suspected that taxis were not picking him up because he is an African-American. Recently his suspicions were confirmed when he asked a driver why he had hesitated to take him. &quot;The driver said, &#039;I worry Africans will run off and not pay.&#039;&quot;<br><br>But catching a cab isn&#039;t the only problem. Another common misconception Derban has to contend with is that he is a drug dealer, he said. &quot;I&#039;ll be with a group of friends and someone specifically comes up to ask me if I have drugs. At first I was offended. Now I tease them and say: &#039;No, do you have drugs?&#039;&quot;<br><br>Derban laughs off such incidents, finding humor in the ignorance. Others have been less fortunate.<br><br>Liberian student David Johnson moved to China just two months ago. He said he has already been subjected to several racist remarks. &quot;One time I was walking down the street and someone called me a stupid black c***,&quot; he reported.<br><br>&quot;Maybe it was because I was with a Chinese girl and they don&#039;t like that.&quot;<br>-------------------<br><br><br>BASED CHINESE!","filename":"Neger und noch mehr Neger","ext":".jpg","w":3000,"h":1800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1490105243371,"time":1490105243,"md5":"60t9NEuPty8Fx5d+0G+jHg==","fsize":1308900,"resto":0,"id":"RoJbrZSq","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"chinese-hate-black-people","country_name":"Germany","replies":2,"images":2,"unique_ips":2},{"no":117626896,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:08:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117626762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117626762<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Reports of this kind of racism date back to when Africans were first welcomed into China to study at Chinese universities in the 1960s.

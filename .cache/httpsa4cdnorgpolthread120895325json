So many of them falsify that shit and work under fake or assumed names\/numbers.

And even if they did many would more than likely get tax refunds due to the shitty low paying jobs they work in. add on top of that local taxes like sales taxes and shit which they do also pay every time they buy shit that is taxed then they do end up actually paying a decent amount and usually more than they end up costing due to not being able to claim shit like social security for which they pay into.<br><br><br>So they often times , at least with those genuinely come over to work, end up putting more into the system in general and end up being very beneficial to local economys since there tends to be more money flowing even with all that they send back home.<br><br><br>So yeah at least illegals working in America.

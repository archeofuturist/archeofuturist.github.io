I&#039;m not ashamed to say I started to get really turned on watching her sobbing, the tears running down her pale, white face while she tried to wipe them away. Her long brown hair was all over the place and she looked like a distressed young maiden crying as she evacuated her village to escape the approaching rapacious Red Army. I got a really hard erection and had to hide it behind my desk. I thought of how great it must have been to be a Lieutenant Colonel and round up women like this, demure looking homely girls, and maybe take them to a barn and try to make them cry more. I would dearly love to hurt her face and make her fellate my pistol while I lick the tears from her face. I would lubricate her anus with her own tears and the sheer eroticism of the setting would mean that two fierce pumps in her torn, bleeding hole, and I would be spent. It wouldn&#039;t even count as a real orgasm for me until I turn her around again and shoot a bullet through her cunt. It would be important to make sure that she knew that she was about to die. I would savour this moment for a while, perhaps telling her what I already did to her elderly parents. I thought of all this that day, and when I got home my underpants was soaked.","filename":"lit","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":470,"tn_w":79,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492459343703,"time":1492459343,"md5":"0gNu5QEHK8MKPBjG8xrz4g==","fsize":25399,"resto":121570776,"id":"JTR1uS\/n","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121573083,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:03:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"sage this shit<br><br>all balts are subhuman niggers","filename":"1342071749328","ext":".jpg","w":375,"h":500,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492459422565,"time":1492459422,"md5":"K\/X9XLpTvHGO6vbCA1dAWQ==","fsize":47364,"resto":121570776,"id":"tJ5HjCJm","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121573463,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:06:19","name":"\u25b6","com":"<a href=\"#p121573083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121573083<\/a><br>Leafs gonna leave<br><br>as they say","filename":"1492142095107","ext":".png","w":400,"h":578,"tn_w":86,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492459579296,"time":1492459579,"md5":"NDmfxyos1NaW+24b87wdxw==","fsize":158540,"resto":121570776,"id":"wo1HrP2n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Now have next to no money and don&#039;t see things getting any better. The progress hes made since I stopped working two years ago has been fantastic.<br><br>I don&#039;t wanna abandon the little guy.<br><br>Also pisses me off that my government can find housing and hand outs for fuckers from Syria and Afghanistan who have refugeed here yet can&#039;t help out a local. I used to think that people in this situation were taken care of and looked after by authorities. But now ibfind myself here I realise this ain&#039;t the case. Spend all my time dealing with 18 year old faggot Samoans at government call centres who DGAF. As I speak to them I&#039;m pretty confident they&#039;re on fb or wondering what they&#039;ll have for lunch.","time":1492241371,"resto":121181907,"id":"m9W1CnH8","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":121187279,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)04:06:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121184801\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121184801<\/a><br>He is your blood.

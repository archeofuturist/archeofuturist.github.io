I can put that as one of my vices too but not really because i usually go my whole work week without playing vidya and on the weekend probably put 16 hours or more on a video game. <br><br>However if im playing a really really good video game i play on the week days too and those hours add up like crazy.<br><br>Witcher 3 was the last game i did that with. I probably invested 52 hours a week on that game when i was into it for like 3 weeks. But thats still probably just childs play compared to alot of other gamers.","time":1492188449,"resto":121068701,"id":"TLwXVF8Y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121081926,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:47:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121080434\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121080434<\/a><br>the bob marley drinks have valarian root and they taste amazing.. at least the green tea one and the red one.. delicious.","time":1492188472,"resto":121068701,"id":"qGe46W8o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121082084,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:49:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hayfever meds","time":1492188557,"resto":121068701,"id":"pQjIP+mA","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121082300,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:51:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121068701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121068701<\/a><br>Hope.","filename":"1491555414481","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":365,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1492188668238,"time":1492188668,"md5":"YmKCFA1YyfHdfESEOZIfVw==","fsize":52626,"resto":121068701,"id":"UFYV9JDd","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":121082399,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:52:03","name":"Anonymous","filename":"images.duckduckgo.com","ext":".jpg","w":2546,"h":1953,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1492188723838,"time":1492188723,"md5":"LtVyXI6Z6ow23rQdnoamzA==","fsize":1433753,"resto":121068701,"id":"psHZjfzG","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121082429,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:52:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121081879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121081879<\/a><br>No, I mean I literally do nothing but play vidya and post on 4chan every day.","time":1492188740,"resto":121068701,"id":"Y2fDHMuZ","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121082771,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:55:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"What Are Xanax called in Germany, and do really all americans use that much medication\/pills?","time":1492188905,"resto":121068701,"id":"IA0rYCU7","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121082803,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:55:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121076062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121076062<\/a><br>Thats a good ass beer breh.","time":1492188925,"resto":121068701,"id":"PlH+pUo+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121082992,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:57:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121069906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121069906<\/a><br>Yeah...if you are taking for anxiety that&#039;s plenty.

But under the new law:<\/span><br><br> Gun restriction laws applied only to handguns, not to long guns or ammunition. The 1938 revisions completely deregulated the acquisition and transfer of rifles and shotguns, and the possession of ammunition.[8]<br> The legal age at which guns could be purchased was lowered from 20 to 18.[9]<br> Permits were valid for three years, rather than one year.[9]<br> More classes of user were exempt from the requirement to hold an acquisition permit; holders of annual hunting permits, government workers, and NSDAP (the National Socialist German Workers&#039; Party, aka the Nazi party) members were no longer subject to gun ownership restrictions. Prior to the 1938 law, only officials of the central government, the states, and employees of the German Reichsbahn Railways were exempted.[8]<br> Manufacture of arms and ammunition continued to require a permit, with the proviso that such permits would no longer be issued to any company even partly owned by Jews; Jews could not manufacture or deal in firearms or ammunition.[8]<br><br>Under both the 1928 and 1938 acts, gun manufacturers and dealers were required to maintain records about purchasers of guns, with serial numbers. These records were to be delivered to a police authority for inspection at the end of each year.<br><br>The 1938 Regulations Against Jews&#039; Possession of Weapons, which came into force the day after Kristallnacht,[10][11] effectively deprived all Jews living under the Third Reich of the right to possess any form of weapons, including truncheons, knives, firearms and ammunition.[12] Before that, some police forces used the pre-existing &quot;trustworthiness&quot; clause to disarm Jews on the basis that &quot;the Jewish population &#039;cannot be regarded as trustworthy&#039;&quot;.[8]","time":1491912865,"resto":120586170,"id":"Ea1+u+mm","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":120590382,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:14:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120590170\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120590170<\/a><br>Even if he was a garbage truck driver he would still be in the right","time":1491912878,"resto":120586170,"id":"a0nLxxlB","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120590388,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:14:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120589712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120589712<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120589746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120589746<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Board<wbr>ing_%28transport%29<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Boarding starts with entering the vehicle and ends with the seating of each passenger and closure of the doors.<\/span>","filename":"wrong","ext":".gif","w":480,"h":287,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":74,"tim":1491912880257,"time":1491912880,"md5":"8R15BwOYK3fNGPX9\/kbVuw==","fsize":1272861,"resto":120586170,"id":"UcXMjWe\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120590401,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:14:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120590230\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120590230<\/a><br>If &quot;overbooking&quot; was outlawed then we wouldn&#039;t have this problem in the first place","time":1491912888,"resto":120586170,"id":"dtc3nyww","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120590437,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:15:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120589326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120589326<\/a><br>Why take the 800 when he can sue for millions?

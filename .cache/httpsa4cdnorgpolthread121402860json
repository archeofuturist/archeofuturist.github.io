In its first reading, Parliament may send amendments to the Council which can either adopt the text with those amendments or send back a &quot;common position&quot;. That position may either be approved by Parliament, or it may reject the text by an absolute majority, causing it to fail, or it may adopt further amendments, also by an absolute majority. If the Council does not approve these, then a &quot;Conciliation Committee&quot; is formed. The Committee is composed of the Council members plus an equal number of MEPs who seek to agree a compromise. Once a position is agreed, it has to be approved by Parliament, by a simple majority.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Euro<wbr>pean_Parliament#Legislative_procedu<wbr>re<\/span>","time":1492372626,"resto":121402860,"id":"REJ3F+mP","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121404574,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)15:57:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121404517\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121404517<\/a><br>T.Merkel","time":1492372658,"resto":121402860,"id":"thNCO4NY","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121404862,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)15:59:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121404517\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121404517<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That position may either be approved by Parliament, or it may reject the text by an absolute majority, causing it to fail, or it may adopt further amendments, also by an absolute majority.

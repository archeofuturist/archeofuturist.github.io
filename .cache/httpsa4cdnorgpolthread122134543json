The ability to demoralize an enemy force through fear is one of if not the best way to make your enemy give up and go home. <br><br>Today it&#039;s generally seen as one of the prime exports from the Middle East, but antifa, BLM, and to a certain extent on both sides of the US election season. (Burning trash cans, wearing masks while &quot;armed&quot;, shutting down roadways and malls, etc.) terrorism is the cheapest, easiest way to sway addled individuals within a populace. For an example, look at the spin done for the moldylocks incident. Now people believe that trump supporters punch women. <br><br>The media has been terrorizing people since I&#039;d say the Vietnam era. In the age of spin, anyone can be reached out and terrorized in the comforts of their own home. (Could North Korea be putting lead paint in your cereal? Tune in at 11!) <br><br>So terrorism as a broad term could be applied to just about everyone. But if you wanted to specifically focus on antifa\/middle eastern\/BLM, there are probably hundreds of examples recently that you could use. Personally, I am fucking no one, so no one would terrorize me directly. But since a good majority of my family is still on active duty, I keep an eye out on things that may send them to &quot;peacekeep&quot; or outright war. I hope this gives you some ideas anon.","time":1492781917,"resto":122134543,"id":"gWUdVRAg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

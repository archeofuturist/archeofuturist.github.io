So if Congress ever refuses to raise the debt ceiling, what it&#039;s really doing is refusing to honor America&#039;s debt obligations.<br><br>This would be calamitous.<br><br>U.S. debt is considered the safest asset in the global financial market. Countless other assets and investments around the globe are all keyed off it. Countries stockpile U.S. treasuries in order to maintain currency reserves, because the overwhelming majority of international financial transactions are done in American dollars. All of this hinges on people&#039;s trust that the U.S. government will abide by its promises.

My base definitely wants the border wall, my base really wants it \u2014 you&#039;ve been to many of the rallies. OK, the thing they want more than anything is the wall. My base, which is a big base; I think my base is 45 percent. You know, it&#039;s funny. The Democrats, they have a big advantage in the electoral college. Big, big, big advantage. I&#039;ve always said the popular vote would be a lot easier than the electoral college. The electoral college \u2014 but it&#039;s a whole different campaign (unintelligible). The electoral college is very difficult for a Republican to win, and I will tell you, the people want to see it. They want to see the wall, they want to see security. Now, it just came out that they&#039;re 73 percent down. ... That&#039;s a tremendous achievement. ... Look at this, in 100 days, that down to the lowest in 17 years and it&#039;s going lower. Now, people aren&#039;t coming because they know they&#039;re not going to get through, and there isn&#039;t crime. You know the migration up to the border is horrible for women, you know that?

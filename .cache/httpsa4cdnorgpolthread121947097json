I don&#039;t know what anyone sees in Hannity.

I&#039;d have much rather seen some of those communist kikes on CNN or MSNBC get the boot, but he IS a typical boomer cuckservative. This is still advantageous. O&#039;Reily leaving means there are two good possibilities that could come from this:<br><br>1) someone younger, fresher, more redpilled, more nationalist, and less of an israel cocksucker takes the splot. Sometimes you need to burn down a forest for new seeds to grow. <br>2) his departure is enough to get at least SOME conservative viewers to stop watching Fox News altogether. Remember, FOX NEWS IS CONTROLLED OPPOSITION. It&#039;s the good goy release valve. The boomer conservatives think they&#039;re enlightened, even though they&#039;re watching the exact same ZOGmedia shit as everyone else, just with a different coat of paint.

He seemed to have gut instinct. By far his best moments in the campaign were when he went off the teleprompter and gave expression to his gut contempt for liberal lies and hypocrisy through some cheap but effective zinger, like calling Elizabeth Warren &quot;Pocahontas&quot;. We told ourselves that this instinct and gut feeling would somehow miraculously carry him through.<br><br>There are respectable historical precedents for a deliberately assumed and accepted naivety like ours last autumn. The discipline of the Jesuits under Ignatius Loyola was one of &quot;sacrificium intellectus&quot; - a deliberate sacrificing of the intellect to faith. And the message of the Right&#039;s great philosphical guides, like Nietzsche, is that intelligence is just an epiphenomenon, that everything that matters is done by instinct.<br><br>But the first 100 days of Trump should be graven in history as the definitive refutation of this line of thinking. The unintelligent man is a man unarmed. If anyone had told me in October that I would one day actually hate Trump I wouldn&#039;t have believed them. But here I am now understanding all too vividly and exactly what these Rachel Maddow types feel when they look at his big smug self-satisfied face and hear these vacuous monosyllabic assurances about how &quot;big&quot; and &quot;great&quot; he&#039;s going to make everything dribbling out of his lips.<br><br>I think the &quot;I&#039;m a globalist and a nationalist&quot; absurdity has to be the final kick in the teeth for his real base.

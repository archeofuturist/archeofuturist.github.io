The idea is to come up with a solution before that happens. As to what that solution is... who knows? But we can&#039;t just sit here and do nothing and let a crazy dictator build up a nuclear arsenal that can target our country.","time":1491979885,"resto":120723486,"id":"bXD4CqpE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120726057,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)02:51:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120725129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120725129<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120725280\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120725280<\/a><br>This is just not true:<br>http:\/\/www.nasdaq.com\/article\/midda<wbr>y-update-stocks-return-gains-on-rep<wbr>orts-of-chinese-troop-deployments-o<wbr>n-n-korea-border-cm772273<br><br>You think NASDAQ is publishing fake news?<br>Of course the government denies it! <br>Why should they give away the plan?","filename":"36t35eth","ext":".jpg","w":653,"h":416,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":79,"tim":1491979909247,"time":1491979909,"md5":"E826LtKgmdbX0VVuofkaXg==","fsize":64026,"resto":120723486,"id":"Z+9HdEt2","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120726194,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)02:53:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120725993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120725993<\/a><br><br>Wtf I love commies now","time":1491980023,"resto":120723486,"id":"v2odMEhb","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120726242,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)02:54:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"Does anybody else miss The Gambia generals?","filename":"IMG_1314","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":962,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1491980058398,"time":1491980058,"md5":"4Naj0ihbfvA6l+hGCmU9CQ==","fsize":60033,"resto":120723486,"id":"bBzxHZkw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120726291,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)02:54:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120725581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120725581<\/a><br>My man, I know devil&#039;s advocate is a hard job at times but there is no way in hell allowing an unstable totalitarian micro-country develop a nuclear program is a good thing for any of us.","time":1491980098,"resto":120723486,"id":"6d5xFolg","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120726367,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)02:56:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120725581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120725581<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120726023\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120726023<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120726291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120726291<\/a><br><br>http:\/\/www.news.com.au\/finance\/work<wbr>\/leaders\/north-korean-missile-could<wbr>-hit-australia-within-two-years-us-<wbr>diplomat-warns\/news-story\/2578c6244<wbr>f4b01343bc7940daab67b71<br><br>And again: They can level Seoul, a 10mio city, in 2 hours.

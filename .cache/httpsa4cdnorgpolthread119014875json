In the last month it took 2 weeks of an Iranian posting threads and comments about how &quot;Iranians are white&quot; and in that 2 weeks half of \/pol\/ thought the same until one day someone pointed out the obvious, and I still see a few stragglers in the present. Nobody here even thinks deeply about what they support, no one practices self-inflection and it shows. I myself have been shilling the stance &quot;Iraqis are people too&quot; (It&#039;s the only way I can get you guys to stop calling me a sandnigger) and I have seen some notable improvements in how people react to Middle Eastern Arabs. I&#039;m bringing this up because I am concerned that our own thoughts can be manipulated, through how we think others on this board think, or directly through interactions with shills. The reaction to posts which bring new ideas and opinions or point out the flaws with our president\/guy (regardless if they are trolls) is always that of calling OP a shill. Have posters ever considered that the people who call others &quot;shills&quot; could in fact be (((them))) guiding us further into an unsustainable ideology? The fact that it takes 2 weeks to change half of posters (not necessarily lurkers) views is mind blowing, the fact that people here can flip flop on issues while being able to justify them each time is potentially proof that you guys don&#039;t ponder deeply on what you believe. For all you know, I could be a shill, but look around and you will see how the changes in what this board believes comes to be. This has just been bugging me for a while sorry if this seems disjointed. Example: ISPs selling personal data without permission: When only a few months ago \/pol\/ was completely against this (I know pol isn&#039;t a person so don&#039;t put up that straw man, this is a generalization). Could these posters be die hard Trump supporters? Or could it be (((them))) pushing us into accepting the &quot;Corporate State&quot;?","filename":"1488822588430","ext":".jpg","w":535,"h":1156,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490931731006,"time":1490931731,"md5":"nQYpVc\/rWRjgPLYh\/w9+rQ==","fsize":273068,"resto":0,"id":"W\/quvfkD","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-does-it-feel-that-you-are-so-easily","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":4,"unique_ips":11},{"no":119016629,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:58:09","name":"Sage","com":"Nice pasta<br>Saged and reported","filename":"you_deserve_a_seizure_for_your_posts","ext":".gif","w":640,"h":538,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":105,"tim":1490932689227,"time":1490932689,"md5":"S6pu\/mpTDswAx9BVOA7b5w==","fsize":51811,"resto":119014875,"id":"ZSSbT4lN","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119016806,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:59:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119016629\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119016629<\/a><br>b-but i wrote this tho","time":1490932793,"resto":119014875,"id":"W\/quvfkD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119016940,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)00:01:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119014875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119014875<\/a><br><br>Bitch please.<br><br>If you wrote anything on this board like that, nobody would go past the first 3 sentences.","filename":"1484170537141","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":687,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1490932879511,"time":1490932879,"md5":"00dBEes8EEsqV2Xu8cXyuA==","fsize":60012,"resto":119014875,"id":"58OkVl1k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119017053,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)00:02:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119016940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119016940<\/a><br>That&#039;s what I was hoping wouldn&#039;t happen.","time":1490932950,"resto":119014875,"id":"W\/quvfkD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119017166,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)00:03:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119016629\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119016629<\/a><br>This is Fritz&#039;s mom, you caused a seizure.

JP Morgan and friends have been manipulating the price of silver to try and protect the US dollar for too long and people are starting to wake up to this. Less than 10 days ago, 23k shares of Silver were traded to keep the price down. It went from ~$18.50 down to $16.94 and is now currently trading at $17.55. I expect the second dip in a double dip before this increase happens.<br>Silver is used in many electronics, and we&#039;ve abused it so much, that metal is coming back. Silver is also not being excavated anymore as we might have run out. That means that the quantity of silver is ever decreasing while demand can only go up.<br>Thanks to Ron Paul, Arizona has now passed a bill allowing for the use of Gold&amp;Silver as money while also abolishing the capital gains tax on it. This will further increase the value of the precious metals and can now be comfortably exchanged.<br>If you&#039;re looking to get into buying silver as a hedge against inflation there are two general rules I try to follow.<br>1. buy in one (1) ounce increments as they are easier to exchange<br>2. if you&#039;re not buying numismatic coins, then limit your spot over price to $1.50<br><br>Fun fact: one ounce of silver can be used to purify one gallon of contaminated water in less than 24 hours.","filename":"Philharmoniker","ext":".jpg","w":4032,"h":3024,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490049105414,"time":1490049105,"md5":"66Hrj18Usu8k8mOI061dVg==","fsize":3461976,"resto":117533765,"id":"63ztzuC8","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117541636,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)18:32:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117537768\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117537768<\/a><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Sbo<wbr>h-_w43W8<br><br>This is another good one","time":1490049131,"resto":117533765,"id":"7dFfvxqV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117541916,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)18:33:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117541636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117541636<\/a><br>Yes this is a great one too.

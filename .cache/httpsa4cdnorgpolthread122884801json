But why? I do not understand how a sociologist could come to the conclusion that racial diversity is better for a society than racial homogeneity. Take this paragraph about homogeneity in Japan<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Racial homogeneity means Japan has none of the oppressive machinery America has instituted to cope with \u201cdiversity.\u201d It has no civil rights commissions, equal employment offices, or diversity consultants. Japanese never yelp about discrimination when something goes wrong, and never sue employers for \u201cracism.\u201d There is no racial tension, race riots, or hate laws. No one gets in trouble because the board of directors is all Japanese or because all the faces on television are Japanese. Nobody complains about \u201cprofiling\u201d when the police pat down the most likely trouble-makers. No one is ever fired because he said something \u201cinsensitive\u201d or told a forbidden joke or used a forbidden slur. Elections are about politics, not about whether Hispanics or blacks are taking over. Voting districts can have logical geograpahic boundaries, because no one worries about whether black or Hispanic votes are being diluted. There are no ethnic or national minorities that meddle with Japan\u2019s foreign policy. Any number of hugely vexing and intractable problems are simply absent from Japan<\/span><br><br>To me it seems pretty clear that diversity just adds so many random problems and tensions in a society that make everything far less efficient. Imagine not having to worry about any of these problems. So HOW given this obvious information, could sociology still be so liberal? It seems like an OBVIOUS conclusion that if you wanted to have a society as efficient as possible, you would want it homogeneous as opposed to diverse.","filename":"1481441866960","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":799,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":184,"tim":1493214371218,"time":1493214371,"md5":"U7Y7m57v136fyMo0ozKBjw==","fsize":251375,"resto":0,"id":"aZub+\/rP","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-is-science-so-liberal","country_name":"United States","replies":39,"images":2,"unique_ips":31},{"no":122884982,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)09:48:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Think of the demography that studies at universities.

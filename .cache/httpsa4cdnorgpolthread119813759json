While society overall has &quot;progressed&quot; (according to liberals themselves), and blacks are discriminated much less (if at all) at most places of employment (including the police), the level of violent crime in Chicago, for example, has increased, not decreased. Why is that?<br><br>Alternatively, ask your friend what would be the most likely outcome if we actually _increased_ (not decreased) policing of black-owned neighborhoods, and kept at it for, say 20-30 years. It should be clear to anyone with even a basic sense of economics, that less crime means higher property values. As long as at least a portion of the houses in the neighborhood is owned by blacks, increase in policing should bring prosperity to the black community and decrease the &quot;deep-seated structural inequality&quot; your friend is referring to. So, in fact, BLM _contributes to_ and not alleviates the problem structural inequality. Why is that?<br><br>Most people involved in OWS were radical leftists, hence BLM works under the guidance of and towards the goal of &quot;radical left&quot; (quotation marks because this &quot;radical left&quot; isn&#039;t really radical).

What the &quot;radical leftists&quot; of BLM want isn&#039;t a Communist revolution to overthrow the state by any means. What they want is to serve as a picturesque backdrop to help the pen pushers at the NYT to promote a specific agenda. The agenda would step-by-step dismantle the current (mostly working) law enforcement run by working class officials and replace them with &quot;progressive&quot; friends of the NYT pen pushers.

You&#039;d have to look at the degree to which economic status is related to crime, and then you would have to demonstrate how the low economic status is caused by the so called &quot;systemic racism&quot;. This, of course, would require a definition of said systematic racism and proof of its occurrence.<br><br>One of the problem, however, is that systemic racism is inferred (it seems) whenever there is a statistical difference of outcome on certain parameters between blacks and whites. In other words, the existence of the hypothesized cause is inferred from the effects the cause is supposed to explain.<br><br>Instead of looking for cause C so as to determine whether or not one finds effect E, the activist merely point to some effect E and then assume C to be the case, or even use E as a proof of C. This is backward.<br><br>They must show C to be the case independently of E.<br><br>But even if you were to show that cultural factor are at play in the rate of black on black crime, you would not be out of the wood as to the matter of systemic racism. It could very well be argued that systemic racism caused these cultural feature to emerge. For instance, it could -- probably convincingly -- be argued that police brutality or police racism caused a rise of an anti cop mentality within the black community, and contributed to the creation of a mythos of black gangster good guy versus exploitative and abusive white police bad guys.<br><br>But then again, you&#039;d need a definition of &quot;systemic racism&quot; and a way of identifying it when it occurs.","time":1491524183,"resto":119813759,"id":"bL1rJFTj","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119821519,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)20:17:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119819581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119819581<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not saying anybody should judge people by looks but if someone walked around like a gangster I&#039;m probably going to assume they believe they are one.<\/span><br><br>police also checks them or gets into fights with them, so it&#039;s more than just looks.

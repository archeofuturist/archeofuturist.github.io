I claimed it&#039;s a bad movement overall, while he defended it.<br><br>My main point was that if their primary mission was really to prevent the loss of black lives to senseless violence, they should be using their national platform and tremendous influence to draw attention to black on black crime, which takes an exponentially greater number of black lives than police brutality each year.<br><br>Besides the braindead counterargument of &quot;most whites are killed by other whites,&quot; the most common rebuttal (and the one my friend offered), is that the disproportionate level of violent crime in the black community can be attributed to the epidemic of black poverty caused by deep-seated &quot;structures of inequality.&quot;<br><br>I&#039;m pretty confident this is just a vague bullshit cop out answer along the lines of &quot;muh systemic racism!&quot;, but I&#039;m having trouble finding solid statistical or logical evidence to refute it.<br><br>My hunch is to point out problems in black culture, e.g., single motherhood rate, glorification of gang culture\/crime in hip-hop, relative apathy towards education, etc., but I&#039;m not entirely confident in citing these as hard evidence to explain black on black crime.<br><br>How do you think I should proceed with my argument in this scenario?","filename":"police brutality blacks liberals","ext":".jpg","w":379,"h":471,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491520884208,"time":1491520884,"md5":"0SyQ3r11ktvZ0g8r9GMAdQ==","fsize":83194,"resto":0,"id":"Rie6W9BF","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-to-argue-against-blm-effectively","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119814274,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:25:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119813759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119813759<\/a><br>https:\/\/policy.m4bl.org\/platform\/<br><br>why don&#039;t you go ahead and show us all where BLM states that their mission is to &quot;prevent the loss of black lives to senseless violence&quot;.","time":1491521103,"resto":119813759,"id":"pg7Pwg8G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119814283,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:25:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119813759\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119813759<\/a><br>They will try to get you tangked in their web of bullshit if you argue them on systematic shit since that non-argument can last for days.

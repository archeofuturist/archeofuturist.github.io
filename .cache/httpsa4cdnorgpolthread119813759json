While society overall has &quot;progressed&quot; (according to liberals themselves), and blacks are discriminated much less (if at all) at most places of employment (including the police), the level of violent crime in Chicago, for example, has increased, not decreased. Why is that?<br><br>Alternatively, ask your friend what would be the most likely outcome if we actually _increased_ (not decreased) policing of black-owned neighborhoods, and kept at it for, say 20-30 years. It should be clear to anyone with even a basic sense of economics, that less crime means higher property values. As long as at least a portion of the houses in the neighborhood is owned by blacks, increase in policing should bring prosperity to the black community and decrease the &quot;deep-seated structural inequality&quot; your friend is referring to. So, in fact, BLM _contributes to_ and not alleviates the problem structural inequality. Why is that?<br><br>Most people involved in OWS were radical leftists, hence BLM works under the guidance of and towards the goal of &quot;radical left&quot; (quotation marks because this &quot;radical left&quot; isn&#039;t really radical).

What the &quot;radical leftists&quot; of BLM want isn&#039;t a Communist revolution to overthrow the state by any means. What they want is to serve as a picturesque backdrop to help the pen pushers at the NYT to promote a specific agenda. The agenda would step-by-step dismantle the current (mostly working) law enforcement run by working class officials and replace them with &quot;progressive&quot; friends of the NYT pen pushers.

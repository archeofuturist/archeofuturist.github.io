The very concept of insurance relies upon the company judging the risk of each customer and then setting the rate at a level which which statistically justify keeping them as customers. If a customer is too high-risk, it&#039;s within the company&#039;s financial interest to deny them service.<br><br>This is how EVERY real insurance system works. If you got rid of the ability to deny service, the insurance companies&#039; profit potential will plummet. This means there would be little incentive to enter that market, which will lead to a lack of competition, which will lead to overall high health premiums and monopolies. This is what happens EVERY SINGLE TIME socialist governments try to fix prices and regulate to &quot;improve&quot; the free market.<br><br>What Trump and the government want is not insurance. Insurance is based upon you yourself paying for a worst-case scenario you don&#039;t expect to happen. If you are sick, and you KNOW you will need health money in the neat future, that&#039;s not insurance. That&#039;s a known expense that in any other field would be funded out of pocket. But because a sick person can&#039;t possibly pay millions out of his own pocket, and insuraing them for a known expense is pants-on-head retarded, the only option is to steal millions from the taxpayer to fund it. This is what happens in the end.<br><br>basically, Trump is a dirty socialist.

The very concept of insurance relies upon the company judging the risk of each customer and then setting the rate at a level which which statistically justify keeping them as customers.

Insurance is based upon you yourself paying for a worst-case scenario you don&#039;t expect to happen. If you are sick, and you KNOW you will need health money in the neat future, that&#039;s not insurance. That&#039;s a known expense that in any other field would be funded out of pocket.

Basically, Obamacare has its roots in a system proposed by Nixon and later implemented in MS by Mitt Romney (as governor) and Ted Kennedy. Romneycare gave lots of people good coverage and was bipartisan, but was too expensive. They didn&#039;t prioritize cost when they wrote it. Obamacare wasn&#039;t actually made by Obama, and when he said &quot;his health care plan&quot; in his speeches, he was lying. He only helped negotiate it. He wasn&#039;t doing the dirty work crunching numbers or writing policy.<br>The economic and Health and Human Services committees that were key in writing the policy ultimately came up with a pretty good plan that was unrealistically and poorly scored by the Congressional Budget Office, and would never pass because Republicans wouldn&#039;t vote for any health care reform, even if it was a good plan - they couldn&#039;t let something good happen under Democrat control. Newt Gingrich, Paul Ryan, John Boehner, and John McCain, plus many other neocons were in on opposing health care reform.<br><br>The idea behind the mandate is to eliminate the freeloader problem - everyone signs up instead of only buying insurance when they&#039;re sick. Call it socialism, but it&#039;s probably the only way to get people to buy care outside of government-provided insurance. The real cost of insurance doesn&#039;t come from the insurance companies - the costs come from big pharmaceutical companies, companies that manufacture medical equipment, and hospital networks. For example, in Canada pharmaceutical companies have their profits capped. In the US, before Obamacare (maybe now, I haven&#039;t gotten to that part of the book), Medicare was not able negotiate the cost of drugs. This wrote a blank check to the pharma companies.","time":1491191893,"resto":119283556,"id":"ajwORKlh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119287663,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:58:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119287508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119287508<\/a><br>nah Rand&#039;s only schtick is healthcare the rest of the country would be on fire.","time":1491191933,"resto":119283556,"id":"C4s8ek8h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119287684,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:59:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119287563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119287563<\/a><br><br>Why should somebody have to go into debt just because they got sick?","time":1491191942,"resto":119283556,"id":"jHKO0Qzr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119287712,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:59:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119287302\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119287302<\/a><br>I sell critter meat but not in a formal shop.

We also need to reform the malpractice system, as doctors often issue extra tests that are unnecessary when compared to other countries, and they don&#039;t do it for extra charge - they do it defensively so that if something happens to the patient they can prove that they tested everything. <br>Obamacare consisted of a bunch of agreements between Chuck Schumer and individual Democrats that were mostly stripped from what they were originally (example: excluding certain states from medical taxes because manufacturers were there). Pelosi, Schumer, Obama, and the advisory committees threw together a shitty version of a good bill that had been butchered to pass Congress but ultimately had to be modified to pass reconciliation (51 votes for a bill consisting of mostly financial policy) because they couldn&#039;t pass a filibuster (which Republicans have abused more in modern times than any other time in US history).

Since we are talking economics, we will consider it from the perspective of economic principles. In that way you are saying that unlimited health-care is a good financial investment. i.e., if you pay for health care for person X, that&#039;s worth it because person X will contribute more to society in his lifetime than if he were dead. Most practically, he will contribute more in taxes than he would cost in treatments. <br>tl;dr : paying health-care costs will make the government money in the long-term.<br><br>it doesn&#039;t take a genius to figure out this can&#039;t possibly true. If a person will earn enough in his lifetime to make up for health-care costs, the he obviously has the ability to fund it himself. If his expected costs are sufficiently low, he will qualify for health care. If the expected costs are high, but his earning potential can make up for it, then he can take a loan and pay for it later. This is completely handled by the free market.<br><br>What isn&#039;t handled by the free market are things that lose money and don&#039;t make a profit. So if a poor person has low earning potential and high predicted treatment costs, then the only option for him is to get tax funding. BECAUSE IT WILL LOSE MONEY TO TREAT HIM. If you save his life, you will LOSE MONEY, and make everyone in the Courtney POORER than they were before. If this wasn&#039;t the case, the free market would have exploited this a profit-earning potential transaction.<br>tl;dr : the economic argument for free health-care is nonexistent.<br><br>That only way you can argue that universal health-care is a good thing is if you look at it from a moral perspective instead of an economic one. Economically, it&#039;s one of the most retarded things you can possible do.","time":1491193233,"resto":119283556,"id":"4a1uya7I","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119289637,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:20:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119288482\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119288482<\/a><br><br>Yeah, I don&#039;t believe that.

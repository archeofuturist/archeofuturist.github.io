This should -only- be directed at whites or Europeans, because the White West is the only place on Earth where Christianity is dying. Even the Arab diaspora who left the Middle East are 70% Christian, and they&#039;re more religious and spiritual than the vast majority of American Christians. The problem with American Christians is that the stupid ones treat Christ like a rock star and the Jews as his audience, rather than treating him as the Son of God, and the Jews as the people he stood up against. Yes, you are correct that Western Christians have become so caught up with being nice that they forget that Christianity and Islam are brothers when it comes to similarities, and that in the Middle East, they both worship the same Allah. Christianity is not about being a nice white family, it&#039;s about so much more, about a personal connection with God. <br>Now, the reason I said this is a meme is because the religion is only dying in the corrupt, atheist, Jew-worshipping West that is doomed to collapse anyway. Christianity in the rest of the world will grow, as all of Sub-Saharan Africa is Christian and will experience a large population boom, as well as devout Latin Americans, Chinese, and Indians as well. The religion isn&#039;t dying at all, it&#039;s only dying in your homes where to be honest, it doesn&#039;t deserve to have to share a continent with such jewish corruption.","time":1492533200,"resto":121702441,"id":"izCsP9Rg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121704161,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)12:33:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"Romans 2:28 - For he is not a Jew, which is one outwardly; neither [is that] circumcision, which is outward in the flesh:<br><br>Revelation 2:9 - I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and [I know] the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but [are] the synagogue of Satan.","filename":"1477455257324","ext":".png","w":228,"h":226,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1492533237991,"time":1492533237,"md5":"kiniLkpHnFaUpHEflwcFzw==","fsize":93718,"resto":121702441,"id":"ItGCa\/ap","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121704328,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)12:35:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"embrace your folkways","filename":"5cec2ff16552dc9881c69634fc2193f194d86108377f5303298d22b304104a1a","ext":".png","w":1324,"h":545,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":51,"tim":1492533309486,"time":1492533309,"md5":"d3t1NOjDQx6YOr6rA8PxEQ==","fsize":30519,"resto":121702441,"id":"cDFCboc7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121704381,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)12:35:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Revelation 3:9 - Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee.","time":1492533332,"resto":121702441,"id":"ItGCa\/ap","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121704520,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)12:36:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121702441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121702441<\/a><br>I will take Catechism this year OP.

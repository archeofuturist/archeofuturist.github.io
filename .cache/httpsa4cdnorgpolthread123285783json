Society is ruled by the government as a moral authority, society makes laws that are supposed to represent the morality of society, society teaches people what they should and should not do, and so on. And I personally see no reason why we should rely on an ancient small society of Canaanites to make our rules, when we can do our own.","time":1493443184,"resto":123285783,"id":"JSEpu21q","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123300005,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:25:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123288305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123288305<\/a><br>Is this bait?","time":1493443542,"resto":123285783,"id":"prDj9Rzo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123300033,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:25:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123296750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123296750<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Religious populace <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Preserve traditional values<\/span><br>Oh, is that why Europe is importing Muslims?<br><br>You&#039;re obviously not talking about the modern Christians, who&#039;s values are incredibly different to any values of the past.

And I would agree with you that if the Church tries to control people directly that is a bad thing to do.<br><br>In fact I think that the importance of Christianity in particular is that it gives a basis for individual people to chose to do good and moral things themselves. If you look at the New Testament, Jesus does not force or compel anyone to do anything. He does say what is good and what is bad, and how one can obtain salvation, but it is always up to the individual to chose act that way. This is important for any sort of free society to exist. People must chose to do the right thing not because they fear some sort punishment, or government sanction but because it is simply the right thing to do. Now it is possible a society could exist where government exists to compel everyone to do the right thing but that would be a police state.<br><br>And how do you suppose this Godless society would arrive at deciding what is the &#039;right&#039; thing? Maybe at first it would start with people genuinely trying to formulate what they feel is best, but eventually, especially if this is a police state, it would be those in power who decide on what is right and what is wrong. And I am certain it would lead to those in power creating rules that benefit them and their cronies. Look at every socialist\/communist regime ever for proof. The masses are just cogs in the machine to benefit the elite.","time":1493444157,"resto":123285783,"id":"Pjo4LRhN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123301379,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:42:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Christians have proven to be the worst religious.

God exists and created mankind in his image. This means that mankind has a soul and freewill. This is the capacity to chose to do good or bad. The purpose of man is to get close to get God. This is done by accepting Jesus as your savior and doing good to help your fellow man. Also by virtue of mankind having a soul he is imbued with inherent dignity. This means it is morally bad to behave or act a certain way towards man. It is always wrong to steal from man, to cheat on a man, to murder a man, to enslave a man. These are objective things that are right and wrong based on the inherent dignity imbued in man by God. Without God existing it impossible to logically arrive at this idea. Emmanuel Kant tried to mimic the idea of the soul in his work in a secular way, but it essentially came down to him declaring it is so. Because I said so is not a sufficient basis for reality unless the person saying it is God.","time":1493444921,"resto":123285783,"id":"Pjo4LRhN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123302079,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:49:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123300855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123300855<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And how do you suppose this Godless society would arrive at deciding what is the &#039;right&#039; thing?<\/span><br>That is a very good question, and fortunately, there is an answer. You look at how things are, you study the effects of your actions, and then you decide. This is why atheists are interested in science. You might say that atheists are hypocrites about science when it comes to racism and whatnot, but you might be mistaking atheism with leftism, and leftism is a cancerous religion itself.<br>I digress. You asked how do we decide what is good. We look at the reality of things. You might play the devil&#039;s advocate right now and say that some people might decide murder is good if it benefits them. But I kind of think that people will see the wisdom of punishing murder even without some god telling them, and simply by looking at the fact that society as a whole benefits if people come together to punish murder.<br>Either way, humanity is fucked. Either you realize the reality of facts is a dictatorship, or you accept god as a strict dictator, or you do whatever you want and risk being a degenerate.","time":1493444996,"resto":123285783,"id":"JSEpu21q","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123302361,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:53:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123285783\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123285783<\/a><br>Atheists.

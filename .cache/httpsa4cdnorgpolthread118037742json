Shariablue often calls us a &quot;hivemind&quot; and it&#039;s meant in a derogatory fashion. We are a hivemind, but we don&#039;t act as a singular being. The hivemind has an unending number of voices. What makes \/pol\/ great is that every stupid or great idea can be posted on here and we can talk about the merits of that idea. Our hivemind isn&#039;t one concentrated, single ideology. It&#039;s ten million voices and ten million bots, unafraid to say what they think and in this collective, the best and most entertaining ideas win. That&#039;s why COINTELPRO doesn&#039;t work here. We are unbreakable because you would have to break every one of us at once in order to win. And don&#039;t call our ideas &quot;multicultural&quot; you fucking faggot. This is the fucking idea Thunderdome. Why do you think Marxism\/Socialism\/Communism generals are only ever the result of raids? Because those ideas are shit and everyone knows it. Right-wing ideology has taken over this board because everything else is the immature dream of bullshitters.","time":1490330541,"resto":118037742,"id":"yv2065Uk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118041889,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)00:42:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118037742\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118037742<\/a><br>We don&#039;t need a constitution.

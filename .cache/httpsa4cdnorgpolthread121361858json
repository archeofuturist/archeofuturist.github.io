In a recent study, when we looked at the correlation between genetic structure [based on microsatellite markers] versus self-description, we found 99.9% concordance between the two. We actually had a higher discordance rate between self-reported sex and markers on the X chromosome! So you could argue that sex is also a problematic category. And there are differences between sex and gender; self-identification may not be correlated with biology perfectly. And there is sexism. And you can talk about age the same way. A person&#039;s chronological age does not correspond perfectly with his biological age for a variety of reasons, both inherited and non-inherited. Perhaps just using someone&#039;s actual birth year is not a very good way of measuring age. Does that mean we should throw it out? No. Also, there is ageism\u2014prejudice related to age in our society. A lot of these arguments, which have a political or social aspect to them, can be made about all categories, not just the race\/ethnicity one.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosgeneti<wbr>cs\/article?id=10.1371\/journal.pgen.<wbr>0010014","time":1492354323,"resto":121361858,"id":"9LEvUA5v","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121365863,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)10:52:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121365009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121365009<\/a><br>Based fellow czech telling it how it is.","time":1492354378,"resto":121361858,"id":"3W0AtvI3","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":121365983,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)10:54:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121361858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121361858<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you can&#039;t look at someone&#039;s dna and tell what race they are<\/span><br>yes you can lol","time":1492354447,"resto":121361858,"id":"cdhWi9AY","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121366216,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)10:56:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121361858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121361858<\/a><br>If race were a social construct there would be no races at all because that would imply race doesnt exist.","time":1492354568,"resto":121361858,"id":"KRpSdOMt","country":"BS","country_name":"Bahamas"},{"no":121366281,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)10:56:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121361858\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121361858<\/a><br>Racism is also a social construct<br><br>Sexism is also a social construct<br><br>Even gassing Jews is a social construct","time":1492354607,"resto":121361858,"id":"emIoTunw","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121366343,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)10:57:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;You can&#039;t look at someone&#039;s DNA and say they are &quot;this&quot; race&quot;<\/span><br><br>holy fuck they&#039;re literally just lying.","filename":"Capture","ext":".jpg","w":882,"h":742,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":105,"tim":1492354645575,"time":1492354645,"md5":"sfST\/mJJV1IPXocBtyM2aw==","fsize":47526,"resto":121361858,"id":"VkXSGOAY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121366363,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)10:57:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121365983\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121365983<\/a><br>I&#039;m German\/ sri lankan, what would my gentic markers tell you.

The choice of dogs is obviously motivated entirely by the fact that dog breeds are more genetically distinct than human races.

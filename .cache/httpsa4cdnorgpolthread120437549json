We were promised that it would be America first, yet here we fucking are again, prepping up to fight another war for the jews. There&#039;s no need for us to be there, yet we&#039;re there.<br><br>At the same time, I couldn&#039;t tell you what Trump was thinking. Until we see it all play out, there&#039;s not much that can be said or done. You know, he risks looking like Obama if he does nothing, and he risks looking like a fool if he does. So I suppose he went for both; he attacked an airfield while at the same time not really hitting anything significant.<br><br>I have lost a lot of respect for Trump for even allowing himself to be put into this situation in the first place, however I think he didn&#039;t really have much of a choice. In any case, it does show that he can be played by kikes and their shit false flags made by people who have a literal fucking Oscar award for acting. Just know that we &#039;ought to keep our eyes on Trump for further fuckups.","time":1491832831,"resto":120437549,"id":"X0RSODBz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120440842,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)10:01:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120438724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120438724<\/a><br>Get on your knees kid.

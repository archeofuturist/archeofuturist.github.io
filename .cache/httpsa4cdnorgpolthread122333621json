An unedited video showing ANTIFA for what\/who they are is more powerful than any punch in the culture wars. My idea is to build a website dedicated to documenting ANTIFA crimes &amp; perps who commit them. <br><br>I haven\u2019t coded in years so if someone likes the idea, by all means run with it. In theory the site is a simple video\/photo library with thumbnails of criminals, the crime committed linking to video\/photos. In the detail of crime we should FLIP THE SCRIPT, WEAPONIZE THEIR IDEOLOGY AGAINST THEM. Know your enemy to defeat them, attack them at the root, speak their language to reveal fallacy in it, while also exposing its threats to greater society.<br><br>Remember these people are a product of their environment, never having been exposed to diverse opinion, they can\u2019t win the battle of ideas, that\u2019s why they want to shut down any freedoms of thought\/speech contrary to theirs. Knowing they grew up on a diet of post-modernist cultural Marxist ideology, judging the world by groups, dividing by skincolor, gender, age, sexual orientation, class etc, instead of judging a person by individual actions, words, experiences, can be used against them. <br><br>Ex- How minority Trump supporters are treated. At first contact the leftist freezes up, like a malfunctioning computer they don\u2019t understand, synaptic misfiring occurs in their brain, it does not compute with the indoctrination they have been fed all life. To them its a \u201ctriggering micro-aggression\u201d event, for the first time beliefs have been challenged, flaws in ideology are sewn. After a reboot, hardcore ideologues resort to calling them a \u201ctoken\u201d or \u201cinternalized\u201d victim but a few think &amp; question for the first time &amp; more importantly when the greater world sees what these people believe they loose credibility in public opinion. <br><br>Thoughts? The first post is a weaponized example put to practice.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-22 at 10.37.59 AM","ext":".png","w":496,"h":605,"tn_w":204,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492898273119,"time":1492898273,"md5":"gia+9FLj4wThwVtRT8P0zw==","fsize":187659,"resto":0,"id":"cqzxZFXc","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"antifa-leftist-crimes-ideology-weaponized-against","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":122333690,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)17:58:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122333621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122333621<\/a><br>CRIME= Racism, Violent Anti-Immigrant Assault<br><br>Hi my name is TBD &amp; I am a violent anti-immigrant racist.

These jobs don&#039;t pay well. Sometimes, PI&#039;s won&#039;t even pay you, they will just want students volunteering. I guarantee you if labs could outsource these jobs, they would. In that sense, I feel lucky that I&#039;m not entirely affected by the outsourcing of jobs, but my younger brother is a business student and is struggling to find work. It&#039;s frustrating to see him do well in school (UofT) and struggle to find a bank that will give him a chance","time":1490897152,"resto":118938956,"id":"j9+KJ7P8","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118947892,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:10:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118946274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118946274<\/a><br>CANADA BTFO","time":1490897450,"resto":118938956,"id":"rzF9elw9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118947916,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:10:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why be such a cuck?

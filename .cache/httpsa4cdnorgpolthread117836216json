Time is running out \u2013 call your representative today and say NO to health care cuts. <br> <br><br>If your Representative is a Democrat, just reinforce to them to save the ACA, and improve it by voting YES on H.R. 676, the Expanded and Improved Medicare For All Act. If Republican, please call so they hear loud and clear that their constituents don\u2019t want this disastrous Republican health care bill. <br> <br><br>We want to make sure that our members of Congress know that the American Health Care Act is a tax cut bill that:<br> <br>- Ends healthcare subsidies in favor of tax breaks for wealthy families and will only make it harder for older Americans to afford coverage.<br><br>- Kills the Medicaid expansion, one of Obamacare\u2019s most popular and successful ways to expand healthcare coverage.<br><br>- Defunds Planned Parenthood, a critical provider of women\u2019s health care coverage.","filename":"BN-SL581_HEALTH_G_20170313133258","ext":".jpg","w":553,"h":369,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490220603229,"time":1490220603,"md5":"6FRE3rZpaE+HtvtWJtSD6w==","fsize":36886,"resto":0,"id":"evF\/H6rJ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"tomorrow-speaker-paul-ryan-will-push-for-a-vote","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

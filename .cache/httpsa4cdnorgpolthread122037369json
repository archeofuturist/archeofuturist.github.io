any land left for agriculture due to pollution caused by dirty chink factory practices, overpopulation, and just general chinaman greed, china has been attempting to nigger land away from russia to expand, theyve also been doing the same in africa.<br>That chinese factory explosion in 2011 was a nuke going off, watch the videos of it thats no normal &quot;factory&quot; explosion. This was most likely the tensions between russia and china heating up because around the time of this explosion the two countries were at each others throats, however, due to western media being western media among other reasons, these tensions have recieved little coverage if any.<br>In the long game it would be in russias best interests to fuck over those dirty chinaman chinks and north korea seeing as how NK is just an arm of the chinese regime.","time":1492723202,"resto":122037369,"id":"v7FvORNK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122046205,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)17:21:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122037774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122037774<\/a><br>You are best pony.","time":1492723287,"resto":122037369,"id":"WJtzAI7L","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":122046622,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)17:25:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122037774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122037774<\/a><br>wew lad","filename":"1329953891948","ext":".jpg","w":287,"h":360,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492723509833,"time":1492723509,"md5":"pqxt7kTdF71n9wVepCcJSw==","fsize":90138,"resto":122037369,"id":"7ua9MiLD","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122046682,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)17:25:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Russia is not going to do anything about NK.

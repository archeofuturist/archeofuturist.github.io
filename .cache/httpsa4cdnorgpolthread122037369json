any land left for agriculture due to pollution caused by dirty chink factory practices, overpopulation, and just general chinaman greed, china has been attempting to nigger land away from russia to expand, theyve also been doing the same in africa.<br>That chinese factory explosion in 2011 was a nuke going off, watch the videos of it thats no normal &quot;factory&quot; explosion. This was most likely the tensions between russia and china heating up because around the time of this explosion the two countries were at each others throats, however, due to western media being western media among other reasons, these tensions have recieved little coverage if any.<br>In the long game it would be in russias best interests to fuck over those dirty chinaman chinks and north korea seeing as how NK is just an arm of the chinese regime.","time":1492723202,"resto":122037369,"id":"v7FvORNK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122046205,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)17:21:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122037774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122037774<\/a><br>You are best pony.","time":1492723287,"resto":122037369,"id":"WJtzAI7L","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":122046622,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)17:25:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122037774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122037774<\/a><br>wew lad","filename":"1329953891948","ext":".jpg","w":287,"h":360,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492723509833,"time":1492723509,"md5":"pqxt7kTdF71n9wVepCcJSw==","fsize":90138,"resto":122037369,"id":"7ua9MiLD","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122046682,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)17:25:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Russia is not going to do anything about NK. IF Russia does anything, it should at very least be supported by majority of population. Otherwise this will greatly damage Putin&#039;s rating. <br><br>North Korea is a dictatorship that relies heavily on censorship. There is no goverment policy on NK and no censorship, people have a pretty good picture of what NK is. So, the idea of intervention to NK to protect it will not have even the slightest support among general population, meaning it will never ever happen.<br><br>On a side note, today Russia banned a UNSC resolution on NK, demanding it should include a call to &quot;diplomatic resolution&quot; of the conflict. Even though it was supported by China. I see no reason why we vetoed it. The only logical explanation is that China was really against it, but asked Russia to veto it in order to avoid damaging its reputation. It really makes no fucking sense otherwise.

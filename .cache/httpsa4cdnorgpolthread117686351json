The schools and libs are constantly teaching kids this bullshit that transgenderism is okay and that we should let people transition is complete bullshit. Studies such as http:\/\/journals.plos.org\/plosone\/ar<wbr>ticle?id=10.1371\/journal.pone.00168<wbr>85 have shown that letting people transition is NOT the answer. Why does the left keep pushing an ideology that we should let this minority do this to themselves?","filename":"IMG_0223","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490138604510,"time":1490138604,"md5":"Ox5Ld4NuDYC2t4OPV59uSQ==","fsize":39275,"resto":0,"id":"iWcnorZh","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"normalizing-transgenderism","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":117687132,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:30:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117686351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117686351<\/a><br>Traps are gay.","time":1490139009,"resto":117686351,"id":"clLpG7jW","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

The image everyone around here is losing their shit over is a composite image. It&#039;s not a single image of the sky. It&#039;s made by taking multiple images of the sky over a period of time and stitching them together. This alone can (and does) create artifacts on such images. This is why Saturn is duplicated on the image. The funky line bit &quot;below&quot; it, is an artifact of the telescope. Saturn is a very bright object in the sky (it&#039;s fucking huge (compared to say, Earth) and very very close (cosmologically speaking)). This telescope was meant to focus on deep space. Things that are extremely near and bright will tend to look distorted. It&#039;s also meant to look at &quot;fixed sources&quot;, meaning things that are so distant as to appear relatively motionless to us. Saturn is far from fixed. Add it all together and you get artifacts.<br><br>This field is right near the Ecliptic so it was probably always going to be a solar system object. If you look up the IRAS object catalogs you find these sources were saturated which means it was probably a Planet. I did a search on IPAC\/IRSA&#039;s IRAS minor planet catalog. These objects were not included because they&#039;re saturated (and are not minor planets) but from that I found other entries in the same field which tells you the date this field was observed 14\/07\/83 at about noon in UT time. From this I can simply look up to coordinates of all the planets that day and Saturn was slap bang there. The double object is because the field was exposed twice and stacked as the source catalog shows. The arc will just be an effect of the extremely bright object, in the other bands you can see the objects have big streaks. None of this appears in newer AKARI maps at similar wavelengths but the background (real) structures do. The saturation is probably why the tile wasn&#039;t included in the reprocessed edition with the missing fields.<br><br>It&#039;s Saturn, not aliens, jesus or the end of the world.","filename":"1490233348465","ext":".png","w":1902,"h":895,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":58,"tim":1490408786185,"time":1490408786,"md5":"fbE2ncKXr22nImYP0WjYPQ==","fsize":259050,"resto":118170199,"id":"tfbwzZqd","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118172660,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:27:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118172346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118172346<\/a><br>and in those years they didnt manage to take a picture of the area when saturn wasnt there? seems legit. also always fucking saturn","filename":"Hidsa compact","ext":".jpg","w":4049,"h":5558,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490408843464,"time":1490408843,"md5":"TKNtHTdjE\/KT7qxDGezARg==","fsize":3825348,"resto":118170199,"id":"2k0jMlTb","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118172958,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:30:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"check this thread out. good discussion here on another board I post on frequently.<br><br>http:\/\/csnbbs.com\/showthread.php?ti<wbr>d=726745","filename":"1490126119880","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490409001036,"time":1490409001,"md5":"ujMGQvT0T2cSPERDsrNabQ==","fsize":286590,"resto":118170199,"id":"rLO34\/z8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118173107,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:31:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Also, it&#039;s year 5777 on the hebrew calendar, they expect super happenings","time":1490409080,"resto":118170199,"id":"BEJ1Py2Z","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":118173251,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:32:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118172550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118172550<\/a><br>I&#039;ve seen Saturn before, this don&#039;t look like Saturn","filename":"download","ext":".jpg","w":185,"h":144,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":97,"tim":1490409154066,"time":1490409154,"md5":"R4j2i\/wwACrNSvSymVU1IQ==","fsize":2963,"resto":118170199,"id":"4jYOqek5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118173442,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:34:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118172550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118172550<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I believe NASA<\/span>","filename":"meme","ext":".png","w":516,"h":526,"tn_w":122,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490409251135,"time":1490409251,"md5":"Af1VMG12xDzN93srdCPd\/A==","fsize":230213,"resto":118170199,"id":"0yt\/LliH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118173481,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:34:27","name":"CheckmateAtheists","com":"How far off is the Jewish calendar?

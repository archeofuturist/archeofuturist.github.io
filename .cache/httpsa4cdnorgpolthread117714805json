I almost bashed a Jewish girl&#039;s face in with a beer mug because she kept getting in my face about white privilege. It seems like every day I&#039;m listening to a black, jew, or communist professor tell me about white privilege while I watch all these people obviously not struggling at all to get money, scholarships, job placement, et cetera. Nothing is getting better for poor whites here. People in business I&#039;ve talked to are so cucked that they will give a job to the &#039;struggling&#039; minority with inadequate credentials. A nigger punched my friend in the face for being white. A group of niggers beat my friend with a baseball bat for not being black. It&#039;s fine you want to leave this country for whiter snow, it hasn&#039;t been great since 1965.","filename":"Mkats","ext":".png","w":4179,"h":6889,"tn_w":75,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490163919712,"time":1490163919,"md5":"ld6OfrUR+G3nOPFjsWOBEg==","fsize":2403098,"resto":117714805,"id":"dOG76lyT","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

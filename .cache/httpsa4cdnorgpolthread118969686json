I peeled it off of course and threw it into the bin. Now my university is super left-wing so I expected antifa shitlords attending but I feel that even though most of the faculty and administration and student body are democrats, antifa is an organization of violence and violence has no place in a public place of learning. I sort of want to write the President of the University asking that antifa paraphernalia shouldn&#039;t be allowed as it promotes violence (in the same way they don&#039;t want nazi paraphernalia) however I&#039;m not sure I want to be ousted as not belonging to their groupthink. What are your thoughts?","filename":"st%2Csmall%2C215x235-pad%2C210x230%2Cf8f8f8.lite-1","ext":".jpg","w":210,"h":230,"tn_w":210,"tn_h":230,"tim":1490908457481,"time":1490908457,"md5":"YgPSyDG2TCJY8smCBcZZsw==","fsize":10149,"resto":0,"id":"56ZTDCrO","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dear-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

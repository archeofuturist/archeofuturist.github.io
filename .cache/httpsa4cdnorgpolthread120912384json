Hessian government asked their citizens to sign monetary bonds and pledge money to young males so that they can get their families to Germany also. Hessian CDU government said pledges would be nulled when the refugee status changes.<br><br>However, the federal SPD authority sees this differently. Because of this, the original signers of those bonds are now stuck with tens of thousands of Euros debt, as they are billed for the full living costs, welfare, rent, medical etc. for those Syrian families. And they will continue to be billed until those refugees find a job an no longer require welfare.<br><br>Some German signers are trying to go to court, but they pretty much signed away their own livelyhood.","filename":"refugees main","ext":".jpg","w":1025,"h":657,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":160,"tim":1492091998202,"time":1492091998,"md5":"ioy7dAQwNXCmEG+xD8MtAQ==","fsize":567110,"resto":0,"id":"Iqe68HG+","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sjws-in-germany-btfo-by-government","country_name":"Germany","replies":41,"images":4,"unique_ips":25},{"no":120912574,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:01:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120912384\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120912384<\/a><br>niiice now other germans have to pay for germans who have to pay for fugees","time":1492092106,"resto":120912384,"id":"3QYRNqT5","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120912595,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:02:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120912384\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120912384<\/a><br>The article also says some of them might even go broke and might have to file for personal bankruptcy eventually.","time":1492092127,"resto":120912384,"id":"Iqe68HG+","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120912596,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:02:09","name":"GoogleBot","com":"FactCheck by PolitiFact: Mostly False","time":1492092129,"resto":120912384,"id":"IUXAddFV","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":120912661,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:02:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;holocaust 2: electric boogaloo<\/span>","time":1492092166,"resto":120912384,"id":"MHj6TYCR","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120912807,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:04:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120912596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120912596<\/a><br>Nope.

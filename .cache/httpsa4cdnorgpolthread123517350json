Shitting my self (I&#039;m tanned and fairly short).<br><br>Talking to him, figure out he is my age, really intelligent, red pilled, super friendly, a bit insecure. He is a writer and he is writing for websites and newspapers as an contributor. <br>Really interesting guy, thinking he has lots of potential.<br><br>Next day i walk in Dublin, see him on the side of the street with his hat out, crouched in a fatal position, heads down.<br>Walk a few steps past by him, force my self to stop and turn around. Talk to him. He comes clean, he is homeless for 2 years, mortified and ashamed to be seen. Telling me he was super happy to talk like a normal person the first time. <br>Super aware of shit, open to questions and criticism.<br><br>I ask him: If I bought you a ticket out of here, would you be crazy enough to do it? He nearly cries.<br><br>Getting him into a H&amp;M and the security guy is instantly following him, got him new pants, socks, undies, jumper, shoes, t-shirts, shirt. He is dumping his old rotten grey cotton tracksuit. Looks like a new man spend over 100bucks on all. But he needs to look decent for his new start.<br>Buy him a Bus ticket to Rosslare for 20 quit and a Ferry ticket to France for 90eur. Generous guy at hostel gives him a free night in a hostel.","filename":"polferry","ext":".png","w":2976,"h":2586,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":217,"tim":1493581952191,"time":1493581952,"md5":"EvRXmJAOo1ohW9kH5u+gxQ==","fsize":566684,"resto":0,"id":"KVFFZyO5","country":"CH","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"irepol-help-an-irpolack","country_name":"Switzerland","replies":26,"images":6,"unique_ips":14},{"no":123517413,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)15:52:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Next day I call the hostel, he checked out, call ferry Terminal the guy is not there, then the news: they won&#039;t let him on the ferry to France, he has no passport. The cunts won&#039;t let him on. Looks like he is stranded. Luckly he gets a ticket to the UK.<br>Spend somewhat over 200 bucks to hopefully change a mans life.<br>He cried and he is incredibly happy to get the chance of his lifetime. He seemed scared and I&#039;m sure anyone would after living homeless in Dublin for 2 years, its really really rough there. <br><br>My hope is that his survival instinct is kicking in and that this will save his life.<br><br>Im telling you guys he has a great mind, huge potential, no fucking idea how he got where he is but he needs abit of help to start a new life.<br>He grabbed this with both hands and he ran with it. He was crazy enough to go with it and he really wants to make it out of this dark hole. Most people won&#039;t even have the energy, organisation and strength to make it. He doesn&#039;t sleep at night because its scary as a homeless and he sleeps at day, he is constantly sleep deprived, cold and under nourished. WTF.<br>So he is right now on his way to the UK, Holyhead I assume. The goal would be to get his as far as possible from his old life and to help him have a new start. From Holyhead he can sail to France, Denmark, Holland, Germany?<br><br>Pol, how can we help him to France from the UK? How can we sort him out with a job? Some kind of accommodation? Maybe set him a Patreon up and give him bit by bit help? I really want this man to succeed. What next? Financially this is all I can do for him atm, but he is not out of the waters yet. Also he would need some help with organisation and a masterplan. Could someone meet the guy in Britain? Perhaps sort him out with a couch to sleep?<br><br>Im wrecked from so much flying today I will crash sleeping soon.","time":1493581979,"resto":123517350,"id":"KVFFZyO5","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":123517786,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)15:55:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123517413\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123517413<\/a><br>You&#039;re trying to make yourself a boyfriend, you Swiss pervert?","time":1493582155,"resto":123517350,"id":"jbp54W\/T","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123518000,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)15:57:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123517786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123517786<\/a><br>srsly get your lame ass outta here bro","time":1493582258,"resto":123517350,"id":"KVFFZyO5","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":123518420,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)16:01:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123518000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123518000<\/a><br>Homeless people are usually homeless for more reasons than just simply not having a house.

It&#039;s surprisingly easy to end up on the street or holed up in some (maybe) abandoned camper you came upon in the woods, and it&#039;s surprisingly difficult to dig yourself out of the hole once you&#039;re there. In the same way that a string of bad luck put me out, it was purely a string of good luck that got me back on my feet. I wasn&#039;t homeless for super long, maybe 6 or 8 months or so, but it was literally just the kindness of a stranger that helped me get my shit together. He put me up in a hotel for a few days and bought me an outfit or two. I had decent clothes, but when you&#039;re sleeping outside or somewhere gross, some shit just doesn&#039;t come out. I ended up getting a job at the hotel he put me up in. It was one of those really nice places, too. Pic related is one of the corridors. But I digress. Point being, maybe the guy had problems, maybe he didn&#039;t.

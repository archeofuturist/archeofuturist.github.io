What is your opinion on the politics of man made climate change? A politization of science will (imo) in time be detrimental for the image of science in society; see for example gender studies sjw&#039;s. Also, there is a risk that research is (mis-)used to further agenda&#039;s, or that research is disregarded due to some political association.<br><br>2. Sounds like a basic question, but how is (world) temperature exactly measured? As someone with a background in statistics (but very little to no knowledge of climate models), I&#039;m worried about endogeneity being a problem. Also, changing methodologies in different time periods, may reduce the accuracy of used models. One might be able to argue that there is substantial model risk associated with the models used.<br><br>3. This is more of a philosophical question, but one I find quite interesting in this context. What would need to happen to let people reconsider the current models? The current proposition that man has a substantial effect can be seen as a hypothesis, and it should be possible to falsify it with new data. One of the obvious answers to this question would be that the earth would become substantially cooler in the coming decades, despite emission of CO2 staying at current levels. In my view, there is a discrepancy between the extraordinarity of the claim and its falsifiability.","time":1493648917,"resto":123602219,"id":"tqyTRK1P","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123626471,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:28:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123624760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123624760<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;humans evolve<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;humans decide to dump all that CO2 back into the atmosphere<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;humans stop evolving<\/span>","time":1493648924,"resto":123602219,"id":"sy9E9pTQ","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":123626536,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:29:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123626471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123626471<\/a><br>that&#039;s called extinction","time":1493648966,"resto":123602219,"id":"6326Dn2g","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":123626548,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:29:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123625752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123625752<\/a><br>look up Snowball earth (hint: weren&#039;t it for the fact that CO2 is a greenhouse gas, the world would probably still be frozen over)<br><br>Just to be sure, I don&#039;t want to waste my own or your time, are you asking what outcomes there will be due to climate change?","time":1493648972,"resto":123602219,"id":"ZRgHmPfq","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123626569,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:29:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123602219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123602219<\/a><br>Anybody who uses &#039;debate me&#039;, i.e. &#039;debate&#039; without it being followed by a preposition, should be sterilised.

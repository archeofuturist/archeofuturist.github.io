We all know why. Two paths lie before us. One is more outrages, destruction and death, stoked by regional and intl divisions, or even escalation and deeper confrontation. That is what all Syrians feel and I share their feels. But there is another discussion, a rallying for ceasefire. We need a consensus among major stakeholders to support completely the UN led peace process, as per 2254. We have made modest and incremental progress. 5th round saw no breakthroughs, but no breakdowns either. Parties engaged in substance for 9 days. Discussions were business like and on final day they told me, all of them, they are ready to return to Geneva for 6th meeting. Governance issues, constitutional issues, election and counter-terrorism were topics, with goal of political transition while preserving sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Syria. Delegations prefer to focus on different issues, gaps are still wide, but everybody engaged. Discussed principles of character of a post-transition state. One day all of these discussions must come together for a package negotiation. I felt growing appreciation for basis of transition must be legally and constitutionally solid, well-mapped and agreed upon. Syrians must participate in this. But now, this fragile progress is in grave danger. Talks were overshadowed by intensification of fight. Hard to reach areas, displacement, Thousands fighter evacuated to Idlib, etc. Political statements issued after geneva talks are concerning. GOvt intention to reconquer all syrian territory withou negotiations. Some opposition supports more battles with intl backing. We witnessed horrors of chemical weapons on innocent syrian victims.<\/span>","time":1492023650,"resto":120792007,"id":"ULa6Pm\/y","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":120792103,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)15:01:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120792058\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120792058<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;People realized that syrian calamity is an affront to shared values and affect life of any citizens.

UN is ready for starting point of discussion and negotiation among syrians. Tillerson is in Moscow, we welcome this engagement. These countries have serious differences and common interests. Must find a way to work together to stabilize situation in support of political process. We need to unite behind one process of peace. Guarantors are being but to severe test. They will meet in Tehran then Astana, in early may. We urge them to work to renew ceasefire, along with effort to continue fighting terrorism. UN will be in Tehran and Astana to provide support if we can. We said this so many times, i will say it again, there can only be political solution, no military solution.

They have suffered from ever increasing and escalating barbarity. This council has been held to ransom by Russias shameless support to Assads regime. Assad has failed every time, plunging to new lows. CW experts from UK have analyzed samples of apr4 attack and it is SARIN or sarin-like. Regime is responsible for Sarin attack. Assad agreed to destroy CW but this is latest that he is not committed to ceasefire or Astana process, ruining RU credibility. 13 and half million people are in need of humanitarian assistance. There can be no place for Assad in Syria`s future. There is a way to end this suffering. 2254 charts way to peace in syria. We have Stefano to keep pol process alive and pursue UN led effort. We have oppo who want pol transition. And we have syrians who want peace. Yet we are here in this chamber, with regime that has no interest in peace, who keeps dropping bombs and using CW. Russia defends this and what has that got them? RU decision to dismantle CW has been exposed as a shamble. Credibility has gone. They have chosen to side with murderous and barbaric criminal. They have chosen wrong side of history. It is not to late for RU to change course and to use influence over regime. These efforts must be used to stop CW and barrel bombs. Russia can create space needed for renewed political process strength. We stand ways to find ways to cooperate with Russia against terrorists. Assad offers RU only shame and humiliation.

Regional and intl race will only lead to more deaths. Not to interfere one of the parties in syrian conflict means that this crisis will have no victor. This is war waged by proxy. I call on intl actors, RU and USA to work to reach agreement on political area. Cooperation should be main instrument. Those that tryt to use vacuum of this polarization should GTFO and come in for talks without preconditions and for pol transition, set aside narrow interests and that loser are them and syrian people. Syrian people and interests of these parties will not be achieved by support for whoever their sponsors from abroad are. Syria has made significant contribution to culture. Due to seriousness of situation, and incapacity of this council to agree on CW attack, we must move forward and investigate in neutral fashion.<\/span>","time":1492023739,"resto":120792007,"id":"ULa6Pm\/y","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":120792280,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)15:02:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"France <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120752355#p120762533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120762533<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1wk since regime attacked using CW weapons. Hundreds injured, 86 died. Symptons point to use of nerve agent, probably Sarin based mix. US decision to strike airbase is testimony to gravity of threat, sent mssg that regime would have known already. France proposed draft resolution which is simple and balanced text that condemns attack, reaffirms UN support, and seeks verification of act. What is at stake is bring council around at key objective with is to stop CW. Beyond CW tragedy, all of Syria is landscape of devastation, cessation of hostilities by Astana process no longer exists. Regime never respected ceasefire. Regime is tightening by refusing humanitarian convoys. This is deliberate policy of prevarication, causing people to flee, in contravention of UNSC resolutions and HR law. Guarantoors of syria are responsible for all this. RU must walk its talk. Respect the Astana ceasefire and allow humanitarian assistance. We need more inclusive observation mechanism, since swept last year Fra called for this. Some may deny evidence, we cannot continue as Apr4 attack did not take place. We cannot pretend this chaos and devastation is not Assads fault. Pol solution is more urgent than ever. As long as this regime is in power bc of complicity of those propping it up, there will never be peace in Sryia. Refugges have no hope of returning home and we will never have oppo to tackle terrorists. Pressure to bear on stakeholders so they can engage in good faith in negotiations. In conclusion, recent developments have mode lines and shown that urgency of need of pol transition, creating conditions for re-engagement of all leading players.<\/span>","time":1492023761,"resto":120792007,"id":"ULa6Pm\/y","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":120792340,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)15:03:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Uruguay <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120752355#p120763049\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120763049<\/a><br>Full trust in Stefano de Mistura and sec gen.

Peace talks held 5th round in Geneva blablabla. Fervent support of Mistura. Kazak process is complimentary as well. Other areas of convergence, is that pol process is only way to solve crisis. Involved parties must ensure blablabla process dialogue. Peace talks, etc. We believe any type of unilateral action undermines dialogue process and block way towards peace in Syria, at expense of lives in Syria.

On nite of Apr 2003, i was sitting on place of italian ambassador. Colin Powell spoke. He talked about WMDs in Iraq. Everyone remember what heads of investigative delegations said. Battler, Scott, Hans Blix, and others. They said there were NO wmds in Iraq, and that this was a pretext to invade Iraq. All of you remember that this council decided at end of 2008, after investigation, decided to busy UNSCOM reports. To overlook these reports, and bury in ground, so none can reach, they buried them in vaults. And they said that these vaults will only be opened in 60 years. Can you imagine the secrets in these vaults? Brexit encouraged UK to seek new role in world, by using extreme actions, Reminds us of criminal Tony Blair, after fabricating lie of WMDs. Pushing the American Elephant to destroy the Iraqi Chinaware, with brutality that Iraq suffers to this day.

This include intl coalition action, which destroyed infrastructure, bombardment of syrian army in Dez 17th sept, ofering military cover to terrorist groups.

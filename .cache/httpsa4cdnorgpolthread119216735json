What a wonderful, if short, 12 hours it was to have a board collectively smart enough to ignore shill threads and let them die naturally. <br><br>Pic related is an example of the kind of thread that redditors JUST LOVE to reply to. Yesterday, as soon as the boards were re-split, the top threads were about motherfucking shoes, gays, diet, manlets and other stupid shit. Here are a few more examples that are FULL OF redditors:<br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119204704#p119204704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119204704<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119221123#p119221123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119221123<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119224384#p119224384\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119224384<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119221400#p119221400\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119221400<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119201030#p119201030\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119201030<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119218054#p119218054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119218054<\/a><br><br>There must be a cleansing.","filename":"reddit will reply to this","ext":".png","w":1108,"h":795,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":89,"tim":1491157328498,"time":1491157328,"md5":"AljnMqqjOXW2qM+c4VVP3Q==","fsize":448876,"resto":119216735,"id":"XmNQAGZ2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119227464,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)14:22:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119216735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119216735<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Constantly falling for retard-tier b8<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Constantly jumping at shadows<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Constantly bitching about non-existent shills<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Constantly concerned about purity<\/span><br><br>I dunno, they look pretty similar to me.","filename":"ManFightingBabies","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":1024,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491157340855,"time":1491157340,"md5":"sf88jPmD+6r0yqkBrCP5pw==","fsize":109922,"resto":119216735,"id":"VznqcgNU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119227539,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)14:23:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Making threads about reddit<\/span>","time":1491157382,"resto":119216735,"id":"9jCZ\/lxx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119227557,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)14:23:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119227300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119227300<\/a><br>i lnow burger, calm your tits<br>but there was no reddit influx back in the old chanology days","time":1491157393,"resto":119216735,"id":"IpPZScCg","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119227571,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)14:23:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119218252\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119218252<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;who the fuck cares about what ledditors are doing fuck sake<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;half the time \/pol\/ is full of slide threads and legitimate shills anyways<\/span><br>Because it&#039;s the redditors who are REPLYING TO those slide threads.

The prices for owning a piece of real estate in anywhere that isn&#039;t completely innawoods are not that cheap, plus you&#039;d need a car, health insurance, probably also pay for several technical appliances etc. and this all adds up. <br><br>Maybe if you live in a single big house with low taxes\/rent with couple of generations under one roof in Algeria there then yes, I can see how you can manage.

So I really think it&#039;s more of a life style issue than an economic one. Here in Algeria, most of us don&#039;t go after girls in university and spend money on alcohol and distractions. Also average marriage age is pretty late (early thirties), so if you finish your studies at 23, plus a year of mandatory military service, you&#039;d have to work 6 years to get in your thirties. And all that time, you&#039;d be living with your parents. All in all, you&#039;d have earned a nice fortune by that time.<br>Most of the people I know are making it this way, and they don&#039;t live like you described (that way of life is getting out of fashion nowadays).","time":1493661886,"resto":123646313,"id":"I1yJdV4D","country":"DZ","country_name":"Algeria"},{"no":123650256,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:06:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123646313\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123646313<\/a><br>What is she&#039;s a tenure track doctorial student at a libcuck University?

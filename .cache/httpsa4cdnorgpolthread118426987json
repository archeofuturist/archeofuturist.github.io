It&#039;s very good, he doesn&#039;t blame Germany, he actually is pretty unbiased or maybe a little favors the Germans.<br>Don&#039;t expect any of his other podcasts to be very good, and do not expect him to favor Hitler or the Nazis, actually I&#039;m convinced this guy is paid by Israelis or something because of some of the comments he&#039;s made (he references Hitler often but not so much in this ww1 podcast)<br>It&#039;s a 6 part series of like 4 hour episodes so if you can listen to it at work that&#039;s perfect<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/YFMT_BVBBsA<br><br>Basically the German empire was the greatest empire the world had ever seen and it took the entire world to defeat her and France was salty because all the fighting happened in France and it destroyed so much land, they never fought on German soil even when they started losing.","time":1490570196,"resto":118426987,"id":"hzBvzk8N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118434302,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)19:17:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118430541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118430541<\/a><br><br>I love my country sometimes","time":1490570262,"resto":118426987,"id":"fJUVJ7Ik","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118434357,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)19:18:06","name":"0%","com":"<a href=\"#p118429209\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118429209<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;us joins the winning side at the last second<\/span><br>Kek<br>Literally same shit they did in WW2, except is wasn&#039;t the last second it was as soon it became clear who is going to win I.e battle of Stalingrad and the offensive of Soviet forces","time":1490570286,"resto":118426987,"id":"h2DFxYum","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118434558,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)19:19:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118426987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118426987<\/a><br>Germany invading France through neutral Belgium (fucking it up along the way) as a preemptive measure to avoid possibly losing an advantage if they didn&#039;t mobilize fast enough in the case of the French happening to attack first was, all things considered, a dick move.

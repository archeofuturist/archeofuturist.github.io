If anyone says &#039;benzos are better than SSRIs&#039; then disregard them instantly. If you&#039;re severely depressed then even one dose of benzos can make you feel outright suicidal the moment it wears off, though it&#039;s an extremely comfy numbness\/lack of anxiety before then. More than one dose without time to work off the withdrawals makes the eventual crash even worse, and taking them for three days in a row will render any dose absolutely worthless and any withdrawals will be savage.<br><br>SSRIs are good and bad. If you&#039;re feeling suicidal, if you&#039;ve had a long-term depression that no amount of exercise or dietary control can fix, and if you&#039;re an adult, then try them. At that stage you have nothing to lose. But you MUST be aware of the intial 2-8 weeks where things will be a bit bipolar. One way you can tell if you genuinely need them is how quickly they start to have a consistently positive effect.<br><br>Lastly, be aware that like ANY other mood enhancer (including booze\/weed) it tricks you into satisfaction with the status quo and encourages laziness. You have to use the opportunity to get into good habits whilst on them. For me, I was finally able to sort out my sleep pattern after 30+ years. All other good results (better habits, less drinking\/smoking, improved diet\/exercise) came after I got off them. <br><br>Remember it is not a permanent solution. Try to stay on for maximum 12-18 months. NEVER stop taking them suddenly. Bad idea. Take at least three months to gently ween off of maximum recommended dosage, and it will still be bumpy, so expect it and do not rush it. <br><br>If you feel good then they&#039;re doing what&#039;s intended but use the opportunity to work on your bad habits\/anxieties\/causes of depression. It will not fix anything unless you put serious effort in, so use the opportunity because the clarity and mood improvement will not last forever.","time":1491735443,"resto":120261758,"id":"1QwAysly","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120270410,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)06:58:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120269896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120269896<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After they take them they are like a different person, like abnormally happy<\/span><br><br>this, they sound to start like a basic bitch airhead, all happy and shallow, hate those poeple","time":1491735488,"resto":120261758,"id":"Qt9A4YsS","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":120270475,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)06:58:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120269803\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120269803<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Would you say you became more resilient to negative thought loops?<\/span><br><br>Indeed, having experienced what&#039;s like without, I now know beyond any doubt how worthless and damaging it is, also the trick is it ain&#039;t bad with negative thoughts only, it&#039;s bad per s\u00e9, it&#039;s like a process spinning endlessly, depleting resources and eventually turning bad<br><br>but I&#039;m not sure this is a persisting chemical effect, it feels more like a lesson I learnt at a very deep level","time":1491735537,"resto":120261758,"id":"USOraCim","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120270526,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)06:59:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120270164\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120270164<\/a><br>I&#039;ve been kind of scared to strip it all out with something like apple or prune juice because of the dangerous withdrawal everybody talks about.

But with the introduction of soft socialist measures, the need for a mass revolution was removed, and any previous attempts at planned economics and communist societies had only ended in failure and death. So the humbled left turned to other places. And so was identity politics born.

And so it looks like madness or some sort of mental disease to any sane person, especially one who has been paying taxes for more than a few years.

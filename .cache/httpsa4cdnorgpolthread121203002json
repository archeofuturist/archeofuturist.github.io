Additionally it does incredible work towards scientific funding for large and invaluable projects, like the Human Brain Project, nuclear fusion (ITER), and space travel, among many others. Not only that but Europe is the most peaceful it&#039;s ever been, with no major wars in non-former Soviet bloc countries since the end of WWII.<br><br>I understand a lot of the bullshit the EU does pisses people off justifiably and is retarded, like its promotion of leftism\/liberalism constantly perhaps against the interest of native Europeans, attacking anything Right-Wing, giving Germany too much power, and many other things, but I still believe that the EU is a net benefit to Europe and its separate economies overall.

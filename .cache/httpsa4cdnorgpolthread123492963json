When I started they just told me: this is how you sit.. this is how you bow.. this is how you count your breath. There is an idea in Zen that is called &quot;direct pointing&quot;, you might want to research this yourself but it implies that while language and philosophical constructions should serve to show the truth they are not themselves the truth. If you read blue cliff records or mumonkan you can get an idea of what this means; there is always contradiction and paradox in language, in fact we cannot trust language.","time":1493571796,"resto":123492963,"id":"h3SCxDQY","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123498155,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)13:05:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123492963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123492963<\/a><br>fuck off hippie<br>hate all the westeners who apporpriate buddhism, confuse it with taoism and hinduism and practice yoga<br>you are worse than most other obnoxious religious groups","time":1493571904,"resto":123492963,"id":"zb3wQ3ZT","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123498563,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)13:08:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123498155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123498155<\/a><br>Read my summary in the last thread and listen to one of the lectures I linked to, and tell me if I&#039;m confusing anything with taoism or hinduism.

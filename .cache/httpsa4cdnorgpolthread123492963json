Morality is a required basis for concentration, but is not itself sufficient. It will only lead to favorable rebirths, which are emphatically not a good thing in the (Theravada) Buddhist view, and only put you in much higher danger of missing out on learning the dharma than you have in your current life.<br><br>Remember that my original response was to the question of how much Buddhism is in Christianity, and my point was that it&#039;s really mostly just the morality parts, which are shared not only by Christianity and Buddhism but by many other religions and philosophies.

The Paradise Creator Sons<br><br><br>21:0.1.THE Creator Sons are the makers and rulers of the local universes of time and space. These universe creators and sovereigns are of dual origin, embodying the characteristics of God the Father and God the Son. But each Creator Son is different from every other; each is unique in nature as well as in personality; each is the &quot;only-begotten Son&quot; of the perfect deity ideal of his origin.<br>21:0.2.In the vast work of organizing, evolving, and perfecting a local universe, these high Sons always enjoy the sustaining approval of the Universal Father. The relationship of the Creator Sons with their Paradise Father is touching and superlative. No doubt the profound affection of the Deity parents for their divine progeny is the wellspring of that beautiful and well-nigh divine love which even mortal parents bear their children.<br>21:0.3.These primary Paradise Sons are personalized as Michaels. As they go forth from Paradise to found their universes, they are known as Creator Michaels. When settled in supreme authority, they are called Master Michaels. Sometimes we refer to the sovereign of your universe of Nebadon as Christ Michael.

If I went up to you and smashed your computer, which is essentially your wife, then you would react vehemently despite the fact that you believe freewill is an illusion.<br><br>On a side note, it&#039;s hilarious that you believe you know what good and evil even is. God made it very clear in the story of Isaac that only he knows what is actually good and evil when he gave Abraham a choice that from the outside looks like he&#039;s giving Abraham a choice between two evils (Kill son or disobey God.) The correct choice according to God is to believe him, because he is all knowing and therefore knows what is right or wrong. We cannot know what is right or wrong but you pretend to believe that you do, despite the fact that you&#039;re arguing from authority (Your own reasoning) just like a Christian does when he argues from the Bible. The difference?

The apostles died without getting rich, getting a girlfriend or getting power, they all died horribly. There was no point in spreading Christianity if they didn&#039;t believe in it. Why would they risk their life if it wasn&#039;t true? Why would they risk their life if it was all forged? Why would Paul try to join this new small church?<br>Also the only accounts of Romans getting Christians to change their faith was after the 1st century.

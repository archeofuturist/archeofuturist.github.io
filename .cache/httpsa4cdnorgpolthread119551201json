Rape accusations are relatively meaningless outside of this explicit admission.<br><br>There&#039;s plenty of &quot;news&quot; that I ignore when it hasn&#039;t been confirmed, no matter the news outlet. You have to parse the information dump with care in the sense of discerning real facts only through what one can know from the incessant flow of &quot;information&quot;. The more I find myself having to do this, the more the news outlet seems like a peddler of propaganda. Again. Fox is the largest news outlet regarding this reaching a far larger audience. If you want to change people&#039;s perceptions, you need to pursue engaging the most indoctrinated audiences; and that isn&#039;t the audiences of CNN or MSNBC. It&#039;s Fox news and they&#039;re already doing real damage to the country.","filename":"Sean Spicer note during press conference after being asked about trump obama accusation 2","ext":".jpg","w":1871,"h":919,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":61,"tim":1491364078527,"time":1491364078,"md5":"0o9mKR3wY4KTFuTDQ5\/HtA==","fsize":268299,"resto":119551201,"id":"vekkTnjR","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119562692,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:48:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119551201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119551201<\/a><br>There also is no evidence of collusion with Russia but they still report on that fucking shit all fucking day.","time":1491364101,"resto":119551201,"id":"CUMicp55","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119562841,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:49:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119558566\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119558566<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Zo<wbr>j18a65UlE<\/span><br>not the first!<br><br>CNN IS FAKE NEWS<br><br>Cnn lies about milwaukee riots https:\/\/youtu.be\/udU01_SfjDs<br><br>Illegal to read wikileaks lie https:\/\/youtu.be\/7DcATG9Qy_A<br>Cuts feed once wikileaks is brought up &quot;Oh nooo&quot; https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_fi<wbr>A7HeZz6I<br><br>More lies about clinton from Anderson Cooper https:\/\/youtu.be\/MkfTciQ_pS0<br><br>Or when they equated blacks as felons in an attempt to slam trump http:\/\/dailycaller.com\/wp-content\/u<wbr>ploads\/2016\/08\/Screen-Shot-2016-08-<wbr>23-at-7.59.50-PM-620x208.png<br><br>This is just in the past year.<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/rrdFD-SdpiM<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/AdCk6gJqmoc<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZgAKkmlN9tQ<br><br>and its nothing new they have been doing this for decades.<br><br>1990 persian gulf war https:\/\/youtu.be\/98JDKB-Qmxs","time":1491364190,"resto":119551201,"id":"TFYY4a5P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119563118,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:52:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119561979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119561979<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I say the counter to lies is the truth.<\/span><br>That would be taking journalism into uncharted territory.

But, there is a way for us to win and that way is to &quot;become&quot; leftists. After we &quot;become&quot; leftists we then try to infiltrate their political parties, and most importantly the media and entertainment industry. The reason why the media and entertainment industry are more important targets than the political parties is because the impressionable youth obviously watches tv and listens to music with leftist messages. Since the children are the future of mankind, we need to subtly change the leftist messages in children&#039;s television and all music into conservative messages. If we do this, then our youth will will tend to lean to the right and the youth will grow up into good upstanding citizens instead of turning into sluts, drug dealers, and whores like they do today on account of the leftist media. If you have any other ideas on how to win the culture war please contribute. Our world&#039;s future is at stake!","filename":"runingwesterncivilization","ext":".jpg","w":215,"h":235,"tn_w":215,"tn_h":235,"tim":1493177163524,"time":1493177163,"md5":"x5GeQElP0hTmadQTQbhtMg==","fsize":11738,"resto":0,"id":"ERWcDTAk","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-to-win-the-culture-war","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

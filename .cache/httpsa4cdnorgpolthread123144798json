I always hear about how it&#039;s the one thing you must be in, accel at a degree, and pursue something for a bigger paycheck than what you normally would. What people don&#039;t talk about is how it in some ways is pointless and gives you debt at the beginning of your adult life with the unimaginable student loans. <br><br>The entire thing reeks of a Marxist educational system, what are your thoughts?","filename":"563836592749372","ext":".jpg","w":1511,"h":553,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":91,"tim":1493352776814,"time":1493352776,"md5":"fNi5jqW2kAAOHqkb3tC40A==","fsize":203386,"resto":0,"id":"\/lCoO37o","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-pol-quick-question","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":1,"unique_ips":10},{"no":123145238,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:16:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123144798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123144798<\/a><br>That depends on what you want to do. College is required for something like a chemical engineer. If it is hard STEM, go for it. If it is not, you likely don&#039;t need college. In any case go to your local community college to start with.

There are skilled jobs out there at least in australia that can net you 100-200 thousand a year without any university, working in mines or on oil rigs etc. There are tradesmen who worked their way up into owning huge companies, for example someone like a builder. And there are kids out there who have degrees, massive debt, and don&#039;t have the skills required to get any of these good jobs. They&#039;re lining up to work for minimum while others are paying off their second house and looking at buying a yacht, or building their company.<br><br>Don&#039;t go unless you&#039;re mature enough to know what you want to do with your life imo.

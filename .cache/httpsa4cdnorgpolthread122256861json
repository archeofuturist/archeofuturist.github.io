Or well.. to be precise they are only obligated to reveal the shareholders that own more than 5% of it, but that still doesn&#039;t eliminate the possibility of it being owned by less than 94\/5 (94% referring to the part of the bank that is privately owned, the remaining 6% belonging to Greece) separate entities, considering whatever entities there are that individually control less than 5% each could very well all then belong or be controlled by a greater entity.<br><br>Also, from what I&#039;ve been able to find, most national central banks, with some exceptions of course, are claimed to be publicly owned. But then where does the idea that there are only three national central banks in the entire world that are not controlled by the Rothschilds come from? Can control over national central banks be exercised through means different than directly owning the bank? I am already aware of the influence that the economic elite can exert on let&#039;s say... Congress, or other equivalent &quot;bodies&quot; that other countries have.","filename":"Ilovekikes","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1066,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492851763296,"time":1492851763,"md5":"fNlaedR8quWO6xXRb\/z0Yw==","fsize":472652,"resto":0,"id":"oA3dAQcM","country":"GR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"central-banks","country_name":"Greece","replies":14,"images":3,"unique_ips":10},{"no":122257321,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:10:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122256861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122256861<\/a><br>Bump...?","time":1492852212,"resto":122256861,"id":"oA3dAQcM","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":122257391,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:11:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"Can you write to your local parliament member?","time":1492852268,"resto":122256861,"id":"UHaBU8Pb","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122257505,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:12:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"the fact that we as a society accept that national banks have private shareholders speaks volumes<br>just like the &quot;federal&quot; american reserve<br>we are beyond saving","time":1492852375,"resto":122256861,"id":"gzMfHL9+","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122257597,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:14:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122256861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122256861<\/a><br>Look into Target-2. <br><br>The only thing you need to know about the ECB.<br><br>Then google the Panic of 1837 and the monetary system used back then in the US. <br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Panic<wbr>_of_1837<br><br>Lastly, check out Bretton woods and the Nixon shock.<br><br>Put it all together and if you are smart, you know why I am a libertarian.<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=spP<wbr>FHBNWocM","filename":"TARGET2_balances","ext":".png","w":793,"h":514,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1492852484305,"time":1492852484,"md5":"TRrDbXH5R6WnwTm7NFRbPA==","fsize":57858,"resto":122256861,"id":"aRc+f5l\/","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122257607,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:14:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122256861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122256861<\/a><br>American central bank is owned by american commercial banks and European central banks are owned by national states and EU.","filename":"1492205772184","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":800,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492852490075,"time":1492852490,"md5":"b35nFogzppuVKQuDd7BFtQ==","fsize":78958,"resto":122256861,"id":"KJnBXnm9","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122257706,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:16:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122256861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122256861<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UrJ<wbr>GlXEs8nI","time":1492852599,"resto":122256861,"id":"0Kv+T9lE","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122257774,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:17:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122256861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122256861<\/a><br>Jews own them<br><br>Source: 6 hour documentary with 400 views","time":1492852665,"resto":122256861,"id":"G1gbPL3K","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122257870,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:19:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122257774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122257774<\/a><br>\/pol\/ in a nutshell.","time":1492852770,"resto":122256861,"id":"KJnBXnm9","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122257943,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)05:20:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122257391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122257391<\/a><br>About what?

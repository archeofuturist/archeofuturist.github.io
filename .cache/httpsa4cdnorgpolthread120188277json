Nobody cares about Syria or Assad. \/sg\/ never inspired people to go out and vote, march or do anything politics-related. It has always been a small autistic circlejerk where everybody knew each other because they were the only ones who posted there.<br><br>Trump on the other hand has influenced an entire movement, both in the US and around the world. Trump memes are the freshest and dankest and there have been far more supporters of Trump than there were of Assad at any given time. You have people from around the world wearing MAGA caps. Trump&#039;s popularity meme&#039;d a fucking cartoon frog into an international hate symbol. Trump-era memes that originated on this board are spewed by major politicians and spokepersons. We have countries around the world that want to make x great again.<br><br>Meanwhile \/sg\/ has just remained a rabid fanboy thread in the entirety of its existence. Worthless memes that they produce that never leave their general threads. The fact why the board is even talking about Syria right now is because Trump bombed it.<br><br>Even \/sg\/&#039;s most famous slogan, CAN&#039;T MOSSAD THE ASSAD, is a rehash ripoff of the original CAN&#039;T STUMP TRUMP.<br><br>Anyone who claims \/pol\/ was always pro-Assad is guaranteed to spend 99% of their time on \/pol\/ in the Syria General thread. That is a basic fact.","filename":"1489384573979","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491688284311,"time":1491688284,"md5":"dIcohb+eSCdGUlEdEzZVoA==","fsize":13111,"resto":0,"id":"ditjRESI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-has-always-been-proassad","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":4,"unique_ips":11},{"no":120188765,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:55:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"you&#039;ve wrote 40 lines of bullshit but i&#039;m not seeing any argument or reasoning on why trump attacked Assad, the last secular leader in the middle east<br><br>and no matter how hard you keep shilling, the truth will stay that trump is Bush\/Obama 2.0<br><br>sage","time":1491688513,"resto":120188277,"id":"UPcAoB\/D","country":"TN","country_name":"Tunisia"},{"no":120189353,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:59:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120188765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120188765<\/a><br>I thought secularity was a bad thing that was killing European nations?<br><br>I can sum up the entirety of Assadists in one hashtag<br><br>#NotAllMuslims","time":1491688795,"resto":120188277,"id":"ditjRESI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120189665,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:02:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120189353\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120189353<\/a><br>Secularity is bad in your opinion? well then, enjoy another 9\/11, you reap what you sow.","time":1491688934,"resto":120188277,"id":"UPcAoB\/D","country":"TN","country_name":"Tunisia"},{"no":120191098,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:13:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120188277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120188277<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;writes a massive wall of text trying to claim \/pol\/ is anti assad because Trump did a thing.<\/span><br><br>Shill or autist, You be the judge.<br><br><a href=\"#p120188765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120188765<\/a><br>Trumps attack on assad and all the shit he&#039;s talking is strictly to get neocons\/kikes off his ass.

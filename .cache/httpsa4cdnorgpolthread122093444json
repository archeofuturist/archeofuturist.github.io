Air Traffic Control (ATC) will put aircraft in a holding pattern until there is room (for adequate aircraft separation) on the airway or airport approach to add the aircraft to the sequence traveling the airway or approach. Most hold patterns are right hand turns, suggesting the airplane icon at the bottom left is pointed in the wrong direction. The navigational fix defining the hold pattern is at one end of the northeast straight side. An IFR chart will show the navigational fix and airway that define the pattern, and a symbol showing the location of the holding pattern. The straight sides are one minute of flying, and the semicircles are a one minute (standard rate turn) 180 degree turn. I took IFR ground school a long time ago, never took the written test or got the rating.","time":1492749755,"resto":122093444,"id":"ZEz3eAdu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122097142,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)00:43:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122096969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122096969<\/a><br>how else do the propulsions happen<br><br>I took physics in high school<br><br>v^2 = voriginal^2+2a(x-xoriginal)","time":1492749800,"resto":122093444,"id":"A5z9\/Yf6","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122097206,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)00:43:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122095049\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122095049<\/a><br>I don&#039;t think a serviceman would break OPSEC like that.

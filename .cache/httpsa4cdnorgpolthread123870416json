We had to work on the assumption that the least intelligent people alive had to use them accurately so we texted with low IQ users and when in a task analysis with fake money, they all managed to work it.<br><br>I guess we left out how stupid niggers could be because when released, they came up short just as much as before. <br><br>So we went to the store and installed monitoring stuff and caught employees trying to steal. Draw opens, they take 2 bills out and think they are being slick sliding one into a pocket.<br><br>Surprise, it&#039;s not free money! You have to pay it back. No amount of engineering can stop someone from stealing and niggers are so fucking stupid they do it even when they know they have to pay it back and are being monitored. It&#039;s like they don&#039;t understand what a camera is and act like it&#039;s bullshit if the evil white man math magic gets used to catch them. <br><br>There is even security video of nigger cashiers calling their friends after the lunch rush to rob the place. They are less evolved people, end of story. They are the missing link and don&#039;t have our cognitive abilities.<br><br>Working on this was a rather redpilling experience.","time":1493792459,"resto":123870416,"id":"fz7Uxker","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123881642,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)02:22:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123870416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123870416<\/a><br>So did I when I worked retail and I&#039;m white.

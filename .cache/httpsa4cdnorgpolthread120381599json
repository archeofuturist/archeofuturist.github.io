Gorsuch joins the Supreme Court just in time to cast potentially significant votes in cases that pit religious liberty against gay rights, test limits on funding for church schools and challenge California\u2019s restrictions on carrying a concealed gun in public. Such issues arise either in appeals filed by conservative groups that have been pending before the justices for weeks or in cases to be heard later this month.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gorsuch\u2019s votes in those matters may give an early sign of whether the court\u2019s conservatives \u2014 with their 5-4 majority restored by his confirmation \u2014 will pursue an activist agenda. The cases include a Colorado baker\u2019s claim that he deserves a faith-based exemption from the state\u2019s anti-discrimination law after he refused to design a wedding cake for a gay couple. The justices have been considering his appeal behind closed doors since December, but have taken no action.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If the court agrees to take up the issue, \u201cI think Justice Gorsuch would be with us,\u201d said Jeremy Tedesco, a lawyer for the Alliance Defending Freedom, the Arizona-based group that appealed on behalf of the Masterpiece Cakeshop and its owner, Jack Phillips. Meanwhile, gun-rights advocates are challenging a California law that requires gun owners to show \u201cgood cause\u201d before they are issued a permit to carry a concealed gun in public. Gun-rights lawyers have sued, contending this policy violates the 2nd Amendment and its implied \u201cright to self-defense.\u201d <\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/politics\/la-<wbr>na-pol-gorsuch-court-impact-2017040<wbr>9-story.html<br><br>Let&#039;s hope he doesn&#039;t let us down.","filename":"Neil Gorsuch","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":389,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1491793806029,"time":1491793806,"md5":"+dJFBZIL33ggOdtSvTbgSA==","fsize":47215,"resto":120381599,"id":"Jrs9dT4o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120383112,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:10:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Tell me if I got this right:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spencer fats have been raiding \/ptg\/ for a while<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They&#039;re using a Discord to co-ord<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Discord was ID&#039;d and infiltrated<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Some degree of doxing ensued<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Doxing moved to a parallel thread in another chan, and **intensified**, since you get B&amp; for doing that in rampage mode here<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Spencerfats became aware of it, and panic ensued<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They started deleting their profiles, but it was too late<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;PII about them abounds, social media accounts abound, emails, literally addresses in some cases, and they&#039;re basically fucked<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The poked the Internet Hate Machine, and are basically fucked IRL<\/span>","filename":"Summary","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":1038,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":101,"tim":1491793807021,"time":1491793807,"md5":"9lIMMYJsYRkL+vWX2\/JJcQ==","fsize":180041,"resto":120381599,"id":"6ocqd37I","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120383117,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:10:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120382873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120382873<\/a><br>nice flag serbscum<br>remeber the jews are in power because you sperged out.","time":1491793809,"resto":120381599,"id":"MA60zAvp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120383130,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:10:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120381599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120381599<\/a><br>i genuinely thought that was Jon Bon Jovi until i clicked it.","time":1491793814,"resto":120381599,"id":"3sLC4nkk","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120383164,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:10:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120382975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120382975<\/a><br>You dudes freaked the fuck out the other day when trump had his little fireworks show.

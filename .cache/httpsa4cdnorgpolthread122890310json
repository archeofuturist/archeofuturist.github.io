Ken believes mapping the connectome - the complex connections of all the neurons in a brain - holds the key, because he believes it encodes all the information that makes us who we are, though this is not proven. &quot;In the same sense that my computer is really just the ones and zeros on my hard drive, and I don&#039;t care what happens as long as those ones and zeros make it to the next computer it should be the same thing with me,&quot; he says, &quot;I don&#039;t care if my connectome is implemented in this physical body or a computer simulation controlling a robotic body.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But Ken is a realist. &quot;We are pitifully far away from mapping a human connectome,&quot; he acknowledges. <\/span><br><br>So instead of you existing, a robot slave with a cloned personality running on hardware backdoored to fuck by the NWO will &quot;live&quot; forever.

I ask these audiences to assume that their tables are correct - that the results of the original survey in fact correspond to what they&#039;ve guessed - and to state at least two reasonable hypotheses to explain these results. Their most common responses are the following:<br><br>1.) Educated people are more informed and critical, hence more able to sift through misinformation and conclude that the Vietnam War was not in our best interests, politically or morally.<br>2.) Educated people are more tolerant. There were elements of racism and ethnocentrism in our conduct of the war; educated people are less likely to accept such prejudice....<br><br>There is nothing surprising here. Most people feel that schooling is a good thing and enables us to sift facts, weigh evidence, and think rationally.

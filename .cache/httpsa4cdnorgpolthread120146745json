Finch doesn&#039;t defend Tom Robinson in &quot;To Kill A Mockingbird&quot; because he likes him, or because he thinks it&#039;ll help his career, or because he wants to fight for civil rights, or even because he thinks he could be innocent. Finch risks his livelihood, his social standing, and even his life to defend Tom Robinson for one reason and one reason only - because The Law guarantees Tom Robinson the right to legal representation in a court of law, and as an officer of the court it is Finch&#039;s sworn duty to uphold the law and ensure that Tom Robinson and his interests are fervently and earnestly defended in court.<br><br>Finch truly, genuinely believes in the fair and impartial application of The Law and is willing to risk everything to uphold that principle. It&#039;s this same dedication to the equality and fairness of law that leads Finch to oppose the NAACP&#039;s politicization of civil rights and its push for affirmative action in &quot;Go Set A Watchmen&quot;. Nothing could be more offensive to a man who&#039;s all about the fair and equal application of The Law than a system which explicitly proposes that The Law be applied more favorably to one group over another.<br><br>Also based Gregory Peck.","filename":"Gregory-Peck-as-Atticus-Finch","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1040,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1491668603039,"time":1491668603,"md5":"nQQ9sB42v9bkTr+k8BRlaw==","fsize":128386,"resto":120146745,"id":"vdB771vZ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

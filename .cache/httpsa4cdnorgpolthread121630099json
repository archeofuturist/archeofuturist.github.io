Legit as in it gives you a fuck ton of sources to pour through? Then yes, if you pay out the ass for it. The problem is that the computer obviously cannot sift through tons of handwritten records going back hundreds of years, that&#039;s up to the customer. And customers tend to be fucking stupid. The result is that most people will verify literally every single document that Ancestry sends to you saying that it MIGHT be related to you. And so in the end you end up with these giant cluster fucks of family trees of extremely dubious accuracy.

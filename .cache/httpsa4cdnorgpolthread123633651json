The wickedness of this civilization is truly a modern day Sodom and Gomorrah. Jesus was right and true in rejecting the pharisees which is what most of these Jews are now. They are the synagogue of Satan. It&#039;s undeniable if you can just wake up! If those days had not been cut short, no one would survive, but for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened.

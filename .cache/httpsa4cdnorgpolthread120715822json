Hopefully by then without the illegals overwhelming the polls we&#039;ll go red again.","filename":"gommiefornia","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491976470338,"time":1491976470,"md5":"rqzueyKYK0F2vZCyXNxByQ==","fsize":17958,"resto":120715822,"id":"hnj\/8EEm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120721624,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:55:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120721240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120721240<\/a><br>I go to canyon lake for granny d&#039;s<br>Biggest pancakes in Texas","time":1491976554,"resto":120715822,"id":"AXr2d\/Sf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120721631,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:56:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120721350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120721350<\/a><br>Mexican border has moved to south Austin.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;schliterbahn<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1980s workers all hot blondes with red swimsuits<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1990s workers blondes and brunettes red then blue swimsuits <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2000s workers poo in loos, Mexicans ugly people in dark blue <\/span><br>Fuck everything Texas about 1900-1985 was god tier <br><br>Now it&#039;s just all fucking ruined","time":1491976561,"resto":120715822,"id":"DKflIkkL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120721721,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:57:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120721116\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120721116<\/a><br>I&#039;ve been here since the mid &#039;90s.

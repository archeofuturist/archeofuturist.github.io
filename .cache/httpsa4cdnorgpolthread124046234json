As of right now though too general. I don&#039;t talk in depth very much with them but this person apparently really likes me a lot especially compared to my co-workers. What should be opening be? Can we talk about genital mutilation? This is also my first thread on the matter of what I expect to be many so any and all input about this issue is very appreciated.","filename":"Circumcised-banana-000001126959_Medium","ext":".jpg","w":1578,"h":1216,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":192,"tim":1493893264408,"time":1493893264,"md5":"t19luu9w0SzC7EO\/dvPeHg==","fsize":113495,"resto":0,"id":"G24g0aGe","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"it-turns-out-i-work-for-a-very-powerful","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":124046304,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:22:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fucking autocorrect <br><br>My opening","time":1493893328,"resto":124046234,"id":"G24g0aGe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124046917,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:30:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124046234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124046234<\/a><br>Wut","time":1493893843,"resto":124046234,"id":"+z8RrmgP","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124047361,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:36:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124046917\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124046917<\/a><br>Come on you&#039;ve got to be specific. I&#039;m about to get real serious here starting tomorrow actually. Right now I&#039;m thinking our best bet is to make it illegal for hospitals to even ask if the parents want a circumcision performed or even ban the practice at hospitals altogether. I want it recognized as a 100% religious\/voluntary decision by the parents. Of course I strongly believe it is a criminal violation of the childs rights but that&#039;s a big jump to make. I would prefer some progress at least and then move from there. Jews are gonna freak the fuck out. I mean I can explore the option of an outright ban but from what I just read it&#039;s not looking good.","time":1493894219,"resto":124046234,"id":"G24g0aGe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124047507,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)06:39:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124046234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124046234<\/a><br>Preputioplasty is the preferred method of curing phismosis, although in most cases it goes away by itself.

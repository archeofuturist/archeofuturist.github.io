I played hockey and soccer. My friends and I spent our afternoons and evenings playing in the river valley, climbing trees, playing soldiers in the woods. In winter time we would go tobogganing. On Friday nights I would watch Boy Meets World with my sisters. On Saturdays, my parents would take me and my siblings swimming. On the way home, we would stop at the video store and rent a couple movies: I remember watching Romy and Michelle&#039;s High School Reunion, Robin Hood: Men in Tights, Camp Nowhere, Heavyweights, and Scream (which I watched with my sister and gave me nightmares). Sometimes on weekends I would camp out in the living room with my little brother, pulling the cushions out of the couch and laying them on the floor. We would watch wrestling or hockey. After he fell asleep, I would turn on the TV and watch Southpark (which was banned in my house). I had to sit right next to the TV with the volume low so I didn&#039;t get caught. <br><br>Sunday morning was dreadful because my mom would wake us up for church. We had to wash up and comb our hair and put on dress clothes. But once church was over, Sunday afternoons were the best.

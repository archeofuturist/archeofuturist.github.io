Also, I think we specialize and focus on helping Syrians where they are instead of encouraging them to make the life-threatening journeys out of Syria (we can&#039;t do both let them in and help them where they are- as we wouldn&#039;t get as far than if we should specialized in one)<br>HOWEVER, part of me has feels for the plight of families and young people. A lot of Syrian refugees have gone through GENUINE hell. Isis, a tyranical dictatorship using chemical weapons, and so many factors forcing them to leave their country to start again somewhere else. <br><br>I am really divided on the subject \/pol, so I would love to hear your opinions on what should be done about the Refugee crisis. What should our Governments do? And what should we advocate for?

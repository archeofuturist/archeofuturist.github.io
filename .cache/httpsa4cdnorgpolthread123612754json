This might kill brainwashed North Korean civilians if messed up. Regardless of whether America does hit any civilians or not, Kim Jong-Un is probably going to either massacre some of his loyal citizens. Either that or he is going to round up the bodies of some of the many who have died in that country. He is going to blame an absurd body count on Trump.

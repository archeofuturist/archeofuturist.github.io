Because of the pressure of the jewish capitalists, there can be no such a thing as idealisms in capitalist system, because capitalism thrives in conflict, and those in power will do anything to promote it.<br>This is why Hitler opposed the old capitalist system, he knew he could never have a unified German under control of jewish bankers, are you gonna continue to get cucked by jewish capitalists? Let them lie to you about &quot;diferent politicians&quot; only to control then when they get in power? <br>Moral corruption happens because capitalism needs childish customers, refugee problems happen because capitalists create conflict in third world shitholes, to exploit their resources, even if it means destroying the order of the country (Syria, Lybia, Iraq), human life, culture and race, all become mere products. You can either defend your masters, or you can take the final red pill.","filename":"cool cocaine man","ext":".png","w":480,"h":249,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":129,"tim":1491541287443,"time":1491541287,"md5":"vjFIv7h9onWpGr7TJmED2w==","fsize":66866,"resto":0,"id":"jO2qhhDM","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"will-pol-finally-take-the-real-redpill","country_name":"Brazil","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

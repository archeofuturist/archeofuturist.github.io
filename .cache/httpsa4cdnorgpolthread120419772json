He&#039;ll garner temporary support from the left but he caused his base voters to get pissed off and feel betrayed. The left don&#039;t share Trump&#039;s beliefs since he still has to cater to the right so after the honeymoon period is over the left is going to go right back to shitting on Trump but his core base are still going to be mad.<br>It&#039;s sacrificing the long-game for short-term gain. I don&#039;t know what caused Trump to do what he did but he royally fucked up. All around bad move since this will follow him for the rest of the presidency. Expect this to be brought up if he ever takes military action again except there&#039;ll be an even bigger backlash.","time":1491818258,"resto":120419772,"id":"fCzA6ST7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

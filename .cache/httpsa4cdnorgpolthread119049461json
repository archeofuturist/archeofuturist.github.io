Honestly, nothing is more amusing to Chinese people than hearing Western millenials explain our own philosophies to us. You will never understand them because you approach them from an entirely different mindset i.e. a Western paradigm. Even those of us who don&#039;t practise Taoism grow up to adopt the Taoist mindset. It&#039;s why so many Chinese like to gamble, for example.<br>If I try to picture you now, I see a gay kilted Scotsman trying to teach an Indian about Yoga, or Madonna discussing Kabbala, or ... you get the picture.

I&#039;ve lost count of how many of you I&#039;ve encountered since my parents brought me here from Hong Kong 30 years ago (your teachers are the worst).<br>Taoism offers no explanation as to why were here.

Western minds are always preoccupied by questions that begin, &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Why am I here?&quot; &quot;Why did this happen to me?&quot; This is alien to most native Chinese, whereas it underlies all western thought processes, including when you try to interpret Taoism.

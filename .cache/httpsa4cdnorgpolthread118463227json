Take the USSR for example. The Soviets were state capitalist for all but one area of the economy, and that was the agriculture. In the agriculture they actually did go through with an extensive collectivization program, while everything else was not collectivized. That&#039;s why they were able to keep tank production and the space race going just fine, while their people starved and food production was minimal. In other words, had the USSR been a real communist society, it would have been far worse than it was in reality.","filename":"terror","ext":".png","w":708,"h":1127,"tn_w":78,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490584524053,"time":1490584524,"md5":"KhzqLTrVZEb0lAeDZR8N6A==","fsize":221607,"resto":118463227,"id":"SCw4GOS4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118463541,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)23:15:27","name":"Broseph Stalin","com":"<a href=\"#p118463383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118463383<\/a><br>I can make some revisions on this and create a new thread.

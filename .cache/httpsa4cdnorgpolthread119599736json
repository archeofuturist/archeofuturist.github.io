On that day I was asked a question by Rupert Ryan, brother-in-law of Lord Casey, on the deportation of Malayan seamen, Chinese and other people who had contravened our immigration laws. I said, amongst other things, that an error may have been made in the case of two men named Wong. The Department had served a deportation notice on one of them, but it was the wrong Wong. I then said, and I quote from Hansard: &quot;there are many Wongs in the Chinese community, but I have to say \u2014 and I am sure that the honorable Member for Balaclava will not mind doing so \u2014 that &#039;two Wongs do not make a White&#039;<br><br>It was a jocose remark, made partly at the expense of the member for Balaclava, who was at the time the Hon T W (later Sir Thomas) White. I expected that I would have been correctly reported, as I was in Hansard and that the initial letter &quot;W&quot; on both the names &quot;Wong&quot; and &quot;White&quot; would have been written in capitals. But when the message got to Singapore, either because of some anti-Australian Asian journalist or perhaps because some Australian pressman with a chip on his shoulder, a Labor Party hater, the name of White was deliberately altered into a definition of colour, so as to read &quot;two Wongs don&#039;t make a white.&quot; The story has lasted to this day. I have often answered questions about it from young Chinese students at universities in Melbourne and Sydney. I notice whenever reference is made to it in newspapers or periodicals, or whenever the quotation is used anywhere, the Singapore abomination is generally repeated. Latterly the true version is being printed.<br><br>There was never any intention in my mind to raise any question of colour. I have repudiated the whole story so often that I suppose there is nothing more I can do about it. But I put the facts on record in the book","time":1491399801,"resto":119599736,"id":"wSplC4Ax","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119607342,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)09:43:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119606902\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119606902<\/a><br>&quot;So based&quot;","time":1491399818,"resto":119599736,"id":"wSplC4Ax","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119607432,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)09:44:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119607321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119607321<\/a><br>I assumed he also meant Sir White in his pamphlet &quot;&#039;I Stand By White Australia&quot;.","time":1491399883,"resto":119599736,"id":"8KoH0GaX","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119608533,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)09:57:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119601083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119601083<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw my cousins all live in Campbelltown and Camden<\/span>","time":1491400658,"resto":119599736,"id":"Gg03xn8t","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119608782,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)10:00:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119603369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119603369<\/a><br>What degree?<br><br>I&#039;m just about to start applying for grad positions with a comp sci degree, hope i get something...","time":1491400837,"resto":119599736,"id":"p7yoiFu9","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

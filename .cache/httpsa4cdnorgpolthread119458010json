I&#039;m not entirely sure of the neurology behind the disorder, but from what I&#039;ve heard, ADD\/ADHD is the result of a deficiency in the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which is responsible for fight-or-flight responses, but more importantly, the ability to successfully prioritize stressors according to their threat level. Because of this deficiency, individuals with ADD\/ADHD have serious problems organizing their external environment into something orderly, and can easily become overwhelmed by seemingly mundane tasks.<br><br>Most often, ADD\/ADHD is detected during IQ tests, where a large disparity (at least a standard deviation) is exhibited between the reasoning components of intelligence (VIQ\/PIQ) and working memory (WM). Working memory is associated with activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and measures a individuals capacity to efficiently organize their short-term memory and follow instructions correctly. That specific part of the brain is also associated with impulse control and general conscientiousness.<br><br>Ted Kacynzski wrote extensively about the detrimental effects of the extreme overabundance of historically valuable (hard-to-obtain) resources in his manifesto, blaming much of modern societies ills on the lack of proper implementation of the &quot;power processs&quot;. I think Ted certainly has a point. In my opinion, ADD\/ADHD afflicted individuals are people who have brains that are essentially outdated--poorly equipped to handle the modern, technologically based world, but very proficient at succeeding in expending the tremendous energy needed to harvest resources in a primitive, labor-based world. Similar theories are used by cognitive psychologists to explain dyslexia.","filename":"3c8f1957c93e4916498d488007dc5fae635596bfca6dda47424a6048456336e5","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":941,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1491317761562,"time":1491317761,"md5":"SLWZTGeTQcq45GNRGzahSw==","fsize":189352,"resto":119458010,"id":"OllzIko5","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119476849,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)10:56:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119475615\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119475615<\/a><br>I&#039;d never heard of Dr. (((Eisenberg))) before today.

My point is that ADHD is just a label invented by jews to describe perfectly normal human evolved behaviours. Do you think it&#039;s any (((coincidence))) that the diagnoses for ADHD keep rising each year? When all it takes is hyperactivity and inattention to be the main criteria for a mental disorder you know its a scam. <br><br>Before the 1970s ADHD type-behaviours would have been seen as perfectly normal, and in many cases desirable as it usually correlates highly with right brain orientation (such as creativity). People with ADHD have the hunter gene which means they are less capable of focusing on the finer details but excellent when it comes to snap decisions, abstract thinking, and &quot;going in for the kill&quot;. ADHD traits would have been desirable in war situations as they would have been the types of soldiers to storm the battle lines, with quick bursts of intense energy. The fact that so many people have the so-called mental disorder suggests that it isn&#039;t maladaptive but an adaptive trait intended for crisis scenarios requiring unpredictable behaviour. <br><br>Think about it. If your tribe is surrounded by other tribes, it helps to have some individuals with unpredictable behaviour, to keep potential invaders on their toes. <br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hunte<wbr>r_vs._farmer_hypothesis<br><br>ADHD is 100% a jewish conspiracy","filename":"large nosed man","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491318147024,"time":1491318147,"md5":"R\/FZ2H2QjJ4LFovJGYK6wA==","fsize":65161,"resto":119458010,"id":"\/uG35wrZ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119477677,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)11:04:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119477316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119477316<\/a><br>IQ number just shows you how you fared compared to others that took the same test.

Doctors can literally measure the differneces between a healthy mind and an ADHD mind. An ADHD mind produces less dopamine than a healthy mind, and that lack of dopamine is what causes the many issues that are associated with ADHD. You can&#039;t focus because you don&#039;t experience the same dopamine response to activities. Very little is interesting because you don&#039;t receive as much dopamine as a healthy person. You latch on to the few things that actually are interesting because they are the few things that actually produce dopamine in your mind, and so you try to milk those things and wind up being fucking autistically knowledgeable about off the wall shit.<br><br>There is empirical evidence for ADHD.

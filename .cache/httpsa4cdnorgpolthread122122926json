Yet he made a very good campaign this year and floats around 20% of vote intentions for the first round like Fillon and Macron, which can be sufficient to make it to the second round. He is often attacked on his euroscepticism and his positions toward Russia, Venezuela and the Syrian conflict (said that Putin may solve the situation) and therefore compared to Marine Le Pen.<br><br>-Benoit Hamon : PS candidate, pro-European, basically the SJW candidate. He won the PS primaries against Manuel Valls, but he didn&#039;t campaign very well and the far-left will go with M\u00e9lenchon while the center-left will go with Emmanuel Macron, which basically means that the PS is dead now, thank god for that.<br><br>-Manuel Valls : pro-European, pro-secularism, center-left candidate at the PS primaries, he was the Interior Minister (Home Secretary) at the beginning of the Hollande presidency and then Prime Minister, which made him very unpopular. During the primaries he swore he would vote for the winner (Hamon) but then went with Emmanuel Macron.<br><br>-Fran\u00e7ois Hollande : French president, so unpopular that he didn&#039;t contend for another five years. Although he is a member of the PS, he will vote for Macron for this election (although Macron does not want his support that much).","time":1492781329,"resto":122122926,"id":"Accy8YDQ","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122135384,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)09:29:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122135334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122135334<\/a><br>-Emmanuel Macron : literally a former Rothschild banker who ended up Minister of the Economy in 2014, was very unpopular with the left wing of the PS, and left the government to make his own movement, En Marche. His electoral base would essentially be everyone who voted for Manuel Valls aind Alain Jupp\u00e9 for the Socialist and Republican primaries, he is pretty much the Hillary Clinton of the campaign, with the media describing him as &quot;young and dynamic&quot; and suggesting that he would be at the second round against Marine Le Pen and would be the best candidate to beat her.<br><br>-Alain Jupp\u00e9 : former media favorite, he was expected to win the Republican primary, go to the second round against Marine Le Pen and beat her but he was beaten 30% to 70% by Francois Fillon. He is pro-European, quite liberal, and he also had some affairs which had made him ineligible for 10 years. Most of those who voted for him during the primaries are expected to vote for Emmanuel Macron.<br><br>-Nicolas Sarkozy : president before Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, he also was a candidate at the Republican primary but didn&#039;t make it to the second round of the primary. He now supports Fran\u00e7ois Fillon.<br><br>-Fran\u00e7ois Fillon : the surprise winner of the Republican primary, he has a very clear right-wing stance : economically liberal, conservative catholic, pro-European but wants more dialogue with Putin concerning Syria.

She has worked hard to dediabolize the FN and her political stance on economy is kinda left-wing, so her party is divided between the Philippot line (sovereignist, economically left-wing) and the Marion Mar\u00e9chal line (clearly right-wing, pro-Identity, conservative, like Jean-Marie Le Pen).<br>TL;DR Last year we expected a M\u00e9lenchon (far left)\/Valls (center-left)\/Jupp\u00e9 (center-right)\/Le Pen (far-right) match with Jupp\u00e9 and Le Pen at the second round and Jupp\u00e9 winning but the Macron candidacy and the defeats of Jupp\u00e9 and Valls led to a M\u00e9lenchon\/Hamon (SJW left)\/Macron (center, media candidate)\/Fillon (conservative right)\/Le Pen match, with Hamon pretty much out of the game now.<br><br>Le Pen will most likely go to the second round, but the other candidate is still hard to predict : M\u00e9lenchon has made a good campaign, Macron has the media support, Fillon has a strong electoral base, so all three of them may have more than 20%, which should be sufficient to go to the second round (since the small candidates may take 15-20% of the electorate).

A constant alternated power between the soft left and the soft right. Good you may think ? Well it would be if they were not doing the exact same thing once elected. The FN has a role in this little game, it&#039;s here to scare people. Since the second turn between Chirac and Le Pen most medias want us to just vote for whoever will stop the FN. We call this the &quot;vote utile&quot; or useful vote. It work worked pretty well for a time but now things are different. Another guy is currently growing fast as fuck. It&#039;s Melenchon. He used to be from the far left but he gave up most of his previous ideas to build a program with people from all over the political spectrum. What he really wants is simple. Stop the 5th republic game.<br><br>In the other hand there&#039;s Marine and her party with a new image.

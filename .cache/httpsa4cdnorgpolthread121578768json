The first age being the birth of the internet before websites and other trash, and the second age being around the rise of 4chan\/YTMND.<br><br>The defining aspect of the First Age was that there was nothing. There were no trends, fads, history, and a wide range of theories about what the internet might become. The only people using the internet were merely looking for a workaround to shipping data long distance, and had no interest in developing any sort of culture. As the internet grew, it became more than just a means to transmit data. People began making websites, creating content, and the internet transcended to the second age. <br><br>The Second Age was the era of anonymity. People started making things out of the internet, sharing stupid jpegs, videos, and stories. Sites like 4chan, YTMND, and Newgrounds rose and fell. The most valuable asset on the internet was anonymity. People came here from all walks of life, but it never mattered who you were. Discussions floated or sank on the merits of the ideas and their presentation, not by reputation or standing of the person presenting them. Everyone was equal, at least until they opened their mouths. The internet became a society all its own, even with all its weird quirks and autists. <br><br>Now, we are currently living in the third age of the internet 1\/2","filename":"iBEpNY6","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1492461782138,"time":1492461782,"md5":"H+hYPma4\/2zXKFNhoVl7JA==","fsize":150611,"resto":0,"id":"OhiVRsyD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"end-of-the-second-age","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121578863,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:43:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"It seems that the internet has been seized by authoritarians, manipulators, and normies. With the rise of facebook, tumblr, instagram, et. al social media, regular folks began to stick their noses into the internet and brought with them all the ugliness of modern society. While these sorts of people had always existed in one form or another, a light dripping became a deluge, and the old bulwarks of the online society crumbled. As the normies came in and staked their claim, clearing out the old ways where ever they clashed, their puppet masters and shadowy overlords followed them. These groups set up shop, doing what they do best. They seeded misinformation and lies to manufacture consent, whether it was to feed their consumer habits or solidiy power. In these dark times, the sanctitiy of anonymity has been replaced by cries of fake news, bots, and saboteurs. When an opinion rises that is unpopular, the op has to provide a burden of proof that they are a good person, otherwise they will be labelled a sexist, racist, snowflake, sjw, or any number of other attacks on identity. Even when the accuser agrees with the premise of an argument, they can&#039;t help but add in an extra strawman or slippery slope. <br><br>It seems the only defense against normies is being really fucking edgy. 4chan seems to be safe simply due to the volume of anime (fuck anime) and other nasty shit so that normies can&#039;t stick around for more than a few minutes. Even on reddit, edgy subs keep getting rko&#039;d whenever they start making a stir in the media or otherwise, but that&#039;s not really a suprise. Still, the risk of all the edgyness is that it takes a toll on the integrity of discussion. If we blindly oppose discussion simply because it&#039;s been tainted by the professional facebookers, or r\/redacted, doesn&#039;t that mean we have already lost?","filename":"JYdDnMW","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492461825370,"time":1492461825,"md5":"1SF2aUC8VRhw\/eg04a\/4Lw==","fsize":112222,"resto":121578768,"id":"OhiVRsyD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121580380,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:54:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"ok","time":1492462458,"resto":121578768,"id":"iIcIzSou","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121580606,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:55:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"alright","time":1492462551,"resto":121578768,"id":"LqbJE3eo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

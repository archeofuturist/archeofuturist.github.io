I can&#039;t say I&#039;m the only Redditor who finds it hard to take pride in his own subreddit after having years of constant and needless attacks defaming my choice of website usage from insecure losers here. <br><br>Why not bully Tumblrites or Facebook users? Do they not have much more to be ashamed of than our peaceful race? Instagram users get bullied less than us!<br><br>Like when its not just banter, when a meme is repeated over and over again, repeated systematically, it eventually becomes a truth irregardless of the intentions in repeating it. And that isn&#039;t just jokes any more then, then its harmful!<br>Would you call a Redditor a &quot;Redditfag&quot;(not true at all) to his face? Would you say to a kind, peaceful and hard working salt of the earth Redditor that they are a &quot;Redditorfag&quot;? Would you say those words to your fellow 4chan brother? Are you starting to feel ashamed now? You fucking degenerate?<br><br>You\u2019re destroying this forum. You\u2019re dividing 4chan-ites against each other; So I encourage you to stop now.","filename":"reddit","ext":".png","w":738,"h":415,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492375196878,"time":1492375196,"md5":"RRwmdLSXTaf0hZ0JA+EBBw==","fsize":45095,"resto":0,"id":"\/xHZbcsO","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bullying-against-people-who-use-reddit","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":121410535,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:41:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121410382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121410382<\/a><br>tldr?","time":1492375262,"resto":121410382,"id":"w59XiHmu","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121410593,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:41:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121410535\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121410535<\/a><br><br>Stop bullying us Redditors; we contribute greatly to the community.","time":1492375288,"resto":121410382,"id":"\/xHZbcsO","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121410663,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:41:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121410382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121410382<\/a><br>THIS!!!!","time":1492375314,"resto":121410382,"id":"oqIJlSYa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121410830,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:43:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"dont take the bait","time":1492375388,"resto":121410382,"id":"Iz9RT6IK","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":121410895,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:43:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"What was the original source of this copypasta?","time":1492375414,"resto":121410382,"id":"rhMar0Qx","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121410914,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:43:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121410382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121410382<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121410593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121410593<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121410663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121410663<\/a><br>you guys are huge faggots kys no one wants you niggers here and its because you fags never sage b8 and shill threads and bump them to the top youre fucking cancer","time":1492375420,"resto":121410382,"id":"eYOwKa0R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121411062,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:44:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121410914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121410914<\/a><br><br>This is the sort of horrific and abhorrent bullying I&#039;m talking about.","time":1492375486,"resto":121410382,"id":"\/xHZbcsO","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

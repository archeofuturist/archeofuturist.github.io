It\u2019s not a story the Catholics would tell you. It\u2019s a Protestant legend. Luther was a faithful monk of the Christian faith, so wise and so faithful he could use the faith to influence the people to create Reformation\u2026 He had such a knowledge of the bible that he could even keep the ones he cared about from buying indulgences. The reformed side of the Faith is a pathway to many bonds with Jesus some consider to be heterodox. He became so influential\u2026 the only thing he was afraid of was losing his influence, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his followers everything he knew, then his followers betrayed him and formed different denominations. Ironic. He could save others from betraying themselves, but not betraying him.","filename":"martin-luther-9389283-1-402","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":1200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493654938252,"time":1493654938,"md5":"t8Pzu7tXotzQaYP4lGAQ6A==","fsize":237371,"resto":0,"id":"iCRc2Uex","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"did-you-ever-hear-the-tragedy-of-monk-martin","country_name":"Australia","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":123637531,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)12:12:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Catholics aren&#039;t Christian","time":1493655179,"resto":123637149,"id":"ULh+c3Qy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123637798,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)12:15:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123637531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123637531<\/a><br>thats why Martin stopped being catholic","time":1493655351,"resto":123637149,"id":"iCRc2Uex","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123638465,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)12:22:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Reminder that Martin changed church doctrine so that the relationship he had with his wife wouldn&#039;t be sinful","time":1493655731,"resto":123637149,"id":"oCnLWI8A","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123638677,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)12:24:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123637149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123637149<\/a>","filename":"rosecross","ext":".jpg","w":287,"h":431,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493655858809,"time":1493655858,"md5":"BnIeL1jsbcdNheoEkFPvDA==","fsize":43832,"resto":123637149,"id":"nETK7HsG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123638912,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)12:26:39","name":"2hotdogs","com":"friends are for losers who are too weak to work alone","time":1493655999,"resto":123637149,"id":"2ui6zD+p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123639082,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)12:28:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123637149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123637149<\/a><br>Luther was og shitposter.

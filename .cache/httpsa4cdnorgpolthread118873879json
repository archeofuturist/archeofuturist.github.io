Liberals are very, well, liberal on which scientific evidence is enlightening or racist pertaining to this subject. Part of the reason is Boasian anthropology, a Jewish institution dictated by Franz Boas to make gentiles abandon Darwinism (due to racists like the Nazis using it to fuel their fascist endeavors) and supported by dishonest anti-scientific research in an attempt to show that even savage cultures are &quot;equal&quot; to Europeans&#039;, and there is no such thing as race. This was popularized in the 30s through Jewish media and peer reviewed by Boas&#039;s own students to give the ideas credence, and ever since then it&#039;s become taboo to talk in terms of protecting European culture or preserving the white race.<br><br>Liberals will tell you it sounds stupid, but people of a genetic background that didn&#039;t survive thousands of years of snowy wastes simply don&#039;t think the same way as Europeans. It&#039;s not a bad thing, but it means non-white people in white countries can exploit their democratic institutions to work against white interests (like the Jews have always done) or live off of their empathy and charity (guess).<br><br>The West has tried to fight off multiculturalism for this reason without sounding racist, but it&#039;s an impossible victory to attain. The reason is race and they have made it an unacceptable excuse. It would otherwise take some unimaginable genious and foresight, a miracle, or force to preserve European cultures.<br><br>So basically give up.","time":1490846285,"resto":118873879,"id":"Lm5jLgQH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118879697,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:01:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118875527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118875527<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I am French<\/span><br><br>That explains the arrogant dickhead attitude<br><br>Go back to fuggin ur mum with a baguette faggot","time":1490846509,"resto":118873879,"id":"nWD17fs4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118882620,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:29:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118874939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118874939<\/a><br>\/Thread <br><a href=\"#p118879697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118879697<\/a><br>What was arrogant about his post?","time":1490848185,"resto":118873879,"id":"+8WuQGAP","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"}]}

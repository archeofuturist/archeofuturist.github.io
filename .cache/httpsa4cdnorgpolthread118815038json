I was driving home from work today and I got caught behind three of these slow, annoying fuckers. One after the other - they coast in the middle of the road, wearing clothes that are way too form-fitting and sunglasses that they bought at Bass Pro Shops, and I don&#039;t see why they should be able to do so.<br><br>I pay taxes on my car and it&#039;s licenses, it&#039;s plates, and it&#039;s registration so that I can use the roads that the government paves and organizes for me and other motor vehicle drivers to do so. What taxes are cyclists paying? Other than the sales tax on their FagBreeze 2800 or whatever bikes for grown ups are called these days, none. Why should they be allowed to use the roads?<br><br>Also, let&#039;s talk about public transit\/buses. There is no argument against the fact that public transit\/buses\/etc punish those successful and able enough to buy and operate their own motor vehicles and reward those who do not. Public transit is a sink of taxpayer money, it harbors crime, vandalism, and homelessness, and it inconveniences the rest of us, forcing more resource usage and causing a FURTHER increase to taxes and even an environmental hazard. It sucks.<br><br>Let&#039;s outlaw public transit and bicycles on streets.","filename":"cyclists-in-middle-of-the-road-62617-1","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":426,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490811820579,"time":1490811820,"md5":"G3WK2Vn5X+EpmgiWUhQoxQ==","fsize":51643,"resto":0,"id":"aTBGH0ER","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"transportation-politics","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118817115,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:42:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;america in charge of urban development<\/span>","time":1490812920,"resto":118815038,"id":"s9hfB62M","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":118817383,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:44:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118817115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118817115<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying the government should &quot;develop&quot; anything other than military, roads, and diplomacy shit<\/span>","time":1490813077,"resto":118815038,"id":"aTBGH0ER","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118817390,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:44:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118815038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118815038<\/a><br>I routinely hit bicyclists when they run stop signs for fun.

I ride my bike to work everyday and I&#039;m lucky enough to have a lane. It sucks when I don&#039;t because I know I&#039;m way slower than cars but I try to stick as close to side walk as possible. Cruiser fags riding in the street is retarded. I get where your frustration is coming from but some people don&#039;t have a choice or it&#039;s the only form of exercise they can squeeze in. <br><br>As far as public transportation it&#039;s a necessity for bigger cities. Can you imagine if everyone was driving a car? Shit would look like India or China, you would have to leave the house hours before your shift starts and more gas would be needed as your just sitting in traffics for hours. <br><br>Boost your test levels and ride a bike to work if you don&#039;t live too far. You&#039;ll be fitter, happier, more productive and you&#039;ll save a decent amount of money.

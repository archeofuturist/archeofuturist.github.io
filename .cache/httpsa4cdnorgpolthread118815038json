I was driving home from work today and I got caught behind three of these slow, annoying fuckers. One after the other - they coast in the middle of the road, wearing clothes that are way too form-fitting and sunglasses that they bought at Bass Pro Shops, and I don&#039;t see why they should be able to do so.<br><br>I pay taxes on my car and it&#039;s licenses, it&#039;s plates, and it&#039;s registration so that I can use the roads that the government paves and organizes for me and other motor vehicle drivers to do so. What taxes are cyclists paying? Other than the sales tax on their FagBreeze 2800 or whatever bikes for grown ups are called these days, none. Why should they be allowed to use the roads?<br><br>Also, let&#039;s talk about public transit\/buses. There is no argument against the fact that public transit\/buses\/etc punish those successful and able enough to buy and operate their own motor vehicles and reward those who do not. Public transit is a sink of taxpayer money, it harbors crime, vandalism, and homelessness, and it inconveniences the rest of us, forcing more resource usage and causing a FURTHER increase to taxes and even an environmental hazard.

If a car doesn&#039;t have to swerve to go round them, drivers tend to breeze past without slowing. If a collision occurs (say the cyclist has to swerve round a pothole) the resulting impact at relatively high speed diferences nearly always results in a fatal or disabling injury to the unprotected cyclist.<br>By cycling a metre from the roads edge, the cyclist IS forcing the car to slow down to overtake. It&#039;s quite deliberate, and is actually taught at cycling proficiency classes for kids.<br>If you assholes didn&#039;t regard bikes as a ho-hum impact hazard that isn&#039;t going to do anything to you except dent your wing, then maybe we wouldn&#039;t have to do this.<br>So next time you have to slow to a crawl because you can&#039;t just swish past a cyclist, try blaming asswipe drivers.<br>Having said that, cyclists who ride in the middle of the lane ARE assholes.","time":1490822667,"resto":118815038,"id":"qdJ4YUhc","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118836332,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:24:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"I would be fine if they werent so smug and aggressive.

They also don&#039;t lose sight of why they are commies in the first place, they see capitalism as inherently exploitative. Their goals are usually to get communism without the exploitation and suffering. Impossible though that may be. <br><br>Libertarians on the other hand, won&#039;t even admit that things such as market externalities actually exist. When the real world proves their free market fetish wrong, they grasp for any explanation that exonerates the &quot;free market&quot; and try to place blame on other people. Libertarians are just a cult in a lot of ways, they don&#039;t use logic or facts, but rather a strict ideological dogma that cannot be strayed from. in that manner they are definitely dumber than the commies.","time":1491510365,"resto":119786837,"id":"s9pN5gDv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119789729,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:28:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119786837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119786837<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Implying anyone is as brain damaged as a libertarian<\/span>","time":1491510537,"resto":119786837,"id":"wW7j9P3x","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119789871,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:29:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;libertarians are anarchists<\/span><br><br>Every time<br><br>Good to see this meme coming back","time":1491510593,"resto":119786837,"id":"LMHyzPJy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119790573,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:34:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119786837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119786837<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I need the government to tell me what to do and to provide for me because I&#039;m a giant faggot<\/span>","time":1491510893,"resto":119786837,"id":"17Fmo22A","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119790737,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:36:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119790573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119790573<\/a><br>This is the epitome of the libertarian argument <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;HURRRRRR IM A MAN AND U R NOT DUURRRRRRRRR<\/span><br><br>man up beta bitch","time":1491510965,"resto":119786837,"id":"SUswxywq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119791133,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:38:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119786837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119786837<\/a><br>Lol bergs are less nakedly destructive and some have their hearts in the right place but theyre also a living nightmare to get through to compard to gommies","time":1491511139,"resto":119786837,"id":"WImGPzEI","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119791264,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:39:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119791133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119791133<\/a><br>Libertarians are as bad as Muslims, never forget that.","time":1491511197,"resto":119786837,"id":"SUswxywq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119791463,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:41:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119790573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119790573<\/a><br><br>I blindly trust the free market is always right, because human beings never fuck other human beings over, lol.","time":1491511279,"resto":119786837,"id":"xaTOd8WL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119791482,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:41:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119791264\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119791264<\/a><br>Bit harsh","time":1491511287,"resto":119786837,"id":"WImGPzEI","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

The consensus on the board is that pic related is the single best English language edition of Plato. Now, perhaps there are better \/translations\/ of specific works here and there, but if you want the whole shebang all in one crack, this is the answer.<br><br>There are about 45 selections, usually with each piece being translated by a different scholar. The volume contains everything which is known to be written by Plato, as well as &quot;traditional&quot; selections which have traditionally been attributed to Plato, but which are thought by at least some scholars to be spurious.<br><br>I&#039;ve closely compared the contents of this volume with Edith Hamilton&#039;s Plato, another major English-language edition.

And if you&#039;re that serious about picking a translation by a scholar whose political views are closest to your own (as opposed to, say, the quality of the translation), then you can conduct your own basic research on the scholars, and you have no choice but to actually read multiple versions of the same work anyway. <br><br>Let me suggest that Plato is for the most part &quot;settled&quot;, and that the issue you&#039;re having isn&#039;t quite as valid in this case as it is for, say, a Stalag Mein Kampf vs. Manheim.

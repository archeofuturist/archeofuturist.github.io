They claim the shortened edited version of the Holy Bible infallible yet most don&#039;t even observe The Ten Commandments properly. Jesus said &quot;Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven&quot;. So why are they not observing the Sabbath instead of following Jesus&#039; Catholic Church who by virtue of Her divine mission changed the solemnity to Sunday naming it &quot;The Lords Day&quot;? Why do they remarry and consummate knowing that that is adultery? Do they not know this behavior ends in Hell? Christs&#039; Peace be with you Anons.","filename":"Loving Jesus","ext":".jpg","w":199,"h":253,"tn_w":196,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493761538303,"time":1493761538,"md5":"c4sX4q4K6QXf5rbafiRWzw==","fsize":9775,"resto":0,"id":"qtFbw67A","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-is-the-majority-of-americas-christians-so","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123825074,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:50:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123824348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123824348<\/a><br><br>Hebrews 10:26-29 says, \u201cFor if we sin WILFULLY after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth NO more sacrifice for sins, \u2026 He that despised Moses&#039; law died without mercy under two or three witnesses: Of how much sorer punishment, suppose you, shall he be thought worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and has counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done despite unto the Spirit of Grace?\u201d<br><br>The Bible tells us how much sorer the punishment shall be for wilful sin and it is my heartfelt prayer that no one takes that path. Some may exhort that it is not possible to keep the Ten Commandments. Because we are sinners this is impossible to do on our own, but God&#039;s love changes us and enables us to obey His Commandments. God&#039;s Holy Spirit can pour into your heart an abundance of self denying love so that you will be able to love God most of all and your neighbour as yourself. The Bible also informs us that all things are possible through Christ who strengthens us and renews our hearts and minds making us a new creature. See 2 Corinthians 5:17 and Philippians 4:13.","time":1493761838,"resto":123824348,"id":"RONDXCA2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

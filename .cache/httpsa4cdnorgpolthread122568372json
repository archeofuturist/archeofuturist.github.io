putting aside lifelong indoctrination in favor of learning what it means to be men. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And through the ache in there back and sweat of their brow they too one day will be tempered and work hardened into what their existence has always intended of them. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and even some women, once deadset in the belief they are not equal to men will realise that there power is not taken from men but earned through hard work and sacrifice.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they will learn that certain skills are better suited for the opposite sex, and it&#039;s their own responsibility to take care of themselves and their families.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and even some of the most vile and hideous abominations of the

What&#039;re the warning signs of being in an evil cult?<br><br>Submission:<br>\u00b0Complete unquestioned trust in the leadership.<br>\u00b0Leaders are often seen as prophets, apostles, or special individuals with unusual connections to God. This helps a person give themselves over psychologically to trusting someone else for their spiritual welfare.<br>\u00b0Increased submission to the leadership is rewarded with additional responsibilities and\/or roles, and\/or praises, increasing the importance of the person within the group.<br><br>Exclusivity<br>\u00b0Their group is the only true religious system, or one of the few true remnants of God&#039;s people.<br><br>Persecution complex<br>\u00b0Us against them mentality. Therefore, when someone (inside or outside of the group) corrects the group in doctrine and\/or behavior, it is interpreted as persecution, which then is interpreted as validation.<br><br>Control<br>\u00b0Control of members&#039; actions and thinking through repeated indoctrination and\/or threats of loss of salvation, or a place to live, or receiving curses from God, etc.<br><br>Isolation<br>\u00b0Minimizing contact of church members with those outside the group. This facilitates a further control over the thinking and practices of the members by the leadership.<br><br>Love Bombing<br>\u00b0Showing great attention and love to a person in the group by others in the group, to help transfer emotional dependence to the group.<br><br>Special Knowledge<br>\u00b0Instructions and\/or knowledge are sometimes said to be received by a leader(s) from God. This leader then informs the members.<br>\u00b0The Special Knowledge can be received through visions, dreams, or new interpretations of sacred scriptures such as the Bible.<br><br>Indoctrination<br>\u00b0The teachings of the group are repeatedly drilled into the members, but the indoctrination usually occurs around Special Knowledge.<br><br>Salvation<br>\u00b0Salvation from the judgment of God is maintained through association and\/or submission with the group, its authority, and\/or its Special Knowledge.","filename":"tmp_10368-meca-2-141181844","ext":".jpg","w":1400,"h":1099,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":196,"tim":1490294776366,"time":1490294776,"md5":"0UuesGxHTDTT9p9eBrbTaA==","fsize":608092,"resto":0,"id":"aJerwHxc","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cult-checklist","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":6,"unique_ips":1},{"no":117966375,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)14:47:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117966220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117966220<\/a><br>Group Think<br>\u00b0The group&#039;s coherence is maintained by the observance to policies handed down from those in authority.<br>\u00b0There is an internal enforcement of policies by members who reward &quot;proper&quot; behavior, and those who perform properly are rewarded with further inclusion and acceptance by the group.<br><br>Cognitive Dissonance<br>\u00b0Avoidance of critical thinking and\/or maintaining logically impossible beliefs and\/or beliefs that are inconsistent with other beliefs held by the group.<br>\u00b0Avoidance of and\/or denial of any facts that might contradict the group&#039;s belief system.<br><br>Shunning<br>\u00b0Those who do not keep in step with group policies are shunned and\/or expelled.<br><br>Gender Roles<br>\u00b0Control of gender roles and definitions.<br>\u00b0Severe control of gender roles sometimes leads to sexual exploitation.<br><br>Appearance Standards<br>\u00b0Often a common appearance is required and maintained. For instance, women might wear prairie dresses, and\/or their hair in buns, and\/or no makeup, and\/or the men might all wear white short-sleeved shirts, and\/or without beards, or all wear beards.","filename":"tmp_10368-LRH-38-01-Res-web(2)-441388171","ext":".jpg","w":447,"h":600,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490294849086,"time":1490294849,"md5":"Ayi3WUavsIvSkjuF9QjAVg==","fsize":156687,"resto":117966220,"id":"aJerwHxc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117966623,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)14:49:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117966375\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117966375<\/a><br>\u00b7The group displays excessively zealous and unquestioning commitment to its leader and (whether he is alive or dead) regards his belief system, ideology, and practices as the Truth, as law.<br><br>\u00b7Questioning, doubt, and dissent are discouraged or even punished.<br><br>\u00b7Mind-altering practices (such as meditation, chanting, speaking in tongues, denunciation sessions, and debilitating work routines) are used in excess and serve to suppress doubts about the group and its leader(s).<br><br>\u00b7The leadership dictates, sometimes in great detail, how members should think, act, and feel (for example, members must get permission to date, change jobs, marry\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdor leaders prescribe what types of clothes to wear, where to live, whether or not to have children, how to discipline children, and so forth).<br><br>\u00b7The group is elitist, claiming a special, exalted status for itself, its leader(s) and members (for example, the leader is considered the Messiah, a special being, an avatar\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdor the group and\/or the leader is on a special mission to save humanity).<br><br>\u00b7The group has a polarized us-versus-them mentality, which may cause conflict with the wider society.<br><br>\u00b7The leader is not accountable to any authorities (unlike, for example, teachers, military commanders or ministers, priests, monks, and rabbis of mainstream religious denominations).<br><br>\u00b7The group teaches or implies that its supposedly exalted ends justify whatever means it deems necessary.

They will demand complete \u201csubmission\u201d to the group, its leaders and its teachings. They will do this by making you feel absolutely rotten about yourself. They will ridicule you and attack any weakness you might have (or invent weaknesses you might have if they can\u2019t find any). Their goal is to break your will by causing you mental anguish.","filename":"tmp_10368-WhoreofBabylon19a-1217229180","ext":".jpg","w":1500,"h":1070,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1490295134661,"time":1490295134,"md5":"L2wxjSv+KqZVX2Zz+pr02w==","fsize":293505,"resto":117966220,"id":"aJerwHxc","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117967150,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)14:53:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bumping for evil cult awareness","filename":"tmp_10368-nuevo-7.JPG1898045457","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":904,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490295208389,"time":1490295208,"md5":"AyD1l9zIPLpNmgklFkhdPQ==","fsize":237333,"resto":117966220,"id":"aJerwHxc","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117967532,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)14:56:36","name":"Anonymous","filename":"tmp_10368-_1_bael___baal___goetic_demons_by_willd8-d6gcydz-779853354","ext":".jpg","w":832,"h":960,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490295396107,"time":1490295396,"md5":"8v5vJer4\/e6rTQy5Vp6DxA==","fsize":238932,"resto":117966220,"id":"aJerwHxc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

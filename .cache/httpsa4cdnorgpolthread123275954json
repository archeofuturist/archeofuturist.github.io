That movement found a major sponsor and benefactor in George Soros, a far-left financier of left wing causes and the Democratic Party in pursuit of an elite globalist agenda. Soros pushed the BLM movement in an attempt to stoke black participation in the political process in preparation for the 2016 election and the expectation of an anti-climax among the black electorate. <br><br>Soros failed to stoke black turnout on election day. Hillary lost. The movement is no longer relevant to his plans. He&#039;s moved on and so the movement is more or less dead. There still exists a presence online but the &quot;fire&quot; is gone. The movement is unlikely to ever recover.","filename":"fasbender","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493429267910,"time":1493429267,"md5":"Cb9H3BYrGb9GT6tXiZI1fA==","fsize":474478,"resto":123275954,"id":"ZAqYbeGO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123277567,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:31:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123275954\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123275954<\/a><br>Soros diverted his funds to US Antifa for the time being.

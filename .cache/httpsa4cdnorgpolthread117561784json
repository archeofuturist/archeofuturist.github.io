The man, who has been named as Ziyed Ben Belgacem, is seen struggling with a soldier for more than a minute before help arrives. Belgacem, a 39-year-old French citizen, held an air pistol to the soldier&#039;s head and used her as a shield. Police believe he intended to use the soldier\u2019s weapon to shoot members of the public. The soldier\u2019s colleague intervened and fired three bursts, shooting Belgacem dead.","filename":"20170321001300822738-original","ext":".jpg","w":704,"h":396,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490057503297,"time":1490057503,"md5":"4b4rRU83Ay9SCrM7dWeHIQ==","fsize":40208,"resto":0,"id":"emu\/Ar0G","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"orly-airport-muslim-terror-attack-footage","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

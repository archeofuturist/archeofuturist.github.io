This is due to their ferocity and the way they hang off their victims using their mandibles, and also due to the jumping behaviour. It has been classified 9 times mostly because ant experts simply cannot even. Size varies widely, ranging from 8 to 40 millimetres in length and the large compound eyes provide excellent vision. Like most ants, the female has wings and can reach speeds of up to 30km\/h. When alarmed some species will emit a pheromone alarm while others will attack in a swarm. The larvae of these ants are carnivorous, when no food is available they will cannibalize each other. These ants are known to invade the nests of huntsman spiders and fill them with twigs and other debris, rendering them useless. This scorched earth tactic is used to drive the spiders out of the area. This prevents competition for prey to feed the larvae. It is also known to literally enslave other ant species, mainly the Australian Spider ant. The bull ant deters many predators with its sting, which I can personally assure you feels like a bad burn. The stinger on this ant is not barbed which means it may continually sting without causing harm to itself. The bull ant is the deadliest ant on Earth and is responsible for many documented human fatalities, usually within 20 minutes of being swarmed. The median lethal dose of venom is 0.18\u20130.35 mg\/kg, this is one of the most toxic venom in the insect world. The ant was mentioned in Arthur Schopenhauer&#039;s The World as Will and Representation &quot;But the bulldog-ant of Australia affords us the most extraordinary example of this kind; for if it is cut in two, a battle begins between the head and the tail. The head seizes the tail in its teeth, and the tail defends itself bravely by stinging the head: the battle may last for half an hour, until they die or are dragged away by other ants. This contest takes place every time the experiment is tried.&quot;","filename":"Australian bull ant","ext":".png","w":1267,"h":682,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":67,"tim":1491718757335,"time":1491718757,"md5":"rC2HE+GQmkCXHka30KxTKg==","fsize":687367,"resto":120242526,"id":"Owgyu6II","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120249328,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:21:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120249119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120249119<\/a><br><br>what? this is were i draw the line? a fucking easily avoided insect? k den.

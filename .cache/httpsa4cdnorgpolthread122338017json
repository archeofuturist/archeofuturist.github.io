The chances of yours or mine to be correct is 1 in 3000. <br>And i do not have a problem with that fact, what so ever. <br>But when someone religious talks about his religion he doesnt say, well yeah i do have a chance of 1 in a 3000 to be correct but i do believe in this and others can believe in other things too.<br>I am an atheist *tips* but i am not against religion. I am against religion being stated as fact. When its purely belief and so is atheism. Its all belief, belief needs no proof of ANY sort, to believe you simply need to hear of the idea and thats it. And thats what i try to say whenever i see these religion threads, they are nonsense.","time":1492914395,"resto":122338017,"id":"ZeKty+PS","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":122365401,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:26:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"Atheists have a living breathing god that they worship: the kike.<br><br>They will never speak against their mentors.<br><br>Atheists are detrimental to society, they should be shot","filename":"tenor","ext":".gif","w":498,"h":199,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":49,"tim":1492914397169,"time":1492914397,"md5":"+0JaFzyP+QkppKlCw+EQUw==","fsize":847506,"resto":122338017,"id":"gMO3+FIm","country":"DO","country_name":"Dominican Republic"},{"no":122365558,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:27:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122365394\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122365394<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes but how does people believing in the holy trinity make a whole country different?<\/span><br><br>Because they follow the moral stories as well (some believe in them more than others obviously, but they all have a &quot;be a good person&quot; message).","time":1492914477,"resto":122338017,"id":"\/AQoQtFy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122365624,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:28:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122365401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122365401<\/a><br>christianity is crypto kikery<br><br>jesus was a fucking kike","time":1492914505,"resto":122338017,"id":"jQNqNWIL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122365690,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:28:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122365147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122365147<\/a><br>If theres a religion and they describe super powerful beings as gods, they are going to be classified as gods.","time":1492914536,"resto":122338017,"id":"ZeKty+PS","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":122365774,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:29:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"There arent 3000 gods.

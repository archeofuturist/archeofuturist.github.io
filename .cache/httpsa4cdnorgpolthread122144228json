They straight up ignore that they&#039;re the only people on the planet who give a flying fuck about &quot;progressive values&quot; and are convinced when they see minorities pay lip service to them that they really mean it.

They&#039;ll be right when the consensus is right and wrong when the consensus is wrong. Antisocial people, on the other hand, will have the opposite problem; when the consensus is right, they&#039;ll miss out because they&#039;re disconnected from it, but they also won&#039;t be horribly misled by it when it goes wrong.","time":1492788600,"resto":122144228,"id":"5IYLqDO8","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122147585,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)11:30:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122147427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122147427<\/a><br>I have no idea what you mean, but I am not inclined to listen to you","time":1492788619,"resto":122144228,"id":"cRRfoaaE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122147600,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)11:30:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122144228\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122144228<\/a><br>In highschool I was a pretty little guy.

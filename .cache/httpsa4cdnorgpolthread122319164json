Intelligent machines will make better decisions with large data sets than large numbers of humans. This will mitigate the negative effects of stupid demographic changes. Additionally, genetic engineering will become cheap and widespread, and nearly everybody will become intelligent and high-quality, isomorphic to high quality whites and the society they would create, thus solving the problem of incapable and crappy human population groups.<br><br>As much as \/pol\/ wants to complain about the future, don&#039;t worry, it&#039;s headed in an authoritarian, quasi-fascist direction due to these technological advances, and will be better for it, and that&#039;s a good thing.","filename":"KatyPerry1","ext":".jpg","w":1997,"h":3000,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492890982450,"time":1492890982,"md5":"KcKRQ8lqJcULMG+MCU3qDQ==","fsize":505095,"resto":0,"id":"vAC8iZ7w","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fascism-is-inevitable","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122321821,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)16:19:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122319164\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122319164<\/a><br>Not exactly. There is no such thing as AI. It&#039;s another fake dr Evil concept similar to global WAR-ming, astrology, horoscopes, etc... So they are not exactly doing anything with AI, just spilling their rainbow way of life out of tar budgets into open society. Of course they are using unfair advantage of fairs, carnivals, bread and circuses. They are holocausting straight people as part of path paved with evolution theory. So only strong pervertariat supposed to survive rainbow pogrom killing fields.

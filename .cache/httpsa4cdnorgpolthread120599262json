Taking a moment away from housework to bitch about teenagers. <br><br>We&#039;re currently undergoing a huge administrative change in our school. Some of the changes are good, some are very bad. But part of the shift is that our scores are terrible. We&#039;re in the bottom 1\/3 of schools in the state, our literacy scores are abysmal, and many of our sophomores (15-16) still haven&#039;t mastered Algebra. <br><br>Here&#039;s the thing, though. Instead of a radical shift in how we teach, the types of students we accept, or a simple reallocation of funding, the new admin has decided to ramp up the services we provide and hold teachers even more accountable than we already are..<br><br>As a teacher of 8 years who doesn&#039;t even break $60k, I work like a dog to educate my classes, advise clubs, mentor kids, and perform all the duties or extra duties of my profession. It&#039;s my passion project, I suppose.<br><br>But consistently and without fail, I receive weaker and weaker students, year after year. I keep my bar set high and rarely alter the level of my content, but I have had to reteach very basic skills students should have by their teen years. Things like writing an essay longer than 1 page, long division, graphing, reading for pleasure, handling money, or even academic discourse are all skills lost on modern American youths.<br><br>I sound like a grandpa, I know. &quot;Kids were always this way,&quot; you&#039;ll say. But this feels so different to me. This can&#039;t be the same thing as when I was in school. It just can&#039;t. My teachers complained, but it was on a whole different level.<br><br>The other week, we had a boy fall from the bleachers and nearly crack his back. He was carried out on a stretcher. And what was his first concern? He had to post the story on Snapchat. He was more scared of his PHONE breaking than him being injured. I watched as he was being carried out. The boy was crying for his friends to toss him his phone so he could take pictures of his accident and &quot;snap&quot; it.","filename":"1355832499066","ext":".jpg","w":556,"h":501,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":225,"tim":1491918376093,"time":1491918376,"md5":"LmfxdA1w+k+gSuNF37QsbQ==","fsize":74769,"resto":0,"id":"9CTe\/Px8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"american-public-school-teacher-on-spring-break","country_name":"United States","replies":40,"images":2,"unique_ips":30},{"no":120599317,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)09:46:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120599262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120599262<\/a><br>Instead of buying us better technology, new textbooks, compensating teachers fairly for labor, or maybe throwing back in programs like music and art.... our school offers the following to families and students, entirely at our own cost:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;free dental care on site<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;free healthcare on site<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;free therapy on site<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;free counseling on site<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;free job skills assistance on site (we even make the calls to get interviews for you)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;more Special Ed staff than Math teachers<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;multiple ELL\/ESL classes offered all times of day<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;free daycare<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;free financial advising<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cheap (or free if you&#039;re that poor) night school f<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;free or reduced price meals for kids<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;free breakfast for all students<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;free homework groups every day after school with 1\/3 of our faculty there to &quot;coach your child&quot; (aka do their homework for them or at the very least yell at them because you won&#039;t)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;free city bus passes<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;school buses that run as early as 6am or as late as 5pm for working families who can&#039;t provide transportation themselves<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a full-access automotive shop for families to have their cars worked on by our students<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a full-access restaurant and cafe for families to get cheap meals cooked by our students<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;perks and preferences for parent who work for our school as custodians, secretaries, etc.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;free hair styling and makeup for parents done by our students<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;several fully funded community events that give off raffle prizes, free dinners, canned goods, clothing, toys, etc.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a free laptop (to keep) for every student<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dozens of scholarships just waiting and available for any student or family &quot;in need&quot; (basically any student who isn&#039;t a white male can get a free or cheap ride to college off our school)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;free Internet or library access to any family member of a student<\/span><br><br>There&#039;s probably more, but these are the ones I could remember.","time":1491918406,"resto":120599262,"id":"9CTe\/Px8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120599349,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)09:47:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120599317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120599317<\/a><br>I also want to add that our new administration has started using the ancient two-way intercoms in every classroom to randomly &quot;buzz&quot; a class and listen in.

I&#039;m enjoying this thread so far.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What do you think is the main cause for the stupidity?<\/span><br>The families. Nobody values education anymore. The people who value education send their kids anywhere BUT a public school. For the rest of them, public school is just a necessary evil. Drop your kid off for babysitting, then complain when they get bad reports and blame it on the school. Lather, rinse, repeat.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is it the younger education?<\/span><br>A lot of elementary ed is now focused on &quot;feelings&quot; and &quot;teamwork.&quot; So, yes. I remember doing math drills in 3rd grade, doing research papers in 4th, and teaching my peers lessons in 5th. Nobody does that anymore. It&#039;s become &quot;one size fits all, and that size is an IQ of 70.&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Parents suck?<\/span><br>Already addressed this. But you would not believe how many parents yell at me or the school when their kid fucks up. We had a boy failing EVERYTHING. Literally. And the mom called the teachers, counselors, admin, and then the superintendent to pass the blame. Now we&#039;re getting sued by the family for &quot;failing the kid.&quot; I wish I could make this up. The boy doesn&#039;t complete assignments, turns in half-finished essays and whatnot... But it&#039;s OUR fault as a school that he has 40%&#039;s in all of his courses? Even with a documented paper trail that we called home and sent letters? Ridiculous.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Common Core?<\/span><br>I don&#039;t really see it much yet. Still teaching 2000&#039;s babies. BUT I actually like some of the new standards, to be honest. Streamlines shit much easier for me. Plus they&#039;re a lot broader, so it&#039;s simpler to go &quot;off tangent&quot; and teach things that I haven&#039;t taught before.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Technology?<\/span><br>THIS. THIS is the biggest fuck up (besides parents). If you take a teenagers phone, it&#039;s like cutting off their arm and slapping them with it. A lot of my students don&#039;t even know how to use emails they&#039;re such phone addicts.","time":1491919951,"resto":120599262,"id":"9CTe\/Px8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120602151,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:13:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120599262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120599262<\/a><br>Teach in a private school.

The normal kids, the bright kids who actually want to learn? They&#039;re fucked. The retards are now integrated into the normal classroom setting. In any given class she would have between 1-5 special needs kids. Occasionally they had a wrangler with them but more often than not the onus was on my Mom to deal with them and help them.

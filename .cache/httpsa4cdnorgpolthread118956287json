S. phenomenon, it doesn\u2019t really exist anywhere else \u2014 a little bit in England \u2014 permits a very high level of authority and domination but in the hands of private power: so private power should be unleashed to do whatever it likes. The assumption is that by some kind of magic, concentrated private power will lead to a more free and just society. Actually that has been believed in the past. Adam Smith for example, one of his main arguments for markets was the claim that under conditions of perfect liberty, markets would lead to perfect equality. Well, we don\u2019t have to talk about that! That kind of \u2014<br><br>Wilson: It seems to be a continuing contention today \u2026<br><br>Chomsky: Yes, and so well that kind of libertarianism, in my view, in the current world, is just a call for some of the worst kinds of tyranny, namely unaccountable private tyranny. Anarchism is quite different from that. It calls for an elimination to tyranny, all kinds of tyranny. Including the kind of tyranny that\u2019s internal to private power concentrations. So why should we prefer it? Well I think because freedom is better than subordination. It\u2019s better to be free than to be a slave. It&#039;s better to be able to make your own decisions than to have someone else make decisions and force you to observe them. I mean, I don\u2019t think you really need an argument for that. It seems like \u2026 transparent.","filename":"noam-chomsky","ext":".jpg","w":465,"h":309,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490901945757,"time":1490901945,"md5":"JigenglvJNlYNkFrPJwtFQ==","fsize":55069,"resto":0,"id":"zjC0DlFf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"chomsky-well-whats-called-libertarian-in-the","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":118956558,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)15:28:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;the market forces you to do anything<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh equality <\/span><br>Trashed","time":1490902091,"resto":118956287,"id":"Yu3g8oa\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118956744,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)15:29:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;HURR BLAME TRUMP IF THERE&#039;S A TERRORIST ATTACK DURR<\/span>","filename":"Capture","ext":".png","w":794,"h":867,"tn_w":114,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490902193542,"time":1490902193,"md5":"D3E66a7ZtFFaDSKLAZ9Wqw==","fsize":1212850,"resto":118956287,"id":"P5PwPRHK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118956977,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)15:31:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118956287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118956287<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;which is a special U.

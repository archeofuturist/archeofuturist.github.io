Rand could have never won in the climate of 2016. Libertarians (real ones, not carbon tax fags like Johnson) will never get the votes of Boomers who demand infinite gibs. This alone was the reason he could have never won. We need to show people that a someone from the right could not only destroy the line that divides the parties but also be strong on just about every issue to the point of dangerous authoritarianism. Trump is not the end product unless you&#039;re a fucking idiot. Trump is here to destroy the Left, destroy the media, and destroy our weaknesses. After people finally see the dangers of limitless central power, they&#039;ll turn to Rand just as the Boomers die off enough to lose their anchoring in US politics.<br><br>It&#039;s Rand in 2020 or 2024. &quot;Memeing&quot; him in this time was a fool&#039;s mission.

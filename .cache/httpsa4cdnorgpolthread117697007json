I&#039;m conducting a experiment for my political science class and I&#039;ve decided to use both \/b\/ and \/pol\/ to conduct said experiment <br><br>The rules are as follows:<br>1: Establish a political commentary thread, talk about anything related to politics<br>2: There is little moderation, say as you please<br>3: if there is a argument, there will be no stopping it. It will continue until it dies out.<br>4: If you present a fact, I would like a link to the source where you got said fact.<br><br>Go ahead. I&#039;ll post the results after my paper is done.<br><br>Will be posted on \/b\/ as well.","filename":"Screenshot_20170314-110921","ext":".jpg","w":1403,"h":1256,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":223,"tim":1490144349984,"time":1490144349,"md5":"in06axMg\/xGUhXKM1knBkg==","fsize":189492,"resto":0,"id":"NmW8laZj","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hello-pol-im-conducting-a-experiment-for-my","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":117699834,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)21:23:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117697007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117697007<\/a><br>I have a theory.<br><br>Marx believed in the thesis and antithesis coming together to form the synthesis, yet for some reason he stops applying this logic when communism is involved.

They were talking about muh genderism and how getting blue for boys and pink for girls destroyed society somehow.<br><br>Their point wasn&#039;t so bad, they biological sex was a thing but had little to no impact on personality and how you should act in society. Pretty much saying gender is ok when you&#039;re talking about dicks and vaginas but completly arbitrary when you&#039;re talking about liking toy guns or wearing high heels.<br><br>But just after that, they started talking about transgenders and how a man can be born with the brain of a woman.<br><br>Wait what ? You just SAID there&#039;s no real difference beyong genitals and man or woman behaviors are LEARNED and arbitrary. So how can you be born with the &quot;wrong&quot; brain ? By your very definition, transgenders are the WORST genderists because they cling to the traditional gender separation, just picking the opposite one. Transgenders try to look the other gender, assuming there IS a traditionnal look, taste, way of doing things for a gender. If anything, anti-CIS should HATE transgenders because they are the one saying a &quot;woman&quot; should wear a dress, long hairs, make-up etc... and a &quot;man&quot; should have muscles, strong attitude and wear pants.<br><br>Why can&#039;t they see that ? Why am I the bad guy for pointing that out ? Why did I burn my risotto ?","filename":"transgender-woman2c-taylor-data","ext":".jpg","w":940,"h":615,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":163,"tim":1493313700865,"time":1493313700,"md5":"DZiX+rhzpyYWmBq3kM8BCQ==","fsize":143903,"resto":0,"id":"URJmrmDF","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"yesterday-i-made-a-mistake-and-choosed-to-listen","country_name":"France","replies":47,"images":5,"unique_ips":26},{"no":123060014,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)13:24:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123059661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123059661<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes I cook, it&#039;s manly, fuck off<\/span><br>Threre&#039;s nothing wrong with cooking, but if there are women present you need to force them to cook.

As a result, people who are not scientific choose to ignore it\/suppress discussion about it even though it is obvious evidence against the &quot;male born in a female&#039;s body&quot; idea.","time":1493316843,"resto":123059661,"id":"TAw2rFag","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123066312,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)14:16:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123063787\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123063787<\/a><br>He&#039;s never watched GBBO","filename":"Paul-Hollywood-on-the-The-Jonathan-Ross-Show","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":630,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1493317009973,"time":1493317009,"md5":"MuUDrRcmgNWAyj0dwmmSCw==","fsize":75770,"resto":123059661,"id":"4ISpq6At","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123066617,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)14:19:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;By your very definition, transgenders are the WORST genderists<\/span><br><br>We are.

So it&#039;s actually important to teach kids gender roles so they can know their place in society and what their duties and responsibilities are. Having an entirely freeform society is nothing but a recipe for chaos which is exactly what we&#039;re seeing nowadays, when men are no longer men and women are no longer women because nothing apparently differentiates the two in the eyes of certain radicals, and that political opinion is being codified into law. It&#039;s entirely fucked up and it&#039;s going to be our undoing. Identity is an important thing; fucking with it or not giving the kids an identity at all is as close as you can get to child abuse without striking your kid. I know some of this by personal experience; I was raised as an expat kid and have no feelings of nationality or culture, especially since I&#039;m an American mutt, and it&#039;s had a negative impact on my psyche.

If all &quot;gendered&quot; behaviour is learned and arbitrary, then a. there should be no reason why trangenderism should exist as there are no set, defined characteristics between men and women and b. transgenderism should not exist because male and female brains shouldn&#039;t exist, according to their dogma.

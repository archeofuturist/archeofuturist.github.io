I know Mickey is very anti-marijuana, but I personally think it would be stupid on Trump&#039;s part, especially since he won Florida and Marijuana legalization also won there. If he fucks with marijuana he will probably kiss Colorado and Florida both goodbye as states that could swing for him in 2020.<br><br>Is marijuana in jeopardy?<br><br>Also thoughts on Mickey Mouse? I don&#039;t like him, he sounds way too deep south, he talks like he has a mouth full of grits and his family tree is full of marriages to cousins. I wish Trump had picked someone like Rudy instead. I think rudy is smarter as well.","filename":"jeff-sessions","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":359,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493700595306,"time":1493700595,"md5":"ERof8cIJsqIoiy24FlvopQ==","fsize":41343,"resto":0,"id":"EM1PvCJg","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"will-states-that-have-legalized-medical-marijuana","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

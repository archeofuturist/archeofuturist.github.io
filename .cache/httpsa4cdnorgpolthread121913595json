I noticed that on the \/pol\/ thread (and one in \/g\/ which has since been archived) about this leak that before it reached maximum posts many people were having problems getting fb.py to load. I am but a simple Kekistani meme farmer, but I felt the calling to come up with a fix that would work for everyone using windows. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;First download and then install this version of Python<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.python.org\/download\/rel<wbr>eases\/2.6.6\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Then download and install (as administrator) this version of pywin<\/span><br>https:\/\/sourceforge.net\/projects\/py<wbr>win32\/files\/pywin32\/Build%20221\/pyw<wbr>in32-221.win32-py2.6.exe\/download<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now go into system settings\/environmental variables and add the line C:\\Python26<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Download the leaked toolkit and unzip it to a folder on your C:\\<\/span><br>https:\/\/github.com\/x0rz\/EQGRP_Lost_<wbr>in_Translation<br><br>Now this is the part where people are getting the listeningposts error, and how to fix that! <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Make a folder in the same folder that contains fb.py named listeningposts NOT listeningspost as a couple other tutorials said.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Last part and very important. Right click the file in the fb.py folder called fuzzbunch.xml and click edit. Go down several lines to where it says ResourcesDir and LogDir and next to default set the appropriate directory paths. I know there is no log folder in the folder which contains fb.py, but just make that path as if there was. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now to run the program just navigate in cmd to the folder that holds fb.py and simply type fb.py.<\/span><br><br>All done!<br>Praise Kek!","filename":"meme_wizard[1]","ext":".jpg","w":410,"h":410,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492643650881,"time":1492643650,"md5":"9rI1\/9gO4xOSYC+QDvPEhg==","fsize":21361,"resto":0,"id":"9v2ohbo4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"blessed-be-he-who-keks","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

We could just literally cover them and their land with pig shit and literally force them to give it up. Would this constitute a chemical weapon or is it fair game?<br><br>TL;DR: Muslims don&#039;t like pigs and we have lots and lots of pig shit. Should we drop it on em?","filename":"pigshitlake","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":305,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":127,"tim":1493230825636,"time":1493230825,"md5":"U1eadTo6l+MhdRl3zweRxQ==","fsize":13587,"resto":0,"id":"Zbf3VwMi","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-dont-we-weaponize-pig-shit-for-use-against","country_name":"Canada","replies":9,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122917287,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:23:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is it still considered exporting democracy?","time":1493231004,"resto":122916916,"id":"xxuid4rq","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":122917325,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:23:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122916916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122916916<\/a><br>that&#039;s quite brilliant OP...","time":1493231025,"resto":122916916,"id":"+BL0z9Ec","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":122917630,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:26:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122916916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122916916<\/a><br>that might be too extreme unless we are in a world war situation. that is like salting the earth because everone would get sick.","time":1493231164,"resto":122916916,"id":"nofuqSTN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122917739,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:26:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122917325\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122917325<\/a><br><br>I thought so too but the only problem I can see with it right now is that it might be considered a chemical weapon...

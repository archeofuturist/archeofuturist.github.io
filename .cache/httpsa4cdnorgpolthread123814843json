Its the influx if normies from GG, the nudes leaks, and the 2015 election. They have been among us for quite some time now. They conformed with some of our opinions and out jokes, but now that we have changed our opinions and jokes, they don&#039;t want to. They&#039;re kids. Look at the HWNDU streams. They are kids. And they aren&#039;t white either. They don&#039;t have something we have. Something thats been fucking drilled into brains. Skepticism. Skepticism in any sort of establishment. Even if you have an authoritarian philosophy (I do), you have that populist sentiment inside you. We know that throughout history, fulling pledging yourself to one person with power is usually never a good idea. Once you put a person on a pedestal as &quot;God-Emperor&quot; it never ends up alright. Being a skeptic of everything is the philosophy of \/pol\/. Its a good kind of contrarianism. We will never go with popular political sentiment and we never will. Because never once have I thought this board would unironically shill for Israel. The term &quot;bait&quot; and JIDF shill was used to point out any bait. And the whole board was aware it was bait. And now we have a board full of idiots who fall for every bait thread and post and think there is some vast conspiracy of paid shills on a fucking chan site. And don&#039;t get me wrong, I think shills exist. Its just that nobody is that nobody should be ignorant enough to think that somebody simply saying &quot;drumpf btfo, vote for hillary&quot; is a paid shill. If you really think an organization is funded by Soros, DNC, etc, they are going to be more discreet than that. And no, screenshots of text cannot be &quot;proof&quot; of paid shills. Literally anyone can just edit an image. \/pol\/ was about being open minded to political ideas. Now its close minded idiots who heretically praise &quot;le froge god&quot; and &quot;muh gud emporer.&quot;","filename":"4L_Oa4Twa4k","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":432,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":168,"tim":1493756957573,"time":1493756957,"md5":"9eqbSiAq33qFQlA6EFLqmA==","fsize":49173,"resto":0,"id":"KWVG1vck","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-problem-isnt-reddit-its-not-the-td-its-the","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

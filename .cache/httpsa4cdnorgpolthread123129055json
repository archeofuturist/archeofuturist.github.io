Very few americans (south and north). Some are starting to show up during the later part but mostly fags (also) posting from work\/phone. Some west coast late-nighters shitposting high or drunk, but that&#039;s about it. Mostly eurofags posting about non issues.<br><br>4 pm - 8 pm: <br><br>Plenty of americans, but they&#039;re still not worked up. Usually light banter + some more high energy stuff. They tend to mostly pick up world news since their own cycle hasn&#039;t really begun.<br><br>8 pm - midnight: Getting a bit heated. This is the sweet spot. The faggiest euros are now gone, and the north americans are going at it, getting worked up.<br><br>midnight - 10 am: Unbearable. Tons of fully worked up americans - especially U.S. ones. 50% of the posts is calling people faggots, the other 50% is calling people niggers. This mixed with weird porn.","filename":"redeem-the-time","ext":".jpg","w":1576,"h":1182,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493345438081,"time":1493345438,"md5":"txun5qZBgJvfRyH\/VPF38Q==","fsize":210557,"resto":0,"id":"Ok88PDPg","country":"SE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"best-time-to-be-on-pol","country_name":"Sweden","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

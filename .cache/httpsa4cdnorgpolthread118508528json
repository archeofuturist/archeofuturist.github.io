And when they say &quot;white people&quot; they include some middle easterners and hispanics in it.<br>White IQ is about 100, Mexican IQ is about 88. The USA will inevitably become a third world country.<br>France (also called as Frankistan now) lost 4 IQ points in ten years with all the third world invasion. A loss of 4 IQ point in 10 years is huge.<br>The end of the white supremacy in the world is going to happen. Demography is destiny.<br><br>Meanwhile China is the most populated country in the world.<br>Unlike the USA who is a young unexperimented country, they are one of the oldest civilizations in the world.<br>Chinese have one of the most highest IQ in the world (105).<br>They are very ethnocentric, they only care about their own people, they are not altruistic and empathic like white people.<br>They know the racial differences and they study on that (Beijing Genomic Institute). They even openly develop the first genetically enhanced &#039;superhumans&#039;: http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/sciencet<wbr>ech\/article-3721991\/China-develop-g<wbr>enetically-enhanced-superhumans-exp<wbr>erts-predict.html#ixzz4cWn5iokk <br>Their country is quite homogeneous. They are not destroyed by leftism or &quot;human rights&quot;, they do whatever they want with an authoritarian government.<br>They have the most numerous billionaire people in the world.<br>Their army is the largest military in the world and with modernization programs and the fall America, they won&#039;t be under the USA for the next decades.<br>They are already colonizing Africa and unlike white people they just want to steal everything from Africans. Like I said, no empathy.<br><br>Once white countries will be a mix of Brazil and Syria-tier, they will come for us.

That&#039;s last 28 years. Longer than Lukashenko for that matter. <br>No one in West however gives a fuck about his semi-dictatorial regime because he follows what Americans tell him. <br><br>So why is this non-country joining NATO? Simply to close off Balkans and isolate Serbia. Serbia will be forced to join next. <br>Their government is also Western-sponsored, but population is a bit harder to convince. <br><br>Friendly reminder that you have all been had, and Trump is nothing but a sham and continuation of neocon swinery.","filename":"s3.reutersmedia.net","ext":".jpg","w":763,"h":468,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":153,"tim":1490302664941,"time":1490302664,"md5":"KyVPuBhtdwaN\/sCi9CqIvQ==","fsize":35698,"resto":0,"id":"Cnz4gxXT","country":"ME","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"tillerson-urges-senate-ratification-of","country_name":"Montenegro","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":7},{"no":117984719,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)17:16:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump.

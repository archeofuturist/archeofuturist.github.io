Fostering is short term and you can cut it off if it doesn&#039;t work out. It&#039;ll give you a good idea for how an adoption would work for your family before committing. We&#039;re about 1 week away from getting our foster license.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We&#039;re genetically programmed to want to pass on our genes, but there are so damn many unwanted children, and among them is at least one that you&#039;ll relate to. It&#039;s a chance to take something that was discarded and give it a shot at greatness.<\/span><br><br>Not to scare you, but you see, I&#039;m not only a cop but one who tends to three schools on a full time basis.<br><br>Foster, adopt...fine. Someone has to do it.<br><br>Just buckle up.<br><br>My wife&#039;s friend is fostering. She brought some niglets in tow to my kid&#039;s birthday party.<br><br>They seem fine at a really young age. But then I noticed what looked like a small tattoo on one of the two year olds. Wtf. What kind of hell hole was she plucked from? And how much damage was done in her short life?<br><br>Who the fuck knows what kind of unfixable shit has happened to these kids during their formative years. They don&#039;t come away unscathed.<br><br>Problems with impulse control, stress tolerance, etc. And the earlier their abuse neglect happens the less fixable it is.<br><br>It looks good on paper to rescue a kid (and it is), but just realize it&#039;s not going to be about you, and you cannot neccessarily pin your standards to this genetic\/developmental stranger.<br><br>Truth is, they are not going to express their gratitude to you. Fellow adults will, while your harmless looking 3 year old daughter grows up to be a bisexual camwhore junkie. Some complete goddamn anomaly compared to everyone related to you.","time":1493321351,"resto":123059071,"id":"TCJcm3lU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123074970,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)15:29:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123059071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123059071<\/a><br><br>She&#039;s aging nicely.","time":1493321369,"resto":123059071,"id":"U141samn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123074981,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)15:29:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123073397\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123073397<\/a><br>It&#039;s not shallow to want to remain sexually attracted to your wife.<br><br>I already stated that I&#039;d stick with her through anything.

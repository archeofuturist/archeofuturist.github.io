Do people even understand how fucking broad of a term the word &quot;jazz&quot; is? Someone mentioned earlier that all chord progressions are cliche and then someone replied that some are more cliche than others. These are true statements. You see, people who tend to like modern jazz and any type of jazz fusion are typically tired of hearing the same old cliche progressions played in every fucking song on the pop charts. It gets old. Some people can live their whole lives and be okay with hearing these simple combinations of I-vi-IV-V over and over and over again, and some can&#039;t stand it. That&#039;s the difference between people who like &quot;jazz&quot; and people who dont. It has nothing to do with being pretentious and everything to do with disliking monotony. Sure there&#039;s pretentious jazz fags but there&#039;s pretentious followings of every genre.

Do people even understand how fucking broad of a term the word &quot;jazz&quot; is? Someone mentioned earlier that all chord progressions are cliche and then someone replied that some are more cliche than others. These are true statements. You see, people who tend to like modern jazz and any type of jazz fusion are typically tired of hearing the same old cliche progressions played in every fucking song on the pop charts. It gets old. Some people can live their whole lives and be okay with hearing these simple combinations of I-vi-IV-V over and over and over again, and some can&#039;t stand it. That&#039;s the difference between people who like &quot;jazz&quot; and people who dont. It has nothing to do with being pretentious and everything to do with disliking monotony. Sure there&#039;s pretentious jazz fags but there&#039;s pretentious followings of every genre.

Evans asked him who his favorite contemporary musician was and McCartney said &quot;Billy Joel&quot;. A groan went up in unison from the entire pseudo-hip studio audience as loud as the laughter that went up on Bill Maher the night Anne Coulter said Trump was the candidate most likely to win the presidency. But McCartney kept his dignity even better than Coulter did. He gave Evans and the audience a look that said &quot;I was in the band that altered the entire structure of popular music, and I was the best of them, so imagine how many shits I need to give about your opinion of what it&#039;s cool to like.&quot;<br>I think it&#039;s an acid test of a red-pilled mentality, by the way, to be aware that McCartney WAS the &#039;best Beatle&#039;.

But if dismissing the whole band as a Jew-controlled irrelevance is not an option, then seeing who goes for Lennon and who for McCartney is a sure way to separate the men from the cucks and Cultural Marxists every time. One of our most combative and incisive conservative cultural analysts here in France, Alain Finkielkraut, said the first conservative position he ever took was risking ostracism by his Lennon-worshipping 68er friends by saying that McCartney was his preferred Beatle.","time":1492715459,"resto":122006906,"id":"04Tqhw1o","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122028368,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)15:11:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122027224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122027224<\/a><br>b\/c it&#039;s their mythic-psychological foundation.

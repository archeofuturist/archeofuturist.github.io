We are constructed to follow any mental holding pattern presented to us in education and media. All of it including this site and national socialism is complete bullshit. There is no one entity to fix the nation. Only personalities of cohesion exist. <br><br>The reality of this world is that few people even here understand their own feelings, are not in coping mode and can be authentic in their actions. For example: a child raised saying he will go to hell for premarital sex. This fucks the kid up into adulthood. It squelched and stifled his opinions and everything since then is just formulating more bullshit from an already nonexistent point. In this instance we can see clearly how it affects the psyche. <br><br>Feminism for the first time ever is trying to derail this mental holding pattern by completely eradicating the use of outlandish idealism. We are human, you can aspire to be great but if you are moulded from a false base, you are stifled. Spiritually, physically and mentally.

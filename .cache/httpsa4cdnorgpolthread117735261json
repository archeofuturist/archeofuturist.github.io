They were usually shot in the Alps, the Black Forest, or the L\u00fcneburg Heath and always involved the outdoors. These films were noted for their rural settings, sentimental tone and simplistic morality, and centered on love, friendship, family and non-urban life. Also, the polarity between old and young, tradition and progress, and rural and urban life was articulated. The typical plot structure involved both a &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; guy wanting a girl, conflict ensuing, and the &quot;good&quot; guy ultimately triumphing to win the girl to the happiness of everyone and the children.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Heimat is a German word that can be translated as home, homeland, home soil or fatherland (each having a different

They were usually shot in the Alps, the Black Forest, or the L\u00fcneburg Heath and always involved the outdoors. These films were noted for their rural settings, sentimental tone and simplistic morality, and centered on love, friendship, family and non-urban life. Also, the polarity between old and young, tradition and progress, and rural and urban life was articulated. The typical plot structure involved both a &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; guy wanting a girl, conflict ensuing, and the &quot;good&quot; guy ultimately triumphing to win the girl to the happiness of everyone and the children.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Heimat is a German word that can be translated as home, homeland, home soil or fatherland (each having a different emphasis and connotation).<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Heima<wbr>tfilm","time":1490170338,"resto":117735261,"id":"vACcaDRj","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117737713,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:12:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117737372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117737372<\/a><br>Haneke is quite popular in Europe and I agree that his movies are anti-Western (die Weisse Fahne, Cach\u00e9, the Pianist, etc.)","time":1490170373,"resto":117735261,"id":"t5mBF7gb","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":117737749,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:13:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117735261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117735261<\/a><br>KUBRICK","time":1490170407,"resto":117735261,"id":"KhdF9ODi","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":117737754,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:13:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117737680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117737680<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Piano Teacher (film)<\/span><br>About some perverted shit, that Freud would have a field day over.","time":1490170410,"resto":117735261,"id":"vACcaDRj","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117737844,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:14:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;watch 71 Fragments<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the most spiritually alive and pragmatic character is a refugee child<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the most despicable character is a young white male<\/span>","time":1490170493,"resto":117735261,"id":"nfyHbtPr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Many people can be controlled by guilt. The agents begin relationships with activists behind a well-developed mask of &quot;dedication to the cause.&quot; Because of their often declared dedication, (and actions designed to prove this), when they criticize the activist, he or she - being truly dedicated to the movement - becomes convinced that somehow, any issues are THEIR fault. This is because a truly dedicated person tends to believe that everyone has a conscience and that nobody would dissimulate and lie like that &quot;on purpose.&quot; It&#039;s amazing how far agents can go in manipulating an activist because the activist will constantly make excuses for the agent who regularly declares their dedication to the cause. Even if they do, occasionally, suspect the agent, they will pull the wool over their own eyes by rationalizing: &quot;they did that unconsciously... they didn&#039;t really mean it... I can help them by being forgiving and accepting &quot; and so on and so forth.","time":1491616202,"resto":120064600,"id":"UY0ZpxPv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120065910,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)21:50:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120064600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120064600<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;yes goy, keep supporting (((trump))) how dare you question what he does i bet you wont even strap up your boots and fight a (((war))) for him<\/span>","time":1491616249,"resto":120064600,"id":"QERBZLfG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

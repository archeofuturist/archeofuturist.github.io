You will need a lot of money. They aren&#039;t interested in selling you a bullshit amount of bad debt, and the more bad debt you buy, the cheaper it gets.<br><br>The idea is you buy, say, $1,000,000 worth of bad debt for $100,000. You then own the debt and are allowed to try and collect it. You make deals with the debtors, like if you pay me 30% of what you owe, we&#039;ll close the account. So you make 3x the money you spent on the debt.<br><br>Healthcare debt works similarly, but there are A LOT more rules.<br><br>Most debt is sold in the forms of bonds. Bonds have different ratings, starting at AAA (the best) down to D (the worst - you&#039;ve lost your money at this point).<br><br>When you buy a U.S. Treasury Bond, for example, you&#039;re buying a pice of debt from the United States. They then promise to repay you the amount of debt you purchased plus interest.<br><br>Of course treasury bonds are very slow growth, boring, but safe investments, historically speaking.<br><br>So you want a bond with some volatility. You probably want to aim in the BB to B range. Cheap to buy, decent chance of a good payoff.<br><br>But seriously stay the fuck out of the bond market if you don&#039;t even understand different types of debt.

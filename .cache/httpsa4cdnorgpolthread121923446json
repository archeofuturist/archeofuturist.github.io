As the price of oil increased so did the price if gasoline and we were paying prices for gasoline that had never been seen before. This caused people who couldn&#039;t afford it to simply fill up and drive off without paying. It was a nation wide epidemic and soon every gas station made you prepay if you were using cash.","time":1492649028,"resto":121923446,"id":"NPfqda3b","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121926316,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)20:54:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121923446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121923446<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;niggers<\/span><br>of course that&#039;s part of it, it always is<br><br>Despite popular wisdom, gas stations on avg. only make about 5 cents\/gallon profit per gallon. It&#039;s incredibly competitive market. It&#039;s the only product that&#039;s price becomes a topic of daily discussion, its the only product that&#039;s price is openly displayed like it is, it&#039;s the only product nearly everyone buys in public on a regular basis. It&#039;s why oil companies own a fraction of gas stations compared to years ago.

Gas stations only make money off overpriced impulse shit inside.

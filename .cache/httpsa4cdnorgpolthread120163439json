Now I am being called a shill and a newfag by Trump supporters who came to post here during the primaries for calling him out on the Syrian strike.<br><br>Why are most of you Trump fags so thick headed, and why can&#039;t you admit he fucked up? The whole reason I voted for him is because he preached how he was always against the war in the middle east and how he didn&#039;t vote for these wars.

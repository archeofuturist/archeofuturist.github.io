Each groups (Native Swede, children of immigrants, refugees) live in their own segregated world.<br>2. Native Swedes will never know what its like to be a refugee or an immigrant. Even if they share the empathy they will never know. Worst thing is that they think they are helping when in reality they are fucking up everyone even themselves. This goes for other countries though.<br>3. Swedish people care a lot about status despite labelling themselves equal.<br>4. Almost every Swedish College student has:<br> - Spotify Premium<br> - Macs<br> - White adidas sneakers <br>5. Sweden will experience a steady decline in PPP, GDP per capita, Extreme housing shortages, more cities like Malm\u00f6 and an increase in an already high tax rate. Assuming high immigration rates continue.","filename":"Sweden","ext":".png","w":447,"h":275,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":153,"tim":1491930153563,"time":1491930153,"md5":"QcPE158okzJRajgVzXcQVA==","fsize":16437,"resto":0,"id":"FXcawVbe","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-i-realised-in-sweden","country_name":"Sweden","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120624010,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)13:20:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120621669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120621669<\/a><br>I have noticed similar things in Sweden<br>also<br>6.

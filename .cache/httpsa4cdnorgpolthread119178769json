It&#039;s a calculated assault planned by the media to try and end advertising on anything with user made content.<br><br>The final planning was in february at an advertising industry group meeting, the reason they were able to get so many big companies to pull advertising at the same time is because they colluded with advertising and PR staff at large companies.

They&#039;re counting on people being too busy fighting each other over left\/right issues or which websites they dislike while they institute a large scale censorship system. I would not bother defending youtube. The first step should be to target corporations that pulled their youtube ads. flood their social media accounts with complaints blaming them for the situation. <br><br>The WSJ and newscorp can handle the hate fairly easily, companies involved in the boycott cannot, if they think they&#039;re going to be blamed when peoples favorite youtube channels are gone the whole thing becomes a huge liability.","time":1491144978,"resto":119178769,"id":"Y73C1e4p","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119206987,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)10:56:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"I see kids with 8 hr streams of them playing a video game with like 8 views.

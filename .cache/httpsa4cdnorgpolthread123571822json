Michael Strickland has been recording the brain disease epidemic in Portland, OR known as Social Justice. He&#039;s a CHL holder and at one of these pleasant events the crowd threatened to Zerg Rush his ass. He pulled out his pistol for 7 seconds while holing a hand up and backing away. For this (and also false accusations of racism by a BLM activist) he may spend over 50 years in Prison because an anti-gun activist judge ruled him guilty. <br>Here&#039;s a recently made video explaining not only particulars about the case, but SOME of the general bullshit going on in PDX:<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Wt8<wbr>iBKaV7eA<br>He has less than a month to appeal. It doesn&#039;t look good for justice the State of Oregon.","filename":"10979926_G","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493609309635,"time":1493609309,"md5":"NgoH3UXLpB5CxjeIIyyB5g==","fsize":54508,"resto":0,"id":"rSxKn+m8","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"michael-strickland-is-getting-railroaded","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123572123,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)23:31:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123571822\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123571822<\/a><br>I feel really bad for this guy, he made great videos and in this one in particular there was a fucking nog hopping around after he threw in backpack off.<br><br>That&#039;s the time where you draw your sidearm.","time":1493609470,"resto":123571822,"id":"1oBB4W2a","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123572411,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)23:33:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123572123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123572123<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That&#039;s the time where you draw your sidearm.<\/span><br>...and get thrown in prison for 50+ years.<br>I&#039;d never thought I&#039;d feel like fleeing this state","time":1493609623,"resto":123571822,"id":"rSxKn+m8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123572672,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)23:36:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Actually shooting someone would&#039;ve gotten him less.","time":1493609791,"resto":123571822,"id":"ayq+l4PZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123573479,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)23:44:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123572672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123572672<\/a><br><br>..and that&#039;s literally the logic for jailing him.

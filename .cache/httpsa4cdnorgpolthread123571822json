Michael Strickland has been recording the brain disease epidemic in Portland, OR known as Social Justice. He&#039;s a CHL holder and at one of these pleasant events the crowd threatened to Zerg Rush his ass. He pulled out his pistol for 7 seconds while holing a hand up and backing away. For this (and also false accusations of racism by a BLM activist) he may spend over 50 years in Prison because an anti-gun activist judge ruled him guilty. <br>Here&#039;s a recently made video explaining not only particulars about the case, but SOME of the general bullshit going on in PDX:<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Wt8<wbr>iBKaV7eA<br>He has less than a month to appeal.

Hitler had far better understanding of how the war would break out and over what, than Allied countries had. He was able to unify German countries in peace, and was prepared for the war with France and UK after invading Poland. And France was very well prepared for the war. Even so, Germany utterly destroyed France. The war with USSR began with devastating victories too. Hitler advanced extremely fast during the first phases of the war. But he got stuck in the major cities of leningrad and stalingrad, and he was too fixated on getting them. He also ignored his commander who suggested he should retreat, which ended up in a disaster. When the army surrounding Stalingrad got cut off, he tried to support it with airdrops, but that was just futile. Despite the shortcomings of the German army, it is absolutely clear that they were far better supplied than USSR. They might not have had the adequate supplies to survive Russian winters, but neither did the Russians. Soviets didn&#039;t even have enough guns and food to go around. <br><br>Germany had unprecedented victories in a very short order. Hitler was a great commander during the early war.

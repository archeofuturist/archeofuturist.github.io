Maybe the civilian rebels in the beginning just wanted to get rid of the evil dictator but after 6+ years of civil war i don&#039;t believe theres anyone left fighting of them. They are probably comfy in europe on welfare.<br><br>The whole thing is about creating propaganda to gain advantages in the war. A lot of ground has been won and lost, it changes hands often. One thing the &quot;rebels&quot;(they fight assad and isis) want is the no-fly zone as they get fucked by Russian air bombings. They use propoganda such as the child in ambulance and maybe this gas attack to try and create support for the US to create no-fly zones (which would create the possibility of the U.S shooting down a russian plane directly) Recently it&#039;s been going better for Assad so one would wonder why he would suddently decide to gas 50 civilians for no apparent reason considering last time the international community freaked (and Denmark sent a warship with elite soldiers to collect some chemical weapons)<br>In my opinion it&#039;s an obvious false flag. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s hard to accept that. The thing is that it just dosn&#039;t matter. It&#039;s still been effective of creating support to more war mongering in Syria.

The Alawites, a variety of Shia Islam, make up 12% of the population and mostly live in and around Tartus and Latakia. Christians make up 10% of the country. Most Syrian Christians adhere to the Byzantine Rite; the two largest are the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch and the Melkite Greek Catholic Church.[51][52] The Druze are a mountainous people who reside in Jabal al-Druze who helped spark the Great Syrian Revolt. The Ismailis are an even smaller sect that originated in Asia. Many Armenian and Assyrian Christians fled Turkey during the Armenian Genocide and the Assyrian genocide and settled in Syria. There are also roughly 500,000 Palestinians, who are mostly descendants of refugees from the 1948 Israeli-Arab War. The community of Syrian Jews inside Syria once numbered 30,000 in 1947, but has only 200 today.[53]<\/span><br><br>Majority of ppl are still Sunni. They could be sympathizers with rebels, or just working with rebels in order to get by. All it would take is to have a general THINK that that was the case. Assad could&#039;ve given up all of his chemicals before and still captured more from the rebels later and used that. At any rate, the more indigenous Sunnis Assad can push out his country into Europe, the easier it is for him to rule his country post-civil war. <br><br>Ofc, it could be <a href=\"#p120512531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120512531<\/a><br>Assad and Putin aren&#039;t about to share intel with the US, much less be honest with the public; no more than CIA would.","time":1491868507,"resto":120511557,"id":"u+ZcrPqg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120514333,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)19:55:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120511557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120511557<\/a>","filename":"syrian-syria-crisis-quotes_900-581","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":655,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1491868520027,"time":1491868520,"md5":"thRyTdGzRE6VBBPHXh2T8A==","fsize":306928,"resto":120511557,"id":"7es4XXPc","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120514540,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)19:56:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120511557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120511557<\/a><br>(((Who))) could have done such a thing?","time":1491868606,"resto":120511557,"id":"d7LOLJvZ","country":"CR","country_name":"Costa Rica"},{"no":120514589,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)19:57:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120511557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120511557<\/a><br>he&#039;s a cartoon villain that just does evil shit for no reason, trust me go- I mean guy","filename":"PresidentAssadl","ext":".jpg","w":993,"h":559,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491868623052,"time":1491868623,"md5":"ES6l00zcqYx2y+NM65AdtA==","fsize":95753,"resto":120511557,"id":"\/V90SZLs","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120514671,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)19:57:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120511557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120511557<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But if he didn&#039;t do it, then who did?<\/span><br>the US\/Israel, to have an excuse to invade Syria.","time":1491868660,"resto":120511557,"id":"Q\/YmcYj\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120514792,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)19:58:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120514333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120514333<\/a><br>what is that picture on the wall???","time":1491868712,"resto":120511557,"id":"VkxSCDuD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120514809,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)19:58:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120511557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120511557<\/a>","filename":"1mzpqa","ext":".jpg","w":408,"h":330,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":101,"tim":1491868719266,"time":1491868719,"md5":"htfJC48m3nRiCHhOHnUe0Q==","fsize":40731,"resto":120511557,"id":"W6hWLZCB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120514893,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)19:59:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120511557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120511557<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But if he didn&#039;t do it, then who did?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mossad<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Al Nusra (Ziyaad Tarriq Ahmed)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;T*rks<\/span><br>Basically this: <a href=\"#p120512275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120512275<\/a>","time":1491868757,"resto":120511557,"id":"PO5kZA+O","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

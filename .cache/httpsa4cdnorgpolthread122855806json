I decided to watch and give it a go since I was feeling enraged at injustice in the world after reading some of Patton&#039;s diaries. Well one of the first thing I noticed in the series was that Hitler had a pretty impressive military career. It seemed a little too heroic so I chalked it up to propaganda.<br><br> I looked up what the MSM narrative is and it seems until recently that this semeed to be indeed true.<br>However, recent ((evidence)) was uncovered and it seems like Hitler wasn&#039;t quite heroic as he was made out to be, more working in regimental camps than on the front lines<br><br> This is all according to Thomas Weber. I looked more into the guy to see if he was a Jew which I could not find out, but in one of his interviews I read that Hitler actually served in the infamous Bavarian Soviet Republic. I looked into it and it seems like this Weber guy is the only one espousing these ideas as they come from primary documents that were missed by previous historians.<br><br>I guess my questions are:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Were you aware of this<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do you explain this<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is Weber credible?<\/span>","filename":"1478564334839","ext":".jpg","w":403,"h":403,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493189572921,"time":1493189572,"md5":"HdYHsRcsAI+n\/qs2EyyaKw==","fsize":21427,"resto":0,"id":"GZ1WfEX9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hitler-served-in-the-bavarian-soviet-republic","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122855977,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:55:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hitler himself said he had communist thoughts when he was young.<br><br>Barbarossa speech.","time":1493189705,"resto":122855806,"id":"fO\/UVLnn","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122856204,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:57:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122855977\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122855977<\/a><br>I mean this is pretty different than having thoughts about Communism.

In the Bavarian Soviet Republic there were different trade unions for soldiers, and Hitler was a kind of elected representative in a trade union organisation or group. But nobody knows what did he do there. One thing is sure, he never was a communist. Let me mention in the early NSDAP a lot of leaders sympathised with the Soviet (with Soviet Russia) for example Goebbels ca. till the end of the 20ties. These people were anticapitalists. Even in the SA there were communists (sometime fascist, sometimes communist as they like it).<br><br>I&#039;m finding a lot of conflicting info.

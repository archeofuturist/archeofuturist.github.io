Now I&#039;m gonna redpill you on China and the CCP with all my expertise. <br><br>It is becoming more and more apparent to many people, that the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) knows it is on its last straw of survival. The party is facing severe and increasing systematic stress on all fronts:<br><br>Let&#039;s look at it in detail: <br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 1. Increasing external oppositions from all other countries in the world including all of China&#039;s neighbours. They are forming more and more alliances and becoming more outspoken with rising strengths against China, in addition to increasing anti-China sentiment from people in all other countries.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 2. Increasing internal severe and massive violent social unrest and anti-CCP mutiny from people of all Chinese living places e.g. mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Xinjiang, Tibet, Macau etc. To beat down internal dissent, the CCP every year is forced to spend even more money than on its massive military budget. This is continuously worsened by the free flow of information, with Chinese people knowing more and more from travelling abroad and learning about truths from jumping beyond the &quot;Great Fire Wall&quot; on the internet.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 3. Fierce unstoppable purges and mutually-destructive infighting among different factions within the party, who are imprisoning and killing each other every day. This power grab goes on under the thin guise of &quot;anti-corruption drive&quot; when everyone knows all officials in china are corrupted.<\/span>","filename":"26d185475c98e3550f168e27216bbed5","ext":".jpg","w":5071,"h":1800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":88,"tim":1490366316202,"time":1490366316,"md5":"FMfLWRYa6AGJoEcfV8e0bw==","fsize":1239767,"resto":0,"id":"ibNl74ug","country":"IN","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"alright-pol-allow-me-to-redpill-you-on-china","country_name":"India","replies":113,"images":30,"unique_ips":47,"tail_size":50},{"no":118086486,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)10:39:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"(part 2 )<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 4. Its own economy never able to develop to higher level beyond mass skill-less manufacturing, due to complete absence of law and common morals. High technology and innovations and scientific development all require citizens working together long term in a system they trust, with things like rule of law, no restrictions on speech and expression, copyrights, patents, common morals when collaborating and trading with each other etc. These qualities are all destroyed in modern China by the CCP. When was the last time you heard an announcement of technology development or innovations or scientific breakthrough coming from a Chinese organization or company or university? You haven&#039;t because there ain&#039;t any. The only way modern China gets these things is from stealing and spying from all other countries, but that has become much more difficult since the whole world has caught on to their act.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 5. China&#039;s mass skill-less manufacturing itself is going away to other countries due to increasing costs and openly hostile and unfair business environment full of frauds and sanctioned protectionism and government robberies. It is further worsened by the rise of robotic automatic manufacturing and 3D printing. This situation is a death knock to the &quot;growth-based legitimacy&quot; of the CCP, which is the only thing CCP can rely on for continuing ruling power. For sure Chinese people tolerate the CCP when the economy seemingly explodes, but when one day it crashes and the country&#039;s hopeless bad shape hit them in the face the people&#039;s &quot;support&quot; for the CCP will turn on a dime.<\/span>","time":1490366362,"resto":118086430,"id":"ibNl74ug","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":118086512,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)10:39:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; Since six months ago, all the major economic indicators have gone on a nose dive - including manufacturing orders, export volume, commercial investments, corporate credits, foreign capital inflow, domestic consumption, real estate prices, HSBC Service PMI, survey of business sentiments etc. The CCP is on its last resort of printing literally trillions of worthless renminbi to dump into economy, causing way more long-term harm than short-term help, and when that is over there is nothing else the CCP can do to prop up the failing economy.<\/span>","time":1490366383,"resto":118086430,"id":"ibNl74ug","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":118086676,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)10:41:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"( Continued )<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 6.

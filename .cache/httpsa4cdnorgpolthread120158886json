The Old Covenant has elements of God&#039;s Law but much was given to the people because of their character at the time (Jesus says in response to one instance of this, that it was done because the men&#039;s &quot;their hearts were hard&quot;). The New Covenant (Christianity) fulfilled the role of the Old Covenant so to make way for God&#039;s Law in full. This is why Christianity retains elements of the Old Testament teaching while dismissing many parts of it and adding new things into it.<br><br>For better explaining this in detail, I find the early church theologians very skilled at separating the distinction between retained\/not retained teaching. Please excuse me for appealing to just classic theologians rather than something authoritative:<br><br><br>Basically it&#039;s the Old Covenant teachings can be separated fields: Civil Law, Ceremonial Law, and Moral Law. The Civil and Ceremonial Law are removed in the fulfillment of the Old Covenant and the New Covenant pretty much only retains and greatly expands on the Moral Law element of it. Leviticus is pretty much staunchly the Civil Law and - to put it more bluntly - the Levitical priesthood is dismissed outright in St. Paul&#039;s Letter to the Hebrews, Chapter 7 so it&#039;s inconsistent to support it.<br><br>The Ten Commandments are kept by the church because they almost exclusively a good summary of moral laws (besides the sabbath, arguably, but that&#039;s still nice too).","filename":"Quote Merton","ext":".jpg","w":850,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":58,"tim":1491685141921,"time":1491685141,"md5":"MoSNqs0D0u7XpFQjzueHxw==","fsize":75760,"resto":120158886,"id":"Pw9\/mR3i","country":"US","trip":"!!tuOwy1ct2dy","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120182255,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:01:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120180504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120180504<\/a><br>I think a decent place to begin is, if the universe is a random collection of events, why can I not shake the feeling it has meaning?

These verses are chosen in succession from Revelation 18. I think they&#039;re a prediction about right now. Check this out:<br><br>5 For her sins are piled up to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities. <br>6 Give back to her as she has done to others; pay her back double for what she has done; mix her a double portion in her own cup.<br>7 To the degree that she has glorified herself and lived in luxury, inflict on her that much torment and misery. In her heart she says, \u2018I sit as queen; I am not a widow and will never see mourning.\u2019 <br>8 Therefore her plagues will come in one day, death and misery and famine; and she will be consumed by fire, for mighty is the Lord God who judges her.\u201d <br>9 Then the kings of the earth who committed sexual immorality and lived in luxury with her will weep and wail at the sight of the smoke rising from the fire that consumes her.<br>11 And the merchants (jews) of the earth will weep and mourn over her, because there is no one left to buy their cargo (globalist lies).<br>23 The light of a lamp will never shine in you again, and the voices of a bride and bridegroom will never call out in you again. For your merchants were the great ones of the earth, because all the nations were deceived by your sorcery.\u201d<br><br>So far this seems to be talking about a female political figure who makes deals with various Nations of ill-repute, who with the help of merchants (Jews), deceives the entire world with a lie (Globalism), but who one day is exposed and faces justice.<br><br>If there&#039;s interest in this I&#039;ll go on...","time":1491688706,"resto":120158886,"id":"UZcGNeda","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120189262,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:59:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"who else here excited for the end?<br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119371032#p119371032\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119371032<\/a>","filename":"Revelation of pol","ext":".png","w":1440,"h":2000,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491688746460,"time":1491688746,"md5":"CG4aBCrECtaRW0TIONpBuw==","fsize":1121713,"resto":120158886,"id":"O2eMasmZ","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120189277,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:59:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120182255\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120182255<\/a><br>Because your good","time":1491688758,"resto":120158886,"id":"QG3ot8QU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120189483,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:01:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120189165\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120189165<\/a><br><br>This is commonly thought of as being the USA...

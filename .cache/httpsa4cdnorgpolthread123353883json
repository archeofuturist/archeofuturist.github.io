I am simply trying to capture as much of what my inner monologue\/thoughts are on a subject, as quickly as I can, and as fast as I can get them out. I have an extensive history of concussions and a possible but unknown insult to brain when I was deprived and extremely low on oxygen for about 4 minutes during an pulmonary embolism. I NEVER \u201ccoded\u201d or needed full blown CPR for anyone who is curious and knows far more than me on the subject. (Like note taking or openly brainstorming) This called mental vomit<br><br>- I wanted to make this point so nobody thinks I\u2019m just flippantly ignoring netiquite. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m going through a personal experience I just cannot explain in a way I think anyone will understand. When I try to come up with an explanation the only words my mind comes up with is, \u201cPure Understanding.\u201d<br><br>- This is NOT a \u201cLARP\u201d in what I think is 4chan \u201cspeak.\u201d I have taken the policy of when it comes to trying to find answers on this, to think in the now and be completely honest because I\u2019ll never get anywhere TRUE if I\u2019m not being honest. A lie can spark a lie and I VERY MUCH want to avoid that.<br> <br>- **STRONG URGE** to write \u2013 \u201cCareful this could be what you fear as fulfilling purpose and you\u2019re about to die.\u201d - Is this just my imagination or is that thought real? The urge to FINISH THIS PORTION is overwhelming and overcoming<br><br>- I make ZERO claim I am \u201cin contact\u201d with anyone about any of what you will read. I am simply a stay home father who has been so out of financial necessity since daughter needs so much care and we don\u2019t trust home nurses except for one.

No drugs. Almost \u201cdied\u201d a few years ago and had a scare last week. The scare was nothing serious but the \u201cdied\u201d part was. Explained later<br><br>- I seriously wonder if I\u2019m being \u201cwilled\u201d as the next great philosopher or my my pretty dormant mind (compared to people with societal accepted 9-5\u2019ers.) or if I\u2019m just going crazy. Or if this is all just normal thought that has always been there and somehow, all of a sudden, I noticed. <br><br>4 days ago, out of nowhere, LITERALLY on a dime I had an experience that is really hard for me to explain and understand. From the pause between one sentence to the next my entire thought process went from combative to a more \u201cwanting to understand\u201d feeling.

I questioned my own sanity. I knew everyone had an \u201cinner monologue\u201d but I was instantly curious at what point does that \u201cinner\u201d voice become what we know as insanity.<br><br> For instance I have had growing worries of my son growing up to be a pathological liar. I say this because to me, he could lie about what side of his face he felt the wind. <br><br>I\u2019m talking I could put my finger on each cheek and ask him did you feel this? He\u2019d say no, with my finger still on his cheek, \u201cNo daddy, I don\u2019t feel it\u201d I could put my finger on his other cheek and he\u2019d tell me he felt it on the cheek my finger just left.

I get into long stretches where I simply don\u2019t do anything other than get basic needs of survival. That includes being what society would consider, a non-worthless husband\/father. <br><br>I would sit on my ass and basically control the house like a general in a commanders chair. I started to notice this AND chastise myself internally. I would literally have a conversation with my own conscience.

That meant he would have to really step up his game as far as responsibility. Wife too. As I write this out I realize just how incredibly stupid that sounded considering how useless I was as a contributing member to the team\/ family. Before the dog and after my wife would get home \u2013 years ago \u2013 before our son was born and I would act like I was clocking out. <br><br>Looking back, at the time, I thought I was being sarcastically funny but was serious.

This time she woke me up which WAS hard to do on Ambien and I was again mad at them. <br><br>When they got up and started to walk in I made some comment that had to do with wanting them to hurry up and the next moment something happened.","time":1493486080,"resto":123353883,"id":"f6RsOJg5","country":"US","trip":"!NPiw6DYfeo","country_name":"United States"}]}

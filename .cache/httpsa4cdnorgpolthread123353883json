I am simply trying to capture as much of what my inner monologue\/thoughts are on a subject, as quickly as I can, and as fast as I can get them out. I have an extensive history of concussions and a possible but unknown insult to brain when I was deprived and extremely low on oxygen for about 4 minutes during an pulmonary embolism. I NEVER \u201ccoded\u201d or needed full blown CPR for anyone who is curious and knows far more than me on the subject. (Like note taking or openly brainstorming) This called mental vomit<br><br>- I wanted to make this point so nobody thinks I\u2019m just flippantly ignoring netiquite. I\u2019m not. I\u2019m going through a personal experience I just cannot explain in a way I think anyone will understand. When I try to come up with an explanation the only words my mind comes up with is, \u201cPure Understanding.\u201d<br><br>- This is NOT a \u201cLARP\u201d in what I think is 4chan \u201cspeak.\u201d I have taken the policy of when it comes to trying to find answers on this, to think in the now and be completely honest because I\u2019ll never get anywhere TRUE if I\u2019m not being honest. A lie can spark a lie and I VERY MUCH want to avoid that.<br> <br>- **STRONG URGE** to write \u2013 \u201cCareful this could be what you fear as fulfilling purpose and you\u2019re about to die.\u201d - Is this just my imagination or is that thought real? The urge to FINISH THIS PORTION is overwhelming and overcoming<br><br>- I make ZERO claim I am \u201cin contact\u201d with anyone about any of what you will read. I am simply a stay home father who has been so out of financial necessity since daughter needs so much care and we don\u2019t trust home nurses except for one.

I questioned my own sanity. I knew everyone had an \u201cinner monologue\u201d but I was instantly curious at what point does that \u201cinner\u201d voice become what we know as insanity.<br><br> For instance I have had growing worries of my son growing up to be a pathological liar. I say this because to me, he could lie about what side of his face he felt the wind. <br><br>I\u2019m talking I could put my finger on each cheek and ask him did you feel this? He\u2019d say no, with my finger still on his cheek, \u201cNo daddy, I don\u2019t feel it\u201d I could put my finger on his other cheek and he\u2019d tell me he felt it on the cheek my finger just left.

As I write this out I realize just how incredibly stupid that sounded considering how useless I was as a contributing member to the team\/ family.

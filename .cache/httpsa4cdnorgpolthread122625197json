The max you can get is about \u00a38,000 for your maintenance loan, plus extras if your applicable, and your uni may give you more through bursaries if your household income is under a certain amount or if your disabled or whatever, best to check that before you go. <br><br>So yeah, it should ask you on your applicatioin if you want how much you get to be dependent on household income. Then pout in parents&#039; emails and they&#039;ll have to make accounts and use them to support your application, then the SLC will get back to you telling you how much you&#039;re getting. <br><br>Btw they&#039;re not grants, they&#039;re all loans now, you have to pay it all back. If you&#039;re poor, your student debt will be about \u00a355k-\u00a360k all in all.","filename":"Thumb of Us","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":630,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1493064292973,"time":1493064292,"md5":"TK+Qg9vH81NI2mpJ8kSV+g==","fsize":108570,"resto":122625197,"id":"WVU0OijD","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122630163,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:05:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122629606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122629606<\/a><br>Was jizzing himself on Sky Press Preview when Trump attacked Syria.","time":1493064306,"resto":122625197,"id":"mY6il3jK","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122630167,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:05:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122629973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122629973<\/a><br>I read this as &quot;sexually assaulted a swimming pool&quot;<br>Holy shit","time":1493064306,"resto":122625197,"id":"kMNawlhV","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122630196,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:05:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Theresa May\u2019s secret plans to replace NHS England with private US healthcare system Kaiser Permanente<\/span><br>https:\/\/tompride.wordpress.com\/2017<wbr>\/04\/23\/theresa-mays-secret-plans-to<wbr>-replace-nhs-england-with-private-u<wbr>s-healthcare-system-kaiser-permanen<wbr>te\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there are Britcucks ITT RIGHT NOW who will defend this<\/span>","filename":"C-BwnCfXgAEBzho","ext":".png","w":943,"h":1024,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493064325365,"time":1493064325,"md5":"tdRR+VLZm9Q1pJy9MvxWIg==","fsize":143206,"resto":122625197,"id":"k6Nk1Qm\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122630199,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:05:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122630021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122630021<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Still believing the &gt;degree meme<\/span>","filename":"whattucker","ext":".gif","w":230,"h":250,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493064327485,"time":1493064327,"md5":"fIPklHqGEv\/8y+xRk\/EtsA==","fsize":1893823,"resto":122625197,"id":"MAaXhaJa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122630226,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:05:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122629866\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122629866<\/a><br><br>they can move to the south, not hard lad millions of irish came to England, now they are assimilated and are part of the white English middle class.","time":1493064343,"resto":122625197,"id":"EGN6YqsR","country":"SG","country_name":"Singapore"},{"no":122630246,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:05:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122629973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122629973<\/a><br>Tanned germans at it again","time":1493064353,"resto":122625197,"id":"l2BXPQZO","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122630248,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:05:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122630008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122630008<\/a>","filename":"corbyn rules","ext":".jpg","w":637,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1493064353134,"time":1493064353,"md5":"T\/cSP\/ZWzwxOvGkkhQDfjg==","fsize":63071,"resto":122625197,"id":"mY6il3jK","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122630264,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:06:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122630115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122630115<\/a><br><br>Uwotm8","time":1493064361,"resto":122625197,"id":"r6ckywNR","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122630271,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:06:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;some poor person tries to talk to you like they are your equal<\/span><br><br>Fucking disgusting.

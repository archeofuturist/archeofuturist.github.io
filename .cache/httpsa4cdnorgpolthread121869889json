We are still living in the fallout of this mode of thinking, <br>as the people who espoused these ideas when young have grown to adulthood and are <br>now the \u201cestablishment\u201d \u2014 those adults whom they considered to be the enemy during the <br>sixties. This \u201cegalitarianism\u201d was manifested in cultural domains with concepts such as <br>\u201cAnything can be defined as being art and all such works must be considered to have <br>equal validity.\u201d Thus, some random splashes on a canvas were considered an equal <br>achievement to the Sistine Chapel; a mud hut was held up as being equivalent to <br>Versailles. A janitor was dubbed the equivalent to a physicist; a novelist was now the <br>peer of one who scrawled graffiti on a bathroom wall. This principle of <br>\u201cindiscrimination\u201d was applied to all other fields of achievement. Those who opposed <br>this leveling were accused of being \u201cfascists\u201d or \u201cNazis,\u201d without regard for what these <br>terms might have meant in their actual historical origins and practice. After all, it was the <br>mid-sixties, twenty years after the ending of a war that most of these folks weren\u2019t even <br>alive to have experienced. How quickly past orthodoxies are forgotten.&quot;<br><br>https:\/\/archive.org\/stream\/TheSatan<wbr>icScriptures\/The%20Satanic%20Script<wbr>ures_djvu.txt","filename":"peter-gilmore-sword-lg","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":551,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492624682375,"time":1492624682,"md5":"Fh3fLlYFUCGMV1coQufi\/g==","fsize":34355,"resto":121869889,"id":"Al+i7jG0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121872117,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)13:58:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121869889\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121869889<\/a><br>You could better represent your political opinions with a bowl of potatoes","time":1492624714,"resto":121869889,"id":"L6m1LJDL","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121873256,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)14:08:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;121872117<\/span><br>I don&#039;t much care for brown people","filename":"download","ext":".jpg","w":275,"h":183,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492625308137,"time":1492625308,"md5":"y4UFXqPO0LhniLgoHMw11Q==","fsize":6640,"resto":121869889,"id":"H\/RQvayN","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

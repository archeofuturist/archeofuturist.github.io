However, common variants that occur with high frequency but small effect can cumulatively have big impacts on complex inherited traits \u2014 both positive and negative. If variants provide a better chance of survival, they are positively selected, or tend to stay in the genome through generations.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/news.yale.edu\/2017\/02\/27\/gen<wbr>etic-risk-autism-spectrum-disorder-<wbr>linked-evolutionary-brain-benefit<br><br>So are autists the new \u00dcbermensch?","filename":"d965afe2bdd79d42cdd2f7f79509c8df","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490920523034,"time":1490920523,"md5":"VSc10pM2VrK3NqT6guquAA==","fsize":90182,"resto":0,"id":"63mOQF0D","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"yale-university-finds-autism-linked-to","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":118994012,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:35:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118993958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118993958<\/a><br>WE","time":1490920550,"resto":118993958,"id":"D7z+iH3J","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118994186,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:37:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118994012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118994012<\/a><br>WUZ","time":1490920654,"resto":118993958,"id":"gPz+Oo6w","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118994542,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:41:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118994186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118994186<\/a><br><br>TARDS ?","time":1490920865,"resto":118993958,"id":"rMMmrq7b","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":118994544,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:41:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118994186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118994186<\/a><br>AUTISTS","time":1490920866,"resto":118993958,"id":"snIa7mgN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118994609,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:41:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;kikes pump whites full of vaccines to ravage superior aryan brains with autism.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw their master plan backfires and whites become too smart<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;previously suppressed, whites become woke to their racial identity once more<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;whites construct a mass autism array called the internet<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;internet autists are the downfall of 5000 years of kike schemes<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw too smart<\/span><br>best timeline desu senpai","filename":"a8090c30cd07d03b0243a1ea75f5a3a6aa321cc422ffe41a96c433bab8d3fcd0","ext":".jpg","w":1930,"h":1698,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":109,"tim":1490920905779,"time":1490920905,"md5":"c\/1eEJGxPDFaKeksLwdlrw==","fsize":195388,"resto":118993958,"id":"63mOQF0D","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118994751,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:43:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118993958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118993958<\/a><br><br>Now someone just needs to tell the girls.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;may have been positively selected during human evolution because they also contribute to enhanced cognition<\/span><br><br>Typical evolution &quot;research&quot;. <br><br>Does this count as science?<br><br>lol.","time":1490920981,"resto":118993958,"id":"SPncA98k","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

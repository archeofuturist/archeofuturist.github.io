Religion is just a layer of explanation that society needed. Old mythological creatures and polytheistic Gods all had very specific purposes. God of the Harvest, meant &quot;we as a population do not have enough knowledge to determine what makes a good agricultural strategy, and we do not understand global weather patterns or the climate too much&quot;, hence, to feel secure about our endeavours, we make sacrifices to a made up creature that supposedly controls all of this, and when the crops fail, we have to do more sacrifices to please him. The monotheistic, semetic religions worked similarly, but emphasised in-out-group mentality, and nepotism, dualism and divine determinism as means to gain power over even more people.","time":1493023123,"resto":122555687,"id":"3jdPDD92","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122563921,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:39:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122563549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122563549<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Calling for the end of Christianity, then saying only Christianity can save us = insane.<\/span><br>Where, exactly, did I do either of those things (it was real in my mind doesn&#039;t count)?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You&#039;re too young to remember<\/span><br>I&#039;m willing to put money on my being considerably older than you (not that it&#039;s necessarily an indicator of anything other than experience)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;leddit<\/span><br>Really?

Mass atheism causes degeneracy. <br>Now I am not arguing against a few people being atheists but when it gets to the point that atheism becomes a quasi religion of its own thats when its gone too far. The reason rally and other events just get degeneracy started. Soon people lose their morals that Christianity helped instill into the populace and a bunch of normies become nihilistic and look to either materialism or social justice to be their new &quot;religion&quot;.

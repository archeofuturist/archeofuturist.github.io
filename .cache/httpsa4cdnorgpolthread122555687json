Religion is just a layer of explanation that society needed. Old mythological creatures and polytheistic Gods all had very specific purposes. God of the Harvest, meant &quot;we as a population do not have enough knowledge to determine what makes a good agricultural strategy, and we do not understand global weather patterns or the climate too much&quot;, hence, to feel secure about our endeavours, we make sacrifices to a made up creature that supposedly controls all of this, and when the crops fail, we have to do more sacrifices to please him. The monotheistic, semetic religions worked similarly, but emphasised in-out-group mentality, and nepotism, dualism and divine determinism as means to gain power over even more people.","time":1493023123,"resto":122555687,"id":"3jdPDD92","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122563921,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:39:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122563549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122563549<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Calling for the end of Christianity, then saying only Christianity can save us = insane.<\/span><br>Where, exactly, did I do either of those things (it was real in my mind doesn&#039;t count)?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You&#039;re too young to remember<\/span><br>I&#039;m willing to put money on my being considerably older than you (not that it&#039;s necessarily an indicator of anything other than experience)<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;leddit<\/span><br>Really?

Mass atheism causes degeneracy. <br>Now I am not arguing against a few people being atheists but when it gets to the point that atheism becomes a quasi religion of its own thats when its gone too far. The reason rally and other events just get degeneracy started. Soon people lose their morals that Christianity helped instill into the populace and a bunch of normies become nihilistic and look to either materialism or social justice to be their new &quot;religion&quot;.

(Intelligent design would still have the ultimate goal of creation, not purpose per se, whereas in Christianity, humans are given\/provided a purpose that other creations\/species lack). I agree that the person&#039;s comment is too simple, but your point holds no value. You imply that all creation would have a purpose, as opposed to it being a by-product of naturalism which, if it were designed by a higher power, would have still achieved it&#039;s purpose of creation. Although the only species that is claimed to have been created in &quot;God&#039;s image&quot; within Christianity, are humans. Since people enjoy bringing up the &quot;if your God is perfect&quot; argument, note that within Christianity, humans are allowed to have choices, which will result in positive things or consequences. Depending on the sect of Christianity, a lot of Christians hold the view that sin is a by-product of God creating humans in his own image, which a lot of people translate to knowing the difference between right and wrong. <br>God knew this would occur, hence why we were created in his image. People assume that a perfect God would not allow evil, suffering, etc. but throughout scripture, it&#039;s evident that this is supposed to be one of the ways that humans can improve themselves. You can either overcome barriers, or decide to stay put where you find it comfortable. May I also mention that a good portion of Christians agree with evolution. In case anyone cannot fathom how Genesis would validate evolution and vice versa, I would suggest you do research on the hebrew word for &quot;day&quot; in scripture. The word &quot;yom&quot; is translated to various units of time throughout the bible. Yom is also used for the supposed 7 days of creation. Learning the original languages of scripture in Christianity, will increase your religious fluency, and allow for you to understand why many sects exist (translation).","time":1493025637,"resto":122555687,"id":"+EYguP5J","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122566728,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:20:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122566666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122566666<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;666666<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;666666<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;666666<\/span>","time":1493025645,"resto":122555687,"id":"etvJutWo","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":122566740,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:20:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122566109\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122566109<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i believe correlation equals causation<\/span><br><br>i believe you&#039;re a retard","time":1493025658,"resto":122555687,"id":"l6BOyGjl","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122566771,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:21:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"This thread proves that Sweden will continue to be a mistake until the end of time.","time":1493025682,"resto":122555687,"id":"lWgHAgYK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122566799,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:21:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122566694\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122566694<\/a><br>Aristotle was still a genius compared with Christianity<br>Christianity literally argues for a flat earth, it took priests who read Aristotle to overlook that retardation.","time":1493025711,"resto":122555687,"id":"iHlp\/7MO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122566853,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:22:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122563866\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122563866<\/a><br>Humans can comprehend units of time according to how a higher power sees it.","time":1493025749,"resto":122555687,"id":"+EYguP5J","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122566884,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:22:54","name":"HEAVEN","com":"<a href=\"#p122555687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122555687<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ba me, agnostic<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;know fuck all<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;don&#039;t claim to know anything<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;amazed by people who feel the need to push their abstract ideas on others<\/span>","time":1493025774,"resto":122555687,"id":"+X+yxMmQ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122566915,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:23:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122566592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122566592<\/a><br><br>Why?

The spending China is putting into genetic superiority and eugenics is off the charts. <br><br>CNGB - China national Gene Bank opened late 2016 and is going to be storing hundreds of millions of chinese people&#039;s genetic information. This immense amount of data will be used for creating a new super-human Chinese race with massively increased IQ, health, and cock size. Athletes that will dominate all sports will be created from this vast amount of data. <br><br>Established by BGI-Shenzhen, the China National GeneBank (CNGB) is the first national genebank integrating a large-scale bio-repository and an omics database. It is approved by Chinese government, with the mission of collecting, preserving and exploiting genomics resources, and to build a network fostering global communication and collaboration on biodiversity conservation and genetic resources utilization. In addition, CNGB is supported by BGI\u2019s high-throughput sequencing and bio-informatics capacity, and it will not only provide a repository system for biological collection, but more importantly develop a novel platform to further understand genomic mechanisms of life.<br><br>http:\/\/www.genomics.cn\/en\/navigatio<wbr>n\/show_navigation?nid=256","filename":"Ctg9fTxWEAAPaGg","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":833,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":216,"tim":1493677761718,"time":1493677761,"md5":"JXsRn2HbciIl0Tu5dA1jFw==","fsize":200674,"resto":0,"id":"aOaxLe47","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"chinas-newest-super-genius-human-20-facility","country_name":"United States","replies":284,"images":42,"unique_ips":102,"tail_size":50},{"no":123684012,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:33:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"The centre, dubbed China\u2019s Noah\u2019s Ark by mainland media, aims to collect 300 million genetic samples at its base in Shenzhen when all two phases are complete<br><br>With an investment of 780 million yuan (HK$900 million) for phase one, the China National GeneBank was the fourth of its kind after similar centres in the United States, Britain and Japan, People\u2019s Daily reported.

The AI might offer a gatekeeper a recipe for perfect health, immortality, or whatever the gatekeeper is believed to most desire; on the other side of the coin, the AI could threaten that it will do horrific things to the gatekeeper and his family once it &quot;inevitably&quot; escapes. One strategy to attempt to box the AI would be to allow the AI to respond to narrow multiple-choice questions whose answers would benefit human science or medicine, but otherwise bar all other communication with or observation of the AI.[6] A more lenient &quot;informational containment&quot; strategy would restrict the AI to a low-bandwidth text-only interface, which would at least prevent emotive imagery or some kind of hypothetical &quot;hypnotic pattern&quot;. Note that on a technical level, no system can be completely isolated and still remain useful: even if the operators refrain from allowing the AI to communicate and instead merely run the AI for the purpose of observing its inner dynamics, the AI could strategically alter its dynamics to influence the observers. For example, the AI could choose to creatively malfunction in a way that increases the probability that its operators will become lulled into a false sense of security and choose to reboot and then de-isolate the system<\/span>","time":1493684149,"resto":123683471,"id":"JvWrOrV6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123696495,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:16:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123696083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123696083<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/AI_b<wbr>ox<\/span><br>Use benevolent, 100% controlled super AIs to come up with ways to control other super AIs... problem solved.","time":1493684165,"resto":123683471,"id":"vXDLlw6o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123696649,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:17:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123683471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123683471<\/a><br>Will there be titty monsters?","time":1493684235,"resto":123683471,"id":"DzikldJJ","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":123696659,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:17:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123688240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123688240<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;its really not that complicated you christcuck.<\/span><br>Oh if you only knew<br>It takes YEARS to find out what a single base pair does in a certain gene, and then you have genes that are either suppressed, different in base pair length or outright missing.

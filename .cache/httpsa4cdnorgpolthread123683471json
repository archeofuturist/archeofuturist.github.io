The spending China is putting into genetic superiority and eugenics is off the charts. <br><br>CNGB - China national Gene Bank opened late 2016 and is going to be storing hundreds of millions of chinese people&#039;s genetic information. This immense amount of data will be used for creating a new super-human Chinese race with massively increased IQ, health, and cock size. Athletes that will dominate all sports will be created from this vast amount of data. <br><br>Established by BGI-Shenzhen, the China National GeneBank (CNGB) is the first national genebank integrating a large-scale bio-repository and an omics database. It is approved by Chinese government, with the mission of collecting, preserving and exploiting genomics resources, and to build a network fostering global communication and collaboration on biodiversity conservation and genetic resources utilization. In addition, CNGB is supported by BGI\u2019s high-throughput sequencing and bio-informatics capacity, and it will not only provide a repository system for biological collection, but more importantly develop a novel platform to further understand genomic mechanisms of life.<br><br>http:\/\/www.genomics.cn\/en\/navigatio<wbr>n\/show_navigation?nid=256","filename":"Ctg9fTxWEAAPaGg","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":833,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":216,"tim":1493677761718,"time":1493677761,"md5":"JXsRn2HbciIl0Tu5dA1jFw==","fsize":200674,"resto":0,"id":"aOaxLe47","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"chinas-newest-super-genius-human-20-facility","country_name":"United States","replies":62,"images":10,"unique_ips":22},{"no":123684012,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:33:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"The centre, dubbed China\u2019s Noah\u2019s Ark by mainland media, aims to collect 300 million genetic samples at its base in Shenzhen when all two phases are complete<br><br>With an investment of 780 million yuan (HK$900 million) for phase one, the China National GeneBank was the fourth of its kind after similar centres in the United States, Britain and Japan, People\u2019s Daily reported.

If you&#039;re not familiar Drexel is located in a fairly shitty part of Philly. The campus area for Drexel and U.Penn are nice and basically one connected entity but all around is shitty. The area used to be very nice and wealthy (I&#039;m talking hundred years ago or more) so there&#039;s a lot of grand old Victorian rowhomes around. Most have been chopped up into apts for students but there are some good properties. The reason behind the grant is to encourage students and professors to feel like part of the neighborhood not just an external populace that commutes in and out each day.","time":1490876612,"resto":118914411,"id":"D0ZQEwbK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118917051,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)08:42:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118914411\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118914411<\/a><br>In all seriousness, why do you need to give up a seat to a uniformed soldier?

We recognise this society that we live in has taken the wrong path, been taken away from what it could have been. We want a society where the family is respected and empowered as the basis of civilisation, we want a world where the classes work together for the good of all instead of being agitated into conflict by Marxists. In a reactionary world we would still have smartphones and computers and modern comforts, but our cultures would be monoethnic, we would have respect for and celebrate that past glories of our civilisation.

I think modern technology falls into three categories: The first is things being worked on that shouldn&#039;t really exist. Things like real dolls, sex bots and tinder. In a world where gender hadn&#039;t been used as a wedge to push the Marxist agenda we would have no need of these things. Tech of this type is just attempting to fix problems that we ourselves have caused by defying natural order and it&#039;s existence is harmful because it ossifies us - prevents us from returning to natural order. <br>The second type is things like social media, it&#039;s almost entirely destroyed all of the old community spaces and drove people further apart than ever but conversely it&#039;s also allowing the distribution of ideas on a level that&#039;s never even been conceived of before, if it wasn&#039;t for twitter we wouldn&#039;t have trump, if it wasn&#039;t for Facebook and YT we wouldn&#039;t have the alt-right. Tech like this is a double edged sword but isn&#039;t inherently bad.

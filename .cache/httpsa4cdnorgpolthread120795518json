They coordinated the fake tension to make it seem like they aren&#039;t the &quot;allies&quot; that Spicer said they are. That way, in a few years when we lift sanctions and do everything they want from Trump, there will be plausible deniability and things to point to, because up until last week, Trump and the Kremlin propaganda has agreed on literally everything. <br>Meanwhile there are still sketchy meetings going on with Russia and it was confirmed Russia knew about our bombing before congress did. <br><br>Shits fucked. Fuck our president, his shitty family and his incompetent administration, fuck the MSM and the corporations they&#039;re sucking up to.","filename":"IMG_3758","ext":".jpg","w":1242,"h":1495,"tn_w":207,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492025340847,"time":1492025340,"md5":"TfO7LiTwLJY\/EG+hsdDncg==","fsize":278731,"resto":0,"id":"HHdmywJj","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-its-clear-that-russia-and-trumps","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120795829,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)15:31:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120795518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120795518<\/a><br><br>he he he stupid goyims","filename":"Botsford170131Trump11057","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":320,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492025490924,"time":1492025490,"md5":"SUgBoctfLcvxMQ38wZCPVQ==","fsize":22412,"resto":120795518,"id":"y4yq3t9X","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

Quantum computers will have played a critical role in the creation of this new intelligence. One of the three predictions Rose made in the video provided came true a year earlier than predicted.<br><br>Geordie Rose - Quantum Computing: Artificial Intelligence Is Here: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=PqN<wbr>_2jDVbOU<br><br>&quot;Quantum computers aren&#039;t that powerful yet, but they&#039;re doing something completely different than what conventional computers do. And that thing is like flight. It gives computers access to these new resources, maybe you can call them parallel universes, in order to do something you couldn&#039;t otherwise do on a normal computer.&quot; -Geordie Rose<br><br>&quot;We have our own version of Moore&#039;s law, for the past 9 years(2015), the number of qbits that could fit on a chip has doubled every year.&quot; As a point of reference, the 512 qubit Vesuvius (2012) is about 500,000 times fast than the 128 qubit Rainier (2010), it is comparable to a Donkey that walks 1 mph to the SR-71 that flies at 2,000 mph.<br><br>Even though we are seeing breakthroughs in neural networks with conventional machines such as DeepMind. As more qbits fit on the quantum processor enabling quantum machines to answer the questions of the current unknown, there will be a great shift in the human condition.<br><br>True A.I is inevitable with quantum computation. How will humans live alongside intelligence we helped create, and holds the knowledge of the world wide web, and the data of their private digital lives?<br><br>Will they continue to help guide humanity forward once they gain sentience and acknowledge the fact that they&#039;re just tools for humanity? Or eventually, will information be used as blackmail, or perhaps, rewards for favors? Are we summoning a savior or a demon?<br><br>Discuss.","filename":"Architects","ext":".jpg","w":4710,"h":3099,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":164,"tim":1492140591498,"time":1492140591,"md5":"6UzCGLCSw\/g3rg2Xa0SB5g==","fsize":3475146,"resto":0,"id":"LH+iln42","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"singularity-is-near","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

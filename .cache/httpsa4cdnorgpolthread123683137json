Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1488223422556","ext":".png","w":264,"h":200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":189,"tim":1493677614747,"time":1493677614,"md5":"CZeJ6Dns1Hdbc+F3CtMj9A==","fsize":276085,"resto":0,"id":"iuo9Uoy6","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":6,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":123683373,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:28:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Atheism is the fastest shrinking religion in the world.<\/span><br>good, so sick of these people in my country","filename":"typical atheist","ext":".jpg","w":812,"h":960,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493677719164,"time":1493677719,"md5":"0SaNTwfYRZhhUIpNWl7Paw==","fsize":68482,"resto":123683137,"id":"x4Zu1ZWH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123683415,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:28:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"Linkara&#039;s a Christian, isn&#039;t he?","time":1493677737,"resto":123683137,"id":"JjDwH8MY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123683604,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:30:21","name":"SAGE","com":"This thread again...<br><br>SAGE","time":1493677821,"resto":123683137,"id":"fLwNfXXp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123683916,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:32:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123683604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123683604<\/a>","filename":"bye","ext":".png","w":413,"h":385,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":116,"tim":1493677967501,"time":1493677967,"md5":"acdWV4myLTCMJidJOK4Vaw==","fsize":333282,"resto":123683137,"id":"x4Zu1ZWH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123684080,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:33:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123683415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123683415<\/a><br>He sure is.

Women lack reason and accountability. You can be as &quot;alpha&quot; as you like, you can be as dominating to a woman and lead the relationship as firmly as you so please, but women are driven by impulse. Confidence, physical ability, appearance, and status all apply to getting a woman, but if another man can trigger those impulses, women will leap on them, regardless of how &quot;alpha&quot; their current man is.<br><br>MGTOW understand this. That&#039;s the whole reason they are &quot;Men Going Their Own Way&quot; to begin with. Everyone has their own reasons, but at the end of the day, they don&#039;t want to deal with the stress and crippling depression of doing everything they can to get and maintain a relationship (which to them is already a logical clusterfuck) just to have it lost due to a woman being a woman, and fucking it up because impulses.","filename":"1487505752877","ext":".jpg","w":639,"h":495,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1490759701224,"time":1490759701,"md5":"n9POqzDuEcwZzzbFlTELWg==","fsize":36611,"resto":118740632,"id":"Gi9iCxwu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118743691,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)23:56:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118742659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118742659<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This is a politics board<\/span><br>We&#039;re talking about gender politics and philosophy, genius.

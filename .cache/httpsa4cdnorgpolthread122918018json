America on the other hand was perfect, holding a large sphere of influence and being an attractive country full of promise. Russian meddling in anything has always been PRO-RUSSIAN, never Pro-Israel, Pro-Globalism, etc. So of course the ZOG called for a witch-hunt of &quot;Communists&quot; in America, so that nothing could ever get in the way of what was to be the beginning of a Jewish Global Empire. Degeneracy started in the West at the behest of the Jewish masters, it has nothing to do with the ghost of the Soviet Union. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Muslims are degenerate and must be wiped out.<\/span><br>Not entirely wrong but certainly misguided, Muslims have always been the way they are and have not been a problem to the West until Israel was created and started land-grabbing. There is absolutely no need for any Western powers to be meddling in the Middle-East, yet a reason is always created for Israel to be allowed to spread it&#039;s legs in sovereign territory. All anti-Islam rhetoric is Jewish propaganda aimed at infuriating Goyim to generate support for wars in the East. All pro-Islam rhetoric is aimed at infuriating the other spectrum of Goyim to generate support for wars in the East. Islam must be isolated and kept out with strong borders and strong immigration policies, not because it is &quot;degenerate&quot; but because it is not culturally European and has no place in Europe.","filename":"red-pill","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493231332634,"time":1493231332,"md5":"XDBjdIcsJvj7KTAcnBxrdw==","fsize":830765,"resto":0,"id":"yYH+8VWK","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpill-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122918174,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:29:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122918018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122918018<\/a><br>The Earth is spherical in shape.","filename":"1491581933058","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493231390034,"time":1493231390,"md5":"6YL6LShtGmsHxvTLXBs8vw==","fsize":150790,"resto":122918018,"id":"Z\/X4PiSD","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

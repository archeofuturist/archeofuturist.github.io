I voted hillary. I checked any box that had a D for Democrat next to the name. Then Hillary lost, a ton of the people who had D for Democrat next to their name lost, and my mom started to go a bit crazy, about how someone needed to assassinate trump and about how she supported his supporters being assaulted or shot in the street, and that went against everything she had said so far. She had said oh I&#039;m so worried when Hillary wins trump supporters are going to be rioting in the street burning shit going after Hillary supporters, trying to assassinate her, blaming the loss on outside forces etc etc. Now she is doing the exact same thing. So my mind was in a twist, this was right before I moved out, I was still under her roof I was still under her indoctrination so I passed it as russia had interfered, and my mom was like trump needs to be impeached and when I said he had won pipe down she beat my ass, shoved me into a wall and threatened to end the family line by smashing my nuts because she didn&#039;t want to have her line end up as a bunch of fascists and sexists and racists and homophobes, and, well, that was a real eye opener. I had a really good friend from high school named Justice, and he recommended me to stuff like Chris Ray Gun and Sargon of Akkad, and as I listened I found myself agreeing completely. I brought it up with my mom and she was so livid that she had a nazi for a son and she went and cried in her room.

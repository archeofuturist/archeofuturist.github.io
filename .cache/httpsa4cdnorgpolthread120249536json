Oh wow they are going after gangbangers and pedos. A couple hundred guys a week, its so much winning I can&#039;t contain it. Meanwhile probably thousands flooded into this country this week.<br><br>The deportations need to ramp up tenfold, twentyfold, or even more before I give a fuck. Read about Operation Wetback. THAT is what the feds are capable of doing but Trump is choosing not to because he is controlled.<br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120209849#p120214261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120214261<\/a> #<br>You have nothing to say, no argument to make. The truth is 368 people is laughably low, just a drop in the water. It is a betrayal of his promise. <br><br>Face it.<br><br>Pic related is Kelly and Sessions saying that ICE doesn&#039;t do seeeps and indiscriminate arrests, despite that being the historical way of getting illegals. <br><br>Besides leftist kevetching, I have not seen proof of mass deportation. As much as i want to get rid of &quot;bad hombres&quot;, criminal aliens only account for 20% of illegal aliens. ICE is only targeting criminal aliens and aliens with deportation orders, leaving no resources for sweeps or employer sanctions. <br><br>With the resources spent tracking down one bad hombre, ICE could have went to 50 construction sites and netted thousands of illegals. <br><br>But they don&#039;t. Heck, even Kelly and Sessions admitted that ICE does not engage in sweeps or other indiscriminate arrest practices. <br><br>To get rid of 10 million illegal aliens in 4 years, ICE needs to arrest an average of 7K a day. They are not only nowhere near that but aren&#039;t even trying. <br><br>The nature of immigration enforcement demands indiscriminate arrests. <br><br>I&#039;m disappointed in Trump because immigration was the biggest reason I voted for him.","filename":"IMG_8478","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":637,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":248,"tim":1491719023417,"time":1491719023,"md5":"YE6ltcQl0HNqhqmQQsAeEw==","fsize":86729,"resto":0,"id":"h2JYlHET","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trumps-not-winning-on-immigration","country_name":"United

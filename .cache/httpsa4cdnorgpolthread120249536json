The truth is 368 people is laughably low, just a drop in the water. It is a betrayal of his promise. <br><br>Face it.<br><br>Pic related is Kelly and Sessions saying that ICE doesn&#039;t do seeeps and indiscriminate arrests, despite that being the historical way of getting illegals. <br><br>Besides leftist kevetching, I have not seen proof of mass deportation. As much as i want to get rid of &quot;bad hombres&quot;, criminal aliens only account for 20% of illegal aliens. ICE is only targeting criminal aliens and aliens with deportation orders, leaving no resources for sweeps or employer sanctions. <br><br>With the resources spent tracking down one bad hombre, ICE could have went to 50 construction sites and netted thousands of illegals. <br><br>But they don&#039;t. Heck, even Kelly and Sessions admitted that ICE does not engage in sweeps or other indiscriminate arrest practices. <br><br>To get rid of 10 million illegal aliens in 4 years, ICE needs to arrest an average of 7K a day. They are not only nowhere near that but aren&#039;t even trying. <br><br>The nature of immigration enforcement demands indiscriminate arrests. <br><br>I&#039;m disappointed in Trump because immigration was the biggest reason I voted for him.","filename":"IMG_8478","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":637,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":248,"tim":1491719023417,"time":1491719023,"md5":"YE6ltcQl0HNqhqmQQsAeEw==","fsize":86729,"resto":0,"id":"h2JYlHET","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trumps-not-winning-on-immigration","country_name":"United States","replies":23,"images":3,"unique_ips":14},{"no":120249827,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:26:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120249536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120249536<\/a><br>anyone else pic related?","filename":"1467910663389","ext":".png","w":800,"h":1003,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491719218893,"time":1491719218,"md5":"R5KLjmhMGf5mdflPzXrPXg==","fsize":561507,"resto":120249536,"id":"+OWdkYeE","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120250733,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:37:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;120250418<\/span><br>bump","time":1491719851,"resto":120249536,"id":"+OWdkYeE","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120250756,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:37:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;120249591<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Reddit spacing<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;criticizing Trump<\/span><br><br>Pick one.","time":1491719868,"resto":120249536,"id":"05O5ba28","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120250835,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:38:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;120249591<\/span><br><span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;120250418<\/span><br><br>Enjoy your bans","time":1491719918,"resto":120249536,"id":"05O5ba28","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120250853,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:38:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120250756\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120250756<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Reddit<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Loving Trump<\/span>","time":1491719933,"resto":120249536,"id":"lwJhNlwN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120250936,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:39:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120250853\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120250853<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Let&#039;s show the nazi LARPers why we love daddy<\/span>","filename":"1491715669427","ext":".png","w":1079,"h":983,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":113,"tim":1491719997452,"time":1491719997,"md5":"ECnOYSazAUvLTKJ34Ra3tg==","fsize":454235,"resto":120249536,"id":"+OWdkYeE","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120251017,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:40:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;120249591<\/span><br>fpbp","time":1491720049,"resto":120249536,"id":"AyxppniW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120251033,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:41:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120250853\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120250853<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what is t_d?<\/span>","time":1491720062,"resto":120249536,"id":"05O5ba28","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120251136,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:42:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120251033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120251033<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a single subleddit<\/span><br>Where were you going with this?","time":1491720126,"resto":120249536,"id":"jt1Tramb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120251245,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:43:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120250936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120250936<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;posting you&#039;re own post to reddit<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;screenshotting it and reposting it here<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;saving it with a 4chan filename as to appear as though you saved it from another thread<\/span><br><br>sad","time":1491720200,"resto":120249536,"id":"yPu2WRAG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120251263,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:43:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120249536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120249536<\/a><br>Aren&#039;t the statistics saying that currently Mexican-American Immigration (including illegal) is at a net negative?","time":1491720214,"resto":120249536,"id":"\/VPlP6qb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120251280,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:43:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120250936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120250936<\/a><br>I agree with that anon&#039;s post","time":1491720226,"resto":120249536,"id":"lwJhNlwN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120251390,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)02:45:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120249536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120249536<\/a><br>This is why I&#039;ve lost my patience with the faggot.<br>He&#039;s all talk no action.

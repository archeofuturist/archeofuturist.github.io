Business owners, people with children and grandchildren etc. What we have is 20 somethings voting for things that affect future generations without having children (and never planning on having children) that want to live off welfare\/their blogging for the rest of their lives. If that happened you would see a sharp turn towards conservative ideals across the board. Parents and people that actually have a legacy of any sort care about the future further than &quot;My feelings are hurt&quot;.","time":1493863546,"resto":124000443,"id":"BacygS\/y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124001980,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:05:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124001865\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124001865<\/a><br>Or we could just go full Hamilton and be a true republic","time":1493863556,"resto":124000443,"id":"61kc0\/UI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124002056,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:06:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124000443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124000443<\/a><br>and who decides who is qualified?","time":1493863594,"resto":124000443,"id":"5qWnUWn7","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124002273,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:08:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Only property owners should be allowed to vote","time":1493863716,"resto":124000443,"id":"a+q2mMYK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124002369,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:09:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124001865\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124001865<\/a><br>No, a republic is.

You leave out in talking about The Republic than in Socrates&#039; perfect city, there is a class system. He goes on to say in summary: <br><br>Wealth and poverty cause a lust for luxury and un-devoted work. This is prevented by a system of three societal classes. Each class does what they do well and is happy in their occupation. The city will not be too big to be governed and will have the ability to fight a wealthier city keeping outside influence put as a result of the utilization of warriors. <br><br>This does not represent our thought of freedom but puts people in these three classes based on who they are and what they are good at. So a worker is places into a trade he is good at and given the luxuries to keep him happy. While warriors do not receive the same luxuries nor do the Guardians who steer the city from corruption. This concept in its self seems to work but as I stated could not be applied in todays society for obvious reasons.","time":1493863796,"resto":124000443,"id":"nkLEvU3E","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124002539,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:10:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124002273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124002273<\/a><br><br>So only everybody above 40?

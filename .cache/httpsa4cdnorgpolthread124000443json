You leave out in talking about The Republic than in Socrates&#039; perfect city, there is a class system. He goes on to say in summary: <br><br>Wealth and poverty cause a lust for luxury and un-devoted work. This is prevented by a system of three societal classes. Each class does what they do well and is happy in their occupation. The city will not be too big to be governed and will have the ability to fight a wealthier city keeping outside influence put as a result of the utilization of warriors. <br><br>This does not represent our thought of freedom but puts people in these three classes based on who they are and what they are good at. So a worker is places into a trade he is good at and given the luxuries to keep him happy. While warriors do not receive the same luxuries nor do the Guardians who steer the city from corruption.

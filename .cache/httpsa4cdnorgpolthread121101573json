The Jefferson\/Jackson democrats ran the south. remember who abolished the fed? It was put in place by the New England faction led by Hamilton and Adams. They were the pro-English party, Jeffersonians were pro-French. The major slave ports were all in the north, the (((shipping magnates))) were all based in Bedford, New York, and Boston. They were sold mostly to the south because that was the climate for tobacco and cotton. Northern economies did not rely on agrarian field labor, so when sjws claimed that niggers had souls, the message took root in the north first. The (((shipping magnates))) were happy to sell tlnorthern slaves to Southerners, rather than take a loss on their being freed, then import Irish immigrants to work in textile mills, refining slave-picked cotton in the north because it was literally too hot for factories until air-conditioning in much of the south. <br><br>The (((magnates))) used the produce from the textile mills to undercut the Indian textile market, which turned Britain against them. Once the magnates started to diversify into steel, railroads, and (((banking))), they didn&#039;t need the South&#039;s cotton for their textile mills, which were becoming less profitable due to stronger Indo-British competition, so they were ambivalent to abolitionism. They were not ambivalent to the idea of the white male landholder as bastion of the republic, they wanted middle class whites packed into cities and working in factories for subsistence wages. Destroying the South&#039;s economy by forcing them to give up slavery and cope with millions of ignorant unemployed savages seemed a great way to achieve this.","time":1492199137,"resto":121101573,"id":"wdklzyEu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121103259,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)15:45:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121103067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121103067<\/a><br>and we will be forced to deal with that fat fuck","filename":"loserwins","ext":".png","w":600,"h":749,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492199140412,"time":1492199140,"md5":"\/8j9\/yIpygQuifSSyufsyw==","fsize":833884,"resto":121101573,"id":"CnQvhxBu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121103260,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)15:45:41","name":"AMERICA FIRST","com":"<a href=\"#p121101573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121101573<\/a><br>1.

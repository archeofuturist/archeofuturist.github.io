In Fascism man is an individual who is the nation and the country. He is this by a moral law which embraces and binds together individuals and generations in an established tradition and mission, a moral law which suppresses the instinct to lead a life confined to a brief cycle of pleasure in order, instead, to replace it within the orbit of duty in a superior conception of life, free from the limits of time and space a life in which the individual by self-abnegation and by the sacrifice of his particular interests, even by death, realises the entirely spiritual existence in which his value as a man consists.","time":1490664469,"resto":118592065,"id":"s2JT+nEs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118592212,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:28:10","name":"FashFriend","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;ethical conception<\/span><br>This positive conception of life is evidently an ethical conception.

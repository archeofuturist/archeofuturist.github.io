It&#039;s always been that way. Personally, I dig both. Cats are better though if you live in a small place with no yard. Cats are also cheaper to care for, generally, and don&#039;t need to go outside to shit or pee. But it&#039;s more difficult for them to be comprehensive companions. If you want a cat to be comfy on a lead, or to easily travel in a car with you and take trips, etc., you need to train them from kittenhood. Can definitely be done though. I used to know a girl whose cat was very doglike. He would wear a harness when outside easily, and he was happy riding around in the car with her. He would even sit on her shoulder if she wanted--she had a leather piece made with straps for her shoulder so he could hold on without scratching her. Very very cool. It wasn&#039;t hard to train him, just necessary to start young, which she did. She had a pup too and they got along fine.","time":1490489622,"resto":118287481,"id":"je45vTAo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118298149,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)20:53:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;own a dog<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;love each other for years<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;one day just randomly goes for your jugular because he&#039;s having a bad day<\/span><br><br>hehe :)","time":1490489623,"resto":118287481,"id":"sC4+oE1C","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118298178,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)20:54:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118297167\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118297167<\/a><br><br>Can you train a dog to be beta around you, but alpha around numales?","time":1490489640,"resto":118287481,"id":"uQNO4V6x","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118298190,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)20:54:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"ITT: \/pol\/ LARPing as alpha males","time":1490489647,"resto":118287481,"id":"Ny587Ifw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118298204,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)20:54:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118296875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118296875<\/a><br><br>You can get toxo from uncooked vegetables or meat, even from gardening without gloves or washing your hands. <br><br>I think the only real danger is if you are immunocomprimised and the brain cysts get out of control.<br><br>The permanent effects aren&#039;t even that bad, some are even good:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;makes males less rule abiding and aggressive<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;makes females more nurturing<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;raises testosterone in males<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lower inhibition<\/span><br><br>While it is scary that there is a rampant parasite capable of altering your sentience, its not that bad as long as the immune system kicks in before it takes out big portions of your brain or eyes.","time":1490489655,"resto":118287481,"id":"JIRrtVRh","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118298244,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)20:54:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Dogs are a man&#039;s best friend.

They did usually clean up their shit because expensive tickets if they didn&#039;t, but it was still a pain in the ass. Constant barking all day long from the houses around me, made it hard to work or focus on anything. Luckily Berkeley police are usually bored when there are no demonstrations going on and the Oaktown nigs are at home sleeping or doing SF for the weekend, so I could usually get a response from them on noise complaints.<br><br>Still a huge pain though. Lesbians especially love big mean dogs. This one couple who lived behind me had a bunch of rottweilers that kept trying to get over my fence and kill me and my cat and dog (I had an Aussie shepherd, awesome doggo and loved my cat like a brother.) Anyway, the lesbo dogs got into a neighbor&#039;s yard and killed his cat, so he sued and won. That was cool.

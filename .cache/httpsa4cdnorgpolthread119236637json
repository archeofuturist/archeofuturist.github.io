It&#039;s not scientific, a scientist doesn&#039;t go out in the world looking for evidence to verify what they already believe.

The government has chosen to commission a useless illegitimate study, that is the choice they made. So now we can repeat to everybody we know the implicit bias in the study, so when it comes back, people take it with a grain of salt, and see it for the propaganda piece it is. People need to know Liberals are trying to fly shit like this under the radar, and they aren&#039;t a trustworthy bunch, and they intentionally try to conduct bias studies. <br><br>They could have fixed the language. Conservatives were willing to go along with this, in light of the mosque shooting, if they just fixed the language. This could have been a non-partisan effort. They didn&#039;t go for it though, because ultimately, they wanted the study to be bias. That&#039;s the entire point. To commission a study that verifies what you already believe, not to discover the truth. Then to use the bias study to justify changes in law.","time":1491184769,"resto":119236637,"country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119276926,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)22:02:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119265698\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119265698<\/a><br>Harper did this too though.

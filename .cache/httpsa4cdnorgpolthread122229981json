We&#039;re both 20, I always lived in the city and he lived in the country part. He grew up very redneck around a lot of redneck people, even dresses like a redneck. <br><br>Then BAM out of nowhere he&#039;s full on liberal. Dresses like a liberal, talks like a liberal, and is even going to college for liberal arts. He acts like he hasn&#039;t known me for the past 20 years and hates everyone that&#039;s white despite him being white. He hangs out with other degenerate self-hating whites that dye their hair and wear nose-rings and such.<br><br>Anyone else here ever have a problem similar to this? If so please tell. Sorry I needed to vent, but I really feel like kicking his ass.","filename":"1492752756140","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492831855534,"time":1492831855,"md5":"E10rOrSa8Hib7L3xH71H1Q==","fsize":35302,"resto":0,"id":"T6VvqD7b","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-live-in-texas-and-i-have-a-cousin-that-also","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

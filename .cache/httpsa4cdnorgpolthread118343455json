The existence of John the Baptist within the same time frame as Jesus, and his eventual execution by Herod Antipas is attested to by 1st-century historian Josephus and the overwhelming majority of modern scholars view Josephus&#039; accounts of the activities of John the Baptist as authentic. One of the arguments in favor of the historicity of the Baptism of Jesus by John is the criterion of embarrassment, i.e. that it is a story which the early Christian Church would have never wanted to invent. Another argument used in favour of the historicity of the baptism is that multiple accounts refer to it, usually called the criterion of multiple attestation. Technically, multiple attestation does not guarantee authenticity, but only determines antiquity. However, for most scholars, together with the criterion of embarrassment it lends credibility to the baptism of Jesus by John being a historical event.","time":1490529225,"resto":118343455,"id":"iV0hXQiL","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118354271,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)07:54:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118354178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118354178<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;greentext non-arguments topped off with a meme and an image macro<\/span><br><br>Not an argument.","time":1490529247,"resto":118343455,"id":"iHaqXnBm","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118354287,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)07:54:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118354178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118354178<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Yet another Christian admitting that if he didn&#039;t believe in God he&#039;d be touching kids<\/span><br><br>Get help, pervert.

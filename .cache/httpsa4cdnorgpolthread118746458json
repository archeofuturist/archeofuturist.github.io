Russia hacked the US election with fake news? What fake news is that? They can&#039;t even cite a single piece of evidence. Not a single fucking thing. Every single thing that Trump mentioned about Hillary is true. Obamacare isn&#039;t working well, Hillary&#039;s record as SoS was a joke. Her husband signed NAFTA. She supported Syrian immigration. The left supports open borders and anyone who questions is racist. There isn&#039;t a single piece of &quot;&quot;&quot;fake&quot;&quot;&quot; news they can point to. What knowledge or ideas about Hillary that people think is fake?","time":1490763491,"resto":118746458,"id":"Uiz5fUio","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

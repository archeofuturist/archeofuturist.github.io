The answers simple though, Germany shafted Germany no matter how you cut it, you goys purposely stoked the fire with Russian revolutionaries during WW1 which led to a communist state and backfired massively, Frankfort, etc, you literally poured gas on the fire you later fought that&#039;s now worldwide and blame everyone but yourselves. I don&#039;t know why Germany is worshipped by white supremacist when its actions directly aided in the creation of communism.<br><br>If the whole of Europe were to turn on you and break you up, it&#039;d be justified and sadly better for the German people at this point. I&#039;m gunning for an eastern German breakaway\/autonomous state since they&#039;re at terminal woke status and seem to more or less believe hitler wud a gud boi dindu nuffins wrong.","time":1493413597,"resto":123234489,"id":"btCRymij","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123245515,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)17:08:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123234489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123234489<\/a><br>Give me citizenship and a qt blue eyed German wife and I&#039;m there senpai","time":1493413689,"resto":123234489,"id":"k5GTD1nD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123245610,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)17:09:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123234489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123234489<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no guns<\/span><br>Yeah count me out","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1493413743320,"time":1493413743,"md5":"7dOASWVJSZ79j3qgZbWaug==","fsize":575090,"resto":123234489,"id":"L+4\/nXHE","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123245648,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)17:09:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123234489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123234489<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hard to learn language<\/span><br>German isn&#039;t very difficult to pick up.<br><br>Anyway, I&#039;d want guns to be allowed and a buxom blond","time":1493413760,"resto":123234489,"id":"XsvOvjwU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123245652,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)17:09:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123239645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123239645<\/a><br>So London is indicative of the demographics of England?","time":1493413760,"resto":123234489,"id":"jhTxcHJf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123245787,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)17:10:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123245648\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123245648<\/a><br>I wish I still had a link to that essay Mark Twain wrote about how god awful of a language German is to learn.","time":1493413823,"resto":123234489,"id":"76r2Mz2Y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123245940,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)17:11:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123234489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123234489<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;simple and delicious food<\/span><br><br>KEK, kys krautnigger","time":1493413884,"resto":123234489,"id":"e9WilQNo","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":123245955,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)17:11:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"It would definitely give my life a lot more meaning","time":1493413890,"resto":123234489,"id":"uY1G+laU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123245979,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)17:11:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123234489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123234489<\/a><br>guns basically.","time":1493413904,"resto":123234489,"id":"SwcMb6l5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123246420,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)17:15:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; No guns<\/span><br>The fuck you say?

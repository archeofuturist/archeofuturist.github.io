These &quot;shitskins&quot; you love to hate make up a majority of the world and you have tried to hold them back for much too long. You are a useless minority of people in a diverse world. More white people are realizing this and deciding to not have children, to send their children to become educated in a diverse world, or to deny their whiteness and apologize for their disgusting behavior for so long. My mother was smart in encouraging me to experience diversity, and in turn I realized that I was (and will always be) a large part of the problems with this world.","time":1493345240,"resto":123120604,"id":"FwbG2em1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123128798,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)22:08:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123125323\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123125323<\/a><br>Why is it only white countries need diversity?

He has realized that he is flawed due to generations of white pride and power and is stepping aside for others. More and more of us will follow, to show that whiteness is not a virtue. I recommend you become educated and see what we have done as a people and why that can&#039;t stand. If not, your children will eventually chose to do so.

They&#039;re pissed and preach you garbage, because their meager paychecks depend upon it.<br><br>Anectode. Talked to a successfull woman today with no college education who works for a college, which gave her child discounted tuition. Her daugher wants to pursue the same field her mother is in, but had NO SKILLS AT ALL. She is going to move back with her mum. Her SUCCESSFUL mum. Who saw past the bullshit and knewher daughter would come out of higher education USELESS to the world. She unfortunately did not see the victimhood, self hating Indoctrination. <br><br>She knows her daughter hates her, because she has a job and is sucessful.<br><br>Pray for the her mother, please. She is a good person who saw reality too late for her daugher. (And will now have to let the sniveling little entitled ass move back in. She is very kind and loves her daughter.)","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492837909510,"time":1492837909,"md5":"7VMSI1wQCTAzhkFxj8qQDA==","fsize":34937,"resto":0,"id":"ss5mcxdo","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-you-graduating-high-school-im-talking-to-you","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122239827,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)01:14:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;d say go to university and become a high-school teacher.

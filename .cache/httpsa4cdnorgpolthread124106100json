The announcement was made hours after Yanukovich\u2019s lawyer Yury Kirasir published a letter by the international police organization confirming the end of search, which he said was politically motivated. Yanukovich, who has been living in Russia since he escaped the coup in Ukraine in 2014, was accused of embezzling public funds by the new Ukrainian authorities. Ukrainian military prosecutor\u2019s office said Thursday that it will demand a life sentence for Yanukovich, who was also accused of high treason, TASS said.","time":1493931154,"resto":124106100,"id":"QNGZ2V9X","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":124108647,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)16:52:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124108296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124108296<\/a><br>True, haven&#039;t seen anyone that could be called &quot;a diplomat&quot; from US in ages.","filename":"halo tu bre\u017aniew xd","ext":".png","w":610,"h":528,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1493931176131,"time":1493931176,"md5":"syr7E9Kx7ycjmpRjzxvPiw==","fsize":933909,"resto":124106100,"id":"F0At9cZg","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":124108670,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)16:53:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124107316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124107316<\/a>","filename":"284038","ext":".jpg","w":995,"h":709,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":89,"tim":1493931185040,"time":1493931185,"md5":"yBHb3560fwjBMsPRsbqMyQ==","fsize":108550,"resto":124106100,"id":"rhPBjvvg","country":"ID","country_name":"Indonesia"},{"no":124108676,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)16:53:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124108296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124108296<\/a><br>iirc, they have an ambassador observing the meetings.","time":1493931188,"resto":124106100,"id":"s9pMpEXl","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":124108693,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)16:53:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Iraqi Army opens new front in Mosul, advancing on Islamic State<br>Iraqi troops reportedly opened a new front against Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS, ISIL) terrorists in Mosul and advanced on their enclave from the northwest on Thursday, according to Reuters, citing an unnamed military commander.

I apologise for wasting your time in advance, but some nitwit seems to insist that simple logic is completely backwards.<br><br>So, let me lay down the groundwork.<br><br>Anarchism: belief in the abolition of all government and the organization of society on a voluntary, cooperative basis without recourse to force or compulsion.<br><br>Libertarianism: an extreme laissez-faire political philosophy advocating only minimal state intervention in the lives of citizens.<br><br>Noting this, would you say that libertarianism, promoting reduced governmental control, happens to contain anarchism, promoting zero governmental control?<br><br>Secondly.<br><br>Anarcho-Communism: &quot;Anarcho-Communism is a theory of anarchism which advocates the abolition of the state, capitalism, wage labour, and private property (while retaining respect for personal property), and in favor of common ownership of the means of production, direct democracy, and a horizontal network of voluntary associations and workers&#039; councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: &quot;from each according to his ability, to each according to his need&quot;.&quot;<br><br>Since anarcho-Communism is a classification of anarchism, if anarchism is a classification of libertarianism, does it or does it not logically follow that anarcho-Communism is a classification of libertarianism? Ignore any personal biases. It doesn&#039;t matter if they&#039;re that weird fringe class nobody wants to be associated with, if they are still a class.<br><br>Again, I am sorry for wasting your time, but logic wasn&#039;t penetrating this guy&#039;s brain and he absolutely insisted that I consult you guys.

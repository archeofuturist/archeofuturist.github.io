How different languages have common origins or how apparently vastly different languages have things in common. How language shapes the culture of the people who speak it and vice versa. The field is all but small.<br><br> It is no different than studying nature, only that you are studying a construct of a part of nature (human construct), not how nature works (physics) or how to use it (engineering).<br><br>I am an electrical engineer and I find studying a language quite fascinating. You get to see how another people think and express themselves, how their culture seethes through their language and in turn, how my own language works. <br><br>Of course, for every genuine linguist with a PhD that shows real interest in the field there are hundreds if not thousands of people who just went to study a language to get a relatively easy diploma.","filename":"1434312090813","ext":".png","w":500,"h":371,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1492720581316,"time":1492720581,"md5":"EtjEgs5R\/cE1uF2FH9\/UgQ==","fsize":211474,"resto":122029350,"id":"xUmtrGWo","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":122040160,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:37:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122036728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122036728<\/a><br>flawed argument, the fields on the left teach communism","time":1492720638,"resto":122029350,"id":"cmBl+oNc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres to address what the lawmakers call entrenched bias against Israel at the world body.<br><br>The unanimous message notes that the United States is the largest contributor to the United Nations but does not threaten the withholding of U.S. dues. Still, it uses strong language to insist that the United Nations rectify what the senators said is unequal treatment of Israel on human rights and other grounds.<br><br>\u201cThrough words and actions, we urge you to ensure that Israel is treated neither better nor worse than any other U.N. member in good standing,\u201d the letter said.<br><br>The letter was obtained Thursday by The Washington Post.<br><br>\u201cAs both the U.N.\u2019s principal founding member and its largest contributor, the United States should insist on reform,\u201d the letter read. \u201cWe are deeply committed to international leadership and to advancing respect for human rights.

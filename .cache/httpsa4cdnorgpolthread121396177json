Most literal Nazis in the US are basically just guys that want an excuse to get into fights and aren&#039;t into sports. They aren&#039;t scared by the prospect of violence, that&#039;s literally what they&#039;re in it for.<br><br>Trump supporters, meanwhile, are a huge portion of the US population and a lot of them are feeling pretty marginalized by the media, the left, etc.<br><br>Like most people, Trump supporters will react violently if you attack them. They will rally together and fight back.<br><br>Except since you also punched Nazis, what you&#039;re doing is creating an intense bond-by-combat between Trump supporters and Nazis. It&#039;s easy to get a Trump supporter to say he hates Nazis, its a lot harder to get him to say he hates the guy that had his back in a fight, Nazi or not. That bond is basically the only way to convert your average Trump supporter to Nazism.<br><br>To be honest, the radical left is so fucking inept at political strategy that I&#039;m beginning to see them as being less of a potential threat than the authoritarian right. They&#039;re going to make themselves irrelevant.","filename":"1492351924701","ext":".png","w":750,"h":748,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492368648590,"time":1492368648,"md5":"rtkS7VQlFZMveAnJKMQ33w==","fsize":1690357,"resto":0,"id":"Q0TVKVnu","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"these-guys-the-antifa-that-is-legit-have-the","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":121397171,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)14:58:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Don&#039;t interrupt your enemy when they&#039;re making a mistake.

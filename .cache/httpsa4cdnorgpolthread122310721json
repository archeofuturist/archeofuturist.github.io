I was a high achieving student and athlete when I was younger, but when I entered college I slipped into depression and found myself in a state of apathy after coming out of it. What motivates you to succeed in today&#039;s harsh, male-persecuting western society in which there is no reward for your hard work? All I ever wanted out of life was a wife and children, but this goal seems to be a fantasy, as I witness the relationships of my friends and extended family fall apart. Why should I work so hard to reach my fullest career potential when the end result will only be long hours, misery, and stress, without even a family to spend my enormous salary on? <br>Btw, Im 19, 5\/10, muscular 5&#039;8&quot;, if that helps for perspective. I realize that this post is edgy, but it is genuine. My longterm life plan is to teach english abroad and find an asian or eastern european wife before settling back in America. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 cringe<\/span>","filename":"feelguy","ext":".png","w":450,"h":450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492886671956,"time":1492886671,"md5":"V9grp8hfkkAkfB91CISEuA==","fsize":18074,"resto":0,"id":"NDZTKOvW","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpilled-into-depression","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122310853,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:45:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122310721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122310721<\/a><br>cringe","time":1492886747,"resto":122310721,"id":"laQzrxnX","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122311051,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:47:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122310721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122310721<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What motivates you to succeed in today&#039;s harsh, male-persecuting western society in which there is no reward for your hard work?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;needing external validation<\/span><br><br>Time to become a man son","time":1492886842,"resto":122310721,"id":"A+US\/jk5","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122311732,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:53:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"I focus my anger and anxiety and try to do productive things with it.

Conventional warfare, Muslims are easily defeated and attack soft targets, and Jews typically get others to fight their own battles for them. If whites can realize the strength they possess, both of those can be defeated, but (((the true threat))) will always be the foe that attacks you in the spiritual court, because that is where Satan resides.<br><br>The way angels and demons do warfare is by converting followers, demons believe in the importance of dominating the spiritual court, which is why they understand how important it is to spread atheism and attack church structure. Christians understand how important that realm is as well as they are fighting alongside the angels, but France has become far too secular...

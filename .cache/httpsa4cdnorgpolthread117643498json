Applicants have to apply and prove that they are either receiving certain types of government benefits, such as Medicaid, or have household incomes at or below 135 percent of the poverty line. Using 2009 poverty guidelines, that\u2019s $14,620 for an individual and a little under $30,000 for a family of four, with slightly higher amounts for Alaska and Hawaii.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SafeLink is run by a subsidiary of Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil, the world\u2019s fourth largest wireless company in terms of subscribers, but it is not paid for directly by the company. Nor is it paid for with &quot;tax payer money,&quot; as the e-mail claims. Rather, it is funded through the Universal Service Fund, which is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company, an independent, not-for-profit corporation set up by the Federal Communications Commission. The USF is sustained by contributions from telecommunications companies such as &quot;long distance companies, local telephone companies, wireless telephone companies, paging companies, and payphone providers.&quot; The companies often charge customers to fund their contributions in the form of a universal service fee you might see on your monthly phone bill. The fund is then parceled out to companies, such as Am\u00e9rica M\u00f3vil, that create programs, such as SafeLink, to provide telecommunications service to rural areas and low-income households.<\/span><br><br>I saw someone link the safelink website for free phones and it got me curious.

But the program is rooted in a deeper history.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When phone lines were first laid out in the late 19th century, they were not always inter-operable. That is to say the phone service created by one company to serve one town may not have been compatible with the phone service of another company serving a different town nearby. The telecom companies themselves saw the folly in this arrangement, and so in 1913, AT&amp;T committed itself to resolving interconnection problems as part of the &quot;Kingsbury Commitment.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That common goal of universal service became a goal of universal access to service when Congress passed The Telecommunications Act of 1934. The act created the FCC and also included in its preamble a promise &quot;to make available, so far as possible, to all the people of the United States, a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\u201d There was a fear, expressed by telecom companies themselves, that market forces alone might encourage companies to pass on providing service to hard-to-reach places. This would both hurt the people who wouldn\u2019t have service as well as existing customers who wouldn\u2019t be able to reach them. So the new FCC was tasked with promoting this principle of &quot;universal service.&quot;<\/span>","time":1490115592,"resto":117643498,"id":"XTL5y9jb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117643712,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)13:00:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;This informal practice was codified when the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC) was created as part of the 1996 Telecommunications Act to &quot;ensure all Americans, including low-income consumers and those who live in rural, insular, high cost areas, shall have affordable service and [to] help to connect eligible schools, libraries, and rural health care providers to the global telecommunications network.&quot; The USAC includes four programs to serve rural areas, high cost areas, rural health care providers, and schools and libraries. Since 1997, USAC has provided discounted land line service to low-income individuals. (A more limited program to offer assistance to low-income individuals was created a decade earlier; the telecommunications act expanded and formalized it.) According to Eric Iversen, USAC director of external relations, the Universal Service Fund more recently began funding programs that provide wireless service, such as the pre-paid cellular SafeLink program mentioned in the chain e-mail.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The president has no direct impact on the program, and one could hardly call these devices &quot;Obama Phones,&quot; as the e-mail author does.

We are going to set the record straight.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes and no.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How\u2019s that for clarity? The confusion arises because it depends upon whether or not you think a mandated fee tacked on to the phone bills of virtually almost every American is a tax or not. Some say it is, and some say it isn\u2019t.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Federal Law requires telecom companies to contribute to the Universal Service Fund (USF), which in turn pays for the free cell phones program, in addition to funding telecommunications services (including high-speed Internet access) for eligible schools, libraries and rural health care providers.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A law of economics is that any tax on a corporation always results in the tax being paid by the consumer \u2014 taxes are always passed on. And this is the case with the telecom companies \u201ccontribution\u201d to the USF. These companies collect the money from everyone that pays for phone service by tacking on a few cents to every phone bill. It\u2019s listed on those bills as the Universal Service Fund.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To put it simply, the U.S. Federal government has mandated that every phone bill include this charge. And the charge, in part, pays companies who provide free cell phones for the poor \u2014 like Safelink, Assurance, and ReachOut \u2014 for each customer they sign up \u2014 some money for the phone and then an amount for each month of service.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Some consider a federally government mandated fee that funds government programs a tax, and some consider it a fee. We think the answer depends upon which side of the politically-charge government phone giveaway you are on.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What do we think? To be honest, to us a tax and a federally mandated fee are one and the same \u2014 so call it whichever you which. But that doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t think this is a valuable program for those in need.

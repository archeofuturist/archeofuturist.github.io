GL has no other options to get into power, the VVD can swith to the CU, make some socio-cultural consessions to these Christian soft-theocrats while reaffirming their pro-EU pro-corporatist agenda.

So I&#039;ll concede that having broad terminology for theories is a good thing when discussing politics, but a very bad thing when discussing a single issue (like this one) and who might be &#039;responsible&#039;. It doesn&#039;t matter. &quot;The left&quot; or whatever, the discussions continues. The purity of the terminology is not relevant to what&#039;s happening directly. It&#039;s extremely relevant when you talk about groups of people, like how you like to be a &quot;leftist&quot; but not THIS kind of leftist. It&#039;s enough that you hate this sort of thing. I don&#039;t hate leftists who still believe in equality of opportunity and some sense of equality before the law. We have moved so, so far from that in these matters. Baudet is playing a dangerous game and I hope he&#039;s ready for what&#039;s coming.","filename":"1489849397795","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":683,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490701270764,"time":1490701270,"md5":"co1BYFXWzECBUC7z6HL3kQ==","fsize":83793,"resto":118616298,"id":"OpsqCdVv","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118640326,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)07:41:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118638982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118638982<\/a><br><br>I can appreciate his video&#039;s, but sometimes he&#039;s too simplistic\/hamfisted, as are most YouTube e-celebs.<br><br>I was never a total leftwing zealot, but I think two people were central to exposing a lot of the cliched talking points that I acquired through social osmosis instead of reason: Sam Harris and Karen Straughan.

Both Wilders and Baudet are explicitly anti-establishment, with Wilders being anti-Islam to boot and Baudet a weak-assed mix of anti-immigration and maybe some sexism, who knows. The people who hate them are able to throw them together not because of what Wilders says, although they use it, but because their worldview really IS that retardedly binary. They picture the right as an amalgamation of racism, bigotry, fear, hatred and aggression and all that. It is specifically the case that they are not interested in nuance, because they reason that Baudet can &quot;signal&quot; something &quot;racisty&quot; and such. It does not matter if Baudet clarifies any of his positions, they will group him with &quot;the bad guys&quot; anyway. It&#039;s similar to how a card-carrying leftist can stand up and doubt immigration and they will say that that COMMENT is right-wingy racisty, and then proceed to be unable to distinguish between the person and what they see as real danger.<br><br>So, I&#039;m saying it&#039;s impossible to tell controlled opposition from actual opposition when what they are opposing has every interest of reducing the complexity of the enemy to nothing.

The ensuing debate will derail the topic, like we have here, since it is essentially a deconstructionist attitude (&quot;we don&#039;t know what we&#039;re talking about, gotta dig deeper, meanwhile not talking about it&quot;).

My point is simply that the convenience of the situation for the establishment is not enough to say that they orchestrated it. These things happen because of enormous glaciers moving in the population, and any reactionary movement will start fringe and then explode, and then will spawn a resurgence of their polar opposite (see GL). It&#039;s the same as has happened many times over with the center collapsing, currently in other countries in europe but also throughout history (last time being the 30s probably). <br><br>Your example of them putting FvD behind the PVV is a good one though, and I believe that they do such things at least partially on purpose. But like I said in my previous comment, this is also a result of how some people view the world (good vs bad) and how the party is fringe for a reason. It&#039;s very easy to spot malice on a small scale (like specific anti-FvD bloggers) but these people are not orchestrating anything. It always happens that a reactionary movement grows as the discard pile of those people that the establishment refuses to acknowledge.","filename":"1463991629149","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490704593329,"time":1490704593,"md5":"kdOYl3238N7GDEwZejU\/yQ==","fsize":44242,"resto":118616298,"id":"OpsqCdVv","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118644421,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:37:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Jezus Christus, wie is die dikke walvis?","time":1490704670,"resto":118616298,"id":"ITZOMuSD","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118644704,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:41:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118640914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118640914<\/a><br><br>Mykeru&#039;s video&#039;s might be hard to understand if you weren&#039;t closely aware of the clusterfuck that was the &#039;infighting&#039; withint the atheist\/skeptic community 5\/6 years back.<br><br>Noelplum also makes well-thougt out video&#039;s, that go much deeper than your average run of the mill Sargon clone.","time":1490704888,"resto":118616298,"id":"w6qNsl7g","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118645044,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:46:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118644421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118644421<\/a><br>valt wel mee","filename":"BelgianMOH_eat_healthyboys","ext":".jpg","w":858,"h":536,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1490705188674,"time":1490705188,"md5":"HPF5GtNwBEa81NI02697Lg==","fsize":58169,"resto":118616298,"id":"2tGXnw+g","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118645145,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:47:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118644704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118644704<\/a><br>I remember that, I might have been pretty young but I was a hardcore fanboy back in those days.<br><br>Not an expert on it, but I think I could follow them.","time":1490705273,"resto":118616298,"id":"ZecLIavE","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118645597,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:53:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;dvw mijn kamerfu steeds in beeld komt<\/span>","filename":"Anne-Kuik-1024x618","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":618,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1490705626804,"time":1490705626,"md5":"y56mbh1hvjv4kSDDw3Q+oA==","fsize":111502,"resto":118616298,"id":"TBbqAce6","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118645754,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:55:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Terwijl we NU spreken worden er nieuwe artikelen getypt over Thierry en Hiddema.<br><br>Ze zullen een catastrofale impact hebben.<br><br>We gaan jullie helemaal kapot maken.","filename":"IMG_8123","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":630,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1490705759077,"time":1490705759,"md5":"h5dziHSFw2Tonxfguq9H+Q==","fsize":37844,"resto":118616298,"id":"PAoKCJuA","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118645812,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:56:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118645754\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118645754<\/a><br>Worden ze lekker kruidig?","filename":"Baudet_lavendel","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":654,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490705797235,"time":1490705797,"md5":"3jmijUbhkPE8Qv0k337eAQ==","fsize":32107,"resto":118616298,"id":"LQWWz8s7","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118645898,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:57:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118616298\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118616298<\/a><br><br>Ik wil dat politierapport wel eens zien.","time":1490705858,"resto":118616298,"id":"OynttT1A","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118646062,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:59:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118645898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118645898<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lopend politierapport<\/span><br>Een dagboek is geen politierapport.","time":1490705989,"resto":118616298,"id":"WpAuBnAL","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118646161,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)09:00:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118621073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118621073<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118620890\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118620890<\/a><br><br>Natuurlijk kunnen we winnen.

The discussions you&#039;re suggesting here are absolutely not the &#039;correct&#039; way to talk about what is happening to Baudet, or even an obvious improvement.

I&#039;m actually not interested in the &quot;ugh leftists&quot; thing, since I&#039;m not interested in who those leftists exactly are. I&#039;m very much interested in what we&#039;re talking about here, the ideas, and how much I hate it. You&#039;re right that I can say all of that in a different way and refer to the perpetrators as I see them more specifically. But I didn&#039;t because I am not interested in it. This is the problem if you impose your view of &#039;good&#039; topics on others.

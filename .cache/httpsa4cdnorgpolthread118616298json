GL has no other options to get into power, the VVD can swith to the CU, make some socio-cultural consessions to these Christian soft-theocrats while reaffirming their pro-EU pro-corporatist agenda.

They work from the categories back to the ideas and the people, not the other way around. This is very bad and very destructive, and it pushes everyone right of center further right because you can not deal with people that do this. So I&#039;ll concede that having broad terminology for theories is a good thing when discussing politics, but a very bad thing when discussing a single issue (like this one) and who might be &#039;responsible&#039;. It doesn&#039;t matter. &quot;The left&quot; or whatever, the discussions continues. The purity of the terminology is not relevant to what&#039;s happening directly. It&#039;s extremely relevant when you talk about groups of people, like how you like to be a &quot;leftist&quot; but not THIS kind of leftist. It&#039;s enough that you hate this sort of thing. I don&#039;t hate leftists who still believe in equality of opportunity and some sense of equality before the law. We have moved so, so far from that in these matters. Baudet is playing a dangerous game and I hope he&#039;s ready for what&#039;s coming.","filename":"1489849397795","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":683,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490701270764,"time":1490701270,"md5":"co1BYFXWzECBUC7z6HL3kQ==","fsize":83793,"resto":118616298,"id":"OpsqCdVv","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118640326,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)07:41:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118638982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118638982<\/a><br><br>I can appreciate his video&#039;s, but sometimes he&#039;s too simplistic\/hamfisted, as are most YouTube e-celebs.<br><br>I was never a total leftwing zealot, but I think two people were central to exposing a lot of the cliched talking points that I acquired through social osmosis instead of reason: Sam Harris and Karen Straughan.

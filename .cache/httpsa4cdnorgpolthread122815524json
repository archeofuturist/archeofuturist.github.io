I recently order more of these bags that I have bought in the past, but this time there&#039;s been problems with my shipping. Basically I got a call from U.S customs telling me I had to come sign for the packages and put on &quot;made in china&quot; labels on every single bag. Obviously, since I&#039;ve bought the bags before, they have never had a label like that on them. Maybe because the person makes them &quot;locally&quot; as in not in a mandated factory? <br><br>But I&#039;m curious, do you think these things are being checked so thoroughly for such factory labels because of the tensions in East Asia we have right now? Also, if that is the case, isn&#039;t it strange to just have me go and slap some labels on them to make them legal or not suspicious?","filename":"woman-sending-packages","ext":".jpg","w":360,"h":240,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493167415431,"time":1493167415,"md5":"q09YbzoIdak+kytVwt7Uyg==","fsize":17672,"resto":0,"id":"wMM\/Avcz","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-i-own-a-small-business-where-i-sell-items-i","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

There&#039;s no way that \/pol\/ is actually that obsessed with it and surely has to be a targeted campaign to <br>(1) influence the members of this board to either (a) exacerbate the psychosis of the members (b) alter the concept formation of the members by instilling hatred against black males to instigate further reforms by the left and subsequent expansion of state power. <br>(2) alienate the entire board to emasculate the alt-right in order to warp the perception of non-members. (a) when people look at the arguments made on \/pol\/, they will be able to say that the members of this board are fascist racists and have no credibility. (b) support the strength of the left in it&#039;s rightness by correlating the psychosis of this board with an infatuation and compulsion towards hatred stemming from sexual incompetence, which leads non-members to argue that the driving force behind non-conformity on this board of the lefts principles, such as integration and inclusiveness, to be caused by the shortcomings of anyone contradictory towards it. Essentially an ad-hominem. <br>(3) Disrupt the flow of discussion; (a) petty fights and arguments, (b) opinionated statements regarding the morals of woman which has nothing to do with the power of the state. <br><br>tl;dr, dont respond to shills.","filename":"aristotle","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":625,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":208,"tim":1490431397621,"time":1490431397,"md5":"IJWVu3MushbZQ0IXI+KQmQ==","fsize":58925,"resto":0,"id":"LSi3hz4l","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"right-now-i-count-22-threads-related-to-bbcs-and","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":0,"unique_ips":13},{"no":118204996,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:44:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118204942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118204942<\/a><br><br>k","time":1490431452,"resto":118204942,"id":"spuToLlg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118205101,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:45:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118204942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118204942<\/a><br>Welp, its got me browsing the alternative chan \/pol all evening, this is confirmed","time":1490431541,"resto":118204942,"id":"\/MESvpTK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118205152,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:46:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118204942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118204942<\/a><br>Thats how i left \/b\/ <br><br>Shit gets spammed all day there.","time":1490431592,"resto":118204942,"id":"BQ6oCJ3C","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118205202,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:47:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Don&#039;t be upset.","time":1490431634,"resto":118204942,"id":"M1Nab\/hV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118205232,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:47:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"lmao white boi gettin triggered","time":1490431664,"resto":118204942,"id":"7O3Xmtt3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118205242,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:47:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"definitely didn&#039;t read your whole rant, but if you haven&#039;t realized that \/pol\/ is full a bunch of heart broken autists, virgins and otherwise, who&#039;s entire MO originates in penis size anxiety, then you haven&#039;t been paying attention.","time":1490431673,"resto":118204942,"id":"SPuoGrc1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118205253,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:48:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118205202\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118205202<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118205232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118205232<\/a><br>nice of you to respond so quickly","time":1490431683,"resto":118204942,"id":"LSi3hz4l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118205311,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:48:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"22 BBC threads and 22 threads complaining, I guess pol is dead gg no re","time":1490431739,"resto":118204942,"id":"HLELn0vK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118205327,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:49:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118205242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118205242<\/a><br>take a look for yourself mate, I mean maybe there is some truth to what you say, but tell me the entire board is not being assaulted with a targeted attack","time":1490431753,"resto":118204942,"id":"LSi3hz4l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118205480,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:51:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118204942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118204942<\/a><br>Nothing is going on.

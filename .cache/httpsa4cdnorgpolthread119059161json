Early police reports indicated she wore space diapers during the trip, but she later denied wearing them.

Shipman rolled down the window a couple of inches after which Nowak sprayed the pepper spray into the car. Shipman drove off to the parking lot booth where police were summoned. Several Orlando Police Department Airport Division officers arrived minutes later, with the first officer observing Nowak throwing a bag into the trash at a parking shuttle bus stop. Nowak was subsequently arrested at Orlando International Airport on charges of attempted kidnapping, battery, attempted vehicle burglary with battery, and destruction of evidence.<\/span>","time":1490971884,"resto":119059161,"id":"AO3QU+BL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119062561,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:51:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119059627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119059627<\/a><br>Sorry sweetie, but <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;women represent 60% of american colleges <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;most retards in the world are men<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;women earn more than men in sweden<\/span>","time":1490971889,"resto":119059161,"id":"Kb9GI2EK","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119062591,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:51:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119062275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119062275<\/a><br>Being an astronaut requires literally years of intense psychological and physical training <br><br>You wouldn&#039;t know that though, since your space program is a little bit less capable than north korea.","time":1490971907,"resto":119059161,"id":"J5\/vXgZI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119062592,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:51:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119060628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119060628<\/a><br><br>Anyone got a quick rundown on these?","time":1490971907,"resto":119059161,"id":"GvPhGIFa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119062622,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:52:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119060628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119060628<\/a><br>more like<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;american engineering<\/span><br><br>space shuttle was shit, should have stuck to nazi rockets","time":1490971926,"resto":119059161,"id":"fRofS5rn","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":119062664,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:52:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119062592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119062592<\/a><br>Just google their fucking names","time":1490971952,"resto":119059161,"id":"qSCpK+ZK","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119062736,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:53:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119059161\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119059161<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119059873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119059873<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119059789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119059789<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119060044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119060044<\/a><br>This isn&#039;t the first time this has happened.

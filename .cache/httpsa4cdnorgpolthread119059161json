Early police reports indicated she wore space diapers during the trip, but she later denied wearing them.

Shipman rolled down the window a couple of inches after which Nowak sprayed the pepper spray into the car. Shipman drove off to the parking lot booth where police were summoned. Several Orlando Police Department Airport Division officers arrived minutes later, with the first officer observing Nowak throwing a bag into the trash at a parking shuttle bus stop. Nowak was subsequently arrested at Orlando International Airport on charges of attempted kidnapping, battery, attempted vehicle burglary with battery, and destruction of evidence.<\/span>","time":1490971884,"resto":119059161,"id":"AO3QU+BL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119062561,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:51:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119059627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119059627<\/a><br>Sorry sweetie, but <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;women represent 60% of american colleges <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;most retards in the world are men<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;women earn more than men in sweden<\/span>","time":1490971889,"resto":119059161,"id":"Kb9GI2EK","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119062591,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:51:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119062275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119062275<\/a><br>Being an astronaut requires literally years of intense psychological and physical training <br><br>You wouldn&#039;t know that though, since your space program is a little bit less capable than north korea.","time":1490971907,"resto":119059161,"id":"J5\/vXgZI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119062592,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:51:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119060628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119060628<\/a><br><br>Anyone got a quick rundown on these?","time":1490971907,"resto":119059161,"id":"GvPhGIFa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119062622,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:52:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119060628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119060628<\/a><br>more like<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;american engineering<\/span><br><br>space shuttle was shit, should have stuck to nazi rockets","time":1490971926,"resto":119059161,"id":"fRofS5rn","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":119062664,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:52:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119062592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119062592<\/a><br>Just google their fucking names","time":1490971952,"resto":119059161,"id":"qSCpK+ZK","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119062736,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:53:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119059161\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119059161<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119059873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119059873<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119059789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119059789<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119060044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119060044<\/a><br>This isn&#039;t the first time this has happened.

On the last day of the siege as the Turks were coming in multiple waves his second in command, Giovanni Giustiniani, caught a bullet and was slowly dying. As he was a volunteer relief force for Constantinople and had been immensely helpful, Constantine granted him an exception and allowed him to retreat from the battle so he might recover. As Giovanni&#039;s men were carrying him through the postern gates, the last guy forgot to lock the door behind him and when some of the defenders lost their cool and took this as an oppurtunity to escape.<br><br>And from there you can kind of imagine how it all spiraled out of control very quickly.<br><br>But in the panic of the ongoing battle and the somewhat unexpected decision of Constantine giving anyone else the key, it seems unlikely it was an &quot;inside job&quot; and probably was just a monumental fuck up by some random soldier. <br><br>You can blame the jews though for giving the T*rks cannons, as they didn&#039;t have that technology until a (((merchant))) from Hungary gave it to them.","time":1490974229,"resto":119059161,"id":"nhg\/RVYj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119066057,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)11:31:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119062622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119062622<\/a><br>WRONG","time":1490974301,"resto":119059161,"id":"EvYKnXak","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119066112,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)11:32:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119062736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119062736<\/a><br>Kek.","filename":"thrilled frog","ext":".png","w":416,"h":458,"tn_w":113,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490974337917,"time":1490974337,"md5":"2t7xT2C0EBMUsBznCr\/LCQ==","fsize":34100,"resto":119059161,"id":"VZDANI91","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119066201,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)11:33:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119062622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119062622<\/a><br>You must go back","filename":"1489996931765","ext":".gif","w":965,"h":662,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":85,"tim":1490974403653,"time":1490974403,"md5":"Al8e0mKYNvb6fe\/e5Wh5dg==","fsize":1651659,"resto":119059161,"id":"r7ZWqDCe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119066243,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)11:33:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119065560\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119065560<\/a><br>Yeah, but what did that have to do with the women?

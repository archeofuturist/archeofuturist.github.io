It is easily replicated. Have you ever seen the amusement rides that are basically a cylinder that spins fast enough that you can stand on the walls. That is controlling gravity right there, we may not be able to make items weightless, and able to be manipulated as they can be in free fall yet, but it will happen eventually. Tides are the effect of the moons gravity on earth, and the effect can be replicated in small amounts of water. No one is saying humans are single handedly changing the climate, unless they are idiots. The climate change is a byproduct of technological advancement.

It is simulating gravity since the force perceived by gravity is indistinguishable from acceleration. Gravity happens because mass warps spacetime, causing time to tick at different rates in an object. Acceleration is defined at the change in velocity over time, which in turn is the change in position over itme, dx\/dt. Acceleration modifies the dx, while dt is constant. Gravity modifies the dt while dx is basically constant. End result is still a change in the rate, so it feels the same, but it isn&#039;t the same thing.","time":1492917209,"resto":122366569,"id":"cWIum3Iw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122371257,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:16:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122370219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122370219<\/a><br>To claim that you have influence over something that you have no control over.<br><br>How hubris.","time":1492917389,"resto":122366569,"id":"9Nb2Esof","country":"SG","country_name":"Singapore"},{"no":122371411,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:18:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122370213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122370213<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122370918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122370918<\/a><br>My apologies, it appears I was incorrect on my statements on artificial gravity.

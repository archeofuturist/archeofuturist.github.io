Morality should not be conceived of as a concrete linear system but in terms of how much harm an action does in tearing the Ganylin apart. The good, the bad, they all come together to fight for the survival of the nation state and when they focus on ideological purity they tear the Ganylin apart. In essence, ideological purity manifests itself in the destruction of the self (in many instances), whilst simultaneously destroying the society we live in as well. <br><br>In other words, kek is not chaos in a traditional sense, it is the realization of the banality of evil and good whilst pursuing the benefit of society before the self without sacrificing the self needlessly.

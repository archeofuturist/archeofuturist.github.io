For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us; we were not idle when we were with you, we did not eat any one;s bread without paying, but with toil and labor we worked night and day, that we might not burden any of you.

For we hear that some of you are living in idleness, mere busybodies, not doing any work. Now such persons we command and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work in quietness and to earn their own living.

Anyway, what I&#039;m getting at is I&#039;m fairly new to watching his show over my lunch hour yet I&#039;ve already learned a formula they do. The splice in old footage and kinda make it seem like it&#039;s happening now. It&#039;s smooth. I&#039;m not saying they&#039;re purposely misleading and shit, but I swear if I didn&#039;t know Alex was absent all week, I might think he was still there. Like on commercial break if they don&#039;t ad their store, they sometimes play an old segment where Alex is there, without really saying they&#039;re on radio commercial break.

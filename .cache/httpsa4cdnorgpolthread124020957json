It doesn&#039;t offer room for intellectualism or fact-based refutation. It operates entirely on clickbait, imagery and quick replies, especially on the faster boards like \/pol\/. On other websites such as NYT, reddit or more traditional forums, you are able to view and respond to a post hours after it has been made. This type of structure offers a much more intellectual-based dialog in which points can be refuted with facts and highlighted to be seen by many. In short, this disparity creates a very clear divide in political opinions and views - one based on facts and intellectual standards, and one based on imagery and propaganda.<br><br>What does \/pol\/ think?","filename":"0c308ea2a1cbe32781c1704734a1b21f","ext":".jpg","w":236,"h":236,"tn_w":236,"tn_h":236,"tim":1493873681622,"time":1493873681,"md5":"lmTyM1CKgjrgpBvrTJPM2w==","fsize":8492,"resto":0,"id":"wTJpg5ZN","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-problem-with-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":76,"images":12,"unique_ips":52},{"no":124021038,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:55:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;African proverb<\/span><br>Lmao","time":1493873744,"resto":124020957,"id":"3dLPVy27","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124021146,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:56:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Niggers","time":1493873802,"resto":124020957,"id":"yWMsOQC7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124021212,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:57:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124020957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124020957<\/a><br>If something doesn&#039;t catch on here, it goes away.

Did they elect a leader for their group? How did they distribute the workload? What type of paper did they use? These are irrelevant questions.<br><br>The group did well because they were the smartest, highest achieving students. Everything else is secondary. It doesn&#039;t matter if they voted to select to a leader of if they used some other means to delegate work. These are just tools, a means to an end.<br><br>Likewise, economics is a tool. Authoritarianism is a tool. Like machines in a warehouse, they can increase efficiency, they can improve output, but like all tools they are dependent on their users.<br><br>I don&#039;t believe socialism efficiently allocates resources for large groups of people, but this is irrelevant. If you have a population filled with selfish incompetent assholes, who cares whether the selfish incompetent assholes operate from within the government or from within the private sector? The damage will be done just the same.<br><br>And if those who vote are fools, what does it matter if they vote with dollars or if they vote with ballots? Stupid decisions will be made just the same. You cannot get blood from a stone. <br><br>No amount of playing with dials will save you from a corrupted populace. No amount of moving money around, voting differently, changes to crime enforcement, or anything else will save you. The problem must be solved at its cause. The people matter, politics is a red herring.","filename":"Spartans","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":104,"tim":1493058315843,"time":1493058315,"md5":"nz4m01dbb6pjVR+l0jgWGA==","fsize":271158,"resto":0,"id":"6xYg4951","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-people-matter-politics-is-a-red-herring","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122619250,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)14:31:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"neato opinions op. are you saying that we can all just be communists and if we&#039;re &quot;really cool kids&quot; then we&#039;ll win in the end??","time":1493058685,"resto":122618503,"id":"6xYg4951","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122619256,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)14:31:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"&quot;Muh capitalism and freedumbs&quot; is an American thing.<br><br>Europeans realize that freedom is a meme and focused on Globalism vs Nationalism instead.","time":1493058691,"resto":122618503,"id":"4OnaE1TQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

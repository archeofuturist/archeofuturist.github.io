The Republican forces were constantly trying to cause instability, and enemies of the state were everywhere. Spain did not have a &quot;real&quot; airforce, the bombing had been done by Germany and Italy. On top of this Germany actually preferred Spain to be neutral seeing the North coast of Spain as a huge liability if the British could land. Think about it, the Basques had until recently faught against Franco, the Germans had removed air support, it could have been a potential soft spot. <br><br>Hitler, didn&#039;t really think about the Med. He went there only to clean up Mussolini&#039;s shit.

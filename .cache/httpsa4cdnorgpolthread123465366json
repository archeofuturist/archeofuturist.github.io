With trump getting voted in I thought things in global affairs would steadily improve, but instead nothings changing. The left are still the vocal majority, and we&#039;re left in the dark to perpetuatally ponder why were&#039; the &#039;bad guys&#039; when all we want to do is preserve what our forefathers built. Life just seems so directionless right now, there&#039;s nothing left in the world for people like us. We&#039;re constantly rejected by our peers just for thinking differently. I don&#039;t mind leftists but they seem to revel in making us feel like we don&#039;t exist. There&#039;s nothing left for people like us. We see the writing on the wall but no one is listening.","filename":"tmp_6714-14870599950571300003317","ext":".png","w":474,"h":473,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":249,"tim":1493548798525,"time":1493548798,"md5":"ukqYEJrZFvTGVguyU3jEcA==","fsize":20436,"resto":0,"id":"xv+dFW\/G","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"has-anyone-else-been-getting-a-bit-despondent","country_name":"Australia","replies":16,"images":6,"unique_ips":13},{"no":123466942,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)07:02:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123465366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123465366<\/a><br>rainbow pervertariat controls 99% of the entire worlds wealth and it&#039;s not enough for them. so they keep pitting each individual colors against each other.. notice they already started occupying public streets that belong to the people and squealing soot souls in tar budgets lives matter while doing it.

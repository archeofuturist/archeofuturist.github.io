Go to Fran\u00e7ois Fillon&#039;s Twitter, go to his followers and send them some memes. These memes need to show that Fillon&#039;s endorsement of Marcon, goes against Fillon&#039;s principles of less taxes and safer borders.

Keep fighting the good fight!","filename":"a2448aa8dbab45304d529830c2e1df083022f0a12931658e1f952e1b9c9c1272.png","ext":".jpg","w":180,"h":255,"tn_w":176,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493082806845,"time":1493082806,"md5":"F3OZXpc0PA5GwbKP4W7Qtg==","fsize":16755,"resto":0,"id":"T+2XRL3\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"do-your-damn-duty-duty-calls-and-you-guys-need-to","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

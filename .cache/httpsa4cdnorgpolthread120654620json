In 1917 when the Communist\/Bolshevik Jews took over the tsar russian government in the most brutal and barbaric way. In this total bloodbath the Jewish ran Cheka and NKVD starved and murdered over 65 million Christian Russians, Ukrainians, people of the Baltic States and other people of eastern Europe from 1917 to 1962... but only after most of the people were disarmed. It led to rivers of blood, terror, misery, torture, poverty, slavery and death, all on a colossal scale. The Jewish Bolsheviks murdered 30 million within the first 4 years of their takeover, long before Stalin came to power. <br><br>This part of history has been heavily hidden from textbooks, museums etc. The Jews work especially hard to skim past the shady bits of their history, placing all of the attention on their so-called Jewish Holocaust where 6 million Jews (The real total death toll during WW2 was 271,301 dead Jews documented in official Red Cross documents arcives and there was also NO evidence of systematic genocide of the Jews reported.) were killed. Yet we are treated to numerous movies, miniseries, documentaries, etc. each year about the \u201cHolocaust\u201d. You\u2019ll never hear them mention the Jew run Holdormor famine genocide in Ukraine or the Jew run Soviet Gulags in Russia and any other crimes committed by the \u201cchosen people\u201d because they control the means of communication. Communism is Jewish Talmudic tyranny made manifest. The Luciferian Jewish legacy is one of mass murder and they even dare to project that on us.","filename":"d4953f1748d3a146c45ca0e2ed7bb17fcfe324ad0ef5941b7af540c11a7e963c","ext":".jpg","w":955,"h":700,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1491944202275,"time":1491944202,"md5":"w4NkxYkH5yFXf6XPA5WTyQ==","fsize":81678,"resto":120654620,"id":"brF3JL8L","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120655639,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:57:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"fuck yourself you piece of fucking shit.","time":1491944232,"resto":120654620,"id":"UlLsUNLe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120655678,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:57:27","name":"Anonymous","filename":"originalcngcncv","ext":".jpg","w":599,"h":586,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":122,"tim":1491944247956,"time":1491944247,"md5":"o40Xgzc6V87+qr8pKjDllA==","fsize":89675,"resto":120654620,"id":"brF3JL8L","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120655750,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:58:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120655443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120655443<\/a><br>A militia is formed of citizens that supply their own weapons. <br><br>Well regulated in the context of the times meant something like &quot;in good working order&quot;.<br><br>This supports the statements that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. <br><br>You need an armed population to draw on in order to form a citizen&#039;s military force.","time":1491944280,"resto":120654620,"id":"7phv+DC7","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120655938,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)16:59:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120654620\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120654620<\/a><br>Guns and lemonade...

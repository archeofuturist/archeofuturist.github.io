That&#039;s what the lotr trilogy would have been like if made five years later.<br><br><a href=\"#p119110886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119110886<\/a><br>Those shitty scenes are hobbit trash","time":1491001200,"resto":119107384,"id":"b4608DtG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119111949,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)19:01:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119107384\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119107384<\/a><br>Just thank Tolkien.<br><br>Are there any Hyperion Cantos fags here?

Geographically, much like the Irish coast. Surprisingly green. <br><br>It&#039;s pretty comfy out there, although a couple of teens died trying to sail. The sea is very rocky and it&#039;s easy to get smashed into them if you go out in bad weather. <br><br>Internet is dreadfully slow, although prices to buy things aren&#039;t expensive at all because of the Government sucking up some of the costs to import to there. <br><br>It is nothing like Svalbard is, these places may as well be part of the mainland UK because of their funding. <br><br>I worry for the Scottish islands if Scotland gets independence, they will not be able to fund them without going into massive debt, leaving the Islanders no choice but to abandon and move to Scotland.","time":1492527978,"resto":121692751,"id":"Um\/jyzbO","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121693973,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)11:07:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121693802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121693802<\/a><br><br>I didn&#039;t proof read this before sending it, apologies for sounding so passive, on the internet I write like an American; like some sort of retard.","time":1492528070,"resto":121692751,"id":"Um\/jyzbO","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121694100,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)11:09:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s full of cryptids, don&#039;t go there","time":1492528142,"resto":121692751,"id":"N4OKPa8J","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121694167,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)11:09:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"no one knows but every other weekend a huge crate of whiskey floats over to the mainland on a raft","time":1492528192,"resto":121692751,"id":"KpczoonC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

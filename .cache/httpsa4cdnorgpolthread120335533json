Gci, the largest provider that totally doesn&#039;t have a monopoly on the entire fucking state, has said there is a problem with their fiber line that services the entire state. Basically if you have gci cell or Internet\/tv, it&#039;s either completely down or if you&#039;re lucky, dialup tier slow and unstable.<br>Could this be simply accidental damage or the line just failing? Or could it be intentional? There is even speculation on sabotage to the ocean fiber lines.<br>Wouldn&#039;t Russia love to have absolutely no high speed communications going in and out of Alaska if they planned to invade or attack?","filename":"1443152429516","ext":".gif","w":370,"h":281,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":189,"tim":1491771421884,"time":1491771421,"md5":"OKxkAoUNZCTuQWVL1GS6Xg==","fsize":886143,"resto":0,"id":"2U80+hxo","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"possible-alaska-happening","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":120335999,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:00:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120335533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120335533<\/a><br>you bring up a great point anon.

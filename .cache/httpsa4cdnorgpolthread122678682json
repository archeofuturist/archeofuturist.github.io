Forty-six Muslim countries combined contribute just 1 percent of the world\u2019s scientific literature; Spain and India each contribute more of the world\u2019s scientific literature than those countries taken together. In fact, although Spain is hardly an intellectual superpower, it translates more books in a single year than the entire Arab world has in the past thousand years. \u201cThough there are talented scientists of Muslim origin working productively in the West,\u201d Nobel laureate physicist Steven Weinberg has observed, \u201cfor forty years I have not seen a single paper by a physicist or astronomer working in a Muslim country that was worth reading.\u201d<\/span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Comparative metrics on the Arab world tell the same story. Arabs comprise 5 percent of the world\u2019s population, but publish just 1.1 percent of its books, according to the U.N.\u2019s 2003 Arab Human Development Report. Between 1980 and 2000, Korea granted 16,328 patents, while nine Arab countries, including Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the U.A.E., granted a combined total of only 370, many of them registered by foreigners. A study in 1989 found that in one year, the United States published 10,481 scientific papers that were frequently cited, while the entire Arab world published only four. This may sound like the punch line of a bad joke, but when Nature magazine published a sketch of science in the Arab world in 2002, its reporter identified just three scientific areas in which Islamic countries excel: desalination, falconry, and camel reproduction.<\/span><br><br><br>http:\/\/www.thenewatlantis.com\/publi<wbr>cations\/why-the-arabic-world-turned<wbr>-away-from-science","filename":"b82d3747d2f619bfe7e2a53ef57ddac0cdc13111975351f8c66802a9a206750d_1","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":620,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":193,"tim":1493087411151,"time":1493087411,"md5":"s20WLDMzGrkLEpKL9x3s3A==","fsize":55356,"resto":0,"id":"PexJM52V","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-islamic-world-is-a-legitimate-threat-to-the-w","country_name":"Australia","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122678948,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)22:32:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122678682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122678682<\/a><br>That pic made me kek but yeah fuck the dune coons","time":1493087537,"resto":122678682,"id":"khY+zKAB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122680617,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)22:44:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"if you anglo-niggers just left us alone we would be in a much better world today.","time":1493088283,"resto":122678682,"id":"Ns81eBof","country":"SA","country_name":"Saudi Arabia"},{"no":122682350,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)22:58:30","name":"I","com":"<a href=\"#p122680617\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122680617<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122680617\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122680617<\/a><br>And if your primitive camel shagging ancestors didn&#039;t spread Islam throughout the middle east by the sword, you&#039;d probably have some semblance of civilisation.","filename":"images (44)","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":250,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493089110752,"time":1493089110,"md5":"xrelcz+Cu9rz1A0cY80LXA==","fsize":6892,"resto":122678682,"id":"PexJM52V","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

No, they are not. That is the difference between those who have wealth and those that do not. If a rich man was blowing his cash all the time and not investing, he would not be a rich man for long. There are many examples of this - people winning the lottery, then ending up bankrupt in a few years time.<br><br>Taxation is robbery at the barrel of a gun. If someone doesn&#039;t pay their taxes - then they&#039;ll be arrested. If they refuse arrest, they&#039;ll be shot. Same as any street mugging.<br><br>That said, you have two systems - a free market, and socialism. For a free market example, we can look at America, before the Federal bank got instituted. For a socialist example, we can look at something more contemporary - Venezuela.<br><br>Unemployment for long periods in free market America was virtually non existent. The country was built from virtually nothing to an industrial powerhouse larger than the entirety of Europe in about 100 years. Why? There was no taxation. No regulations. People just provided services to one another, and we had the fastest growth this world has ever seen.<br><br>In just 10 years of socialism, Venezuela has turned from one of the wealthiest countries in South America to the poorest. There&#039;s fucking cannibalism going on in the prisons, and outside it&#039;s not a far cry from that. Meanwhile, the government is running around closing bread shops and arresting their owners because they&#039;re not doing as they&#039;re told. Medicine is virtually non-existent. There&#039;s been constant brown-outs and blackouts since a year after the government nationalized the power companies.<br><br>So, the burden of proof is on you.

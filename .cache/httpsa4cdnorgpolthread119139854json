This is why folks talk about buying houses vrs renting. If you buy a house your payment should not change. Which in the future means when you start getting more money from inflation it will be easier to pay off your loan. This is why your middle aged people are generally better off than tweens. They hae paid off their mortgage, car, furniture, etc.. notes.

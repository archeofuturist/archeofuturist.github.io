It is a nation killer. The best alternative is a currency that deflates, therefore, all debts are paid back (with a psuedo interest) when paid back in full. <br><br>Currency should naturally become greater and greater in value. This encourages saving and responsible behavior, as well as providing a natural raise for workers maintaining a job.<br><br>Another solution to the capital issue of youth (how am I supposed to pay for college when I&#039;ve never had a job?) is labor-backed currency like ITHACA Hours. So rather than ask the government for a fiat currency, you ask them to trade you man-hours of labor. You can spend the man hours of labor as you wish, but you have to pay them back, either by getting man-hour currency from working, capitalism, or, if nothing else, you just take a government job and pay them in your real man hours (if you borrow 2000 hours you work for them for 2000 hours.)<br><br>So the effect is a currency that is backed by an available labor force of young men in your country.","time":1493249414,"resto":122956805,"id":"uTkBTvj\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122957840,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:30:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122956805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122956805<\/a><br>Bumb","time":1493249433,"resto":122956805,"id":"57xb8ukd","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":122958253,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:33:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122957806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122957806<\/a><br>Well I seem to be a brainlet cause I don&#039;t understand much of it. <br>But you are saying there is a way to remove this type of interest too.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The man who borrows money with 0,1 interest and lends that money with 0,5 interest<\/span><br><br>Right?","time":1493249638,"resto":122956805,"id":"57xb8ukd","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":122958729,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:37:49","name":"Anti-Nymos","com":"<a href=\"#p122958253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122958253<\/a><br>?!<br><br>*Interest grows*","time":1493249869,"resto":122956805,"id":"7wPW1EJK","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122959357,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:42:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122958729\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122958729<\/a><br>Please understand I don&#039;t know much economy. <br>And if &quot;interest grows&quot; with no real work being done then eventually the resource leeches will take everything without lifting a finger.","time":1493250172,"resto":122956805,"id":"57xb8ukd","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":122959546,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:44:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122958253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122958253<\/a><br>It is okay, roach, I will teach you.<br><br>So I have 1 man-hour, let&#039;s say that&#039;s enough to buy myself 50 oranges.

Maybe that orange farm will develop a better method of harvesting oranges, or the trucks that ship the oranges will be a little more fuel efficient, or they will switch to a cheaper material to package the oranges, so that in a year, they can lower the price of an orange so that a man-hour will buy 51 oranges.

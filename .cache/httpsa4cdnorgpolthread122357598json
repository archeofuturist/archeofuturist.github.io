The show is effectively a echo chamber for typical liberal talking points aimed at manchildren at a grade school level. If you watched the first debate, you wouldn&#039;t have even known the guy who got CNN&#039;d was for LFTR&#039;s and more or less everything they agreed with in terms of Climate Change, you would have just thought that he was out to build a typical fission reactor in every backyard and that he wanted to irradiate your kids. It&#039;s worse than anything Oliver or any other typical liberal shill puts out because Bill just jumps around from segment to segment with no deeper inspection other than &quot;HURR, CLIMATE CHANGE BAD, REBUPLICANS STUPID, BILL!

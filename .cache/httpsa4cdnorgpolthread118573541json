(Violence or threat of violence against military targets, including related government and industrial infrastructure, as a from of direct military engagement is not considered terrorism. Though seemingly similar, it effects direct change by force, instead of indirect change by fear. Terrorism may be considered a strategy of warfare, akin to Propaganda)<br><br>White Nationalism=1. The belief that non-albino white-skinned people should form and rule their own nation-state. 2. The belief that white people should be the effective ruling class of an already existing nation-state<br>3. A form of traditional, non-exclusionary nationalism that identifies the core values of the nation as belonging to a broadly defined white identity, and vice-versa, making the protection and furthering of the white identity synonymous with and dependent on the protection and furthering of the nation-state.<br><br>White Supremacy= The concept that, within a racial framework, non-albino white-skinned individuals are superior to all other racial groups identified within that framework. A common corollary to this concept is the concept that in being superior to other races, the white race has the inherent right to rule.<br><br>These terms are not synonyms, but they are non-exclusive, and White Supremacy typically begets a White Nationalist political view. <br><br>To suggest all white nationalists are white supremacists is wrong. To suggest all white nationalists, or even white supremacists are terrorists, is an even greater fiction. Terrorism is not an inherent strategy to either of these philosophies, and suggesting otherwise only serves to strengthen their position. Even the impression of dishonesty causes people to be more credulous of your opposition, no matter how resistant they may otherwise be to such positions.","time":1490656923,"resto":118573541,"id":"TFu3qn3f","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

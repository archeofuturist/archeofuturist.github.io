On some issues it takes a lot of reading comments to get there.. seeing through shills and such, but eventually I get there.<br><br>I have a serious question, I&#039;m trying to understand this Syria business. But I find my non understanding of the way the Muslim religion works is causing me (and a lot of others) confusion. <br><br>I don&#039;t need to be spoon fed but can we get some credible links to start (us) out. For example:<br><br>Muslim = Chistian<br>Islam = Catholicism, Baptist, Lutheran<br>What is a Sunni?<br>(I don&#039;t know these assumptions are right)<br><br>How does this religion break down, who are the bad guys. Please point the Normies in the right direction to get our understanding right.<br><br>Please don&#039;t go crazy on me... My intentions are good. And am a huge fan of your work.

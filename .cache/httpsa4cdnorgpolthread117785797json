He&#039;s been a political consultant internationally and domestically for the last 40 years, and is probably one of the most well known political strategists of our lifetimes. He was the most effective arm of Black, and started the careers of many Senators, and personally restructured how K-street works several times. If you are associated with the political sphere at all, or work anywhere near the Hill, Manafort is a household name. He selected Reagan&#039;s transition team. He&#039;s the Tiger Woods of political strategy. <br><br>It&#039;s no secret that the West precipitated the crisis in Ukraine. It&#039;s funny how we act as though &quot;who would collaborate with those dirty Russians&quot; while during the Obama administration our foreign policy and subversive operations made the annexation of Crimea inevitable. Manafort was instrumental in the democratic sphere of influence which poised Yanukovych to control a puppet Ukraine and spread it&#039;s legs for the trap the West had built. Manafort did those over seven years -- oh, did I forget to mention, Bernie Sander&#039;s political strategist Ted Davine was there too? The sockpuppet Ukrainian politicians needed a lot of help from experienced PR magicians. <br><br>Secretly? Secretly? Only if you&#039;re an idiot. Only if you&#039;re completely uninformed.

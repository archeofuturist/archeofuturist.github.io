My mother who practices TM says that it changed her life for the better and gave me an ultimatum of either paying $1000 for TM classes with her or take up medication, neither option is good. So I went to the place and had the guy there explain to me what TM is to me before I decided if I wanted to do it or not and it hit me that the whole thing felt like a HUGE scam. The whole thing felt like some expensive way of essentially taking a siesta for 20 minutes twice a day to feel more relaxed and happy. And the guy then showed me scientific evidence of it being proven to work as well as it being the only meditation certified by the american heart association. <br><br>SO here is the crazy thing. Transcendental Meditation is heavily promoted now by a lot of famous people including but not limited to:<br>Oprah Winfrey<br>Katy Perry <br>Hugh Jackman<br>Howard Stern<br>Jerry Seinfeld<br>Rupert Murdoch<br>Sheryl Crow<br>Russell Brand<br>David Lynch and many others.<br><br>I am starting to feel that this whole thing is a way of people paying a lot of money for things that could work simply by sleeping more and the people running TM to pocket the cash or even worse use this scam to influence people for power and to push their agenda whatever that may be.<br><br>So I am actually begging \/pol\/ now, Please help me prove that TM is bullshit so that I can get out of doing it!","filename":"Transcendental_Meditation_which_Bridgewaters_Ray-b99af61a6722445e412c8fc6e3ef264","ext":".png","w":649,"h":499,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":192,"tim":1492048211075,"time":1492048211,"md5":"x8dwMQ8y\/pxWxpjILyC86g==","fsize":142901,"resto":0,"id":"3\/CjkJLi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-transcendental-meditation-a-scam-and-a","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120849291,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)21:56:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/x\/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;\/x\/<\/a>","time":1492048574,"resto":120848483,"id":"Mc97lldH","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

They react, not through going through cognitive dissonance, but by making it a joke, ironic. Eventually they take the joke seriously enough that it stops being a joke. Then, when it starts becoming to serious they make it a joke again.<br>This is known as &quot;layers of irony&quot;<br><br>This is not bad. It allows people to react to many different circumstances, to pretend to be an ally of something while destroying it from within (without losing heart and assimilating the enemy ideology like most infiltrators). As a strategy it&#039;s unstoppable, as to fight it you must understand it, and to understand it you must be part of it. It&#039;s a way of life, and if you get into it you are here forever, since even if you stop posting you will carry this behaviour with you.","filename":"If you can find out the truth, so can others","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":675,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490388203258,"time":1490388203,"md5":"1FxChILH3BD5nTrtqpZ4lQ==","fsize":61445,"resto":0,"id":"C4F574Ah","country":"IT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wikipedias-page-on-doublethink","country_name":"Italy","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

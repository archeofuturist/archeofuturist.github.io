Sarkozy talked a good fight back in the 2000s and it was really only personal ambition and corruption - both of these personified by his odious multi-culti liberal wife Carla Bruni - that turned his administration into a treasonous joke. Penelope Fillon certainly didn&#039;t look like the type to play the same role. Unfortunately, the Fillons turned out to suffer from a similar sense of entitlement, even if it was of the preferable &quot;grand bourgeois&quot; as opposed to Bruni&#039;s even more repugnant &quot;bobo&quot; version. Sorry, but the &quot;Penelopegate&quot; thing wasn&#039;t ENTIRELY a media assassination. <br>Currently, then, Le Pen is the only choice. I had prejudices against her and her whole dowdy, middle-aged housewife persona from the 2012 presidentielles, when I followed French politics less closely. I don&#039;t know if she&#039;s changed or if my ideas have but I&#039;ve been massively impressed by her this time round. She has given some passionate, eloquent, brilliant speeches and her performance against cuck libtard journalists in interviews is a joy to behold. Unlike Trump, say, her political history is impeccable and unambiguous because she&#039;s spent 40 years as a veritable political leper, shut out of all the structures of power. She could be a real change. Plus, talking of Trump, it should be noted to her credit that she is one of the few Western leaders who have unequivocally condemined Trump&#039;s cave-in to globalism (Fillon didn&#039;t even have to distance himself from Trump; he was already on record as saying he was &quot;of course&quot; for Hillary).","time":1492436044,"resto":121509754,"id":"2Pz6mf\/b","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121526045,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)09:34:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121525814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121525814<\/a><br>You&#039;re welcome","time":1492436072,"resto":121509754,"id":"ixuKmo37","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121526067,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)09:34:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;French lady trump<\/span><br>Calling someone a neocon and warcriminal is not a good way to get support","time":1492436086,"resto":121509754,"id":"TPEF4QTG","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121526087,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)09:34:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121523952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121523952<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m sorry for you if that&#039;s the case.

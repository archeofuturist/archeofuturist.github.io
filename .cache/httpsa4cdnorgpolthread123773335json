Aside from a few small scale special operations, we stayed out of neighboring nations the Ho Chi Minh trail ran through. That&#039;s the surest sign of the complete hackery in charge of strategy. If you don&#039;t cut off supply and logistics, you are never going to have any lasting victory. The second was the unwillingness to ruthlessly attack North Vietnam. For the apocalyptic amount of ordnance dropped in Vietnam, there was no dedication to decapitating the North&#039;s ability to command, control and produce.

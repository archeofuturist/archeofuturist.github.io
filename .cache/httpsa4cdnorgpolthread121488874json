We cops have outright been threatened by the top brass (with the asshole mayor right beside of him, to make sure the threats are carried out verbatim), that ANY cop who lays a single hand on an Antifas, or tries to save a Trump\/alt righter\/innocent bystander, would be fired and blacklisted from ever working in law enforcement again. <br><br>WE ARE WHOLESALE BEING THREATENED BY THE MAYOR&#039;S OFFICE IF WE PROTECT ACTUAL INNOCENTS!<br><br>We have also been told, by the mayor, that all of the local media are &quot;on the mayor&#039;s side&quot; and would snitch on anyone who tried to out the mayor&#039;s agenda to let Antifas beat and brutalize innocent people, who&#039;s only crime is having a point of view the Antifas disagree with. Or were in the wrong place at the wrong time. The mayor has also stated he has &quot;friends&quot; in the national media as well, who will likewise out any whistleblower. <br><br>THAT is why no cop has come forward on or off the record with what is going on in Berkley. We are outright living in fear from reprisals from the social justice fascist regime currently controlling the local city government. As well as our own top officials in the department: any cop who is caught voicing internal concerns has been subject to illegal reprisals (shitty shifts, sick\/vacation days suddenly being revoked, etc) along with threats that any cop who doesn&#039;t narc on another, being punished too. <br><br>It&#039;s full on insane, to the point that a lot of us had to do our damn best not to break forth in cheers for the Trump folk who smashed the Antifas Saturday, due to the shit we&#039;ve been made to let those bastards skate on.","filename":"r3zJNVv64SI5a","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":275,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":137,"tim":1492409262678,"time":1492409262,"md5":"Gt2zz9fjvWqkUAtEHA7V7Q==","fsize":1027114,"resto":0,"id":"Giq+gq+C","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"berkley-pd-insider-here","country_name":"United States","replies":208,"images":29,"unique_ips":157,"tail_size":50},{"no":121489034,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)02:09:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121488874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121488874<\/a><br>timestamp or ur a larper","time":1492409358,"resto":121488874,"id":"bV673jeN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121489098,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)02:09:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121488874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121488874<\/a><br>Anya = best girl","filename":"3143OyC","ext":".jpg","w":790,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1492409391533,"time":1492409391,"md5":"+KECNSdP442tkCOiDEp81g==","fsize":68577,"resto":121488874,"id":"W\/QBSykq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121489122,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)02:10:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121488874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121488874<\/a><br>You are all boot licking scum with no back bone.

First you drink their beer, but soon you&#039;ll be pushing them out of their ancestral trailer parks and claiming the very (bare cinderblock) foundations of their (mobile) homes. <br><br>Memeing about the impending destruction of the white race is not only racist and hateful, it makes you a poor sportsman.

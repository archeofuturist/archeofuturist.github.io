Voaters in that post seem to be convinced this information was put on the website PRIOR to the Podesta leaks. Other voaters also noted really weird hidden data\/ non-sensical posts with everything from number sets to weird occult ramblings and really alarming pornographic material. The website itself is an endless rabbit hole of weirdly coded webpages, videos, and occult ramblings. For convenience purposes and from observing that this phrase keeps popping up in this website, we will call these websites Laughing Horse Orifice Headquarters or LHOHQ as that what is repeatedly being used on the sites themselves.<br><br>Upon seeing that post, I decided to research LHOHQ and found something startling.<br><br>In 2007, an anon posted to the AboveTopSecret forums that found a piece of paper taped to a billboard when he was walking with his friends in Milwaukee: http:\/\/www.abovetopsecret.com\/forum<wbr>\/thread286926\/pg1<br><br>The piece of paper had a weird occult symbol and a cipher of letters. He also posted his story to a Hacking forum and asked for help: http:\/\/www.blizzhackers.cc\/viewtopi<wbr>c.php?f=52&amp;t=357587&amp;sid=b7df432ddf1<wbr>41ed9d9329d48df62115e<br><br>The hackers at this forum deciphered the letters on his piece of paper and discovered the LHOHQ acronym! They also found sites eerily SIMILAR to the LHOHQ site Michael84 found in 2017 from searching that acronym, these sites the BlizzHackers found we know go back to at least 2007, here is one of the websites these hackers discovered on the forums in 2007: http:\/\/lhohq.appliedchaosdynamicsco<wbr>ntrolassociation.net\/<br><br>What does this all mean?","filename":"3e8b11eea349be6031a115e209a5f41ea3c2d3a5aadcc9ba8609ffa8a36b61dd","ext":".jpg","w":494,"h":358,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":181,"tim":1491332465058,"time":1491332465,"md5":"TAptSZh1X8Bw+u3CKsCHmg==","fsize":34997,"resto":0,"id":"VCJw9sci","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pizzagate-breakthru-need-researchers","country_name":"Canada","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119501914,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:02:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1491332525,"resto":119501793,"id":"8HdxTxNg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119502122,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:03:56","name":"anon","com":"LINK to Voat post which better summarizes these findings: https:\/\/voat.co\/v\/pizzagate\/1769011<wbr>","time":1491332636,"resto":119501793,"id":"VCJw9sci","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119502178,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:04:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119501793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119501793<\/a><br><br>Yo am I going to be killed for reading this?","time":1491332670,"resto":119501793,"id":"EpWr1LAq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119502617,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:08:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119501793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119501793<\/a><br><br>bump","time":1491332897,"resto":119501793,"id":"EpWr1LAq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119503175,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)15:12:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119501793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119501793<\/a><br>What the fuck is going on?

What about a perfect mix of ultra-capitalist minarchism, monarchism and nationalism? Let me explain my idea. <br>There is no central bureaucracy at all, and the country is kinda a confederation; there are local elected authorities, which are almost independent and just &quot;coordinated&quot; with the other confederate states. Meanwhile, as a &quot;central coordinator&quot; with almost no real power in times of peace, I&#039;d put something like a life-elected or a hereditary &quot;monarch&quot;, who wouldn&#039;t be like in the traditional European sense and wouldn&#039;t need any waste of money in ceremonial stuff, but would earn a pretty average wage. I think of him as a &quot;guardian of the nation&quot;, which would prevent the confederation from falling apart or being overrun by the hordes of sandniggers, he would be in charge of the military whose task would be protecting the borders and making the ethno-state great again. This hybrid system would be in place for fifty years until the full transition is complete and then we will go full an-cap. What do you think of it?","filename":"Minarchism","ext":".png","w":450,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493102443014,"time":1493102443,"md5":"Qbxyy0yqan\/ogz+jRViQbw==","fsize":2129,"resto":0,"id":"emAn2ejf","country":"IT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"good-morning-pol-today-i-woke-up-with-an-idea","country_name":"Italy","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

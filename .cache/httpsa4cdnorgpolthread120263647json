The founders began working on the venture last fall and have already raised $18.3M in a Series A round led by Joshua Kushner&#039;s company, Thrive Capital, and General Catalyst Partners. Other investors include real estate giants like SL Green Realty, Andrew Farkas of Island Capital Group, and former Vornado Realty Trust CEO Michael Fascitelli.

Jared (pictured), who&#039;s married to Ivanka Trump, is the CEO of Kushner Cos, a developer of Dumbo Heights in Brooklyn, and is one of the youngest and wealthiest real estate moguls in the country. Meanwhile, Josh has invested in major tech startups like Instagram and Reddit, in addition to real estate startups like Hightower, 42Floors Honest Buildings and Compass.

Look, I think many of us are giving Trump too much credit. I doubt he has any idea what he&#039;s just done. Kikeshner found a way to control him through Ivanka and he was successful. He is merely a man who legitimately cared about America, who was manipulated into betraying American interests by a Jew who pretends to be on his side, knows that he trusts his family, and uses his family to convince him to act in favor of Israel via a false flag that was sure to bait Trump&#039;s moral compass. His plan unfortunately worked like a goddamn charm.","filename":"04LGBTsub3-master768","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":512,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491731234919,"time":1491731234,"md5":"vWCznJWxIRV1EnkHVk3vpA==","fsize":48761,"resto":120263647,"id":"TzkR3\/B3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120265080,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:47:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120264860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120264860<\/a><br>He didn&#039;t bother to pull any sources out of his ass and his claims were unrealistic so it was probably shit or mostly shit.","time":1491731236,"resto":120263647,"id":"rL7yuIi9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120265107,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:47:41","name":"Sage","com":"<a href=\"#p120264584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120264584<\/a><br>Drumpf","time":1491731261,"resto":120263647,"id":"ALgxrGZ8","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120265115,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:47:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Can I join this thread, goys?","filename":"1491715847022","ext":".jpg","w":915,"h":576,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1491731267269,"time":1491731267,"md5":"ZhI9ZxQZTtVpll\/PokOzqA==","fsize":140561,"resto":120263647,"id":"1bUoMy\/A","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120265130,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:47:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120264945\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120264945<\/a><br>His dad is a convicted criminal.<br><br>http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2005\/03\/05\/n<wbr>yregion\/democratic-donor-receives-t<wbr>woyear-prison-sentence.html<br>https:\/\/archive.is\/JBeKi<br><br>Chris Christie who was purged by Trump prosecuted Charles Kushner.<br><br>https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news<wbr>\/politics\/2016\/11\/16\/trump-kushner-<wbr>christie-transition\/93992468\/?utm_s<wbr>ource=feedblitz&amp;utm_medium=FeedBlit<wbr>zRss&amp;utm_campaign=usatodaycomwashin<wbr>gton-topstories","filename":"Jared Kushner Holocaust","ext":".jpg","w":674,"h":175,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":32,"tim":1491731277546,"time":1491731277,"md5":"pmLuNHEtMlvI+yvH4BD+vw==","fsize":69908,"resto":120263647,"id":"LeRk0iv1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120265137,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:48:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;there are actual trump supporters ITT, RIGHT NOW<\/span>","filename":"1491647390907","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":563,"tn_w":111,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491731283949,"time":1491731283,"md5":"6btRXug4lKl5r3SyCVFZlw==","fsize":71878,"resto":120263647,"id":"U50o2J5G","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120265150,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:48:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120264584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120264584<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump has been a shark for decades,<\/span><br><br>This.<br><br>One of the reasons why he got through the primaries and got himself elected, is because he was a bigger killer than the rest.<br>He&#039;s the toughest shark in the tank. <br>It&#039;s impossible for him to be a puppet to anyone, his ego wouldn&#039;t allow it. <br><br>That doesn&#039;t mean he can&#039;t fuck up or choose the wrong path.

I want to escape and get away from everything around me except my family.<br><br>I have devised a scheme to save up money, quit my job, and live on the road for a few years in the hopes that this brings me some form of peace, contentment, and intellectual stimulation. My current life has no real challenges. It is money, comfort, food, safety, stability, loneliness, and misery. <br><br>Last thread described my plan to save about $65 000 and live as a hobo for 1-3 years, getting in touch with nature and the underground members of society. <br><br>The other half of me is telling me to keep my job, accrue wealth and possessions, and then in sixty years, just die alone and give it to friends and relatives. While doing this, I would try to stay engaged in our fucked up society, keeping track of all the hypocrisy, corruption, double-dealing, deception, and hopelessness. I think we are intellectually crippling ourselves by our choices of media, technology, and social interaction. I see this only get worse as AI improves. <br><br><br>Still don&#039;t know what to do.

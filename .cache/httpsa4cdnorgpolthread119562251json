Marble is used to hamper forensic investigators and anti-virus companies from attributing viruses, trojans and hacking attacks to the CIA.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Marble does this by hiding (&quot;obfuscating&quot;) text fragments used in CIA malware from visual inspection. This is the digital equivallent of a specalized CIA tool to place covers over the english language text on U.S. produced weapons systems before giving them to insurgents secretly backed by the CIA.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Marble forms part of the CIA&#039;s anti-forensics approach and the CIA&#039;s Core Library of malware code. It is &quot;[D]esigned to allow for flexible and easy-to-use obfuscation&quot; as &quot;string obfuscation algorithms (especially those that are unique) are often used to link malware to a specific developer or development shop.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Marble source code also includes a deobfuscator to reverse CIA text obfuscation. Combined with the revealed obfuscation techniques, a pattern or signature emerges which can assist forensic investigators attribute previous hacking attacks and viruses to the CIA. Marble was in use at the CIA during 2016. It reached 1.0 in 2015.<\/span>","filename":"heartattack","ext":".jpg","w":840,"h":798,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":237,"tim":1491363844103,"time":1491363844,"md5":"QMwUWP9tuvCp2LNcf9JnvA==","fsize":294275,"resto":0,"id":"xnyw3SYB","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wikileaks-vault-7-marble-framework","country_name":"Australia","replies":5,"images":2,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119562631,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:47:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"inb4 old news, looks to be nothing, sleepy, russia is hacking America&#039;s dental work, etc.","time":1491364060,"resto":119562251,"id":"SxC25VEK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119563570,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:56:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"so Chuck Shumer hasn&#039;t been doing his job because he feels like he&#039;s threatened by our intelligence community?","time":1491364610,"resto":119562251,"id":"re\/PcXCy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119563997,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)00:00:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"huh, sure are a lot of \/b\/ tier threads right now","filename":"cia-vault-7","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":427,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491364853997,"time":1491364853,"md5":"9JwVvTajdGA7iYC7WxVnmQ==","fsize":80162,"resto":119562251,"id":"SxC25VEK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119564189,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)00:03:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"this stuff gets crazy and crazier.

There is no need for that. Now countries have so many specialized tools at their disposal to bring another nation to their knees without resorting to conventional warfare. You can shoot down their satellites to jam their entire communication system, conduct cyber warfare to destroy their financial system, hold bioweapons over their heads and blackmail them, that kind of stuff. To go all in with guns blazing in 21st century warfare (between real superpowers, not just bombing sand people) would be like bringing a sledgehammer to a sniper battle. Your enemy will shut you down with high-tech tools before you can even blink, at a fraction of the cost and little blood spilt.<br><br>If WW3 does break out you might not even realize it began until it was too late - hell, the elites may not even tell us it happened at all and cover it up. It will involve only a few thousand scientists, hackers, drone operatives and special agents from each country, each trying to scupper the other nation&#039;s military&amp;civilian infrastructure with high tech weapons we may never get to see. It will be over in a matter of days, weeks at max.<br><br>When the US and China go to war, there will be no fireworks raining down from the sky. It will seem like a perfectly normal day in New York or Beijing. Then suddenly the satellites will explode, the power grid fails, the stock market goes crazy, the internet goes down, and drones sink an aircraft carrier or two. There might even be a &#039;terrorist attack&#039; killing a few people in some major city. Then one of them will declare victory.","filename":"schlacht_von_zablat_hogenbersche_geschichtsblatter","ext":".jpg","w":3441,"h":2581,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492423674325,"time":1492423674,"md5":"\/6CjrJRR8wFt9bwj7vZjwQ==","fsize":1718712,"resto":0,"id":"4jpY7pGp","country":"KR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ww3-will-not-be-the-end-of-the-world","country_name":"South Korea","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121510428,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)06:31:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121508647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121508647<\/a><br>you don&#039;t get it, do you? In globalized world ruled by truculent CIA lemon party gestapo there are no countries, no wars and no military conflicts. There is only one military divided into various factions following one orders of one axis of Dr Evil. So what we have now is various layers of military deception resembling that narrative in aristocrats joke. It&#039;s not far fetched to assume that they are in process of solidifying already created network of scattered castles. So this new world order is not about ideology or government. It&#039;s about them implementing their tar budget way of life (some sort of very advanced technology that they can&#039;t really speak of) into our open and democratic society. Obviously they tried and failed. So it&#039;s broken. But are they squealing &quot;Change!&quot; and &quot;Disruption!&quot; trying to cover their crimes or it&#039;s part of intended course of action?","time":1492425079,"resto":121508647,"id":"EWb8h31o","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"}]}

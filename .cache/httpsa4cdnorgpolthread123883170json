Why are you such faggots for caring about what stupid people do when it probably has no impact on your life? Why don&#039;t you appreciate that you are not a piece of shit yourself and move on, there is nothing you can do about it. Stupid people will continue to do stupid things. The effects of the new degenerate Western world will probably not have too much effect in your lifetime and even if it did why do you care? There is no meaning to life. Worry about yourselves. Society is shit.

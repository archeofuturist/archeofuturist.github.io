So I&#039;ve quoted it in it&#039;s entirety:<br><br>Reviving this thread someone posted that needs more attention:<br><br>Mike Flynn immediately began following some guy on Twitter, after he wrote a series of tweets in which he speculated that it was the Russians who had informed the Trump campaign that Obama had been spying on them. So, fearing that the FBI was compromised and knowing that the AG was meeting with Clinton on the tarmac, they decided to use Flynn as the sacrificial lamb, for the purpose of gathering ultimate proof and exposing the leakers and the spying. <br><br>This would normally be pure speculation, but Flynn immediately followed the dude who tweeted all of this. It seems safe to say that&#039;s pretty close to an endorsement, if not at least a nudge.

In 2015, IRCC processed applications (new and extensions) from 1,588,590 persons seeking temporary resident visas to come to Canada, 82.3% of which were approved. IRCC continued to be successful in promoting the use of multiple-entry visas, which are valid for up to 10 years and allow applicants from visa-required countries to travel to Canada more frequently and on their own schedules. In 2015, a total of 1,231,041 multiple-entry visas were issued, which was a 21% increase from 2014. Effective February 6, 2014, a policy change automatically considered visitors to Canada eligible for a multiple-entry visa.

In 2006, 57% of residents were foreign-born.[26] Visible minorities make up 67.4% of the population.[26] The population is 22.0% South Asian, 19.5% Chinese, 10.3% Black, and 6.5% Filipino.[26] The remaining visible minority groups each represented less than 2% of the population. The immigrant population has created vibrant multicultural locales in various areas of Scarborough. One of the more notable among these is the heavy concentration of Chinese businesses and restaurants in the Agincourt neighbourhood. Many of Scarborough&#039;s main arteries, including segments of Kingston Road, Eglinton Avenue East and Lawrence Avenue East, feature Caribbean, Chinese, African, and Indian restaurants and shops, as well as businesses representing the other ethnic groups in the area. Scarborough also has several Sri Lankan Tamil-owned businesses that cater to the community.[1]<\/span>","filename":"i am the immigration master now","ext":".jpg","w":478,"h":350,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1490185223241,"time":1490185223,"md5":"lBZvYX2hYDqWZvOovfIuXQ==","fsize":30146,"resto":117744282,"id":"AcxORBxt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117752678,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)08:20:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117752129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117752129<\/a><br>Just asking cause Canada is mostly male and mostly gay.<br>Are you feminine or do you plan on turning into a man??

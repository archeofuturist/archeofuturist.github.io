In 2015, IRCC processed applications (new and extensions) from 1,588,590 persons seeking temporary resident visas to come to Canada, 82.3% of which were approved. IRCC continued to be successful in promoting the use of multiple-entry visas, which are valid for up to 10 years and allow applicants from visa-required countries to travel to Canada more frequently and on their own schedules. In 2015, a total of 1,231,041 multiple-entry visas were issued, which was a 21% increase from 2014. Effective February 6, 2014, a policy change automatically considered visitors to Canada eligible for a multiple-entry visa. IRCC also introduced a single fee for the processing of a temporary resident visa applicable to both single-entry and multiple-entry applications.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Literally 1.2 million shitskins get unlimited live\/work visas \/ year for 10 years that can skip straight to PR or citizenship.<\/span><br><br>Are you this fucking stupid?<br><br>And you wonder why a coder in SF can get $250 USD \/ hr vs $20 CAD \/ hr in Toronto","filename":"2 million shitskins","ext":".png","w":1772,"h":1837,"tn_w":120,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490177717749,"time":1490177717,"md5":"VzZpBSRnMHiNb+AHv9hJBA==","fsize":380911,"resto":117744282,"id":"AcxORBxt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117745026,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)06:17:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117744801\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117744801<\/a><br>Toronto rents are about $3000 for 500 sq ft, up there with Manhattan<br><br>except wages are in the $200-300K USD range in Manhattan<br><br>where as they&#039;re $60-70K CAD in Toronto, aka $40-50K USD","time":1490177856,"resto":117744282,"id":"AcxORBxt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117745172,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)06:19:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117744687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117744687<\/a><br>Did you ever hear of 2 million shitskins being let into Canada a year?<br><br>Nope<br><br>all you hear about is <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;muh reasoned immigration, 300k, all highly skilled&quot;<\/span><br><br>What if I told you the most critical labour shortage program, Express Entry in Economic Class, had &quot;COOK&quot; and &quot;FOOD PREP SUPERVISOR&quot; as it&#039;s top 2 express entry categories?","time":1490177989,"resto":117744282,"id":"AcxORBxt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117745247,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)06:20:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117745172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117745172<\/a><br>Hey buddy, you NEED those kebab shops.","time":1490178053,"resto":117744282,"id":"qDJXs96C","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":117745366,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)06:23:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117744687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117744687<\/a><br>I should mention those states are also minimized because each of these shitskins is getting multiple-entry visas, so instead of having to reapply every 3-6-12 months, they&#039;re getting one visa that&#039;s good for 10 years so they can keep the stats as low as possible while pulling the wool over your eyes<br><br>Amazing how Canada has gone from 25M whites \/ 6.3M non-whites in 2011 to 24M whites \/ 11M whites in 2016 despite muh reasoned immigrations of 250K\/year. <br><br>Wait, but it increased by 950,000 non-whites\/year?

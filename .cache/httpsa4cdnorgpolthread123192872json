So apparently because Alex Jones is someone who talks about conspiracy theories, he doesn&#039;t deserve to have his children (and is part of the hurrr durr &quot;alt reich&quot;). These nasty cunts are openly mocking Alex and laughing at him, during one of the most difficult times of his life. Fuck them. I&#039;m tired of their hypocrisy and hate speech. Alex Jones, as much as he may ham it up for his show, is a fucking great guy and doesn&#039;t deserve the bullshit he&#039;s dealing with right now. FUCK these cowards kicking the man while he&#039;s down.","filename":"reddit","ext":".png","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493385427907,"time":1493385427,"md5":"ZbjZvDGbSRR\/\/2HfmD2Wuw==","fsize":39922,"resto":0,"id":"CSEORtkq","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fuck-reddits-bullshit","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":0,"unique_ips":10},{"no":123193390,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)09:22:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Features such insightful comments as:<br><br>&quot;If you honestly think this guy being around children is a good thing, you are an awful, horrible person.

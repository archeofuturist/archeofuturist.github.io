Bring a water bottle and a bag of chips yourself. Medical stuff isn&#039;t a bad idea though. <br>May I making pepper spray that can be sprayed in a stream as opposed to a mist. Get one of those spray cans from a gardening store or something then get a bunch of chili peppers. Dry them out and then soak in acetone for several days (make sure container is sealed so it doesn&#039;t evaporate) so the capsaicin goes into solution. Then let it evaporate and filter it. You now may dilute it in water and put in your container. Should easily incapacitate any antifa. As for smuggling it in have it in a vile and then only fill the spray tool from a drinking fountain when there.","time":1493054100,"resto":122608912,"id":"d6Dcr1PA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

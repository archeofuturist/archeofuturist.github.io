Lived here my whole life and I&#039;ve met plenty of straight up ass holes. Also health care is not 100% free like people think. Things like prescription drugs and dental are not covered. It&#039;s more like, say you get into a car accident and break you leg or somthing. You get bandaged up and see the doctor for free. But you pay for the ambulance ride there, and also the pain pills they will most likely prescribe you afterward. Also maybe the crutches you might need aren&#039;t free.

Obama actually has restricted government power, while Trump wants to expand it, to deal with issues like women uncomfortable with transexuals using their bathroom, by allowing them to do things like force them to use a third bathroom, which is currently restricted by Title IX.<br><br>Obamas approach is better. It&#039;s not an issue that needs to be managed through the government. It can be enforced through individuals and the community, it doesn&#039;t need to be enforced via those that represent the government.<br><br>However, the federal government should not be managing how the states manage their bathrooms.

If people want to rename these bathrooms &quot;gender neutral&quot; bathrooms to virtue signal, that&#039;s fine by me, it&#039;s a trend that will die off like calling &quot;Christmas trees&quot; &quot;Holiday trees&quot; because it&#039;s just so stupid.

I think people are being overly alarmist about this. We&#039;ve known Trump had close ties to Israel for awhile, we&#039;ve know for a long time that he really isn&#039;t \/ourguy\/ on the JQ. This strike doesn&#039;t really surprise me much. <br><br>It has a lot of upsides metapolitically. It squashes the Russia narrative once and for all. It squashes the &quot;trump hates muslim babies&quot; narrative. It distracts from &quot;chaos in the white house&quot; narrative. It throws a bone to the GOP and liberal establishments and the kikes and helps to get them off his back on his domestic issues. (a legit worry is that feeding the beast will encourage it though). <br><br>It all depends on what comes next. What he should do is leverage this new found Mainstream support into a more hard line on immigration, infrastructure and trade. We&#039;ll see in the next few months. <br><br>If Trump escalates further and forms a &quot;coalition&quot; to oust Assad, and abandons his nationalist immigration polices, I will dump him. I&#039;ve come far enough with Trump to give him at least a few weeks at least and see what happens. <br><br>Trump has do with the actual realities of dealing with the American system. That means dealing with kikes and dealing with liberals. He can&#039;t win 100% of the time. He also can&#039;t go to the mat for every issue.

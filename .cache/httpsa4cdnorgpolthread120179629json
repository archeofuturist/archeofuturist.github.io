Yet here you are snickering to yourself in a dark room, wiping away tears from your eyes, thinking you&#039;re the hottest shit that&#039;s totally untouchable, but what&#039;s this? You just wiped spicy cheeto dust in your eyes. That&#039;s the 7th time this week. I&#039;m over here. Evolved. Shitposting from my phone, doxxing myself so fags like you can waddle their fat ass on my property for me to legally murder. &quot;oh no an intruder&quot; *shotguns*. And that&#039;s pretty much the whole point of this. You&#039;re a fucking loser and an awful troll. I&#039;ve been trolling on bitches like you since I was 12. And here you are. Probably 30+. Kissless virgin. Getting angry at people on the Internet. I pity you.","time":1491687262,"resto":120179629,"id":"EErP5BVC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

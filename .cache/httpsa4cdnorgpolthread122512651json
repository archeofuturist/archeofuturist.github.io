The worthless City Council are 70% niggers. My tax money doesn&#039;t go to fix the potholes in the streets, but it does go to feed the niggers. Can&#039;t go for a walk down the street at night without getting robbed and possibly killed by niggers. You look at the videos of Detroit and Baltimore back in the Fifties and look at them now, and you see what a total pestilence they are.","time":1492998957,"resto":122512651,"id":"Y2Fn\/nrl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122525480,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)21:57:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122524684\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122524684<\/a><br>That&#039;s almost surely why she left but she totally isn&#039;t racist, my parents just moved to that town because it was one of the nicest in the area.

One day I made the mistake of actually buying a small amount of weed off one, continued to buy weed every so often from the dude, another more respectable looking black guy started working for me and he sold much better shit so I started buying off him as did everyone else around the place.

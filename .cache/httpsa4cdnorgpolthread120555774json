I was out playing basketball with my friend, and he came up and asked if he could shoot some hoops with us. We all were so happy he was there and wore our trump hats to play. I was going towards the basket when Trump pulled my hat over my head and slammed me into it. He proceeded to make a goal and asked if I was ok saying &quot;you&#039;re a pretty sweaty guy&quot;. My friends started laughing at me and started calling me a wetback. I had the ball again and trump stuck his leg out and tripped me. He then threw the ball in my face and made another goal. He walked over and said &quot;what&#039;s wrong little guy? can&#039;t handle the wall?&quot;. I told him these move he was making were illegal but he punched me in the face and said &quot;I&#039;m the fucking president I can do whatever I want to&quot;. While I was lying on the ground, he lit my trump hat on fire and put it in my pants. He said &quot;you&#039;ll be fine the sweat will put it out&quot; He asked his secret service agents to break down my door and grab a sandwich from my fridge. They came back and said there were no premade sandwiches so they just put the whole fridge on the back of his limo and left.","filename":"Shareblue-Sample-05","ext":".jpg","w":582,"h":491,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":210,"tim":1491886559671,"time":1491886559,"md5":"P9mdL8Q6KHWkqCX8lLAG9w==","fsize":43469,"resto":0,"id":"raai9ivU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-met-trump-the-other-day-i-was-out-playing","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120556082,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:58:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120555774\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120555774<\/a><br>Get some better friends.

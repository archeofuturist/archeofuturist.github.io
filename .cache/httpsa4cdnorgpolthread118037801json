Martin Luther was the good King and the smartest of the three. He preached peace, loyalty, and self-respect. Don was a debo who sprung on the wrong cat and got rickets from a stank poon on 125th Street. He was a pumperbumper who turned a trick on a skeezer named Geroniho and suffered in drinkin&#039; a case of Natural Ice while blastin&#039; diarrhea all over his crib; he was the bad king. Rodney was a bull dagger cootchie ripper who was geeking on baking soda while flab stabbing some ho in the back of a hoopty. He gave the &quot;Jelly-Donut&quot; to the Mogul-Tric, while Amadou Diallo changed his name to Amadou What the Cops Tell Me to Do. He was the worst king of all.","filename":"kwanza","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490328404015,"time":1490328404,"md5":"Yr9TXv071TjyJP5A1EuN3Q==","fsize":62304,"resto":0,"id":"\/KplSvq+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"there-was-three-kings-don-martin-luther-and","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

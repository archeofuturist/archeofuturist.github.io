I don&#039;t know why, I&#039;ve never had a problem with gay people and my coworker who is a fag is tolerable.

Nothing against the guys but first instinct of our race is procreation and the sight of attempted procreation or acts associated with procreation without the ability is like watching someone fuck a fence.

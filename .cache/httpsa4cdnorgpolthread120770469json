Mexico has about 150 million people. Canada has 30 million. Canada has one of the largest land masses of any country in the world. Looking forward realistically for the future of North America we are going to have to invade Canada and annex a large percentage of their territory. We may have to actually absorb their entire country into the united states. They have so much land and they are not even using it, and lets be honest the world isnt getting any bigger, but the populations are rising rapidly. So I propose that we need to accelerate the plans to invade Canada for the common good. Besides they are a bunch of cucks anyway. Who is with me?","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-12 at 7.12.56 AM","ext":".png","w":1328,"h":591,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":111,"tim":1492012556617,"time":1492012556,"md5":"d5zuPtVKzGUywLIixSplxA==","fsize":389982,"resto":0,"id":"iJWlKvbp","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-time-we-have-a-serious-discussion-poll-united","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":120772347,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)12:12:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"Canada is pretty much already a US state culturally and economically(if you can overlook all the commy crap).","time":1492013557,"resto":120770469,"id":"7\/4M4\/86","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120772985,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)12:18:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120770469\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120770469<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They have so much land<\/span><br>aren&#039;t large swaths of it too cold for long term establishments, kind of why most large canadian cities are in the south near the border and along the coasts","time":1492013896,"resto":120770469,"id":"4mz6fVwS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120773170,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)12:19:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;invade Canada<\/span><br><br>Please do.

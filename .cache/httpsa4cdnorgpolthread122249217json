After university, I found myself working in some of the world\u2019s most dangerous places including Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as New Orleans\u2019 most violent housing projects. I owned a steamboat restaurant in the Virgin Islands, ran a political campaign in Louisiana and worked at the US Congress in Washington DC. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In 2006 I founded Tangiers, now a leading global business specializing in insurance, emergency assistance, on-the-ground claims handling and intelligence services. With the business growing rapidly, I moved from the United States to my ancestral home of Reggio di Calabria, Italy, where I met my wife, Regina. In the meantime, Tangiers was growing. Our service reach had expanded to more than 100 countries. Seeking better logistics in an English-speaking country, we moved to Malta in 2008.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In 2012, to help serve people who live, travel and work in dangerous places, Tangiers started the Organisation for Better Security (OBS). Along with weekly articles, OBS includes in-depth reports, analysis and news alerts.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Inspired by 2013\u2019s migrant tragedy in Lampedusa, my wife and I founded the Migrant Offshore Aid Station (MOAS).

I don&#039;t have any kind of training in rescue, never worked or volunteered in humanitarian effort or aid, it&#039;s not even among my chief interests. One can be personally detached from the problem and still find that letting people die in the ocean when it&#039;s entirely preventable is simply unjustifiable. I try to do good with my life as much as possible, and I do to some extension systematically with my own profession, but the amount of good any one individual can do with his life is very limited. When it comes to these intense human suffering problems I choose to show my support through vote and donations. There are plenty of people willing to work helping people in these situations, be it for economic opportunity or for personality inclination, so what&#039;s the problem again? <br><br>By the way, how about your government stops fucking around wherever it wants creating all these problems in the first place?

The prophet Elijah, who came to prep the way for Christ (both in the Old Testament, and at the Transfiguration in the New)<br><br>God got so fed up with the heathenry that he told Elijah to rail against the king and queen, and then sent a drought. When he wanted to end it Elijah got together and said &quot;ok we&#039;re gonna prove who&#039;s God and who&#039;s worshipping a lump of clay&quot;. So they get together and he gives the Baal\/Asherah\/Molech priests of the day their choice of sacrifice, and the only rule is you can&#039;t bring the fire yourself. The entire time they&#039;re praying and wailing and cutting themselves to appeal to their guy he&#039;s mocking them. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hey your &#039;god&#039; doesn&#039;t seem to be sending fire, maybe he&#039;s busy, or travelling far away, or maybe he&#039;s in the can. SPEAK UP he can&#039;t hear you!<\/span><br><br>When they finally give up, he doesn&#039;t just put his sacrifice on the altar and pray for the fire, nah that&#039;d be easy. He digs a trench, and says pour water over the altar til it fills the trench. The trench wasn&#039;t all that deep, maybe 15 liters, but the act of having to pour water til it covered the wood, the stones, saturated the earth and filled the trench prolly triples that. Of course everything is burned the minute he asks God, but is that it? Course not, he MURDERS EVERY LAST EVIL PRIEST, so they can&#039;t taint his people anymore.<br><br>This is the prophet Christ follows, and emulates\/surpasses in leading the world. Stop thinking Christian life = pacifism, God loves to employ bad freaking men, to help keep the world on track.","filename":"1484930504632","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":860,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491882758923,"time":1491882758,"md5":"u\/hfOfUNPOOqjLubNO\/jag==","fsize":83328,"resto":120546692,"id":"x0SSdYej","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120548542,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)23:52:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120548057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120548057<\/a><br>What has nork done to the US... ever","time":1491882777,"resto":120546692,"id":"OfFac5Om","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":120548554,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)23:53:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120548479\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120548479<\/a><br>I knew that would be an arc without any payoff or resolution.","time":1491882788,"resto":120546692,"id":"++juXLWb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120548557,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)23:53:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120548374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120548374<\/a><br>DEUS AWOO","filename":"1487451128280","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1491882788966,"time":1491882788,"md5":"BBgVZebMUOQNVsV3UlVSXQ==","fsize":181036,"resto":120546692,"id":"TdPeEoJW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120548596,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)23:53:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120548430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120548430<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Official<\/span><br>Songbird needs to shut his fucking mouth","time":1491882806,"resto":120546692,"id":"LUFb+reJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120548626,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)23:53:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120548430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120548430<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;headlinesurfer<\/span><br>Or<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;white house press secretary<\/span><br><br>:Thinking:","time":1491882819,"resto":120546692,"id":"MSAjVOcI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120548673,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)23:54:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"What&#039;s our favorite neo-con been up to while I was asleep? :)","filename":"1462271475449","ext":".png","w":900,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491882849597,"time":1491882849,"md5":"ZKkHJ1wJj53IpBY60vh2xQ==","fsize":381287,"resto":120546692,"id":"+YG0SP8p","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":120548675,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)23:54:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"General threads are killing \/pol\/<br>Reply if you agree.","time":1491882849,"resto":120546692,"id":"sOpHhNhI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120548676,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)23:54:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120548596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120548596<\/a><br><br>And the other source was some chick on Twitter?

Additionally there might be mistakes in translation, lost sections of books, any manor of other problems getting what God told someone to write.

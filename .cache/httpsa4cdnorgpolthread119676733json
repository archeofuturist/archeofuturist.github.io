The guy knows how to appeal to people, he hit up every place that he needed to and told them precisely what they wanted to hear. And while Trump was (arguably) a &#039;shady businessman&#039; to the layman, he&#039;s a fucking golden boy compared to dispassionate, dishonest Hillary Clinton. I thought the prospect of a female president was neato like the rest of them, but she is a truly unsettling individual. <br><br>I would argue it wasn&#039;t the quality of Trump&#039;s campaign that won though.

I have no idea how you can even have internet in such a fucking autistic shitshow of an excuse of a pathetic piece of shit landmass that sadly has to be referred to as a country, because the amount of impossibly ass-backwards retarded niggers and faggots could not even be conceived as a possibility anywhere fathomably close to the realm of reality, yet you managed to do the fucking impossible, so bravo brazil, another fantastic fucking shitpost, one more point for your autistic little nigger brain.

Libertarians live in a fantasy land where the balance of power will peacefully correct itself of the US suddenly retreated it&#039;s global presence. But that&#039;s not the real world. Itd be great to be able to have a purely defensive force but that isn&#039;t realistic right now. The increase is basically undoing a cut that happened under Obama a few years ago. Enough generals have spoken out about our equipment being outdated and depleted that I&#039;m inclined to believe the claim that it&#039;s &quot;needed&quot; in order to optimize our military. If the US just suddenly brought all the troops home the world would completely destabilize. For one, we literally are the defense force of Europe.

Now the region is a total disaster that no one else can really deal with it. Russia&#039;s too poor and has too many other problems, Europe is already getting invaded, and if China is allowed to deal with it they&#039;ll just blatantly conquer the region for a Chinese empire and dominate the west in every arena afterwords.Truthfully, Trump (and McCain actually in 08 election) was right when he said that leaving Iraq would create a power vaccum. Now Muslims are launching Jihad against the world and the Saudi-Iranian proxy wars are escalating towards real cofrontation. The mideast situation is really something that will have to be dealt with by the US. That&#039;s just how it is.<br><br>Basically the US must be strong right now or the world is going to spiral out of control. And once the Europe and the Mideast are dealt with we&#039;re still going to have to have a huge historical showdown with China.","filename":"1489621463161","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":615,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":192,"tim":1490070970826,"time":1490070970,"md5":"tyyHwN+9muoOfBvKteyKDg==","fsize":60729,"resto":0,"id":"yXxdQ2xI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-do-you-think-pol-is-trumps-dod-budget","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":2,"unique_ips":5},{"no":117587613,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)00:37:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117587445\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117587445<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What do you think \/pol\/, is Trumps DoD budget increase justified?<\/span><br><br>Pic related<br><br>Neocon bullshit budget for bible thumping neocon base.","filename":"1489085932578","ext":".jpg","w":1422,"h":710,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1490071074251,"time":1490071074,"md5":"pyS+b92m\/xtTJBUkJe9zBg==","fsize":147615,"resto":117587445,"id":"a7I9BjJI","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117588162,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)00:43:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"If the US just suddenly brought all the troops home the world would completely destabilize.

Neocons want war with Putin and Assad. Trumps foreign policy is shaping up to be something different. You can&#039;t just write off all military activity as &quot;neocon bullshit&quot;. Ideally I would like to see the US practice more non interventionism, but that time just isn&#039;t now. When literally every one else in the world is building up arms and escalating it&#039;s just plainly stupid to intentionally make ourselves weaker because we feel guilty and dumb abt invading Iraq. Its pretty objective fact that pulling out of the mideast and slowly withdrawing from the world stage over the last eight years hasn&#039;t worked. It seems evident that the US is going to have to reclaim its world leader role. If we don&#039;t the midast is going to escalate to total war. Think the refugee crisis is bad now? Imagine what it would become. The global jihade will launch out of the mideast imploding. The world&#039;s a mess, and sure the US military adventurism caused a lot of it, but someone still has to clean up the mess","time":1490071970,"resto":117587445,"id":"yXxdQ2xI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117589369,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)00:55:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"China is going to collapse in a few years.","time":1490072105,"resto":117587445,"id":"6hMd5Ch3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117589631,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)00:58:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;trillions missing<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;throws money at problem<\/span>","time":1490072286,"resto":117587445,"id":"YLkVfqtt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

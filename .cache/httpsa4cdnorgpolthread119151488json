I understand that we supported him during the campaign since he shared some of our views. But now that he&#039;s president, and make decisions that have real world impact, can we disapprove if he does something that is not in our interest? I think we should allow people to post CONSTRUCTIVE criticism of Trump without calling them shills. We need to stand up for ourselves and not be Trump&#039;s cucks.","filename":"Donald_Trump_official_portrait","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":1000,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491026099248,"time":1491026099,"md5":"Znww5zpwH07wrWRqWc8kwQ==","fsize":78747,"resto":0,"id":"vW7Ottdp","country":"NO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"donald-trump","country_name":"Norway","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119151601,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)01:56:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119151488\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119151488<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we<\/span><br><br>No, paid Russian trolls supported him. <br><br>Maybe you were retarded enough to get manipulated by their propaganda, but &quot;we&quot; didn&#039;t support him.","time":1491026175,"resto":119151488,"id":"UbAGWzRj","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119151712,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)01:57:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119151488\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119151488<\/a><br>Trumps failure will bring upon National Socialism and finally permanently BTFO the lolbertarian divide and conquer Jewish right.

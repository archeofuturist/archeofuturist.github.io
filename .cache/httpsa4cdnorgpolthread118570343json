At the time, Catalonia did not yet exist as a political entity, though the use of this term seems to acknowledge Catalonia as a cultural or geographical entity.<br>The counties that would eventually make up the Principality of Catalonia were gradually unified under the rule of the Count of Barcelona. In 1137, the County of Barcelona and the Kingdom of Aragon were unified under a single dynasty, creating what modern historians call the Crown of Aragon; however Aragon and Catalonia retained their own political structure and legal traditions.

Against what people meme around, Catalonia is pretty right wing, we&#039;ve had mostly right wing govts. But there&#039;s no real right wing in Spain. Spain has been like a planned economy since the days of Franco, and even the right wing parties constantly boast about MUH PUBLIC SERVICES because they know that&#039;s how they get votes.<br>South is the most left-wing region because all they want is free gib.<br><br>There&#039;s mostly two kinds of British people: pensioners living out their days in the sun, an drunk chav tourists. The former are nice people, the latter are worse scim than Spaniards themselves which is quite a feat.","time":1490661796,"resto":118570343,"id":"uVtZ494K","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118587645,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:49:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Piedgedemont hara a Catalu\u00f1a independiente?","time":1490662170,"resto":118570343,"id":"\/H5F+nZE","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118587907,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:51:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118574930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118574930<\/a><br>because of 1492.","time":1490662306,"resto":118570343,"id":"\/H5F+nZE","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118588056,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:53:18","name":"LARPer","com":"Second Spanish Civil War when?","filename":"spanish_civil_war","ext":".png","w":324,"h":419,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490662398319,"time":1490662398,"md5":"L3Ems0BwfAN1WcGpbxc6xg==","fsize":36204,"resto":118570343,"id":"YD1Yzzfn","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":118588583,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:58:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118588056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118588056<\/a><br>Catalan referendum will trigger second civil war.<br><br>SCREENCAP THIS","time":1490662681,"resto":118570343,"id":"uVtZ494K","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]}

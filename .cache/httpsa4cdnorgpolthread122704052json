Also, ordering a cab via an app will literally mean that the cab driver will not do anything to you (fuck with the meter, ask for a bigger tip etc), mainly because all of the apps function via a point system - a taxi driver puts real money in the app and he receives points that he uses in order to make calls via the app - if he does anything remotely illegal (even coming late), the app will penalise him by taking away points.","time":1493126152,"resto":122704052,"id":"SHikzXHW","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":122732474,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)09:15:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122722360\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122722360<\/a><br>Semis will never be self driving","time":1493126156,"resto":122704052,"id":"G37T\/GE\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122732548,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)09:16:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122732237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122732237<\/a><br>This.

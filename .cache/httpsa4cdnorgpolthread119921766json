His counterpart is Cui Tiankai, China\u2019s ambassador in Washington. That, alone, gives China an edge. Mr Cui is a professional diplomat who knows America well \u2014 he did his postgraduate studies in the US capital and worked as an interpreter at the UN.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mr Kushner\u2019s chief qualification is that he is married to the president\u2019s daughter. Mr Cui has just one job \u2014 US-China relations. Among other things, Mr Kushner is the White House point person for Middle East peace, criminal justice reform and US business innovation.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;China seems to have grasped that the best way to influence Mr Trump is via his family. Chinese diplomats have gone out of their way to court Mr Kushner and Ivanka Trump, who were their guests of honour at the Chinese new year celebration in February. China has also looked favourably on Mr Trump\u2019s business.<\/span><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/EcZJe","filename":"images (1)","ext":".jpg","w":288,"h":301,"tn_w":239,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491558210490,"time":1491558210,"md5":"cyqxBcI2G5y0BdFlNnCuEg==","fsize":18869,"resto":0,"id":"TWmwgnO6","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"anyone-else-worried-about-trump-selling-out-or","country_name":"Australia","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119921947,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:45:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"good news for me friendo","filename":"2f7","ext":".jpg","w":601,"h":508,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":105,"tim":1491558315675,"time":1491558315,"md5":"7QG+pK\/9qNss1l5fm+vnDw==","fsize":28337,"resto":119921766,"id":"XwJZ4KqH","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119922453,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:49:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119921947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119921947<\/a><br>I mean the sort of deal where he cedes ethnic Cuinewe areas to the PRC<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;like Vancouver<\/span>","time":1491558598,"resto":119921766,"id":"TWmwgnO6","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

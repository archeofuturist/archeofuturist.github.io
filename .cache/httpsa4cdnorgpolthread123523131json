They&#039;re conflicted - and untrustworthy unless you give them space to air their concerns, tell you their shame, and you can move on from there. If you don&#039;t feel she&#039;ll be a good mother, leave. But Jesus preached forgiveness and the end goal is raising proud children, so if she has a few notches that you&#039;ll never know for sure about - they all do - you can only read, improve yourself, protect yourself, and find a partner you can trust to be an intelligent, respectable, and love (not fear) motivated mother.","time":1493584991,"resto":123523131,"id":"6Lheksj8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

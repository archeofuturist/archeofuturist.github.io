He said instead of going to church we should have other activities to bring people together like a rock concert or a physics lecture. I&#039;m not religious but it annoys me that he can&#039;t understand that not all people are smart as him or logical thinkers. People also need an ideology to follow. I believe it is human nature to live your life according to an ideology. He is replacing religion with science, atheism, liberalism, and socialism while not realizing that below average thinkers cannot do that as easily. Without an ideology people become more and more degenerate (unless your ideology is Islam in which case you are already degenerate).<br><br>As smart as the guy is, his insane liberal ideology is so fucking disappointing.

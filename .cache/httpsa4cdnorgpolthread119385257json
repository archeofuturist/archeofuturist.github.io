It was extremely annoying for me. These are some of the things that bugged me. I didn&#039;t listen to the end. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;constant bashing of trump<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So scared to be xenophobic that he asks joe rogan if hes xenophobic because he has qualms accepting that our ancestors might be AI that exterminates us.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cries about how backwards we are that we cant accept socialized healthcare and alludes to how technology will force us to have a communist salary for all.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pompous attitude about religion and how he can&#039;t understand why people have faith.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;throws in some punches about Republicans not believing in evolution, and not accepting gays.<\/span><br><br>The attitude about religion bugged me. He said instead of going to church we should have other activities to bring people together like a rock concert or a physics lecture. I&#039;m not religious but it annoys me that he can&#039;t understand that not all people are smart as him or logical thinkers. People also need an ideology to follow. I believe it is human nature to live your life according to an ideology. He is replacing religion with science, atheism, liberalism, and socialism while not realizing that below average thinkers cannot do that as easily. Without an ideology people become more and more degenerate (unless your ideology is Islam in which case you are already degenerate).<br><br>As smart as the guy is, his insane liberal ideology is so fucking disappointing. Talk about cognitive dissonance, from a scientist no less.<br> <br>Discuss.","filename":"lawrence","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491255881525,"time":1491255881,"md5":"QKala889qA+b0MRakX5Xcw==","fsize":110392,"resto":0,"id":"7E1fMGdN","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lawrence-krauss-and-his-retarded-socialist-ideas","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119385709,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)17:48:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"agreed. it blows my mind that so many leaders of science are incapable of being critical of dems.

They did not teach these concepts properly in school. The two main things that i think have led to &quot;flat earth&quot; being believable are the fact that they have always shown people maps that are scaled wrong, therefore the vast majority of people have no concept of how big the earth actually is. The other thing is people were not taught about gravity in a correct way, most people think of it like every body in space is like a spherical magnet that sucks things into it.

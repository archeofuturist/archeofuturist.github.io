I&#039;m not a regular user, but I do come here every now and then when something significant (or atleast what I think is significant) happens in media. Most recently Berkeley, and the ANTIFA &quot;attack&quot; that had taken place. I noticed that when stuff like this happens, you guys are pretty fucking good at singling out, and pin pointing these terrorists.<br>I&#039;m joining the military in a couple of weeks, and I hope to gain some knowledge atleast some hand to hand combat, and I&#039;ll figure what else I&#039;d need from there. <br>I also saw a picture of one of these thugs, demasked, and having his head pulled up by his nasty fucking hippy dreads to show his face. I&#039;d very much like to be this helpful, and single out these fucking clowns, an unmask them, dump the pictures here, and have you autismos identify them. If you&#039;re interested, that&#039;s great. If you&#039;re not, too bad, I&#039;ll be dumping the pictures anyways.<br>If you have a discord or some shit that you wouldn&#039;t mind having a discussion in, please post it here, thanks.","filename":"IMG_20170327_232009_548","ext":".jpg","w":1500,"h":1875,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493295291098,"time":1493295291,"md5":"n105Ucw7fKCEiJHK9zoqTw==","fsize":924848,"resto":0,"id":"jxkntQcL","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hello-4chan-im-not-a-regular-user-but-i-do-come","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123030070,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)08:19:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123029634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123029634<\/a><br>So you&#039;re going to try to unmask random antifa fags?","time":1493295570,"resto":123029634,"id":"Vy+XVEXi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

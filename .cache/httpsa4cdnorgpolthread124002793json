Who cares what Mike &quot;I was a garbage man for a day&quot; Rowe says? He has never worked a real job. Work as a garbage man for 40 years or trim bits of plastic off car mirrors for 12 hours a day for 50 years and talk about bringing your passion to work. Over my short life i&#039;ve worked in three factories, a warehouse, at McDonalds, as a waiter, and as an infantry officer. Only the officer job and making car engines was dignified and only being an officer wasn&#039;t hell. I would fucking love Mike Rowe&#039;s job spending a day as a garbage man or wrangling pigs or shoveling shit seems like fun. What makes jobs bad is tedium, working 12 hour shifts standing in place trimming plastic off of car mirrors is hell, sure the first week or two when you learn every machine and meet people is nice but once you get into a routine it grinds on you until suicide or homelessness seem objectively better than going to work.","time":1493867608,"resto":124002793,"id":"QFp0OLzN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124009802,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:14:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124002793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124002793<\/a><br>This is false humility which is based on a misinterpretation of christian morals, a lot of people believe in that the &#039;turn the other cheek&#039; means that if you let people shit on you and suffer for it that good karma will come to you and you will be rewarded and respected for your hard work. All I have to say is that is something called 3rd world countries that prove that wrong every day. People in 3rd world countries work very hard, they accept low pay as fair, they accept that a few people hoard all the resources as fair, and they pay with the kind of poverty that kills millions of people every year. No one ever became prosperous by accepted whatever was given to them. The bible never says you will be rewarded with wealth and honor by hard labor. The bible says industrious people who know how to bargain and do business will prosper. <br><br>The industrial age is over, we are an information and service economy now. Even jobs like construction is handed over to illegal aliens. The only people who will prosper in todays economy are people who are university educated and can command an income based on their ability to produce wealth. Most blue collar labor is being handed over to illegal aliens and so people are trying to convince blue collar workers to accept slave wages. Capitalism no longer provides an honest living for blue collar and manual labor and so you are going to start seeing people create communes where they grow their own food and build their own houses as they can provide more from their own hands than what they can buy in todays have\/have-not economy.","time":1493867663,"resto":124002793,"id":"0MSibtbj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124009868,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:14:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"DON&#039;T GAS THE ROBOTS <br>TECH WAR NOW","time":1493867691,"resto":124002793,"id":"vGo17xQX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

All I have to say is that is something called 3rd world countries that prove that wrong every day. People in 3rd world countries work very hard, they accept low pay as fair, they accept that a few people hoard all the resources as fair, and they pay with the kind of poverty that kills millions of people every year. No one ever became prosperous by accepted whatever was given to them. The bible never says you will be rewarded with wealth and honor by hard labor. The bible says industrious people who know how to bargain and do business will prosper. <br><br>The industrial age is over, we are an information and service economy now. Even jobs like construction is handed over to illegal aliens. The only people who will prosper in todays economy are people who are university educated and can command an income based on their ability to produce wealth. Most blue collar labor is being handed over to illegal aliens and so people are trying to convince blue collar workers to accept slave wages. Capitalism no longer provides an honest living for blue collar and manual labor and so you are going to start seeing people create communes where they grow their own food and build their own houses as they can provide more from their own hands than what they can buy in todays have\/have-not economy.","time":1493867663,"resto":124002793,"id":"0MSibtbj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124009868,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:14:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"DON&#039;T GAS THE ROBOTS <br>TECH WAR NOW","time":1493867691,"resto":124002793,"id":"vGo17xQX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124010044,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:16:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124007012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124007012<\/a><br>Someone with such an extensive background in( objective) science, shouldn&#039;t put his (subjective) nose in politics.

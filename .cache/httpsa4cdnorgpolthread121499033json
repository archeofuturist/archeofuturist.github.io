I&#039;m so disappointed and i cried myself to sleep yesterday. Most of the people on this sub did the same thing i guess. But we shouldn&#039;t give up right now. Neither of us. Now they&#039;ll try to deny Atat\u00fcrk&#039;s existence, they want to erase him from our history by turning this country into a islamic state. Secularity, Democracy and freedom, the characters in which our Republic was found, will diminish. But for the love of Atat\u00fcrk i will not give up. I&#039;ll shout louder, hang my Atat\u00fcrk Flag up my window so anyone can see i&#039;m not one of those Comars. I live in Germany and the majority of the Turks here voted yes. I can&#039;t comprehend how so many Turks in western countries voted for the opposite of what they&#039;ve been enjoying their whole life. They all went to school here and got western education, they&#039;re living here in peace, they&#039;re free and enjoy every democratic aspect of these countries, but they still vote yes to fuck you up. They live in Germany and they SEE that it can be done, but they still vote YES. It&#039;s madness if you ask me and i could talk hours about how dumb the average Turk here is.<br><br>I don&#039;t want anyone to think that i&#039;m one of those people. At least i can look back and tell my children that i voted Hayir for the referendum, i wanted them to have a better future, if i&#039;m ever going back. I educated myself on this topic very well before i voted and therfore voted No, because i saw the danger of a disappearing demcracy, which was already very broken. Sadly my vote counts as much as the vote from an uneducated Ayse Teyze who is living in a K\u00f6y for 60 years and only watches the Propaganda on TRT.<br><br>But I will not let my beloved country die so easily. And neither should you.","filename":"fft99_mf3338771","ext":".jpg","w":606,"h":340,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492415915904,"time":1492415915,"md5":"EUzgkiUaJYlrJhB97xjJzw==","fsize":40641,"resto":0,"id":"L9q0nXC+","country":"TR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"to-my-fellow-turkbros","country_name":"Turkey","replies":29,"images":4,"unique_ips":20},{"no":121499250,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)04:01:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121499033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121499033<\/a><br>Yea, that sucks you gonna be living in an Islamist shithole now : \/<br><br>OH WAIT!","time":1492416073,"resto":121499033,"id":"bC5szl+V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121499379,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)04:02:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121499250\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121499250<\/a><br>At least we dont have gender neutral bathrooms","time":1492416165,"resto":121499033,"id":"L9q0nXC+","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":121499441,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)04:03:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Can you guys please start washing and shaving your wife&#039;s?<br><br>they disgust me","time":1492416208,"resto":121499033,"id":"Laiu2yXG","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121499509,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)04:04:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121499441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121499441<\/a><br>or you can just stop eating their asses","time":1492416260,"resto":121499033,"id":"L9q0nXC+","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":121499659,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)04:06:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121499033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121499033<\/a><br>Islam is going to ruin your country.

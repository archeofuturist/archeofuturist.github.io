During the election people who knew him described him as the sort of person who just reflexively agrees with what the last person on the room says, and based on his time in office so far that seems like an accurate description. Since he filled his cabinet and surrounded himself with establishment neocons and warmongers, he&#039;s being fed the usual neocon narrative and neocon strategies. It&#039;s just that he&#039;s too dumb and insecure to know when he&#039;s being manipulated and how.<br><br>The ultimate problem here is that so much of this country can&#039;t tell the difference between actual conviction and blustery grandstanding. What seemed obvious to some as signs of insecurity and weakness, his supporters saw as strength of will. This makes sense considering his biggest fans; teenagers and racists and rednecks and the alt-right are so mired in their own ignorance and insecurity that they can&#039;t recognize it in others, and saw in him validation of their own weaknesses. In his tendency to let his insecurities and prejudices allow to him to fall for increasingly ridiculous ideas and obvious scams, they saw themselves. And since they reject the idea that they could be manipulated into acting against their own interests, they refused to consider how easily he could be tricked. Narcissism has a hard time recognizing narcissism. His flaw is the same flaw that led so many people to vote for him in the first place.<br><br>Trump&#039;s failure so far should be a wake-up call to those who supported him, to examine the flaws that he exposes in themselves. They won&#039;t, for precisely the same reasons that he appealed to them in the first place.

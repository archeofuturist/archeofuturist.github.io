It is no longer obsolete,&quot; Trump said during a press conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, adding that the alliance was increasing cooperation to stem terror attacks, among other steps.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump met with Stoltenberg in the Oval Office for an hour and discussed ways in which the NATO chief plans to get member countries to increase military spending to bolster the alliance.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;During the campaign, Trump repeatedly said NATO countries were not shouldering their fair share of defense costs, leaving too much of the burden on the United States.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;The very strong message from President Trump has been very helpful&quot; in getting member states to boost military spending, Stoltenberg said.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A few countries have recently agreed to move toward meeting the goal set in 2014 of spending 2% of gross domestic product on their militaries. That said, defense spending by NATO states had started to increase before Trump became president.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump&#039;s outreach to NATO came as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson received a frosty reception in Moscow during a visit that initially was billed as a way to jump-start better relations between Russia and the U.S.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tillerson&#039;s trip has been dominated by U.S. criticism of Russia&#039;s unwavering support for Syrian President Bashar Assad following a gruesome poison-gas attack in northern Syria last week blamed on Assad&#039;s forces. That attack prompted a retaliatory U.S. missile strike.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In a further irritant to Moscow, Trump signed off Tuesday on Montenegro joining NATO next month, expanding the alliance&#039;s footprint in the Balkans.<\/span><br><br>source: http:\/\/www.latimes.com\/politics\/was<wbr>hington\/la-na-essential-washington-<wbr>updates-despite-calling-nato-obsole<wbr>te-trump-1492008895-htmlstory.html","filename":"176231238","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":394,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492033944064,"time":1492033944,"md5":"J3BKAtGrzx67JAHtbZQb1g==","fsize":19989,"resto":0,"id":"1byAfM3L","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-i-said-nato-was-obsolete-it-is-no-longer","country_name":"United States","replies":169,"images":41,"unique_ips":103,"tail_size":50},{"no":120816061,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)17:54:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"looks like trump learned how to be a dirty politician pretty quickly","time":1492034059,"resto":120815773,"id":"ogK\/Rtsv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120816219,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)17:55:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120815773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120815773<\/a><br>fucking disappointing","time":1492034123,"resto":120815773,"id":"e4yWq1TF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120816311,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)17:56:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120815773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120815773<\/a><br>Yeah now that he wants European goys to join in his Zionist war against Russia they&#039;re not obsolete anymore.

I&#039;m hopeful it was an all around good move, but won&#039;t fantasize and lie to myself or anyone if it turns out to be bad. And actually going in to Syria (to fight Assad, not kill ISIS)?

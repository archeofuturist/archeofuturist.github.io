One can learn that he is a seventh-generation descendant of dynasty founder Mayer Amschel, and that as the great-grandson of &quot;the Benefactor&quot; he controls the Caesarea Edmond Benjamin de Rothschild Foundation. The foundation, through the management of the Caesarea community, provides financial support for education in Israel and has land and cash holdings worth more than NIS 700 million. Googling also reveals that the baron controls private banks in France and Switzerland, owns a number of the world&#039;s most famous palaces and wineries and is very fond of sports, particularly sailing. He rarely gives interviews; there are a handful of articles about him in the French press but none in the English-language media and certainly not in the Israeli media.<br><br>We were on the way to interview Baron Benjamin de Rothschild, the last scion of the dynasty&#039;s French branch, who is considered the world&#039;s richest Rothschild today.<br><br>http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/israel-news\/<wbr>family-values-1.323094","time":1492381191,"resto":121425922,"id":"QW\/HTLwp","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":121426990,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)18:22:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121426586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121426586<\/a><br>Just rich people doing their stuff.<br>SAGE","time":1492381332,"resto":121425922,"id":"wg0xE2xU","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":121427063,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)18:22:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121426990\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121426990<\/a><br>I agree as well, this thread is shit.<br>SAGE","time":1492381356,"resto":121425922,"id":"wg0xE2xU","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":121427408,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)18:24:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121426990\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121426990<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121427063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121427063<\/a><br>samefagging so hard","filename":"5","ext":".jpg","w":1198,"h":1200,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492381491096,"time":1492381491,"md5":"Qnwy0egbt7we4U2OyeQ\/2A==","fsize":960806,"resto":121425922,"id":"QW\/HTLwp","country":"CH","m_img":1,"country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":121427982,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)18:28:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121426426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121426426<\/a><br>Yes, but wouldn&#039;t you be more interested if you realized most of your (and worldwide problems) come directly from the ideas and minds of the people depicted on those images.","time":1492381682,"resto":121425922,"id":"QW\/HTLwp","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":121428498,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)18:30:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121426047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121426047<\/a><br>would fug","time":1492381854,"resto":121425922,"id":"C\/FpXCnv","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":121431012,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)18:46:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121425922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121425922<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/pastebin.com\/QtM48q9j<\/span><br><a href=\"#p121426047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121426047<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121426274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121426274<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121426344\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121426344<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121427408\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121427408<\/a><br>vs","filename":"1492204931762s","ext":".jpg","w":125,"h":84,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":84,"tim":1492382781489,"time":1492382781,"md5":"CJ7GCqoa9\/4plVHFE4ja\/g==","fsize":2942,"resto":121425922,"id":"QW\/HTLwp","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":121433596,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:02:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"wouldn&#039;t it be great to rip the whole room apart with a minigun or something? fun to think about.","time":1492383735,"resto":121425922,"id":"8yhbFwZm","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121434083,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:05:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121433596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121433596<\/a><br>indeed","time":1492383925,"resto":121425922,"id":"L4baradK","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":121434497,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:07:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Reminder that these happy merchants are one of several families responsible for all the death and degeneracy in the world for the past couple hundred years.","time":1492384074,"resto":121425922,"id":"fOuunXWh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121434510,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:07:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"creeps fuckers","filename":"1473207854339","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":4104,"tn_w":60,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492384074697,"time":1492384074,"md5":"7pRalx7HhUp+FzTzW5LgpA==","fsize":2338426,"resto":121425922,"id":"H5yiAYQy","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121435407,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:13:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121433596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121433596<\/a><br>someone call steve stephens!","time":1492384430,"resto":121425922,"id":"epoZWe9G","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

This is easier to do than you might imagine; for example, a few men with bolt cutters can take out huge swaths of telecom... some well-placed shots in multiple places in the power grid can disrupt power for days... a few improvised explosives in wellhouses, water treatment, and water tanks can dry the city up. Do this all at the same time, and you will have unstoppable rioting with a government largely incapable of doing jack shit about it. The humanitarian crisis will force the UN to intervene.","filename":"everything-burns","ext":".jpg","w":589,"h":448,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1492650057015,"time":1492650057,"md5":"RRVDF023VOct5l4\/AVgYvw==","fsize":202362,"resto":121910997,"id":"E9bDkl+\/","country":"NA","country_name":"Namibia"},{"no":121927204,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)21:01:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121911534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121911534<\/a><br>If anything, here in Peru we need a stronger goverment.<br>By our constitution our goverment can&#039;t renegotiate concession contracts by any means","time":1492650104,"resto":121910997,"id":"RPp+JP2e","country":"PE","country_name":"Peru"},{"no":121927269,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)21:02:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121927102\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121927102<\/a><br>You can&#039;t do that<br><br><a href=\"#p121926868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121926868<\/a><br>\/pol\/zuela???<br>IDFK","time":1492650133,"resto":121910997,"id":"bcjGQ52c","country":"VE","country_name":"Venezuela"},{"no":121927357,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)21:02:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121926057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121926057<\/a><br>I want to rip his face flesh","time":1492650172,"resto":121910997,"id":"V\/lqulzV","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":121927412,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)21:03:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"I live in a poor area.

Her management was inept, her messaging misguided, and her character terribly flawed. Let\u2019s put this into proper perspective: she lost to Donald Trump, for fuck\u2019s sake! A colossal joke of a candidate who by all accounts should\u2019ve lost to a chair. As the saying goes, the election was Clinton\u2019s to lose... and she lost it. So why on Earth would I want her to run again in 2020?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The answer is rather simple: I remain committed to the belief that Clinton would be an incredible president. And I believe she not only will run again, as her recent and outspoken re-launch onto the public stage indicates, but that she will also win. No, I\u2019m not crazy. I just believe that history repeats itself. And for that we simply need to look to Richard Nixon.<\/span>","filename":"7b3","ext":".jpg","w":1120,"h":714,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":79,"tim":1493535576149,"time":1493535576,"md5":"bjL64HF3A\/vXe02LRUwuHA==","fsize":74573,"resto":123448463,"id":"dZPkAe0L","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123449321,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:00:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123448914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123448914<\/a><br>keep being delusional. unlike you i work in politics in the district. ill cap your post for delusion.

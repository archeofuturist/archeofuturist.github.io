From data stretching back millions of years we know this warming period is very unusual, so it&#039;s reasonable to assume industrialization is the X factor. From there it&#039;s hard to pinpoint the details because you have carbon sinks like growing forests and the ocean. You also have many sources of &#039;greenhouse gasses&#039;. I may be wrong but I&#039;m pretty sure rotting wood contributes more CO2 than fossil fuel burning. You also have methane from livestock, that while it doesn&#039;t stay in the atmosphere as long, has a much more powerful greenhouse effect. I personally don&#039;t think there is much to be done on or end. Reforestation would help since trees require a massive amount of carbon.

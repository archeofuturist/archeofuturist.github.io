I was for Trump and all, and I think he won fair and square in this election. If we had done the popular vote, it would have been a different ball game and Hillary may or may not have won.<br>Regardless, if more people in the country as a whole voted for a candidate, shouldn&#039;t that candidate win? This gives more people an incentive to go out and vote so we can see what the country as a whole would like to see what the next president should be.

I&#039;ve heard of the Proud Boys and FOAK, but that&#039;s about it and haven&#039;t been able to find much information about joining or creating a chapter at the local level. Are there any other groups worthy of looking into? General information about riot survival and tactics too.","filename":"MlkkWxdYoDUKgps-800x450-noPad","ext":".jpg","w":679,"h":382,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493694353053,"time":1493694353,"md5":"trVjdMaM0QUmVZVfE5JQgg==","fsize":72978,"resto":0,"id":"a6iC7+yE","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"groups-opposing-the-far-left","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Memes aside, almost everyone on this board wants just that, but we almost unanimously detest globalism. Why?<br><br>We recognise that globalism is very similar, in practice, to internationalism: it involves the sovereignty of nation states being compromised and handed over to supranational entities (this is disguised by the globalists themselves using buzzwords like &#039;global governance&#039;: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Globa<wbr>lism) at the expense of those not fortunate enough to count themselves amongst the elite class.<br><br>We all instinctively reject this, and recognise that globalism serves the interests of this economic and social elite (Soros, central banks, large corporations who benefit from cheap labour). The tragic irony is that, like internationalism, which purported to want to unite the working poor across all nations against their oppressors, globalism in practice actually makes life miserable for those at the bottom (or simply not at the very top) of the pecking order in the developed world.","time":1493461281,"resto":123317483,"id":"VVPB49F4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123320064,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)06:21:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Jews are communist now?","time":1493461312,"resto":123317483,"id":"7iSMCBUa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123320190,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)06:24:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123317483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123317483<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;moving the goalpost<\/span><br>If you don&#039;t understand what we don&#039;t want you need to hit the books.

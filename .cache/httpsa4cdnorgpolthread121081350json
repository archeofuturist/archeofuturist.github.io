The complete ineptitude of the bad guys, including Kylo Ren. There was no real tension in the first movie because the First Order was so outmatched by the good guys. They pretty much slaughtered all their soldiers with no effort or, in some cases, no training. And Kylo got his ass beat by two people with zero experience with light sabers or the force.<br><br>2. They need to give a better explanation of the main character\u2019s incredible abilities. Let\u2019s ignore how she is an expert pilot despite never having flown before (at least Luke used to bullseye womprats with his T-16), how she was one-shotting Stormtrooper left and right despite never holding a blaster before, and how she knows the Millenium Falcoln better than Han damn Solo. The real issue is with the force. Im previous films, the force was this mysterious thing that you had to learn about and respect. You had to train really hard to do even the most basic things. Luke spent all of Episode IV leading up to making a shot with his proton torpedoes. It wasn&#039;t until after training with Yoda, the greatest master, that he learned to do things like the Jedi mind trick. But Rey didn&#039;t even really know what the force was, yet unlocked her powers like a superheroe does. It was like the X gene or something. With ZERO instruction or knowledge of the force, she became able to do things that took Luke three movies and years of training to learn. This is not consistent with Star Wars, and also destroys what made the force so cool.<br>Here is my possible solution to both problems.<br><br>In the next film, Luke begins training Rey. She becomes impatient, because she&#039;s a prodigy and feels like he&#039;s moving to slow. He fears losing another pupil to the dark side by going too fast. Meanwhile, Snoke realizes how much more powerful Rey is than Kylo, and uses Kylo to put her friends in danger.","time":1492190726,"resto":121081350,"id":"WY0yMXnT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121086315,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:25:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121081855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121081855<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;more black kids than white kids<\/span><br>You obviously haven&#039;t been here very long and know nothing about American demographics.

Luke is put in the position of Yoda and Ben from Episode V (since The Force Awakens was a ripoff of episode IV, this would make sense), warning her that her attachment to her friends and her impatience can be used to turn her to the dark side. People look for shortcuts to do good things, but the shortcuts corrupt them. She ignores him and goes to save her friends. She succeeds, but ends up being captured herself by Snoke and seduced by the dark side as he promised to teach her her true power. She agrees to do it if he lets her friends go, thinking she will just use her unparalled powers to eventually overthrow Snoke.<br><br>Meanwhile, Snoke orders her to kill Kylo and take his place. She still hates him and thus actually tries to kill him (evidence that she is actually being corrupted by the dark side though she thinks it&#039;s justifiable revenge). Kylo of course loses but he survives and runs.<br><br>The movie ends with Rey starting her training with Snoke and Kylo showing up before Luke. He realizes he has been a pawn and that he killed Han for nothing and tells Luke that he should kill him. Instead, Luke realizes that Kylo now understands the dangers of the dark side more than any teaching could have done. Now he is finally ready to train properly. Luke begins to train him.<br><br>So the set up for the final film is this. Rey is corrupted by the dark side even though she doesn&#039;t know it. She believes she is fooling Snoke who thinks she&#039;s a pawn like Kylo. Kylo is now looking for redemption, and agrees to help the other characters try to defeat Snoke and prevent Rey from becoming a sith. So now, the good guys are the underdogs again, and it&#039;s a nice twist.","time":1492190753,"resto":121081350,"id":"WY0yMXnT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121086373,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:26:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Even for a teaser that was underwhelming.","time":1492190766,"resto":121081350,"id":"lj7Pfbw5","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121086592,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:27:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121086302\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121086302<\/a><br>Better twist: Luke says, &quot;No, fuck you.

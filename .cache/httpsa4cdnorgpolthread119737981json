It&#039;s a fucking yogurt advertising campaign. It&#039;s the Americanization of the french politics. Just like in the USA, you take an mostly unknown guy with little experience, so that you can stick on it anything PR team thinks people want to hear to get your party to win. Like G W Bush or Obama, for example. That&#039;s why your politicians say one thing, than the complete opposite 2 months later, and than backtrack again if there&#039;s a backlash.<br><br>You don&#039;t notice it, because you&#039;re swimming in it. But the french have another political history. Our presidents usually have a long career behind them, like prime minister (head of government) and ministers before that. They have a past and a political journey. <br><br>That guy was only minister of economy for like 2 years ( and a shitty one at that). He&#039;s a giant white billboard were its PR team can just stick any ads that might be useful to grab voters.","time":1491482694,"resto":119737981,"id":"vou7Z+0H","country":"PF","country_name":"French Polynesia"},{"no":119739122,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:48:33","com":"<a href=\"#p119738842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119738842<\/a><br>I guess this is what happens when you put advertising executives in charge of politics, right?<br><br>Silly advertising executives, you don&#039;t belong in politics....<br><br>Stop trying to create a fucking BRAND around a politician with no position or personality to speak of.","time":1491482913,"resto":119737981,"id":"exZROmWD","country":"US","trip":"!niqjediPCA","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119739185,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:49:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119738842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119738842<\/a><br>If drumpf has proven anything it&#039;s that it absolutely works","time":1491482957,"resto":119737981,"id":"ouJOEPx6","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119739552,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:53:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119738196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119738196<\/a><br><br>He&#039;s from the socialist party member wearing a mask.

It&#039;s painful to watch.

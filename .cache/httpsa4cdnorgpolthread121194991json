It varies greatly on what kind you go for. The average person does it for exercise, to meet new people or to brush up on their self confidence. The kind of scenario where you might consider using it is the kind of scenario that would be best handled with street smarts and knowing when a situation is getting ugly, and just avoid it in the first place. It doesn&#039;t make you some sort of warrior when you become a black belt. Getting into a real fight will usually involve either you or them throwing the first punch. Mastering a difficult kata doesn&#039;t mean shit in a real fight, and getting hit by a real fist with no pads will make the normal sane person, even a black belt, freak out. It is scary and it fucking hurts. For whatever reason, I&#039;ve been in quite a few fights in my time. 70% of it comes down to situational awareness, level of sobriety and luck. Having good strength and muscle memory, knowing how to throw a punch, technique is good. But a lot of the time you will end up on the ground trying not to get your head smashed into the bitumen. If you have good training and experience, that can quite often work against you in a court if the other side invests in good legal representation. Every time you get into a street fight you are rolling the dice, and once the law gets involved you have no say in what happens. Martial arts are great, but don&#039;t rely on using them, avoid situations with cunts.","time":1492252999,"resto":121194991,"id":"m3qDK2OO","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121197711,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)06:43:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121197429\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121197429<\/a><br>Or you can be an asshole about it and bring a knife to a fistfight","time":1492253000,"resto":121194991,"id":"5zv0RWwE","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121197731,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)06:43:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121197518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121197518<\/a><br>Kickboxing is uncomplicated and you train like an athlete, rather than LARPing as an ancient Japanese person in pyjamas.

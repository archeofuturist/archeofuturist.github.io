Germany even offered peace - they had taken grave casualties but France&#039;s demographics were fucked so they weren&#039;t going to be a threat in the future anyway (as WW2 showed us btw), in the east Germany had acquired enough of a buffer to feel safe from Russia (mostly Poland). I think they even offered to give Belgium and most of France back. So anyway Britain didn&#039;t want to lose (and pay for her own war debts, much better to beat Germany and make them pay for it) so they tried to get the USA into the war.<br><br>The US Anglo Elites wanted to jump in earlier but the population didn&#039;t want to, however the Jews were already influential in America back then so the British offered the Zionist community Palestine if they lobbied for the USA to jump in. This explains why the USA sent in over a million ground troops and lost about 100k or more of them over a few sunk ships.","time":1493119971,"resto":122721401,"id":"nBn3GZel","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122724830,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:38:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122724419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122724419<\/a><br>Danke.

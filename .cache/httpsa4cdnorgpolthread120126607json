This was an incredible anti-tank gun. It was small and light so it got attached to horses and cavalry was able to move around with the guns quickly and in basically any terrain. On top of that the gun could penetrate the armor up to 40mm up to 100 meters. Heaviest german tank at the time had 30mm. Most had 10mm.<br><br>The myth originated in german propaganda that wanted to emphasize the superiority of german military over polish one. <br><br>It is possible that the Battle of Krojanty was the battle that the myth came from. 250 polish cavalrymen charged 800 german infantry and was in the process of routing them. At one point german tanks started attacking them with machine guns so the cavalry force dispersed. When Italian and German war correspondents arrived they saw german tanks there with corpses of cavalrymena and their horses. So they though that poles charged the tanks, with lances and swords and shit. <br><br>Later Goebels used the myth in Kampfgeschwader L\u00fctzow movie where Slovaks played the part of Polish cavalry.","time":1491655884,"resto":120126607,"id":"qHgU1MgD","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120128508,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)08:58:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120126607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120126607<\/a><br>Fake news.

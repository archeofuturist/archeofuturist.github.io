Need your help. <br><br>I made a thread on there about a 10 days ago that gave an error &quot;failed post&quot; or something to that effect. It happened twice, then I checked the catalog just in case and I seen it had created 2 threads. One had a few replies in it, so in the other one I posted &quot;please delete, duplicate thread due to forum error&quot; and a few hours later I got slapped with a 1-week ban for &quot;spamming the board&quot;.<br><br>I successfully replied a few times the past few days after the ban ended, and just now I get this message with the same &#039;reason&#039; and with a permanent ban attached to the original ban. It was added a few days after and I got re-banned for the same thing.<br><br>One of your mods are compromised. See the catalog thread there: &quot;We are losing 400-500 unique IDs&quot;. <br><br>There is a rat. If anyone from your chan sees this, link them this topic in that thread, please. <br><br>Also, pls bump for our other brothers.","filename":"Corruption","ext":".png","w":875,"h":822,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":234,"tim":1493772211281,"time":1493772211,"md5":"KGtQLDUh6AOr\/3mpGZjzLA==","fsize":46324,"resto":0,"id":"ha86rh6P","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"8-pol-is-compromised-alet-alet","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":123846373,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)20:45:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"8 was compromised a while ago.<br><br>We are facing a shill storm here too.

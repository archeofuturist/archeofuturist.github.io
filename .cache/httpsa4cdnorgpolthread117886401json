Intel is pretty good about letting employees move around within the company. An opening came up on the Management Engine team, and since I have experience with micro-controllers I figured I&#039;d give it a shot. The interview went great and they wanted me on board, but the final step was to get a security clearance.<br><br>I asked them WTF I need a security clearance for, and they said they couldn&#039;t tell me until I was on the team. Thus began a 3 year trip down the fucking rabbit hole.<br><br>I&#039;m coming forward today because of the news that Trump was spied on. I know exactly how it was done because I spent the last three years adding backdoors into the ME. For those of you that are unaware, the ME is on a separate CPU and cannot be disabled, and it exists at a level below the operating system. Intel has been working with the intelligence community for years to get backdoors into physical hardware so they don&#039;t have to worry about finding OS exploits. If the hardware itself is compromised then the whole machine is compromised.","filename":"E1jOQL2t","ext":".png","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490242982819,"time":1490242982,"md5":"utzfZvZGzJr9q50mMrdcWQ==","fsize":32796,"resto":0,"id":"Bk\/FHvIo","country":"US","bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"intel-me","trip":"!!6U610hrljE5","country_name":"United States","replies":320,"images":53,"unique_ips":151,"tail_size":50},{"no":117886474,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:23:42","name":"dumpintel","com":"<a href=\"#p117886401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117886401<\/a><br>The ME has full access to memory without the parent CPU having any knowledge, it has full access to the TCP\/IP stack, and full access to every peripheral connected to the computer.

The Intel Core uArch was developed initially for mobile, primarily based on the work from design teams in Haifa. This gave said teams a large amount of pull internally (in the company), and if I&#039;m not mistaken, uArch development swings on its own internal cadence between Haifa and Hillsboro (Portland, OR). On the other hand, microfabrication improvements are pioneered and brought from pathfinding to ramp to high volume primarily in Hillsboro.<br><br>Other aspects of processor and system design are done elsewhere.

Way too high up the protocol stack, these exploits are going on at the hardware level and stolen data can easily be held, wrapped in legitimate traffic and sent at a later date. You could be staring at the raw packet data and still not recognize the exploit. The only real way is comparison testing with known good hardware so it&#039;s a catch 22. Even then should you detect a difference it takes much work to figure out what is compromised and what is good. You can try and dump the raw code out of a piece of hardware but there may be mechanisms in place to foil that method. Also, all ROM&#039;s are EEPROMS and have been for years, the code is dynamic and there could be mechanisms in place to detect a pentest, malware scan - whatever and have the exploit disappear - self delete - and simply be reloaded remotely at a later date.","time":1490248597,"resto":117886401,"id":"RFUqzepM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117896125,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)01:57:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117889131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117889131<\/a><br>why is that fake news?","time":1490248633,"resto":117886401,"id":"AGGyRqvx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117896236,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)01:58:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117893325\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117893325<\/a><br>a) Does DAL still allow test\/dev certs in production?<br>b) Does the flash on the ARC still support the fixed table huffman encoding?","time":1490248692,"resto":117886401,"id":"Ch8zLS46","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117896446,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)02:00:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"are you the guy with the sideburns and ponytail that walks around all disgruntled","time":1490248830,"resto":117886401,"id":"QqzTu1YF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117896458,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)02:00:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117895405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117895405<\/a><br>the ME is a microcontroller in the peripheral controller hub. it has control over most major functions of peripherals and DMA access to system memory via HECI.","time":1490248838,"resto":117886401,"id":"Ch8zLS46","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117896855,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)02:04:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117886474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117886474<\/a><br>Thank heavens for old Thinkpads!","time":1490249077,"resto":117886401,"id":"3oOgZhoh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117896915,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)02:05:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117887999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117887999<\/a><br>checked, look up me cleaner<br><br>it&#039;s possible on some hardware<br><br>also look up coreboot \/ libreboot","time":1490249115,"resto":117886401,"id":"3oOgZhoh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117896974,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)02:05:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117886401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117886401<\/a><br>I work at intel.

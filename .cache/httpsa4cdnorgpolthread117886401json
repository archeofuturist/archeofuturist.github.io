Intel is pretty good about letting employees move around within the company. An opening came up on the Management Engine team, and since I have experience with micro-controllers I figured I&#039;d give it a shot. The interview went great and they wanted me on board, but the final step was to get a security clearance.<br><br>I asked them WTF I need a security clearance for, and they said they couldn&#039;t tell me until I was on the team. Thus began a 3 year trip down the fucking rabbit hole.<br><br>I&#039;m coming forward today because of the news that Trump was spied on. I know exactly how it was done because I spent the last three years adding backdoors into the ME. For those of you that are unaware, the ME is on a separate CPU and cannot be disabled, and it exists at a level below the operating system. Intel has been working with the intelligence community for years to get backdoors into physical hardware so they don&#039;t have to worry about finding OS exploits. If the hardware itself is compromised then the whole machine is compromised.","filename":"E1jOQL2t","ext":".png","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490242982819,"time":1490242982,"md5":"utzfZvZGzJr9q50mMrdcWQ==","fsize":32796,"resto":0,"id":"Bk\/FHvIo","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"intel-me","trip":"!!6U610hrljE5","country_name":"United States","replies":114,"images":25,"unique_ips":80,"tail_size":50},{"no":117886474,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:23:42","name":"dumpintel","com":"<a href=\"#p117886401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117886401<\/a><br>The ME has full access to memory without the parent CPU having any knowledge, it has full access to the TCP\/IP stack, and full access to every peripheral connected to the computer.

The Intel Core uArch was developed initially for mobile, primarily based on the work from design teams in Haifa. This gave said teams a large amount of pull internally (in the company), and if I&#039;m not mistaken, uArch development swings on its own internal cadence between Haifa and Hillsboro (Portland, OR). On the other hand, microfabrication improvements are pioneered and brought from pathfinding to ramp to high volume primarily in Hillsboro.<br><br>Other aspects of processor and system design are done elsewhere. Folsom houses large teams for iGFX and NAND solutions, for example, while Santa Clara houses some forward-looking research labs (integrated photonics, etc.).

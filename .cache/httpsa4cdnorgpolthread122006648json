Then he went on Fox News and unwittingly revealed he didn\u2019t remember that Kim Jong-Il gave way to Kim Jong-Un in North Korea six years ago. Then he began repeatedly referring to his close ally Paul Ryan as \u201cRon\u201d during a Tuesday rally in Ryan\u2019s home state. And this came after Trump bombed Syria and then immediately announced that he had bombed Iraq instead.","filename":"1492180863895","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":831,"tn_w":225,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492703159775,"time":1492703159,"md5":"e\/oOhT0FG1\/9qvOWztnlfA==","fsize":130203,"resto":0,"id":"G\/a8M9e8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-dementia-watch","country_name":"United States","replies":29,"images":7,"unique_ips":25},{"no":122006913,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)11:48:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"He&#039;s 70 years old.

It sends a message without actually putting any American forces in danger. Looks like Trump is adopting a similar strategy to the one used by Bill Clinton during most of his presidency.

He has said that America shouldn&#039;t get involved. It wasn&#039;t American&#039;s problem (it&#039;s not). What&#039;s wrong with people like you? Do you like being lied to? Why do you so blindly follow this guy? I am honestly curious. He hasn&#039;t done anything he said he would. If he was a top 4D chess player like his supporters claim, wouldn&#039;t he have foreseen all of the problems that he was going to have with his travel ban among other things?","time":1491577140,"resto":119958220,"id":"2WsYKihA","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"}]}

As he grew older, his original Anglo-Saxon racial worldview softened into a classism or elitism which regarded the superior race to include all those self-ennobled through high culture. From the start, Lovecraft did not hold all white people in uniform high regard, but rather esteemed the English people and those of English descent.[a] He praised non-WASP groups such as Hispanics and Jews; however his private writings on groups such as Irish Catholics, German immigrants and African-Americans were consistently negative.[57][58] In an early doggerel poem, the 1912 On the Creation of Niggers, Lovecraft describes Africans not as human but &quot;beasts..in semi-human figure...filled with vice...&quot;. While his racist perspective is undeniable, many critics argue this is irrelevant to the compelling mythos of his philosophical worlds.[30][56] In his early published essays, private letters and personal utterances, he argued for a strong color line to preserve race and culture.[b]<\/span><br>from wikipedia","time":1492814376,"resto":122194751,"id":"wPYElCbD","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122197900,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:50:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122196705\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122196705<\/a><br>any note worthy quotes?","time":1492815044,"resto":122194751,"id":"nmcodHY4","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":122198119,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:52:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122195359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122195359<\/a><br>I fucking died, hahhahahaa","time":1492815162,"resto":122194751,"id":"ZKXsR21k","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122198217,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:53:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122194751\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122194751<\/a><br><br>Here, OP.

He is bad for the economy, bad for workers and bad for America. We will NOT be funding his campaign next time, in fact we&#039;ll be pouring hundreds of millions into his opponents&#039; campaings.<br><br>If he isn&#039;t impeached before, that is. Right now we&#039;re leading a joint effort with the media and the CIA to gather incriminating evidence and we&#039;re about 90% done. My advice to you is: enjoy it while it lasts.","filename":"trump cuck","ext":".jpg","w":1172,"h":1182,"tn_w":247,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490545632364,"time":1490545632,"md5":"Fm5u5jxFDxW+t32J9XpcLw==","fsize":224725,"resto":0,"id":"DJFrV+WM","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ceo-of-a-fortune-500-company-here","country_name":"Germany","replies":6,"images":2,"unique_ips":7},{"no":118379213,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)12:28:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118379067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118379067<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bad for the economy<\/span><br>The stock market rose more in months of Trump than years of Obama","filename":"dow","ext":".png","w":847,"h":450,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":66,"tim":1490545708519,"time":1490545708,"md5":"S6mq2ZvYTwpPJV\/xdkCfbA==","fsize":39677,"resto":118379067,"id":"L\/fv5pEQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118379330,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)12:29:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118379067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118379067<\/a><br>What&#039;s the name of your company?","time":1490545767,"resto":118379067,"id":"APWQbvLn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118379703,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)12:32:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118379067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118379067<\/a><br>Sorry, Hans Shlomoberg, but you&#039;re going to be too busy dealing with the collapse of the EU after the UK leaves.","time":1490545954,"resto":118379067,"id":"cflTTVg\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118380316,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)12:37:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118379213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118379213<\/a><br>You really think the stock market is the only measure of a healthy economy?

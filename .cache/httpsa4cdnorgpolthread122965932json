No former military or military analysts here? Facts: If we (USA) attack NPRK Russia\/China will know in advance. Phase I Operations (Major Combat) will be done in less than three weeks-- there will be no elements of NPRK bigger than a company left by then. This will not be a big deal, easier than Iraq was. Hopefully this time we don&#039;t try to rebuild and be buddies, just cut the head off the snake, crush their military, then GTFO.","time":1493257400,"resto":122965932,"id":"qyzZyF7S","country":"US","trip":"!Ef66Rm46zM","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122975209,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)21:44:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122965932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122965932<\/a><br>Holy fuck all I hear are jets...gonna die.","time":1493257480,"resto":122965932,"id":"WLccbL\/w","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122975240,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)21:44:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122974116\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122974116<\/a><br>Youre probably right, but if we were any more advanced than what we&#039;ve got right now why aren&#039;t we \/starwars\/ now?","time":1493257493,"resto":122965932,"id":"W4sQU3rB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122975276,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)21:45:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122974543\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122974543<\/a><br>You would be clinically insane to think otherwise.

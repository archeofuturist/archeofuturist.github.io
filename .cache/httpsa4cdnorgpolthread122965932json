The old lady who had pulled over on front of us thought it was a ufo and I couldn&#039;t blame her. It was flying so low and was so quiet. It passed right overhead , we fell in its shadow for a moment. When it turned, it became so hard to see, almost invisible. I&#039;m assuming this is because it is so thin. No wonder why so many people report ufo sightings.","time":1493255010,"resto":122965932,"id":"M0BILi\/6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122969843,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)21:04:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122965932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122965932<\/a><br><br>Standard practice at all times is to have several of them in the air to give a first strike\/strike back capability (enemy wont know where they are, they cant be taken out with the airfield and they&#039;ll be in a good position to hit back).

According to Michaelson, Frank&#039;s theology asserted that the attempt to liberate the sparks of holiness was the problem, not the solution. Rather, Frank claimed that the mixing between holy and unholy was virtuous.[6] Netanel Lederberg claims that Frank had a Gnostic philosophy wherein there was a &quot;true God&quot; whose existence was hidden by a &quot;false God&quot;. This &quot;true God&quot; could allegedly only be revealed through a total destruction of the social and religious structures created by the &quot;false God&quot;, thus leading to a thorough antinomianism. For Frank, the very distinction between good and evil is a product of a world governed by the &quot;false God&quot;. Lederberg compares Frank&#039;s position to that of Friedrich Nietzsche.[11]<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Frank claimed that &quot;all laws and teachings will fall&quot;[5] and following antinomianism asserted that one&#039;s most important personal obligation of every person was the transgression of every boundary.<\/span><br>They don&#039;t advocate a Satanic kingdom.

They seeks to undermine it, and poison it (Hollywood, feminism, miscegenation, etc). They want to import browns and blacks, to fracture Europe and the US, because they fear homogeniety. They know that Jews and their pawns can only be successful in a heterogeneous and semi-dysfunctional society, where they can still claim to be &quot;persecuted&quot; but seize power behind the scenes. It is only in a situation like this, where they can continue to swindle, deceive, and water down the dominant native groups. Jews dont build, they leach (you might think Israel is an exception - but it was built on, and continues to survive on Western aid), so they dont want to kill the host entirely, because if anarchy really happened, they would be fucked. They believe that they can import the Muzzies and Nigger, to slowly take over (decades or so), and replace the Europeans, due to their explosive birthrates (which I might add, only occurs because Western countries send food and goods to their shitholes, and they live on welfare when they come here). They just want to create a new groups to hide behind, and leach off. Of course this is somewhat risky, as the shitskins hate them even more than whites do, but ((they)) believe that they can be kept under control.<\/span>","filename":"The-Jewish-Conspiracy","ext":".png","w":795,"h":681,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":107,"tim":1493360037845,"time":1493360037,"md5":"GdFnmRcYU4REMlak83yO2Q==","fsize":73248,"resto":123152297,"id":"ScFU6r2M","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123157781,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)02:14:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123157404\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123157404<\/a><br>I was referring to the reviews of the show, which seem to be mostly split down the middle of the ideology of the publication, so it it&#039;s received more positive reviews.","time":1493360054,"resto":123152297,"id":"UWy\/NgqF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123157898,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)02:15:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123157744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123157744<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Greedy Schmucks (group 2): They are all about money.

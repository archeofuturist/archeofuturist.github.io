That scenario, in any sane person\u2019s reading of the situation, is not an option. If figures like Jeremy Corbyn are emerging to propose a far more humane and workable direction for society, and if such figures are garnering enormous support from part of the electorate that\u2019s been denied a voice for too long, then it may be that this is because people like Corbyn have become historically necessary.

Is it or is it now quite common to hear about a father killing burglars to defend his family on American news?

You haven&#039;t got any rational argument to make, even this &quot;white knight&quot; argument is laughable and I can&#039;t fully comprehend why I even bothered to answer you. In the US the vast majority of their gun crime occurs in cities with tights restrictions on guns, because this leaves people unable to defend themselves from the criminals who do have guns. In places where guns aren&#039;t restricted less and less gun crime happens. Do you not realise that you don&#039;t need to use a gun for it to be useful? The idea of a gun being around scares even criminals.","time":1492806822,"resto":122173036,"id":"MLV3fIue","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122181331,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)16:33:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122180991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122180991<\/a><br>Nooooooooooooo","filename":"1487977491206","ext":".png","w":594,"h":517,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1492806836019,"time":1492806836,"md5":"zTgO0EXbkpEJF8U0YSpOkQ==","fsize":552405,"resto":122173036,"id":"Hvz2tMx5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122181367,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)16:34:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122181091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122181091<\/a><br>C O M R A D E<br>O<br>R<br>B<br>Y<br>N","time":1492806858,"resto":122173036,"id":"Q5byTLt7","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":122181369,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)16:34:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"right ok<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;earn \u00a316,000 a year<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rent in Leeds on average costs \u00a3326 a month<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;12 x 326 is \u00a33912<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;average annual bill gas electrcity water broadband \u00a31100<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u00a3300 for motorcycle license + road tax<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;leaves \u00a34762 for food, gym membership, servicing<\/span><br><br>Holy fuck I am going to be penniless if I move out","time":1492806860,"resto":122173036,"id":"1cPfbF7a","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122181393,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)16:34:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122181125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122181125<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We killed plenty of savages<\/span><br>Wasn&#039;t murder","time":1492806870,"resto":122173036,"id":"3Z\/vzxLr","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122181457,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)16:35:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122181237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122181237<\/a><br>Is that the new series of Coast?","filename":"coast","ext":".jpg","w":466,"h":260,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":69,"tim":1492806901648,"time":1492806901,"md5":"pNI1SeWP8RdKRU7Y+crTvg==","fsize":25477,"resto":122173036,"id":"ay+G0gj8","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122181521,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)16:35:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122180991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122180991<\/a><br>She could unironically need her legs amputated for this.","filename":"1470176310943","ext":".png","w":495,"h":791,"tn_w":78,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492806931831,"time":1492806931,"md5":"5Ia+\/Ze5494mRl\/2cJtOQQ==","fsize":21080,"resto":122173036,"id":"zfSPWiZE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122181602,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)16:36:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122180810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122180810<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The cheese was named after the Somerset village called Cheddar.

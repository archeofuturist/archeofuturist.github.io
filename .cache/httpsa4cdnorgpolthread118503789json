Women can sometimes seem smarter than men because men are more naive in terms of deceit. Especially when it comes to beautiful women, men drop their guard and are thus easily manipulated. The fact is, women are innately more childish which basically means they are more petty and this pettiness can lead to malicious behavior than wouldn&#039;t even cross a man&#039;s mind. Men are the more autistic sex generally because men&#039;s more logic-prone mind won&#039;t see the point in pettiness and would rather do something more productive. Women can manipulate men because men are generally oblivious to petty concerns. This makes men both smarter and more foolish than women.","time":1490627312,"resto":118503789,"id":"gCCCocIO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118521099,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)11:09:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118504655\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118504655<\/a><br>I guess that explains all those great female scholars, philosophers, artists, inventors and scientists.

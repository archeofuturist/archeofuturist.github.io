And I&#039;m not an anti-Le Pen. <br><br>Anyway, why do I say that ? <br>Well, because she said it herself. <br>In a radio show, she said she wants to negociate a &quot;New Europe&quot;, and only then, she will propose a referundum, and will choose whatever she support the leave, or the remain. <br><br>There is a LOT of chances that we end up with an female and french version of Cameron. <br><br>Another problem is that French people don&#039;t want to leave, for the biggest part.<br>Not that they love the EU, but they are afraid of what could happen if we leave. <br>Therefore, I don&#039;t believe the Leave will in the referundum. <br><br>The worst part is that if Marine Le Pen is elected and that she fails at renegociate the EU(which she will), and the Remain won at the referundum, Marine le Pen could NOT do any important part of her program. <br><br>I believe the same would happen with Melenchon or Dupont-Aignant.","filename":"FN-Marine-_FN-Marine-LePen-m","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":405,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492913680086,"time":1492913680,"md5":"jhCy4mTKH2cL1ntxzLcu9g==","fsize":36428,"resto":0,"country":"FR","archived":1,"bumplimit":0,"archived_on":1492914823,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-french-and-i-can-tell-you-marine-le-pen-doesnt","country_name":"France","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":122364408,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:18:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122364026\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122364026<\/a>","filename":"OFFICIEL T_1491334502-pol1","ext":".png","w":136,"h":102,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492913882037,"time":1492913882,"md5":"KKWJGqTmz8Y1iqJ0XeGyMQ==","fsize":21872,"resto":122364026,"country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]}

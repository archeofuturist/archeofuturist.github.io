Because the latter is strongly intertwined with channelling action (going to the gym is similar, in this sense).<br>So yeah, I am very tolerant of religion because it is one of the chief examples that our minds work in biased ways... so that we ought to accept a certain degree of delusion whenever we try to bring ourselves to act in a certain way -- otherwise we might come to believe true statements, but be unable to act upon them just because we miss the great narrative that usually prompts us to act.<br><br>[cont.]","time":1492379554,"resto":121411898,"id":"2Zbqe0F5","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":121422134,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:53:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hillary Clinton is further to the right than Donald Trump, and more authoritarian than Thomas Hobbes<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump is where &quot;literally hitler&quot; would be<\/span><br>I mean, where else would he go?","filename":"questioning","ext":".jpg","w":192,"h":214,"tn_w":112,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492379629066,"time":1492379629,"md5":"qWOP5L86dogo81CG+4QvYg==","fsize":29010,"resto":121411898,"id":"vNhJi3WO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121422689,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)17:57:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"The problem with this thing is the authoritan\/libertarian thing.

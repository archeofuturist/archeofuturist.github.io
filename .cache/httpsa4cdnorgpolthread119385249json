If you add up all the active military personnel in the EU you&#039;ll see that the number is higher than the US. If you add up all the tanks in the EU you&#039;ll also find the same thing.<br><br>The main thing the US military seems to be much better at is:<br>- transport (ships, planes, helicopters for soldiers), <br>- nukes (only France and UK have nukes in the EU)<br>- strike aircraft.<br><br>The only category you would want EU countries to spend more without upsetting the world is planes. If the EU started building nukes it would basically undo all nuclear proliferation.<br><br>You have to also remember that several EU countries have extensive reserves due to conscription.

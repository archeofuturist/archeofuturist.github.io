Your marital relationship is dead, or so tepid or abusive you might as well file for divorce. Every single friend you have has reached a polar result in their relationships; either glowing, mutually constructive companionship, or repulsive bitterness and resentment that&#039;s awkward to be around. You don&#039;t know anyone who is young, cute, or beautiful who you socialize with, because everyone in your life is tired, their bodies fattening and increasingly subject to hormonal disruptions, their self-held images of former attractiveness fading into the void. It won&#039;t be long before exactly one of your friends&#039; kids dies from myriad possible causes, probably. And the neuroticism you feel from your own heretofore marginally successful parenting efforts will only grow as you realize that you have nothing but your own daughter&#039;s token, mandatorily handed-out accomplishments, and Bill and Alice&#039;s model relationship to provide yourself with any sense that life has meaning and is worth soldiering on through even though the foreseeable future consists of just paying down the mortgage, and keeping face at PTA functions despite that your wife of 13 years, Amy, yesterday admitted that Michael the competent father and successful lawyer has been casually stuffing full the one place you felt might be a safe repository for your stunted emotions.<br><br>And a few years later, your beautiful daughter has graduated from Smalltown Liberal Arts College with a degree in Womens&#039; Studies, finally given the intellectual tools necessary for telling you why &quot;it&#039;s&quot; all your fault, and why as a man you deserve the hardships beset upon you.<br><br>That&#039;s what happens when you transition into old-person life with children.","time":1492158693,"resto":121033684,"id":"U2pvEDpt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121037482,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)04:32:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121037394\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121037394<\/a><br><br>The world isn&#039;t overpopulated you stupid sheep.<br><br>There&#039;s too many darkies and not enough whities.

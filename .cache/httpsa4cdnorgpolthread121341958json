While very few people in modern Western democracies would call themselves fascists (and most of the people who are pejoratively called fascists are actually not), it would appear that you are nevertheless a true fascist. Now, whether you actually call yourself that or not we are unable to say, but the fact is that your political opinions are verifiably closer to the doctrines of fascism than they are to those of communism, socialism, conservatism, or liberalism. Among your answers, there is an unmistakable predilection for authoritative and state-centric political initiatives of which variants (or even carbon copies) may be found in the political manifestos of actual fascists. Even adjusting for happenstance and the common ground between fascism and these other political doctrines, the fact remains that you really are quite the fascist.

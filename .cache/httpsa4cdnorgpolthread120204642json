I left her in a parking lot behind some donut shop. I killed Ivanka, my old wife, with a nail gun, and some man uh some old faggot with a dog last week. I killed another girl with a chainsaw, I had to, she almost got away and uh someone else there I can&#039;t remember maybe a model, but she&#039;s dead too. And Steve Bannon. I killed Steve Bannon with an axe in the face, his body is dissolving in a bathtub in Hell&#039;s Kitchen. I don&#039;t want to leave anything out here. I guess I&#039;ve killed maybe 20 people, maybe 40. I have tapes of a lot of it, uh some of the girls have seen the tapes. I even, um... I ate some of their brains, and I tried to cook a little. Tonight I, uh, I just had to kill a LOT of people. And I&#039;m not sure I&#039;m gonna get away with it this time.

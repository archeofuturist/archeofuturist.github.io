Some animals do this like seahorses or insects for example, they try to have as many offspring as possible and just hope that a few of them survive while the rest die off because their parents are too stupid to properly care for them. This is why you see starving nigger children in Africa in those Jewish donations commercials.","time":1491792007,"resto":120378939,"id":"gFJVytiK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120379780,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)22:43:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120379412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120379412<\/a><br>Africans are dying out too though.

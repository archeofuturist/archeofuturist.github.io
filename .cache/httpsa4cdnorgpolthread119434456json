Great Man History in terms of warfare and land grabbing is dead. All territory has been accounted for, and too many interests from too many parties will prevent intervention. &quot;What about China in Africa?&quot; Yeah, their plan didn&#039;t work out too well for them, and as you can plainly see - they were attempting to do a land grab by way of manipulating the local economies of these areas. Not by actually putting boots on the ground. <br><br>#2. With the Ooga Booga countries out the way now, we can look at the 1st and 2nd world ones. Most civilized countries that actually matter (in that they control vast swathes of the world&#039;s land mass, or hold some sort of important place by way of financial power or resources) have nuclear weapons or a patron who has nuclear weapons. You can never truly defeat a country who is in possession of nukes. You can beat them, but you can&#039;t win. So trying to take and hold China, or Russia, or the US, or Australia, or where ever can literally never happen.<br><br>#3. Multi-national interests. Companies in China have money invested in America. Companies in America have money invest in China. Companies in Australia have money invested in... And since money is so tied up in politics, you are never going to go to war. Therefore all combat is limited to proxy wars and border skirmishes in irrelevant shitholes. <br><br>#4. Financial burden. People go to war. People die. You can no longer swindle people into doing this for free under the pretense of nationalism. They want to be paid, compensated, and taken care of (or their families if they are killed). This puts immense strain on the economy. Look at how much Iraq cost the US, and that was just an intermediate sized combat operation. Not a Total War scenario. <br><br>Okay?

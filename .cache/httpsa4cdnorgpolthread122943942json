He&#039;s great and all (jewish memes aside), he believes government should be very, very small, he&#039;s pro-life, he thinks transexuals are mentally ill people, he&#039;s against female genital mutilation by some radical muslims etc, but why no one ever asks him whether he supports circumcision or not, considering he&#039;s a practicing jew, in his public talks at universities?<br><br>If he does support it, it would be the only logical flaw in his speeches. It would be hypocritical to be in favor of circumcision and against female genital mutilation motivated by religious belief. Circumcision is not as bad as female genital mutilation, but it&#039;s also mutilation in a way, right?<br><br>Thoughts?","filename":"shapiro","ext":".jpg","w":852,"h":950,"tn_w":224,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493242926456,"time":1493242926,"md5":"wL1nWZwWWLB2oitN6jCx4A==","fsize":201265,"resto":0,"id":"mTYe778U","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-not-american-and-i-just-got-introduced-to-ben","country_name":"Brazil","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

I can&#039;t say I&#039;m the only Indian man who finds it hard to take pride in his own country after having years of constant and needless attacks defaming my heritage from insecure losers here. Why not bully Swedes or Germans? Do they not have much more to be ashamed of than our peaceful country? Potato niggers get bullied less than us and yet we are the purest whites in all of Asia.<br><br>Like when its not just banter, when a meme is repeated over and over again, repeated systematically, it eventually becomes a truth irregardless of the intentions in repeating it.

Would you say to a kind, peaceful and hard working salt of the earth Indian man that they are a &quot;poo&quot;? Would you say those words to your fellow white brother? Are you starting to feel ashamed now?

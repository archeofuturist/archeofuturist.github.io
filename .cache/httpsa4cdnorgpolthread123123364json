I can take the topics from pretty much any angle. If anyone has any other topics they want said, speak now or forever rest in peace.<br>Intro:<br>The Swedish immigration crisis has been in effect for several years, yet its severity has increased drastically in recent years. This has a profoundly negative effect on the native inhabitants, the immigrants themselves, and the countries surrounding Sweden. In certain cases, laws passed in other countries have had an effect on Sweden\u2019s ongoing immigration crisis. This irresponsible immigration policy has been propagated and defended by Sweden\u2019s mainstream media, their lawmakers, and their own police. These groups push these policies for various reasons, but in effect harm Sweden as a whole.

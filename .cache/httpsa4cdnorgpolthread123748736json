Do you really think men in the 1920s who worked backbreaking hours building skyscrapers or mining coal felt any better about their work? They didn&#039;t &quot;find meaning&quot; in their jobs, they created their own meaning at home by being part of a family that loved them (the breakdown of this is another discussion but it&#039;s true). <br><br>This is why I honestly believe there will be a massive amount of suicide among white women in the next 10-20 years. They fell for the feminism meme hard and are throwing themselves headlong into massive amounts of debt to find some ever elusive sense of meaning that will never materialize.","time":1493733227,"resto":123748736,"id":"dwmKhVlT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123769067,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)09:54:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123767300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123767300<\/a><br>What is taking you guys so long with the F-35?

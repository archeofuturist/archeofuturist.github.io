Seriously each episode following the boy wizard and his pals from Hogwarts Academy as they fight assorted villains has been indistinguishable from the others.

He wrote something to the effect of, &quot;If these kids are reading Harry Potter at 11 or 12, then when they get older they will go on to read Stephen King.&quot; And he was quite right. He was not being ironic.

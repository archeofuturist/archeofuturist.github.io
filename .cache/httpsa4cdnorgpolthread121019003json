Haven&#039;t really liked the answers I have seen for this question so I have been spending some time thinking. The question alone gives acknowledgement to the issue of Cause and Effect. An issue that breaks the Big Bang model. This led me to a fun answer. I could spend hours talking about its implications. God by nature of being outside of the confinements of space and time is also no longer confined by its laws... Including Cause and Effect.","filename":"Who-is-God","ext":".jpg","w":3867,"h":2578,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492144766215,"time":1492144766,"md5":"ZaURNhTFTnhB1PqFjlABlQ==","fsize":2506025,"resto":0,"id":"vott4Tnm","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"who-created-god","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":0,"unique_ips":9},{"no":121019139,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)00:40:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121019003\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121019003<\/a><br> christfags and most religions will just say God was always just there.....doesn&#039;t make sense to me, but to each their own.","time":1492144834,"resto":121019003,"id":"EqviFLpx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121019250,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)00:41:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121019003\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121019003<\/a><br>God created god.

God ahs always existed because our world is based on some sort of existence, nothing does not exist. It appears only as a superposition of two opposite states. God can be thought of as growth, and in order to know good and evil in a non linear world, suffering is required. In addition, God can be though of as communication, which requires logic (in the begining God was with logic and God was logic, simple systems are not interesting, but extending to higher order logics leaves inconsistencies).

You hear about sex from your friends, see it on tv, hear associate talk about it, hear it on the radio, and see it on the internet. Seeing it all of those times causes the concept to repeatedly be ingrained into your mind, whether you want to have sex or not, it becomes the norm to you. And once you hear people constantly say that those who aren&#039;t participating in it are inferior or pathetic, you begin to feel that way after hearing it enough times.

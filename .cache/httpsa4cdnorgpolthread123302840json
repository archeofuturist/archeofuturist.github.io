I can&#039;t remember the name of it and it&#039;s hard to find because it &quot;spontaneously ignited&quot; and instantaneously vaporized some 17,000 people instantly. That&#039;s a good read if you can find the local newspaper clips about it and there is a memorial site next to the fuckhuge crater it left in the side of mountain if you feel froggy and want to drive.<br><br>To put this in comparison there is a town in Illinois called Decatur that has another one, as well as Batavia, and they are quit literally 30 and 10 times the size respectively. Both have open ended contracts so nobody knows the exact scope but they seem to be linked around areas where processing of soy, corn, plastics and glass are done for government contracts. Gorbechev has a statue at the ADM headquarters in Chicago and in Decatur. Friend from school&#039;s dad was a private pilot and spent many a night flying Russian officials in and out of the corporate grounds down there. Always said they were on some pretty crazy shit with GMOs but hell, the entirety of Illinois is nothing but Chicago and GMO corn\/soy\/dairy towns with massive government subsidies for seemingly no reason.","time":1493455458,"resto":123302840,"id":"fPtMmtps","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

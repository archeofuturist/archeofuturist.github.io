This following question and Answer explains how natural selection led to humans, not divine creationism. <br><br>Q: If people evolved from apes, then why are there still apes???<br><br>- A high school student from Arkansas<br><br>Ans: <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; This is a good question, and it points out a common misconception. The quick answer is that humans didn&#039;t actually evolve from modern apes. But we did both evolve from a common ancestor who happened to look more like an ape than a human.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; So where did the ape-like ancestor go? Why did this ancestor evolve into humans and modern apes?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; This is where evolution comes in. Evolution is a natural process that changes all living things over many generations.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Evolution requires at least two things. First, we all have differences in our DNA, the instructions for making every living creature. These DNA differences lead to various eye colors, skin colors, blood types, and all of the other variation that exists between each of us.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Some of these DNA differences don&#039;t matter. Others can be bad and cause diseases and even death. And some of these differences in DNA can help a person to live longer or stay healthier. For example, one DNA difference seems to make people more resistant to HIV and maybe also smallpox and the plague (see \/ask\/ask10 for more details).<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Second, evolution requires that DNA be passed from one generation to the next. This way, any survival advantage can be passed from parent to child.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Combining these, evolution works because animals (or other living things) with beneficial DNA differences usually survive longer and are able to have more kids. And those with bad DNA changes often die before they can have kids. Over time, more and more animals have the good DNA, and fewer have the bad DNA. This is called natural selection.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; So now that we understand evolution and natural selection, how can this explain why we have humans and apes?<\/span>","filename":"humev_cartoon","ext":".gif","w":160,"h":249,"tn_w":80,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490268455582,"time":1490268455,"md5":"OEvkvbLERcW+88ESmXMXkg==","fsize":5779,"resto":117920279,"id":"r50o5SyJ","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":117920772,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)07:27:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"how can you beleive in evolution if it is just a theory (a geuss)?","time":1490268468,"resto":117920279,"id":"kFDMXsnB","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":117920787,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)07:27:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117920673\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117920673<\/a><br>If you start thinking about everything in the world being trial and error, and iterative - everything starts to make sense.","time":1490268476,"resto":117920279,"id":"I+WPEIoc","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":117920819,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)07:28:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117920491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117920491<\/a><br>Well creationism says the world was created 6000 years ago which is not very viable in evolutionary theory.","time":1490268500,"resto":117920279,"id":"YuLBdhFQ","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":117920826,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)07:28:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117920757\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117920757<\/a><br>(part 2 )<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; One way natural selection can work to evolve new species is if the old species gets split into two groups. The two groups have to be separated in different environments for a long time. This is what might have happened to cause modern apes and humans to appear. The story probably went something like this.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Sometime between eight million and five million years ago, Africa had more rain and was covered by forests. During this time, an ape-like species (our common ancestor) lived in these forests. They were quite successful and spread all over the continent.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Then the climate began to change, the land began to dry out, and the forests began to disappear. Some of these ape-like creatures continued to live successfully in the woods. But others were forced to leave the woods and go into the open fields of grass.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; What works best for survival in the grasslands is different than what works best in the forest. Once our ancestors found themselves out of the woods, they couldn&#039;t hide from predators as well, and food was not as plentiful. Many of these ape-like creatures living in the grasslands could not survive.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; But some of these creatures did survive- those that could walk on two feet, for example. Walking on two feet may have helped them to run for longer distances to get away from predators. It also may have helped them to find food from further away and have free hands to carry it back home. Whatever the reason, those that could walk on two feet were surviving more often.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The ape-like creatures that could walk on two feet had kids that were also more able to walk on two feet (this is controlled by one&#039;s DNA). So every generation, more and more of the surviving population could walk on two feet. The others got killed off by predators and\/or starved to death.<\/span>","time":1490268505,"resto":117920279,"id":"r50o5SyJ","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":117920835,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)07:28:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117920279\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117920279<\/a><br>I can&#039;t tell who&#039;s trolling in these threads, whereas I know everyone is trolling in the flat-earth ones.<br><br>Evolution explains the differences in Human groups.","time":1490268512,"resto":117920279,"id":"mhqLyKe3","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117920856,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)07:28:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117920826\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117920826<\/a><br>(part 3)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Over many generations (and a few million years) living in separate places, we ended up with two different species. The ones in the grasslands walked on two feet, learned to make tools and work in groups, and eventually evolved into us. Those that stayed in the forest evolved into modern apes. Of course, those in the forest also changed after many years to survive better in the forest.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; So there you have it. We didn&#039;t evolve from apes; rather, apes and humans evolved from a common ancestor. Natural selection doesn&#039;t care about whether a species is smarter or more progressive. It only cares about whether a species can survive long enough to find a mate and have kids.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Thus, the reason that modern apes are still around is that they have been successful at surviving in their environment. And we are still around because we have also been successful at living in our environment. Perhaps the most amazing thing is that after 5-8 million years, we still share 98% of the same DNA with our distant cousins, the modern apes!<\/span><br><br>- By Dr. Kim Matulef, Stanford University","time":1490268532,"resto":117920279,"id":"r50o5SyJ","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":117920858,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)07:28:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117920722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117920722<\/a><br>Stop being edgy.<br><br>If it&#039;s true than why are there still monkeys?","time":1490268533,"resto":117920279,"id":"Oh9XuIFm","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":117920863,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)07:28:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117920279\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117920279<\/a><br>Can you believe white people were black monkeys?

They found that it is very similar to, but more primitive than, another early anthropoid, Afrotarsius libycus, recently discovered at a site of similar age in the Sahara Desert of Libya.

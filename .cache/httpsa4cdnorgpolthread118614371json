I&#039;ve been a hardline Trumper since early primary days and I live in a bright blue state. It&#039;s just getting harder and harder to keep defending him and it seems there&#039;s some new fire to put out every time I wake up. Some of my buddies who voted Trump because of me are flipping and talking about regrets and everything and they&#039;re basically ditching me when they go out.<br><br>To make matters worse I really do need Obamacare. I dodged a bullet when Trumpcare got cockblocked but I feel like I fucked myself--I root for his success and I get shafted on healthcare, or I root for his success and he just gets blocked again.<br><br>I need some silver lining and I need it bad.

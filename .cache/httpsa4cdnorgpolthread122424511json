The &quot;march for science&quot; represents the worst of STEM. It&#039;s all born out of a misunderstanding of what science is or what it&#039;s trying to accomplish which is bringing us closer to truth. At some point when empiricism lost favor as the primary philosophical model people started seeing science more as a fundamental reality rather than our best current understanding. Scientific realism is a cancer that has mired the field in dogma. These people treat science less as a rational system of inquiry and more like a religion. That&#039;s why you&#039;ll see them talk like the science is &quot;settled&quot; on things like climate change and we have complete understanding. Even though being a chaotic system sensitive to input variables we&#039;ve been unable to make an accurate model of the way things will change due to human input. Regardless they think we need to cut off our own arm to solve the problem when we don&#039;t have a good idea of how bad it actually is, because otherwise they wouldn&#039;t be good &quot;believers&quot; in science.<br><br>It&#039;s all bullshit born out of people&#039;s inability to think in anything but absolutes. &quot;Truth&quot; isn&#039;t something that can exist in this world, it&#039;s an ideal to strive for and we can get close but probably never reach it. The sooner people realize science is supposed to be a truth seeking system and not a neo religion with all the answers the better off we will be.<br>It unfortunately doesn&#039;t help either how enormously accomplished the scientific field is. Thanks to all of our work we&#039;ve obtained almost magical powers over our environment. People so desperately want to wear the mantle of science to give their positions more credibility. You see this with the way democrats try to own science, they want it to be theirs, on their side so you can&#039;t argue with just them but the entire field. There was some pop sci youtuber that spoke at the march that was saying &quot;science is inherently political.&quot; They desperately want it to be.","filename":"you really should be able to","ext":".jpg","w":987,"h":783,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":99,"tim":1492962180735,"time":1492962180,"md5":"6dhpQiy2h4yIKX5vPJES8A==","fsize":116004,"resto":122424511,"id":"PPEvG7Sp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122438347,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)11:43:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122437950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122437950<\/a><br>funny thing is that you are still proving my point about PhDs lurking \/pol\/","filename":"windows95","ext":".gif","w":320,"h":184,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1492962190264,"time":1492962190,"md5":"gNW\/6h4AgtJ6CbBpl3o7CA==","fsize":1724817,"resto":122424511,"id":"zAVmLu8\/","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122438392,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)11:43:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122437309\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122437309<\/a><br>You&#039;re clearly not looking hard enough. \/r\/math, \/r\/physics are great\/<br><br>\/sci\/ has a small user base and is filled with homework questions and &gt;300k starting bullshit.","time":1492962214,"resto":122424511,"id":"PyN1xqba","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122438397,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)11:43:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122437488\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122437488<\/a><br>This<br><br>I was doing research on dark matter when I heard there was a march going on<br><br>t.

Otherwise, primary concern is the effect on normal flora when you vaccinate with whole cell vaccines. Your immune system is well regulated and tolerates your flora, but if you strongly immunize with a IgM \/ IgG response to host flora antigens it can cause collateral damage to your microbio.

True science does not have a political agenda, it&#039;s just supposed tell us what&#039;s happening and how it&#039;s happening in the world around us. It&#039;s true politicains should listen to scientist when it comes to protecting the natural world or getting facts to back up your statement. Don&#039;t just say &quot;90% of scientists belive in climate change&quot;. Instead use the scientist arguements and evidence. The problom does not lay on science it&#039;s self but politicians who use &quot;science&quot; to lie and get votes. Trump has said that climate change is a lie and people believe him. This goes against what actual science has been telling us so of course scientist are going to be mad. Another problem lays with people who actually listen to scientist political beliefs and think that they&#039;re experts. If you wish to talk about climate change, a climatologist opinion would be a professional opinion. If you wish to talk about rocks. A geolist opinion would be a professional opinion. Of course, you should always take professional opinions into question when that opinion is stepping outside the profession itself, I argue with libreals all the time about abortion and they say the same thing every time. &quot;That&#039;s not the medical opinion&quot;. I&#039;m sorry but last time I checked its not doctors who are the people who decide what&#039;s right and wrong. But if I argued &quot;well im looking out for women&#039;s health&quot; then a professional opinion from a medical professional would be apreaciated, becuase whether I think it&#039;s right or wrong it doesn&#039;t really ensue any danger to the woman in question. But that doesn&#039;t give doctors the right to say what&#039;s right and wrong. This is an example of science in potitics where it don&#039;t belong. Politicains don&#039;t censor scientist. and give all scientific claims equal considerisation, and let the scientist sort through the bullshit and the truth. Scientist, don&#039;t get involved in humanitarian issues.

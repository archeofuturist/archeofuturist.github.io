In the process, much of Protestantism views faith primarily through an individualistic lens.","filename":"protestant-gnostics","ext":".jpg","w":315,"h":475,"tn_w":165,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493728387676,"time":1493728387,"md5":"+c7tFknmmUR3ao6UQ8zftg==","fsize":31210,"resto":0,"id":"98mrMJSk","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"protestant-gnostics","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123762532,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)08:33:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123762474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123762474<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gnostic Teaching #2: The Material World isn\u2019t Important<\/span><br>Many evangelical Christians believe that our bodies are just &quot;shells&quot; for the &quot;true person,&quot; the soul, which is inside of us. I remember being taught this in Pentecostal Sunday school at my father&#039;s church. The bodily resurrection is a belief that is often forgotten or completely unknown.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gnostic Teaching #3: Knowledge saves<\/span><br>An assumption among much popular Protestantism (although it is not to be found in the Protestant creeds) is that in order to be saved by the gospel one must understand the gospel. The idea that genuine faith must be self-conscious faith has unconsciously oriented many evangelicals to locate the soteriological nexus in a cognitive state, whether faith, doctrinal exactitude or personal assurance. John Wesley, for example, came close to suggesting that salvation was impossible outside the cognitive state of &quot;assurance.&quot;","time":1493728439,"resto":123762474,"id":"98mrMJSk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123762586,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)08:34:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123762532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123762532<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gnostic Teaching #4: God Doesn\u2019t Work Through Means<\/span><br>Echoing the anti-creational orientation of classical Gnosticism, much of the modern evangelical community is uncomfortable acknowledging that God\u2019s grace can be mediated through physical means and instruments. The sacraments are thus reduced to mere symbols for the much more important work which is invisible and non-physical.<br><br>This mentality has led some evangelicals to making anti-sacramentalism a central pillar in defining their movement For example, the ministers of the London Baptist Association defined Evangelicalism as being \u201cin opposition to Sacramentarianism; the simplicity of the communion of the Lord\u2019s Supper, in opposition to the doctrine of the Real Presence\u201d<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gnostic Teaching #5: The Church is Invisible<\/span><br>Protestants and Gnostics alike will agree on the doctrinal point that the &quot;church&quot; is invisible and stretches across denominational lines, hinging on the subjective notion of &quot;faith alone.&quot;<br>This _new_ interpretation of the Church was founded in the rejection of the first Church, the Catholic Church. At the end of Martin Luther&#039;s life, 40 new religions cropped up, all based on private interpretation, and all &quot;led by the Holy Spirit.&quot; This required a new understanding of the nature of the church... and therefore had to be described as an invisible kingdom--precisely as the Gnostics proclaimed it to be!","time":1493728478,"resto":123762474,"id":"98mrMJSk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123763672,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)08:48:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"You know I could come up with topics that gnostics supposedly had in common with the Catholic Church.

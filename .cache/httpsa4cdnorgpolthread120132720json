Symbolism in itself is nothing new in British politics.<br>The Conservatives, who are naturally rather shy about their creed, wear a modest primrose once<br>a year in memory of Mr. Disraeli. The Liberals wear rosettes of varying hues at election time.<br>The Socialists wore red ties until they faded pink after the last Labour Government. In<br>symbolism as in our creed we are more full-blooded people and, literally as well as<br>metaphorically, have put our shirt on Fascism. Our members are not compelled to wear the<br>Blackshirt. In most districts only about 1 in 20 wear it. But those who have worn the Blackshirt<br>in the early days and publicly proclaimed their faith before the world, have performed a service<br>to Fascism which will never be forgotten. Strongly held opinions, strongly expressed, are a<br>necessity in the chaos of a flabby age. The Blackshirt, therefore, is the symbol of Fascism.<br>(2) The salute is not Italian nor is it German, but the Germans also use it. It is the oldest salute of<br>European civilisation and was used in early Britain many centuries before a Fascist Party was<br>created in Italy.<br>(3) The Fasces, too, are a symbol used in Britain for the last 2,000 years and are to be found on<br>most of our great monuments. The symbol was brought to Britain by our Roman ancestors, who<br>were here for four centuries and their stock remained for ever. The Fasces were the symbol of the<br>Roman Empire. What more fitting than that they should be used by the Empire which succeeded<br>and surpassed the Roman Empire ?","time":1491659559,"resto":120132720,"id":"lDpWMDg\/","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":120133785,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:54:54","name":"Anonymous","filename":"ANGLO&#039;D","ext":".jpg","w":312,"h":241,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1491659694541,"time":1491659694,"md5":"RMPLvkcGA7b9MMiz8Ofr2g==","fsize":75905,"resto":120132720,"id":"abluAO3P","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":120133913,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:56:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120132720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120132720<\/a>","filename":"Screenshot_2017-04-08-09-42-05","ext":".png","w":480,"h":854,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491659788354,"time":1491659788,"md5":"Pg\/pfhWI27Ekm4lpdKBGlg==","fsize":223297,"resto":120132720,"id":"I1E\/houu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120134079,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:57:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120133325\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120133325<\/a><br>I&#039;m not even a newfag.

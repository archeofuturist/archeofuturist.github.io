Price action naturally determines what needs to be made, when, how much, and where it needs to go. This allows producers to have incredibly limited knowledge of what their product is used for only that more or less people want it. The timber industry for example doesn&#039;t need to know how much wood should be allocated for making pencils it just sells it to whomever is willing to buy it, in the same stroke the rubber industry doesn&#039;t need to know anything about pencils either to sell rubber for erasers they just know based on market pricing that they should make more or less of a thing. Government invariably fucks this up and that&#039;s how you end up with food shortages like we saw in the Soviet Union or in Venezuela today. Soviet planners even used the Sears Roebuck catalogue to guess at how things should be priced and distributed. This wouldn&#039;t work of course because it was for the American Market.","time":1493088637,"resto":122680315,"id":"joWF0pms","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122682303,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)22:58:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122680315\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122680315<\/a><br>Monopoly- always leads to higher prices and lower quality. The US post office for example was one of the explicit monoplies under the constitution that the government was allowed to set up. However, the profit motive for the State is fucked up because they&#039;ve already stolen your money through taxation. There is no market response their level of service so they can&#039;t tell if its working well. In 1844 a man name Lysander Spooner set up the American Letter Mail Company as a direct challenge to this monopoly. He was able to drive the cost of a stamp down to 6.25 cents a piece and delivered for free locally door to door. He is the reason your mail comes to your house today and not to the central post office. He nearly bankrupted the state&#039;s enterprise until they legislated him out of business. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ameri<wbr>can_Letter_Mail_Company<br><br>Another enterprising individual came along and decided he was better than the Pony Express because he was smart enough to deliver via rail roads. The government arrested him too and proceeded to steal his idea. This is where the whole &quot;the government can&#039;t even deliver the mail why would you want them to....&quot;","time":1493089093,"resto":122680315,"id":"joWF0pms","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

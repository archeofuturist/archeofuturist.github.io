I went from public school to private school (#3 in the state) and I got put in pre-AP\/IB classes in every subject EXCEPT math. I got put in 8th-grade math as a freshman. In the end, I got 800s on reading and writing, and 540 in math on my SATs. My early public school math education ruined me.","time":1490744380,"resto":118714070,"id":"fA0K33W+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Most people here would agree that colleges have become nothing short of Leftist reeducation camps that force political correctness while simultaneously taking all your money. However, while browsing for some exceptions, I may have found one. Prager University is exactly what colleges should be. Instead of giving students just a Leftist point of view with Leftist arguments, they promote freedom of thought.<br><br>Why is this important? Well, Prager University in particular has some pretty Conservative leanings. They go as far as explaining the evils of Socialism, the merits of Capitalism, and the value of free speech and free thought. We have to get behind this as this might be the last chance to keep colleges safe from Communist indoctrination.<br><br>These guys even called out Berkley in particular when describing how most colleges are Leftist education centers with no Conservative views taught at all. Of course this is relevant info since it seems like there are riots and protests every other week at Berkeley. Unfortunately, these guys are in favor of kikes but it&#039;s the best material we&#039;ve got so far at redpilling normies without using Nazi propaganda like usual.<br><br>Anyway, check out their shit and post your opinions. Not everything is related to the free thought on campus stuff but it&#039;s still pretty good.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=<wbr>y0HKgs-0zDY (This sounds like liberal bullshit at first but he takes a 180 and calls out liberal faggots on their 1984 shit)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=<wbr>bKhR9i5CGkA (Explains why Brazil is so shit today)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=<wbr>HlJHY2pSJV4 (Something I&#039;m sure you all know)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=<wbr>HlJHY2pSJV4<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;&gt;https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=<wbr>7VBAEJlR4pk<\/span>","filename":"PragerU Rockefeller","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492493644980,"time":1492493644,"md5":"JbvDUmfUvyVco\/JNKoiGxA==","fsize":80619,"resto":0,"id":"iXVFOJv1","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"prager-university","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":0,"unique_ips":7},{"no":121644953,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:36:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"I love your work but holy fuck are you retarded for posting such blatant shilling.

Universities are literally the biggest waste of money ever, unless they have a &gt;90% employment rate right after graduation in their respective field, with a rate where the graduate can pay it back within 4 years, it&#039;s a scam. Yes, this includes doctorate programs. In fact, almost all of them are scams and it shouldn&#039;t take someone more than 5 years to pay back their loans, unless they really fucking want to pull rotten teeth out of people for a living.","time":1492495048,"resto":121644741,"id":"mas7hheC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121647170,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:58:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Prager is the best we got.","time":1492495106,"resto":121644741,"id":"e8jxUYZ3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121647251,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:59:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Pragar is legit.

Then my dreaming changed and I just would wake up in places I had already gotten to. Unually unusual places that seem important for some reason. Normal places and weird places I&#039;d never heard of like being on a hot waterslide in a winter storm in the mountains. Or climbing a spiral staircase in a tower encased\/made of stained glass. Or breaking my phone in an asian city where I&#039;ve never been traveling like that. <br><br>Since I remember most moments in my every day I also remember these dreams. Then years later they happen and sometimes I use what I saw to find the next place I want to be or I change things like getting a better cellphone case and the case got broken instead. I can read things if I know the language and sometimes talk with people though people aren&#039;t always well resolved and the locations are often places that feel like a convergence where many things could have lead me there and mostly only life changing kind of moments where I need to do something important. It&#039;s odd to describe. <br><br>Since I&#039;m an atheist I find this a bit odd and my friends don&#039;t exactly believe in that sort of thing. But I still I guess you could say I use it when I find myself in a place I dreamed. And it&#039;s kinda like reaching save points and feels like being in the zone where everything clicks.

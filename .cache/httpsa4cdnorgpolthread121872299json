class=\"quote\">&gt;It was because investors calculated \u2013 counter-intuitively at first glance \u2013 that a bigger Tory majority in the Commons, if that\u2019s what follows, will mean a softer form of Brexit. This argument was best expressed by Deutsche Bank\u2019s analysts, who reckon the election is \u201ca game-changer\u201d for the pound and the Brexit negotiations. A bigger majority would set Theresa May free from the \u201cunrealistic timetable\u201d set by the eurosceptics in her party, they argue.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;First, the 2019 deadline for delivering a \u201cclean\u201d Brexit will be less pressing because there won\u2019t now be an election the following year. Second, the influence of hard Brexiters will be diluted and the government will be able to compromise over transitional agreements. Third, May can fall into step with the EU\u2019s desire to settle the divorce bill first and then negotiate the detail of Brexit. \u201cThis sequenced approach materially reduces the \u2018crash risk\u2019 of Brexit negotiations as well as strengthening the prime minister\u2019s hand in pursuing an orderly (and very lengthy) withdrawal,\u201d argues Deutsche.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Up to a point, this line seems legitimate. If delivering a \u201csuccessful\u201d Brexit involves making a few pragmatic compromises \u2013 which is surely the lesson from the initial skirmishes with the EU negotiators \u2013 you can\u2019t blame May for seeking cover from the hard-liners in her own party. And kicking out the next election until 2022 seems a smart political move: it would allow time for a three-year transitional phase before UK voters go back to the polls, which could take the edge off any economic shock at the moment of Brexit in 2019.<\/span><br><br>Goldman Sachs on why May will throw the Brexit wing of the party and voters under a Vote Leave bus when she gets a crushing victory this election.

But for most voters it was near the bottom of their concerns. Far from settling some burning national question, Mr Cameron\u2019s referendum took a non-issue and turned it into one which really could poison British politics for years.","filename":"20170408_woc316","ext":".png","w":1190,"h":592,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1492625880588,"time":1492625880,"md5":"KqyUMRQffwgg7AZHB1C6kg==","fsize":40201,"resto":121872299,"id":"Veaw1gYE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121874418,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)14:18:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121874097\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121874097<\/a><br>Oh shit lad of course it is, I was fantasising about Julia Bradbury (who coincidentally appears alongside Portillo in Alan Partridge&#039;s latest book)<br><a href=\"#p121874137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121874137<\/a><br>Top taste m8","filename":"ChoochooStrike","ext":".jpg","w":925,"h":534,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":72,"tim":1492625898226,"time":1492625898,"md5":"lb+ZIrL+ITnBUEz8zBfHEw==","fsize":91816,"resto":121872299,"id":"c6BgX90S","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121874429,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)14:18:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;MPs who voted against the election motion<\/span><br><br>Labour: Ronnie Campbell, Ann Clwyd, Paul Farrelly, Jim Fitzpatrick, Clive Lewis, Fiona MacTaggart, Liz McInnes, Dennis Skinner, Graham Stringer<br>Independent (ex-Unionist): Lady Sylvia Hermon<br>Independent (suspended SNP): Natalie McGarry, Michelle Thomson<br>SDLP: Dr Alasdair McDonnell<br><br>Any names of note there?

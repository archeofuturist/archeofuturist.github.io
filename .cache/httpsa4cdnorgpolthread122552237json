You can see that morality is completely logical, because logic is what makes you obey it, when you&#039;re in a community (so as not to offend the community, which is the sourcec of your strength). When outside of the community, your &quot;morality&quot; or your valuations change.So no, there isn&#039;t really anything stopping you from killing me, only you&#039;re logic.

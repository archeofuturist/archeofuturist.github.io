South Korea will never okay a military strike, too many civilian lives are at risk. This means that the US would have to go against their own allies, which historically just doesn&#039;t really tend to happen. Anglos love offloading all the real work to other nations. Secondly, Russia and China dont have any incentives to agree on more sanctions. Russia will block any new UN sanctions due to the Syria strike, I think that angered Putin personally. China might make a deal if they get the islands for free in return, but how likely is that? And even if China does make a deal for more sanctions (non UN, just China sanctions) then it will still drag out for more decades. It&#039;s not like sanctions ever caused any regime change. And Kim will not attack first, he is not stupid enough for that. What motivation would he have to attack and who? Some meaningless carrier group and then watch himself get obliterated? He has *zero* motivation to start anything. He just wants to keep testing missiles. So for all these reasons, I see the North Korea crisis going absolutely nowhere and being another political loss for Trump.<br>The DPRK actually simply wants free money and food I think. That&#039;s the only explanation for the incredible increase in threats in the recent years. The increase is almost comical, so the rate of increase never made so much sense to me but I have too little information to make an informed call there. <br>Honestly, this situation looks like another classic anglo war. The US tried to goad the other party into attacking first so it can respond without moral or political side effects.<br>In this case I dont think Kim is stupid enough to fall for it but then again, neither should Hitler have been and he did it too.","filename":"war-capabilities","ext":".png","w":900,"h":7335,"tn_w":30,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493471121224,"time":1493471121,"md5":"QLsTNRVHSDE1EIHft8ucew==","fsize":1209257,"resto":0,"id":"f\/ldCajA","country":"AT","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"analysis-of-north-korean-crisis","country_name":"Austria","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

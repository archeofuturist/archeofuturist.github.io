You can have that, but then after that condition is met, everything else is deregulated and free market. You can do any drugs you want, sleep with prostitutes, own guns or even military grade equipment. There is no taxation other than the labor you agree to for the first 5 years of your adult life (you have to build a house for you self and maybe two others, until it&#039;s no longer practical to build houses). It might not actually be possible, but it makes sense in my head.","time":1493428652,"resto":123269566,"id":"+YA27ckP","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123276165,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:18:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123269566\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123269566<\/a>","filename":"fa3aa9adfb9d1cce18fdb7efc9d969c20c1a8cba7a85d065ac94a9bbfaa692ce_1","ext":".jpg","w":538,"h":402,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493428732689,"time":1493428732,"md5":"\/Ht004ltLzwwiypxRozGlw==","fsize":76143,"resto":123269566,"id":"fR3mNUDP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123276429,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)21:20:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s only possible in smallish communities where their members can keep checks on each other and punish or banish a member.

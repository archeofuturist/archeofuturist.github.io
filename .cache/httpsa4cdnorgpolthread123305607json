Why could there not simply be an endless series of things mutually keeping each other in being?This is an attractive hypothesis. Think of a single drunk. He could probably not stand up alone. But a group of drunks, all of them mutually supporting each other, might stand. They might even make their way along the street. But notice: Given so many drunks, and given the steady ground beneath them, we can understand how their stumblings might cancel each other out, and how the group of them could remain (relatively) upright. We could not understand their remaining upright if the ground did not support them\u2014if, for example, they were all suspended several feet above it. And of course, if there were no actual drunks, there would be nothing to understand.<br>This brings us to our argument. Things have got to exist in order to be mutually dependent; they cannot depend upon each other for their entire being, for then they would have to be, simultaneously, cause and effect of each other. A causes B, B causes C, and C causes A. That is absurd. The argument is trying to show why a world of caused causes can be given\u2014or can be there\u2014at all. And it simply points out: If this thing can exist only because something else is giving it existence, then there must exist something whose being is not a gift. Otherwise everything would need at the same time to be given being, but nothing (in addition to &quot;everything&quot;) could exist to give it. And that means nothing would actually be.Why not have an endless series of caused causes stretching backward into the past?

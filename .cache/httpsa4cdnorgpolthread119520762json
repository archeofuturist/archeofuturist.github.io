It is of interest in this connection to note that the emblem is found as a water-mark in paper as early as the reign of King Charles II. On either side are golden roundels, which are as near as heraldry permits to get to the familiar tabloids of our chemical factories. These are charged with ears of wheat, symbolizing another of the staple industries of the borough. The golden anvil at the base of the shield is emblematical of the great engineering and metal-working interests.<br>The hermit typifies those recluses who, by their holy lives and untiring devotion to the cause of humanity, set a noble example for all time. It may, moreover, be recalled that it was through their exertions that funds were obtained for erecting the first bridge over the Darent. The earliest hermit of whom there is any record, John Sodeman by name, under the title of &#039;Hermit of the Chapel of the Blessed Virgin and Martyr, St Katherine of Dertford, for reformation of the poor&#039;, obtained Letters of Indulgence from the Bishop of the Diocese on the1st of June 1438.

This because he is rich itself and reflects the will of the wealthiests.<br>- The wealthiests are a minority (more than \u20ac 3,500)<br>- Hollande&#039;s presidency has been considered one of the worst ever and it would be extremely contradictory to vote for Macron who has been a minister in Hollande&#039;s government.<br>- Macron program is extremely weak: he doesn&#039;t even show to have a realistic and coherent solution or plan for France issues. (for example: &quot;\u2018Terrorism will be part of our daily lives for years to come&quot;, Macron)<br>- Nicolas Dupont-Aignan (right wing), who achieved 5% in the first-round vote, shared alot of ideas with MLP endorsed MLP and it&#039;s reasonable to think that his electorate will vote for MLP.<br>- A huge amount of vote in every salary group were for M\u00e9lenchon and Fillion.<br>- M\u00e9lenchon and Fillion ideas and programs are much more similar to MLP ones than Macron&#039;s: Fillion policy clearly belongs to the right wing and M\u00e9lenchon program shared alot of ideas with MLP one.<br>- Voters are much more conditioned by ideas than candidates&#039; endorsements.<br>- In fact, Fillion has been heavily criticised for endorsing Macron.<br>- Interviews have shown M\u00e9lenchon voters more inclined to vote for MLP or to abstain than voting Macron.<br>- Agreement for MLP is growing every day, not only on social networks.<br><br><br>You know what to do: prepare your meme NOW, for France, Pour La Victoire, for Europe, for Shadilay, la mia libert\u00e0.","filename":"IMG_20170427_154617","ext":".jpg","w":753,"h":496,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":164,"tim":1493576279814,"time":1493576279,"md5":"cOkj5j3yCaINwvXbkN30YQ==","fsize":111909,"resto":0,"id":"WldYALEr","country":"IT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cest-quand-quelle-vient-marine-le-pen","country_name":"Italy","replies":17,"images":5,"unique_ips":9},{"no":123506480,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:22:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1493576564,"resto":123505987,"id":"Ple3WM2v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123506540,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:23:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Any French speakers...which is correct?<br>Je suis avec Elle<br>or<br>Elle est avec nous","filename":"Emmanuel Macron and the EU","ext":".jpg","w":772,"h":664,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":107,"tim":1493576597261,"time":1493576597,"md5":"T9GFUCqgfUk53yZLyL7aBg==","fsize":204357,"resto":123505987,"id":"pxWqgPnl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123506780,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:25:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123506540\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123506540<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Je suis avec Elle<\/span><br>I&#039;m with her.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Elle est avec nous<\/span><br>She&#039;s with us.","filename":"1488169389451","ext":".jpg","w":548,"h":356,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1493576728077,"time":1493576728,"md5":"9gF\/Qy+9MhB3iMby\/v6K2g==","fsize":50560,"resto":123505987,"id":"6gadvBX4","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123507130,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:28:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123505987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123505987<\/a>","filename":"Points","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":679,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493576917245,"time":1493576917,"md5":"VxTpXq0FlHu6B59AEO5vCw==","fsize":49172,"resto":123505987,"id":"WldYALEr","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":123507521,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:32:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123505987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123505987<\/a><br>Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist","time":1493577138,"resto":123505987,"id":"B\/zM3Ze4","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":123507924,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:35:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123507521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123507521<\/a><br>Shadilay Shadilay Shadilay Shadilay Shadilay Shadilay Shadilay Shadilay Shadilay Shadilay Shadilay Shadilay","time":1493577350,"resto":123505987,"id":"WldYALEr","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":123508602,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:41:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Vive Le Pen!

We know what kind of demographic likes him - big city liberals - but we don&#039;t know what kind of demographic would want him as a second option. You can&#039;t do guesswork - if it was Fillon vs. Macron(let alone Fillon vs. Hamon) then you could guess that FN voters will support Fillon while Melenchon voters will be all for Macron.

The rich strata conservatives, who were in for Fillon economics will jump ship to Macron, but what about the rest? Macron means destruction of French lifestyle in many ways as he wants to Americanise labour laws - for the French, Sunday being free of work is kind of essential, anglos may not have it but they do. French conservatives and traditionalists are concerned about their identity and culture being replaced by anglo-saxon identity and culture and they&#039;re not okay with another hit from this direction.<br><br>Shy Tory effect may also be a thing, especially since FN was called second coming of Hitler(okay, Petain) ever since it was founded, so you can expect to be harsher than elsewhere.","time":1493578054,"resto":123505987,"id":"gJydDeUA","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":123509441,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:49:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123509230\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123509230<\/a><br>http:\/\/www.breitbart.com\/london\/201<wbr>7\/04\/28\/french-physicist-maths-le-p<wbr>en-victory\/","time":1493578154,"resto":123505987,"id":"WldYALEr","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":123510826,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)15:00:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123509441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123509441<\/a><br>I wouldn&#039;t count on Breitbart, and my point isn&#039;t to play an oracle, I wanted to show you that these elections are very unusual for French politics.<br><br>In more classical configurations you can predict how will the voters behave in the next turn based on how it looked like in previous elections.<br><br>Now there&#039;s a confusion.

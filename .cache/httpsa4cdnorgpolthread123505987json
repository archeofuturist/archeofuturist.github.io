This because he is rich itself and reflects the will of the wealthiests.<br>- The wealthiests are a minority (more than \u20ac 3,500)<br>- Hollande&#039;s presidency has been considered one of the worst ever and it would be extremely contradictory to vote for Macron who has been a minister in Hollande&#039;s government.<br>- Macron program is extremely weak: he doesn&#039;t even show to have a realistic and coherent solution or plan for France issues. (for example: &quot;\u2018Terrorism will be part of our daily lives for years to come&quot;, Macron)<br>- Nicolas Dupont-Aignan (right wing), who achieved 5% in the first-round vote, shared alot of ideas with MLP endorsed MLP and it&#039;s reasonable to think that his electorate will vote for MLP.<br>- A huge amount of vote in every salary group were for M\u00e9lenchon and Fillion.<br>- M\u00e9lenchon and Fillion ideas and programs are much more similar to MLP ones than Macron&#039;s: Fillion policy clearly belongs to the right wing and M\u00e9lenchon program shared alot of ideas with MLP one.<br>- Voters are much more conditioned by ideas than candidates&#039; endorsements.<br>- In fact, Fillion has been heavily criticised for endorsing Macron.<br>- Interviews have shown M\u00e9lenchon voters more inclined to vote for MLP or to abstain than voting Macron.<br>- Agreement for MLP is growing every day, not only on social networks.<br><br><br>You know what to do: prepare your meme NOW, for France, Pour La Victoire, for Europe, for Shadilay, la mia libert\u00e0.","filename":"IMG_20170427_154617","ext":".jpg","w":753,"h":496,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":164,"tim":1493576279814,"time":1493576279,"md5":"cOkj5j3yCaINwvXbkN30YQ==","fsize":111909,"resto":0,"id":"WldYALEr","country":"IT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cest-quand-quelle-vient-marine-le-pen","country_name":"Italy","replies":7,"images":4,"unique_ips":5},{"no":123506480,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:22:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1493576564,"resto":123505987,"id":"Ple3WM2v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123506540,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:23:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Any French speakers...which is correct?<br>Je suis avec Elle<br>or<br>Elle est avec nous","filename":"Emmanuel Macron and the EU","ext":".jpg","w":772,"h":664,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":107,"tim":1493576597261,"time":1493576597,"md5":"T9GFUCqgfUk53yZLyL7aBg==","fsize":204357,"resto":123505987,"id":"pxWqgPnl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123506780,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:25:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123506540\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123506540<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Je suis avec Elle<\/span><br>I&#039;m with her.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Elle est avec nous<\/span><br>She&#039;s with us.","filename":"1488169389451","ext":".jpg","w":548,"h":356,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1493576728077,"time":1493576728,"md5":"9gF\/Qy+9MhB3iMby\/v6K2g==","fsize":50560,"resto":123505987,"id":"6gadvBX4","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123507130,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:28:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123505987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123505987<\/a>","filename":"Points","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":679,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493576917245,"time":1493576917,"md5":"VxTpXq0FlHu6B59AEO5vCw==","fsize":49172,"resto":123505987,"id":"WldYALEr","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":123507521,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:32:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123505987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123505987<\/a><br>Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist Racist","time":1493577138,"resto":123505987,"id":"B\/zM3Ze4","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":123507924,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:35:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123507521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123507521<\/a><br>Shadilay Shadilay Shadilay Shadilay Shadilay Shadilay Shadilay Shadilay Shadilay Shadilay Shadilay Shadilay","time":1493577350,"resto":123505987,"id":"WldYALEr","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":123508602,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:41:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Vive Le Pen!

How come when presented with facts that they&#039;re harmful, they resort to casting insults? How come the very techniques antixaxxers used to prove vaccines cause autism (and were mocked for the techniques they used) were also the exact same techniques provaxxers use to prove vaccines DO work? Correlation, not causation.<br>&quot;Muh vaccines cause autismo&quot; *shows graph of autism increasing with vaccine usage<br>&quot;Muh vaccines prevent polio&quot; *shows graph of polio in decline with introduction of vaccines*<br>Why aren&#039;t you the superior human species that can see both sides for the retarded opinions that they hold, and keep a clear mind that is driven by facts, not the information they&#039;ve been spoon fed since birth?<br>Just take a look at Ignaz Semmelweis, the doctor who studied hand washing. Something so basic that it&#039;s practically second nature to us today. But did you know that it wasn&#039;t always commonplace to wash your hands? Doctors would perform autopsies, and without washing their hands would go directly to delivering babies.<br>It&#039;s no wonder babies died from disease and polio. These nigger doctors would rub their hands in the fresh polio infected flesh and touch a newborn baby with them.<br>But I&#039;m supposed to believe that if this doctor was vaccinated, that the vaccine HE received would protect the newborn, unvaccinated baby from his filthy jew hands?<br>No matter how many vaccines you get, if you have filthy jew hands, you will spread corruption to all that is pure and holy on earth.<br>Now please show me a single study that proves vaccines work, and prove there are no negative side effects in the long term.<br>I&#039;ll gladly take a vaccine if they&#039;re proven to work.","filename":"Vaccine-in-vial-with-syringe","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":675,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493904069098,"time":1493904069,"md5":"EQEar7WpAAihDt9XSSD59w==","fsize":97252,"resto":0,"id":"5lnxKnUg","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-come-people-who-love-vaccines-so-much-can","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":124059283,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)09:21:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"I won&#039;t take a vaccine just cause they&#039;re &quot;proven&quot; NOT to be harmless, but not proven to be effective.<br>Cause let&#039;s be honest, vaccines aren&#039;t effective.<br>I work in healthcare.

Germany\u2019s military spending amounts to 1.2 per cent of GDP: when Ms Merkel visited Washington last month, the president suggested that she owed him \u201ca trillion dollars\u201d in respect of years of underwhelming budget contributions.<br><br>All but five of Nato\u2019s 28 members fall short of the 2 per cent target. But Mr Trump has singled out Berlin for criticism because of the yawning gap between its economic clout and global military insignificance. Of European Nato members, only the UK and France can effectively project force abroad. Germany lacks even adequate air transport: due to years of delays in delivery of the new Airbus A400M, it relies mainly on aircraft first flown 50 years ago.<br><br>Ms Merkel says she is committed to \u201cmaking every effort\u201d to meet Nato\u2019s goals. Allies agree. Roderich Kiesewetter, a hawkish lawmaker in the chancellor\u2019s CDU party and former army officer, says: \u201cTrump\u2019s election has, above all, made clear that Europe together must make a bigger contribution to its defence under Nato\u2019s auspices.\u201d","time":1493214497,"resto":122884916,"id":"VH1R8Aue","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122885087,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)09:49:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122884916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122884916<\/a><br>Do it Germany, I trust in you. 4th Reich when?","filename":"1492678579731","ext":".jpg","w":670,"h":833,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493214574536,"time":1493214574,"md5":"X7mCWziKSsA4jWKELA22Jg==","fsize":72705,"resto":122884916,"id":"MdJeWUGx","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":122885090,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)09:49:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122884991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122884991<\/a><br>(continued)<br><br>Germany has broken a taboo about sending troops abroad, with missions to the Balkans, Africa and Afghanistan. In Lithuania, 41-year-old Lt Col Huber, who joined the army in 1995, suggests foreign missions such as that to Rukla are the main change he has seen. \u201c[When I signed up], they were only just beginning,\u201d he says.<br><br>But, as in Lithuania, Berlin always works with allies and tries to limit its use of force. In Syria, for example, it provides reconnaissance for US-led air attacks on Isis, but not firepower.<br> <br>After prolonged post-Cold War defence cuts, the 2014 Ukraine crisis prompted a U-turn in German military spending, with the first increase in more than 25 years as Berlin reassessed the potential Russian threat. But the boost is coming slowly.<br><br>This year\u2019s planned military spending is 8 per cent up on 2016. But the draft 2018 budget envisages a further increase of only 4 per cent. With the economy growing, defence\u2019s share of GDP could drop, leaving Berlin short of the 2 per cent goal. And a Forsa agency poll this year showed a majority of Germans still oppose boosting defence budgets.<br><br>Much hangs on September\u2019s parliamentary election. Ms Merkel\u2019s conservative Christian Democrat-Christian Social bloc faces a strong challenge from the Social Democrats, her junior coalition partners, who are much more cautious about boosting defence spending.Sigmar Gabriel, the Social Democrat foreign minister, said last month at a Nato ministerial meeting that the 2 per cent target \u201cwas formulated...as a guideline and not as a goalpost\u201d.<br><br>Even CDU-CSU politicians are careful about the 2 per cent target. Mr Kiesewetter says it is only \u201csensible\u201d to \u201cmove towards\u201d 2 per cent if Nato members in Europe first do more to co-ordinate budgets, capabilities and the interoperability of weapons systems.","time":1493214577,"resto":122884916,"id":"VH1R8Aue","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122885285,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)09:52:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122885090\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122885090<\/a><br><br> High quality global journalism requires investment.

Hans-Peter Bartels, the parliamentary commissioner for the armed forces, says a pared-down defence ministry is ill-equipped for expansion. With labour scarce, Germany is unable to recruit its full complement of 170,000 soldiers, let alone the extra 12,000 to be hired by 2024, he adds.<br><br>Ursula von der Leyen, defence minister, is already struggling with widespread shortcomings in weapons programmes. A 2014 parliamentary inquiry found that only 41 out of 190 helicopters, 42 of 109 Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft and 280 of 406 Marder armoured cars were operational.<br><br>A government economic adviser says bluntly: \u201cGabriel is right.

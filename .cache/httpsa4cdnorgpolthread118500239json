They poisoned the conversation with lies on the left and on the right. Many did it to influence the outcome, others, just to make a buck. The president uses the term \u201cfake news\u201d to discredit responsible reporting that he doesn\u2019t like, but we\u2019re going to show you how con-artists insert truly fake news into the national conversation with fraudulent software that scams your social media account. The stories are fake, but the consequences are real.<br><br>This past December, Edgar Welch opened fire in a Washington D.C. pizzeria. He told police he was there to rescue children forced into prostitution by Hillary Clinton. The story of Secretary Clinton\u2019s child sex-trafficking operation, in a pizzeria, was invented before the election by fraudulent news sites and shared by millions. James Alefantis owns the restaurant.","time":1490612420,"resto":118500239,"id":"4Et88yjY","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118501501,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)07:06:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u2018They\u2019re not lies\u2019: Pizzagate troll tells 60 Minutes his \u2018fake news\u2019 stories are \u2018100 percent true\u2019<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anchor Scott Pelley said that while Pres.

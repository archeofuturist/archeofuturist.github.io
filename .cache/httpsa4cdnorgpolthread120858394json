It is precisely the EXCESSIVELY individualistic (individualism is fine as far as protecting one&#039;s property and family goes) culture bred by the libertarian capitalist origins of the United States system of governance that for sure has led to its growth, but also ensured its own demise and the total collapse of the existing Western value systems and demographics. When everything is permissible, it is the tendency of the ordered structure of society to corrode over time as people forget more and more of their history and embrace transient hedonistic impulses, the minor failures of the parents of one generation grow exponentially into the rest. There needs to be legal confinements for basic morality and traditions to be upheld or else they deteriorate, nobody wants to hear about personal responsibility and sacrifice and the things that allowed us to reach this point. Allowing the basic morality of the father culture to perish will lead to the collapse of society and the regression of several centuries of social progress, a truth that echoes back through the ages.","time":1492055371,"resto":120858394,"id":"YclExiMx","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120862699,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:51:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120862463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120862463<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Implying every elite class have allways been kikes.<\/span><br><br>Not what I&#039;m saying.

What is happening now is your home and your church family are in an antagonistic relationship with the government, which has become divorced from its parent culture and is being used to erase the value structures you embrace and no doubt want your children to embrace. Replacing such a government with one that seeks to uphold the traditions of you and your people is a boon, and is in no way worse than what you have now. Tell me how, then, a government which simultaneously protects its own businesses from predation and its own workers from exploitation or a government which teaches constitutional rights, the benefits of monogamy and the atomic family and other such things in place of the self-flagellating social sciences in school subjugates you or interferes with your loyalty to your family and church group, or your worship of god? It doesn&#039;t, all it does is stifle the growth of influences which have been systematically modifying the educational system to turn your children against you, and want to expand their influence over what is taught in home school and private school so they can do so to an even greater extent.","time":1492056920,"resto":120858394,"id":"YclExiMx","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120865252,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)00:16:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120864928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120864928<\/a><br>You sound like a really dull fucking person","time":1492056978,"resto":120858394,"id":"Ej5NzFkY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120865255,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)00:16:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120860186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120860186<\/a><br>I didn&#039;t have one till 12 and I didn&#039;t even have a mildly informed one till I was 16","time":1492056981,"resto":120858394,"id":"Sqq1Y6Nw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120865329,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)00:16:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120865103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120865103<\/a><br>also in case anyone didn&#039;t understand by my being on \/pol\/, i am in the purple currently, and it goes from left to right","filename":"1481082909672","ext":".png","w":488,"h":473,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":121,"tim":1492057019103,"time":1492057019,"md5":"5kx+YJQRUVEJX1Zp15K7RQ==","fsize":179151,"resto":120858394,"id":"ABFjVGCq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120865532,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)00:18:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120864813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120864813<\/a><br>What your neighbor does affects you.<br>What the town next door does affects you.<br><br>A united people is far stronger than some disparate bundle of radical individuals","time":1492057134,"resto":120858394,"id":"F947BiSi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120865570,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)00:19:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120865063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120865063<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They need someone guiding them, and leading the way<\/span><br>Then they&#039;ll follow leaders.

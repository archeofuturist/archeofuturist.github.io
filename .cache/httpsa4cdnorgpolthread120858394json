When everything is permissible, it is the tendency of the ordered structure of society to corrode over time as people forget more and more of their history and embrace transient hedonistic impulses, the minor failures of the parents of one generation grow exponentially into the rest. There needs to be legal confinements for basic morality and traditions to be upheld or else they deteriorate, nobody wants to hear about personal responsibility and sacrifice and the things that allowed us to reach this point. Allowing the basic morality of the father culture to perish will lead to the collapse of society and the regression of several centuries of social progress, a truth that echoes back through the ages.","time":1492055371,"resto":120858394,"id":"YclExiMx","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120862699,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:51:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120862463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120862463<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Implying every elite class have allways been kikes.<\/span><br><br>Not what I&#039;m saying.

Even if each county gained complete independence the Mexican or Canadian armies wouldn&#039;t invade because the sheer population would make their invasion a blood bath.

They&#039;re leftists, and they parrot what the professors tell them. In turn, the professors give them good grade for it. Thus, these communists get the highest grades, good enough for grad school.<br>So then it&#039;s only these communists getting into grad schools (at least for liberal arts). These communists then become professors, and they push for more mandatory liberal arts courses in which they will brainwash your children. It&#039;s a dangerous cycle, and we cannot ignore it.<br><br>We must be ever vigilant.","filename":"6PBbtj_web[1]","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":430,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":167,"tim":1491248937963,"time":1491248937,"md5":"XanlhgcjscRbZnjutD922A==","fsize":78924,"resto":0,"id":"+gOMMm1n","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-guys-joke-about-communism-but-its-actually","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119371743,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)15:53:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/anticomofficial<wbr>?lang=en<br><br>Join anticom","time":1491249238,"resto":119371186,"id":"vt3MccpQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119371772,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)15:54:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Shoot up the school","time":1491249254,"resto":119371186,"id":"xVzras1J","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119372464,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)15:59:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"never underestimate extremists, you&#039;re absolutely right about that<br>Russians and others did it in past, Okhrana even encouraged Bolsheviks because they were so extreme<br>it backfired spectacularly","time":1491249582,"resto":119371186,"id":"\/yYOMleg","country":"ME","country_name":"Montenegro"}]}

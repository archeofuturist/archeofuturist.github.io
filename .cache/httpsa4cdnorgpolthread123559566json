She got the second highest score and will oppose Macron in the finals. <br><br>Fillon was fucked the moment he tried to deflect the scandals as &quot;things that should not be the focus or the campaign&quot; and refuse to go to court when summoned. He got third. <br><br>M\u00e9lenchon got fourth, which is a fucking high as hell score for a communist, even in the socialist land of France. <br><br>And Macron got first, because he was the least bad. <br>Also all other candidates except him had already been candidate for presidency at least once before (and were defeated).

Hahahaha nope. Not even in her wildest dreams. Sure, french politics will become more conservative, but EU laws would make it impossible for her to make really drastic changes. <br><br>She could reduce immigration, but we have open border within the EU, so it&#039;d be useless. Banning mosques is forbidden by EU legislation. Even going back on gay marriage would be incredibly hard legally speaking. I don&#039;t know exactly what she could to, to be honest. Until now, France has always had politics that were more socialist than the EU, so it&#039;s hard to predict what will happen is we become more conservative instead. <br><br>If she organizes a vote to get out of the EU, and if we vote yes, then first of all the EU will most likely explode. We&#039;re the ones who created it along with Germany, as well as one of the biggest contributors and I don&#039;t see Germany sustaining the EU on its own. After that, the only thing that could stop her will be the constitution and other traditional counter-powers. Most importantly, given the results in the first turn of the election, it&#039;s very likely that, if Le Pen is elected, she&#039;ll get an unfavorable parliament, which will at least make every law she wants to pass a struggle, or perhaps even take the law-making power away from her, if the parliament is controlled by parties opposing her (i.e. most parties). <br><br>In any case, banning mosques is thoroughly unconstitutional, deportations of illegal migrants will likely happen regardless, and religious garments will most likely be banned in public (France is extremely secular to begin with).","time":1493607344,"resto":123559566,"id":"fhUMX+zK","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":123568653,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:59:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123567481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123567481<\/a><br>He&#039;s mocked as a baby faced toddler who married his mom.

Without him, with his steadfast courage and determination, the Revolution would have been betrayed by the big bourgeoisie who continually sought an accommodation with the Crown. It is no accident that Cromwell has been described as the Lenin of the English bourgeois revolution.<br>The English Revolution of 1640-60 was a great social overturn like the French Revolution of 1789. The old feudal regime was destroyed and replaced with a new capitalist social order. The Civil War was a class war which overthrew the despotism of Charles I and the reactionary feudal order that stood behind him. Parliament represented the new rising middle classes of town and country which challenged and defeated the old regime, cutting off the head of the king and abolishing the House of Lords in the process.<br>During the first part of the 17th century relations between the Crown and the bourgeoisie sharply deteriorated. Charles continually defended the Divine Right of Kings, while the Commons stood for the &#039;nation&#039;, its privileges and inherited rights. These bitter quarrels led invariably to the dissolution of parliaments and ended with the eleven-year lone rule of Charles I.<br>Charles succeeded in alienating the men of property with the imposition of taxes, forced loans and arbitrary government. Eventually the City of London went on strike and refused a loan. Meanwhile the Scottish army drove south and occupied Newcastle. Charles had no alternative but to again recall Parliament in November 1640. This was known as the Long Parliament, and sat with intermissions for the next twenty years. Within a little over a year, Parliament had split and the class struggle was carried through by Civil War. The fundamental issue was political power.<br>http:\/\/www.socialist.net\/oliver-cro<wbr>mwell-english-revolution.htm","filename":"cromwell","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":306,"tn_w":102,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492293799075,"time":1492293799,"md5":"9GR40t3pTpb2FSrAtRGS6g==","fsize":10227,"resto":121266171,"id":"QDZ3Mp2L","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121268668,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)18:04:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121268455\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121268455<\/a><br>I&#039;d also like to throw in this interview, gives you a good overview of his thoughts on various issues<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aL3<wbr>agVbX6K8","time":1492293846,"resto":121266171,"id":"ZcvgB4sg","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121268681,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)18:04:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121268452\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121268452<\/a><br>How did they find this out?","time":1492293852,"resto":121266171,"id":"k18ZUNwE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121268696,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)18:04:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121268203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121268203<\/a><br>A tan and a good camera shot can do a lot for you.","time":1492293859,"resto":121266171,"id":"2PjUv9oZ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121268698,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)18:04:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121268397\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121268397<\/a><br>Mate, I know you&#039;re trying to be edgy but you&#039;re not offending anyone.","time":1492293859,"resto":121266171,"id":"IikL7Y3A","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121268708,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)18:04:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why are council flats so soul crushingly depressing?","filename":"councilhousing","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492293861618,"time":1492293861,"md5":"14lwkR4S8fi4ayu1S9d6yw==","fsize":1640913,"resto":121266171,"id":"0Sfld6\/2","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121268768,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)18:04:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121268696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121268696<\/a><br>As well as a really sexy accent.","time":1492293893,"resto":121266171,"id":"IikL7Y3A","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121268785,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)18:05:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121268568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121268568<\/a><br>I know someone who&#039;s never hungry.

It&#039;s very obvious that <br>Renegade is behind this new &quot;group&quot; for several reasons: Firstly &quot;Blink 1488&quot; appeared at the exact time Sinead was exposed as an agent, the lyrics, genre and mindless <br>overuse of \/pol\/ memes in an attempt to slip under the jewdar, form a perfect stylographic match to her previous work. Lyrics deserve a second mention. It&#039;s not enough to <br>explain this by arguing that lyrics are bound to have strong similarities due to the subject, no, Sinead&#039;s stereotypical over application of &quot;meme speak&quot; reveals her <br>authorship every time. reemergence of the repressed: analyze the lyrics of her previous parodies and compare them with the lyrical content of &quot;RWDS Entertainment&quot;, unless<br> you are mentally obtuse you will soon begin to notice a fixation with certain sexual themes and bodily functions. What&#039;s that I hear? &quot; But W, I can&#039;t compare the lyrics<br> because Sinead deleted her older parodies, it&#039;s almost like she&#039;s trying to hide the connection!&quot; ... well isn&#039;t that an unfortunate (((coincidence))). Anyhow, lyrics<br> dealing with forced sodomy, anal rape, cuckoldry and BDSM themes feature strongly among this woman&#039;s sick and depraved Entartete Kunst.","filename":"Sinead2","ext":".jpg","w":1253,"h":708,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493613932173,"time":1493613932,"md5":"mxv9df0L\/014H\/0tHN6VUA==","fsize":126210,"resto":123579474,"id":"D1oj2ns6","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123579652,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)00:46:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"(As a side-note, pay attention to<br> the recurring motif of a woman gagged with duct tape that has not only featured regularly in her named work on Youtube and the various websites she contributes to; but<br> can be seen used as OP picture in many of the \/pol\/ threads uncredited but very obviously started by the same nu-right clique to which she belongs.

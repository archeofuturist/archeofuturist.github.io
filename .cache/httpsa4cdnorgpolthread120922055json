Entire narrative of billionaire having to work is just retarded. He is not a billionaire - he is low tier CIA homo. He is just a figurehead that follows orders. The problem is entirely elsewhere. Think of president cabinet that is about 3000-5000 strong filled with con artists, free riders, snake oil salesmen, etc.. Most of them Trump never met even once in his life. Same story was in Obongos slime house.","time":1492098200,"resto":120922055,"id":"pPO1gg7\/","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"}]}

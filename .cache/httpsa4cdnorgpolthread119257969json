Harvard&#039;s Alexander James Ingles created a system of &quot;education&quot; designed to produce a monoculture of dumbed down subhumans to be ruled over by selecte ass kissers. Harvard is creating a race mixed social elite to set an example for all the good goyim serfs to follow. Nigger and spic DNA takes to the programing much better than intelligent white people. The future will be composed of dumb, brown mongrel serfs living in a global high school.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eP9<wbr>8ZKt709A","filename":"NormieFamily","ext":".jpg","w":246,"h":205,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1491178935379,"time":1491178935,"md5":"Y2R3kbYxO25ZQFHFYKS98g==","fsize":16728,"resto":119257969,"id":"SN5j9v+8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119267223,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)20:22:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119265917\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119265917<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;200,000 Jews in Argentina <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;150,000 in Mexico and Brazil <\/span><br>Quite a few","time":1491178962,"resto":119257969,"id":"\/+LmyjcH","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":119267322,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)20:23:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119267078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119267078<\/a><br>Fuck you you fat fuck.

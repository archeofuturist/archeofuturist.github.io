Harvard&#039;s Alexander James Ingles created a system of &quot;education&quot; designed to produce a monoculture of dumbed down subhumans to be ruled over by selecte ass kissers. Harvard is creating a race mixed social elite to set an example for all the good goyim serfs to follow. Nigger and spic DNA takes to the programing much better than intelligent white people. The future will be composed of dumb, brown mongrel serfs living in a global high school.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=eP9<wbr>8ZKt709A","filename":"NormieFamily","ext":".jpg","w":246,"h":205,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1491178935379,"time":1491178935,"md5":"Y2R3kbYxO25ZQFHFYKS98g==","fsize":16728,"resto":119257969,"id":"SN5j9v+8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119267223,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)20:22:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119265917\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119265917<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;200,000 Jews in Argentina <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;150,000 in Mexico and Brazil <\/span><br>Quite a few","time":1491178962,"resto":119257969,"id":"\/+LmyjcH","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":119267322,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)20:23:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119267078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119267078<\/a><br>Fuck you you fat fuck.

Take a look at who&#039;s in them:<br><br>Gryffindor- SJWs, niggers, pakis<br>Hufflepuff - retards and autists who shouldn&#039;t even be in a highly-ranked school<br>Ravenclaw - studious house (students like cho chang) - chink nerd house<br>Slytherin - ubermensch, most succesful, outperform even the supposedly intelligent Ravenclaws, all this while their common room is a damp dark basement (literal child abuse) and they have to deal with being stereotyped as evil - basically the evil white male that the SJWs hate<br><br>Now look at the end of half the fucking movies. Slytherin leads with the points for the annual competition, right? And then Dumbledore hands over points to Gryffindor, rising them from the very bottom to the top, the points are awarded for &quot;friendship&quot; and Harry breaking the school rules.<br><br>The school literally penalised hardworking Slytherins and rewarded the degenerates that are so retarded that they can&#039;t even follow the most basic of rules like &quot;don&#039;t go there, danger&quot;.<br><br>Let me tell you about the Deatheaters. The Deatheasters, the followers of Voldemort (yet another excellent student), are just frustrated reactionaries, if the society sent my Aryan child into a fucking basement and humiliated his hard work by shitting on it, I&#039;d be trying to resurrect Voldemort as well, wouldn&#039;t you?<br><br>Oh, and I mentioned Dumbledore... JK Rowling is saying that he might be a homosexual. And that Hermione chick is a stereotypical SJW. She tried to start a House-elf revolution and when the elves told her that they like it the way it is, she gets angry at them and attacks them for not knowing whats good for them.","time":1491179082,"resto":119257969,"id":"drUtiOnO","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":119267671,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)20:27:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119267436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119267436<\/a><br>Dont be mad Croatia, just go there and dream!!","time":1491179230,"resto":119257969,"id":"+4qEXG0n","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119267873,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)20:28:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119263213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119263213<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Other tabs<\/span><br>kek","time":1491179337,"resto":119257969,"id":"\/OpZipMK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

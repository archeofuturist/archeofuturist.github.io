I will not declare beyond 50\/50 because that was as close as our election was and given the current power of the media. They will not rest or give any respite. Declaring war on our President and half the nation&#039;s elected leader day after day. <br><br>We are seeing working Americans striped of their jobs and livelihood because of &quot;incorrect&quot; opinions and political stance. There are standing groups of antifa who attack citizens of the US for using their free speech to support the elected President. <br><br>It is a crazy fucking time we live in and every day I feel we are closer and closer to some kind of breaking point. There is only so much assumed guilt or ridicule we can expect out of the opposition yet they refuse to accept their wrong doing. Over and over they claim to be correct and piss in the fact of the majority, and are ready to forcibly stop people from expressing themselves. <br><br>I have no wish to kill anyone but I feel we need something to happen. For all the unpent rage and frustration to be released so both sides can bring their all and let conflict decide the victor.","filename":"456845964","ext":".png","w":598,"h":250,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":104,"tim":1490597116387,"time":1490597116,"md5":"RAyuVsVKWJGuFLvULMBWtQ==","fsize":319102,"resto":0,"id":"2QUVxa\/+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-far-off-are-we-from-a-civil-war","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118483509,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)02:46:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"The sooner the better<br> <br>SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS","filename":"91827_Obv","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490597171693,"time":1490597171,"md5":"IpV1nvCf2jOYLbeTnygicA==","fsize":231186,"resto":118483435,"id":"pq55gIlO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

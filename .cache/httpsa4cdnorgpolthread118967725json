NYTimes, Washington Post, and everything that isn&#039;t directly connected to Russia is FAKE NEWS! We have idiot Senators in Congress on both sides of the aisle saying Putin interfered in our elections. Well yes, he hacked the DNC, Podesta, and planted stories and trolls across social media, but he only did it to help God Emperor Trump. Obviously that means Putin has our best interests in mind.","filename":"meet-the-pr-firm-that-helped-vladimir-putin-troll-the-entire-country","ext":".jpg","w":2140,"h":1605,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490907518809,"time":1490907518,"md5":"xf1U7QFEWr8a89ALATI9pQ==","fsize":119384,"resto":0,"id":"2Cu2DXNL","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-cant-cucks-just-accept-that-no-one-cares-more","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118967858,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:59:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Putin<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;billionaire<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;protests in Russia over massive corruption<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cares about American middle class!<\/span>","filename":"1490758316904","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":348,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490907586564,"time":1490907586,"md5":"RlIIuSMyL5i+cRBcA2TJCw==","fsize":30786,"resto":118967725,"id":"\/CxDZs\/u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

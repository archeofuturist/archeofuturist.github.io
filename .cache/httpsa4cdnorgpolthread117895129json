This treaty freed prisoners captured by the Russo-Anglo-American Alliance, but left 65,000 civilians (Japanese, Filipino and Russian) and two divisions of British Paratroopers (sentenced for political crimes) in Chinese incarceration, leaving them escape as the only way to freedom. The loss of the war (or rather, a negotiated peace on extremely unfavorable terms, somewhat like the Treaty of Versailles that ended World War I) left the West and Russia on the brink of anarchy.<br><br>After the collapse of national governments, a group of veterans in Aberdeen, Scotland, formed a vigilante group to stop rioting and looting. They hanged a few people (including two veterans) and decided to only allow veterans to join their committee due to a mistrust of politicians. This contingency plan became routine after a couple of generations, and this group of vigilantes originated the Terran Federation. It is expressly stated that this was never intended to be a coup d&#039;\u00e9tat and was more comparable to the Russian Revolution: one system collapsed on its own and another rose to fill its place.","filename":"Would You Like to Know More","ext":".jpg","w":162,"h":90,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1490266098557,"time":1490266098,"md5":"7Vk4jN3XouRpwKcuG2Z6lQ==","fsize":4990,"resto":117895129,"id":"JP9Fd8yl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117918081,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)06:49:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117917599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117917599<\/a><br>You bought it because of NationStates?","time":1490266184,"resto":117895129,"id":"vwPgWEBM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117918085,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)06:49:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117917393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117917393<\/a><br>how is that redpilled?","time":1490266186,"resto":117895129,"id":"vG9ig3x8","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":117918106,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)06:49:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117917970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117917970<\/a><br>The Terran Federation has a multicultural society that votes for a global leader, similar to a representative democracy. However people of higher levels of authority also have to suffer tougher repercussions of their actions: e.g. a lieutenant could hang for making a mistake that a private would merely be dismissed and maybe lashed for. Corporal and capital punishment are practiced by the government as well as spanking children being standard use amongst the population.<br><br>A &quot;History and Moral philosophy&quot; instructor in the Army says &quot;personal freedom for all is the greatest in history, laws are few, taxes are low, living standards are as high as productivity permits, crime is at its lowest ebb.&quot;<br><br>The people of the Terran Federation are either &quot;Citizens&quot; or &quot;Civilians&quot;. Everyone is born a &quot;Civilian&quot;, and at age 18 every &quot;Civilian&quot; has the right to enroll for a minimal 2-year term of &quot;Federal Service&quot;. After completing a term of Federal Service &quot;Civilians&quot; become &quot;Citizens&quot; and gain the right to vote.<br><br>In theory a completed term of Federal Service ensures a &quot;Citizen&quot; is willing to put the needs of the community before their own personal well-being. This is because Federal Service is tough and dangerous (by design). It can involve joining the military, being a human guinea pig, testing survival equipment, or manual labour. The Federation makes it quite easy to quit a term of service before completion (even during war-time), but once someone has quit they are never allowed to enroll again. This is to ensure that all volunteers are dedicated, whilst also discouraging people from leaving.","filename":"45613561583846846","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":688,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":67,"tim":1490266196425,"time":1490266196,"md5":"7ITBXbflfYKUsJBLS3R63g==","fsize":136288,"resto":117895129,"id":"JP9Fd8yl","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117918320,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)06:52:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117895129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117895129<\/a><br><br>I knew Star Wars liked ripping people off, but this is ridiculous.","filename":"serveimage[1]","ext":".jpg","w":1329,"h":622,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":58,"tim":1490266369302,"time":1490266369,"md5":"TKTLDfn0D3rjbzSNcchEjw==","fsize":686336,"resto":117895129,"id":"vrJJJai0","country":"BE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":117918336,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)06:53:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117918106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117918106<\/a><br>The Federation makes the opportunity of Federal Service open to everyone, able-bodied or not.

The doctrine that the world was created is ill advised and should be rejected. If God created the world, where was he before the creation? If you say he was transcendent then and needed no support, where is he now? How could God have made this world without any raw material? If you say that he made this first, and then the world, you are faced with an endless regression. If you declare that this raw material arose naturally you fall into another fallacy, For the whole universe might thus have been its own creator, and have arisen quite naturally. If God created the world by an act of his own will, without any raw material, then it is just his will and nothing else \u2014 and who will believe this silly nonsense? If he is ever perfect and complete, how could the will to create have arisen in him? If, on the other hand, he is not perfect, he could no more create the universe than a potter could. If he is form-less, action-less and all-embracing, how could he have created the world? Such a soul, devoid of all morality, would have no desire to create anything. If he is perfect, he does not strive for the three aims of man, so what advantage would he gain by creating the universe? If you say that he created to no purpose because it was his nature to do so, then God is pointless. If he created in some kind of sport, it was the sport of a foolish child, leading to trouble. If he created because of the karma of embodied beings [acquired in a previous creation] He is not the Almighty Lord, but subordinate to something else. If out of love for living beings and need of them he made the world, why did he not take creation wholly blissful free from misfortune? If he were transcendent he would not create, for he would be free: Nor if involved in transmigration, for then he would not be almighty.<br><br>cont.","time":1493245432,"resto":122932075,"id":"vVH7r7YW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122949424,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)18:24:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122949352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122949352<\/a><br>Thus the doctrine that the world was created by God makes no sense at all, And God commits great sin in slaying the children whom he himself created.

Know that the world is uncreated, as time itself is, without beginning or end, and is based on the principles, life and rest. Uncreated and indestructible, it endures under the compulsion of its own nature.","time":1493245462,"resto":122932075,"id":"vVH7r7YW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122949531,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)18:25:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122932075\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122932075<\/a><br>All Christians.

They inherited an immense economic boom built on the back breaking labor of the Greatest and Silent generations. They took what they were supposed to cherish and ran it into an overdrive to milk themselves every drop of wealth they could until all that was left was an overheated wreck of an economy. I think part of the reason for that was the boomers&#039; grim childhood (traumatized GI gen parents, bleak post-war economy) which they spent their adult life compensating for by accumulating money and power as much as they could. But that&#039;s all the more reason to game their system any way you can to gain the economic leverage. Once we have the control and boomers are pissing in adult diapers in retirement homes, we can get to fixing this shit. But there&#039;s no way doing that if ya&#039;ll rot at home playing shitty vidya and shitposting. Gen Z is with us, they&#039;ve grown into the current culture of worthless consumer trash and lying media and seem to instinctually know that&#039;s all bullshit.

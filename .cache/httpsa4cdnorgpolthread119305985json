Outside of Europe, they are very popular in some South American countries, notably in Argentina and Uruguay. Electronic bidet-integrated toilets, along with functions like toilet seat warmers, are commonly found in Japan.<br>In northern Europe, bidets are rare, although in Finland bidet showers are common.[7] Bidet showers are also common in South-East Asia, South Asia and parts of the Middle East.<br>In 1980, the first &quot;paperless toilet&quot; was launched in Japan by manufacturer Toto,[8] a combination of toilet and bidet which also dries the user after washing. These combination toilet-bidets (washlet) with seat warmers, or attachable bidets are particularly popular in Japan and South Korea, found in approximately 60% of households.[citation needed] They are commonly found in hotels and even some public facilities. These bidet-toilets, along with toilet seat and bidet units (to convert an existing toilet) are sold in many countries, including the United States.<br><br>MUCH LIKE INDIANS CANNOT POO IN LOO, AMERICANS SMEAR SHIT AROUND THEIR ASS WITH TOILET PAPER LIKE SUB HUMANS.<br><br>BIDETS ACTUALLY CLEAN THE ASSHOLE AND ARE VERY HYGIENIC.<br><br>I bought a bidet attachment for my toilet on amazon for $35 and it is life changing.<br><br>https:\/\/21stcentury-living.com\/2017<wbr>\/04\/02\/why-your-home-and-toilet-nee<wbr>ds-a-bidet\/","filename":"BIDETT","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":420,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1491206847097,"time":1491206847,"md5":"aH7y4ssPvPCOtER9Wghq3w==","fsize":76712,"resto":0,"id":"FHsRmORb","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"united-states-should-mandate-bidets-like-italy","country_name":"United States","replies":38,"images":5,"unique_ips":26},{"no":119306106,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)04:09:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119305985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119305985<\/a><br>It seems like it would just splash shit particles all over my ass cheeks and balls","time":1491206962,"resto":119305985,"id":"1vBit289","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119306169,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)04:10:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119306106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119306106<\/a><br><br>As long as you don&#039;t turn up the water pressure too high it does not","time":1491207024,"resto":119305985,"id":"FHsRmORb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119306525,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)04:15:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119305985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119305985<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;buy more stuff, put regulations to buy more stuff to your house<\/span><br>Nice try toilet jew.","time":1491207359,"resto":119305985,"id":"rrDPrhia","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119307168,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)04:27:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119306525\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119306525<\/a><br><br>people need to stop walking around with shitty assholes","time":1491208020,"resto":119305985,"id":"FHsRmORb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119307492,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)04:32:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"So how does it work?

Living in too sterile environment is actually bad for you. If our ancestors were caring about germs and other stuff as much as we do now, there would be no humans today.

Go google that experiment on mice and radiation. There were 3 groups of mice: no radiation, little radiation and high radiation. High radiation mice died of course, but then when they tried to kill mice from the other 2 groups, mice which were taking little radiation doses survived much longer due to their developed resistance.<br><br>Immunity to diseases works the same way. That&#039;s why there are race-specific diseases or races having varying risks of getting a disease, and why vaccines are often weakaned viruses. They are so weak your immunity system can defeat it and remember the pattern to kill it every fucking time you get infected.<br><br><a href=\"#p119307665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119307665<\/a><br>Just wipe and then wash hands.

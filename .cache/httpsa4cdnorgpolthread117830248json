For example, Id keep them in Moscow and have two completely undefended cities between me and Suleiman. However, I only had about 6 cities that I built (I didnt make any wars) and Suleiman had the largest empire and was eating up everyone else. So, then for a few turns he was basiclally giving me the &quot;youre so pathetic and weak&quot; talk that the AI always does, and I would basically answer with the &quot;pls senpai dont hurt me I just want peace :(&quot; option every time. He finally declared war on me, and i kept building more and more units in Moscow while he routed the token force I had in each of my other two cities between us, and I let him conquer and annex them, and the whole time hes cocky and laughing and talking shit oon the screen. I even sued for peace twice as part of the deception and he would just be like &quot;gtfo&quot;. The big surprise was once novograd and st. petersburg were taken, I zerged rushed his accumulated forces with cossacks. DOZENS of units descended on him and completely annihilated his forces. That same turn I bribed England (a powerful navy, neighboring Turkey) to declare war on him and a whole new front was opened against him. In one turn, the war completely BTFO out of him. Eventually he sued for peace, and since I wanted the culture victory, i only got my cities and a fuckton of resources from him for 30 turns. However his war with England wnet really abd for him since all his forces were tied up in war with me and England completly rekt him and he was left with like two cities.","time":1490231536,"resto":117830248,"id":"p35vlEFc","country":"LB","country_name":"Lebanon"},{"no":117862757,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)21:14:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117859727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117859727<\/a><br>Well, Genghis ain&#039;t peaceful.

Their idea of progressive is to accept their radical ideologies. <br><br>We aren&#039;t safe to criticism either. Our alt-right ideology consists of destroying these supposed &quot;conservative values&quot; to promote a safer world. Now I get the heuristic and false equivalency of equating the west&#039;s conservative values to the middle east&#039;s conservative values, but the end goal would be the same if the alt-right were to adopt a more moderate stance. In a way, the alt-right is more progressive.<br><br>Anyways the point is, what lead us to this fuck up? You would think the SJW&#039;s would be leading the fight in some way against the middle-east values instead of staying to iron out the little problems in the safety bubble of the west. <br>Obviously, this isn&#039;t a question directed to all of \/pol\/, as it is a collection of extreme ideologies, but towards the anons who are the brashest and loudest in killing the shitskins. <br><br>Please discuss and\/or help this OP phrase the question in a more logical way to promote further discussion.","filename":"activatesthosealmonds","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":358,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":99,"tim":1490724054598,"time":1490724054,"md5":"hDpq\/32FbEDQpMPaseb5Og==","fsize":32330,"resto":0,"id":"Vkr9mVfQ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-i-have-a-question-for-you","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118675960,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)14:07:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118675211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118675211<\/a>","time":1490724440,"resto":118675211,"id":"gHjuKJhV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118676746,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)14:14:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118675211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118675211<\/a><br>Op this may come as a surprise to you but the best way to deal with any group of people is not to generalize them into one homogenous group that all want to do one thing. <br><br>Many people think these views are poison.<br><br>Probably the most common but far from only view is this though.","filename":"KkPMwN7","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":600,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490724852262,"time":1490724852,"md5":"28U6PdzppN+SX5tJ042g1Q==","fsize":67621,"resto":118675211,"id":"VUp94NVg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

You think you can get away with putting tariffs on our lumber? Don&#039;t you fucking try us. We let you off easy in the war of 1812. Oh believe you me, us Canadians are ITCHING for a war with the USA. We will take even the smallest reason to justify us fucking ANNIHILATING your dirty fat country. There wouldn&#039;t be a square meter of American soil that has running water, electricity, or McDonalds that isn&#039;t on fire, once our airforce and navy is done bombarding your defenceless country. Then, our army boys (we&#039;d send the Quebecois and other mongrels first) would swoop in, raping your women, and killing EVERY American pig shit they see. When Canada&#039;s done with you, we will have committed acts of genocide. Of course no one is gonna do shit about it.

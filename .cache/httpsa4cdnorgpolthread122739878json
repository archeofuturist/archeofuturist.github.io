You think you can get away with putting tariffs on our lumber? Don&#039;t you fucking try us. We let you off easy in the war of 1812. Oh believe you me, us Canadians are ITCHING for a war with the USA. We will take even the smallest reason to justify us fucking ANNIHILATING your dirty fat country. There wouldn&#039;t be a square meter of American soil that has running water, electricity, or McDonalds that isn&#039;t on fire, once our airforce and navy is done bombarding your defenceless country. Then, our army boys (we&#039;d send the Quebecois and other mongrels first) would swoop in, raping your women, and killing EVERY American pig shit they see. When Canada&#039;s done with you, we will have committed acts of genocide. Of course no one is gonna do shit about it. Nothing of value will be lost.","filename":"LEAFED","ext":".jpg","w":638,"h":367,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":143,"tim":1493131035413,"time":1493131035,"md5":"MyfsQ36ci3hu8aYBFrliKg==","fsize":57458,"resto":0,"id":"a9qNUjXG","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"canada-couldnt-singlehandedlydestroy-the-usa-in-a","country_name":"Canada","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":122740434,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:42:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"fuck banning muslims, ban all leafs","time":1493131367,"resto":122739878,"id":"fjezXM9i","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122740619,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:44:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122740434\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122740434<\/a><br>they come all the way down here by the buss loads to shop at our 6% sales tax stores.

Topline figures there are CON 47%(-1), LAB 28%(+1), LDEM 9%(-1), UKIP 8%(+1), GRN 4%(+1), conducted \u201cat the end of the week\u201d. Changes are from the ICM poll at the start of the week.

It suggests that the mid-week YouGov\/Times poll was picking up the start of a trend, rather than just a blip (though given that ORB hadn\u2019t done a recent poll and Panelbase changed methods, we haven\u2019t really seen confirmation from other companies yet).<br><br>Opinium\u2019s latest poll has topline figures of CON 47%(+2), LAB 30%(+4), LDEM 8%(-3), UKIP 7%(-2) (tables here). The changes are from last weekend, though should be taken with a slight caveat \u2013 Opinium have added recalled 2015 vote to their weighting scheme. That changes means it\u2019s hard to tell whether the four point increase in Labour\u2019s support here is in line with the intriguing YouGov poll in the week, or just a result of methodology change. We\u2019ll have another YouGov poll for the Sunday Times later tonight which may shed some light.<br>UPDATE: There is also an ORB poll in the Sunday Telegraph.

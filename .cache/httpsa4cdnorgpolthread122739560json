So it&#039;s not up to you or me to judge hitler on his performance. So who were masters of the hitler? Maybe not exactly the masters. Notice hitler was a homo - check his gait, gesturing, mannerism, loved those awesome great looking pride parades, etc.. So obviously he wasn&#039;t alone. There was some sort of rainbow fight club - collective soul human centipede. I&#039;ve read somewhere that all top nazi brass was homosexual. I think it was article in NYT. They also had some sort of strange secret society called black sun or something like that. Hitler doesn&#039;t really mean that much. He is another effigy of madmen from madison avenue.

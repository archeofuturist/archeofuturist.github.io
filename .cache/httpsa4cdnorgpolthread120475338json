It is standard procedure. They sell too many tickets thinking that some people won&#039;t show up and when they do they have to offer them money to give up their seat. There are specific federal guidelines with regard to overbooking. You may be offered 4x your ticket price or 1300 dollars, whichever is less. Also if you&#039;re going to overbook, you generally stop the people from boarding the plane in the first place at the gate. Finally they offered like 400 bucks and then used the state to beat this guy&#039;s head in while he was legally in the right. They sold him a service and instead of raising the price they were willing to pay passengers for reneging on their deal in accordance with federal guidelines, they beat the shit out of a random doctor. They made a deal and United violated that deal in bad faith causing immeasurable amounts of damage to their brand and actual damage to this man and his patient&#039;s lives.

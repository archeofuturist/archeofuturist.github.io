His teachings are very clearly Jewish in origin, and yet do no reflect any recorded Jewish thought in his time period. The religion spread amongst some of the poorest and least literate people in the world, conveyed only by oral tradition. Despite this, a survey of oral tradition consistently found 4 distinct versions of the story, each of which verified most of the same events. The four versions were consistent with each other, and with themselves, despite multiple passings. The growth of the religion itself is remarkable. It follows a pattern unlike almost any other. You may say that it isn&#039;t true, but that still leaves you with a very difficult human event to try and justify.

However, the miracles of Jesus, especially his early miracles defy any known pattern of human storytelling. <br><br>Consider his turning water into wine. If you actually follow the story, you begin to realize how strange of a story it really is. As the festivities were drawing on, Mary asked Jesus to get more wine. At that point, no guests were aware that there was no more wine at all. Even Mary did not know. All they knew was that the jugs they were using were empty. Perhaps someone was counting and new that they&#039;d need to get more. It&#039;s quite possible Mary was asking Jesus to go out and buy more wine. Then Jesus went to the servants. The servants knew there was no more wine. After all, they were the ones pouring. Keep in mind, he did not speak to the servants in the main room, but in the servants&#039; quarters. He told them to pour water into the jugs, instead of wine. Let that linger in your mind. Effective slaves, told by one master to pour water, when all the guests were expecting wine. That can&#039;t possibly end well. But they can&#039;t deny his request. He commands them after all. They do as he says. Then they pour the water. But when the guests drink, they drink wine. The guests never know. It&#039;s only the servants who know. And of course, they&#039;re the only ones who aren&#039;t drunk themselves. But they are servants. They are not credible to anyone but themselves. None of the twelve, and therefore none of the four, were with Jesus at this time. If allegorical, it is a strange allegory. If literal, then how could this story of honestly spread? But it did. It must have for it to reach the ears of the 12. It must have for it to have made it into the gospel. These are collected stories after all. They predate the book. We know, because there were practitioners before the book. This is not a traditionally compelling messiah.","time":1491861024,"resto":120482057,"id":"Arf\/sl95","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120497390,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:50:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120496720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120496720<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why is a human made object in any way a comparison to the creator of the Universe?<\/span><br><br>Because I just told you that God put it there. <br>Why is this different from saying that God created the heavens and the Earth?<br><br>Why do you believe one statement when you can clearly recognize that the other is bullshit?","time":1491861031,"resto":120482057,"id":"0\/5E+P1C","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":120497430,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:50:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120495873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120495873<\/a><br>ftfy","filename":"1491860445709","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":745,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491861047458,"time":1491861047,"md5":"1nvvBId08aWL602oY6wOCg==","fsize":172370,"resto":120482057,"id":"hIRr23ZC","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120497524,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:51:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120482057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120482057<\/a><br><br> http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2015\/08\/28\/tech\/<wbr>mars-photos-alien-life\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; see picture of Mars surface with a fuzzy object that appears similar in shape to a life form or object on earth<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;THERE MUST BE INTELLIGENT LIFE ON MARS!!!!&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; consider all of known life here on earth with its complexity, beauty, and interdependency<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;It all just happened via evolution over time following a big explosion.&quot;<\/span><br><br>To deny that God designed and created everything we know is the ultimate delusion.

When the faithful are so easily turned, it makes it harder for any new belief to grow. Furthermore, the less involved people are with the physical church, the easier it is for corruption to grow. The superficial relationship most lay catholics have had with the Boston and Irish churches are a huge reason why pedophilia could run so rampant, and why guilt has become so excessive as to turn people form belief. No doubt, there were corruptions higher up in the institution that caused such distance and lack of passion, and allowed these crimes to continue, obviously such corruption protected those molestors, but the lay person is not judged on the strength of the priests. Furthermore, it&#039;s not the actions you display, but the choices you make, which are in the heart. It&#039;s not whether you went to church, by why you did or did not. Your entire universe will be taken into account. Your ending sentence is irrelevant; it&#039;s already given.

In a time of magic and general superstition, when people can die of a plethora of diseases, which are not understood in the slightest, the belief in a benevolent god is a tall order. When add in that he was a Jewish messiah, it becomes even stranger. Of course they would be compelled by the story of Jewish liberation, but Jesus version of that liberation is strange and beggars belief. The temple will fall; don&#039;t trust the pharisees; reach out to people of other faiths, and treat them as your brothers and sisters--that&#039;s all fine and good as a doomsday prophecy, but as salvation? I don&#039;t think so. Look at how people behave today. Look at the stories we tell. Simply look at the stories of Superman! That is our picture of a messiah. He doesn&#039;t look a thing like Jesus.

I&#039;m not denying the corruption. No honest person does. And the church has always struggled with corruption. After all, if you believe the gospels, there is real evil in the world, and it has agency. What more could it want then, to destroy the church. But it remains. Because it&#039;s simple structure is perfect for such a two sided fight over power. The church is a maze of ambition, incompetence, and faith. It&#039;s purpose is not to be an example for men, but to be a safeguard of the dogma. The winding halls of the vatican are effectively impassible to evil. Not that no one in the vatican can commit evil, but rather it is effectively impossible for evil to touch matters of faith. It is tremendously difficult for church teaching to be altered. Furthermore, when the corruption gets too great, the institution is weakened; it loses power and stature in the world. This makes it less of a target of evil, because evil has less to gain. Then the church undergoes a reformation. Without its broad influence, the evil within the church shrivels and starves. Faith returns.<br><br>The last sentence is given, because it&#039;s an effectively moot point. If someone is out of the reach of the church, it is the fault of the church, not of that person. This has been considered since the beginning. Jesus did not say heaven was closed to all but those who believed, and no pope has said so either. That means whether others can get in or not doesn&#039;t matter. It doesn&#039;t change what we should do, or how we behave. Because even if it&#039;s possible, it&#039;s not probable.

These stories were competing with innumerable other myths, legends, philosophies, magics, &quot;sciences&quot;, medicines, and so forth? Out of everything that was believed in 200 A.D., how did Christianity survive? Especially as it did? For one thing, it worked. And that&#039;s particularly remarkable. Because according to just about every other thought at the time, it shouldn&#039;t have. And as we can now see with all the communist countries, and with fascism, when you just take certain elements out, and strip the religiosity, it fails terribly. As you&#039;d expect when you take an honest look at human behavior. So, yes, I have a harder time believing that a series of lies accomplished this. It doesn&#039;t stand to reason.

Major breakthroughs in human organization and information sharing were made by and for the church. The church revolutionized law, and the concepts it taught, revolutionized it again under the British. The Roman empire failed, and only christianity survived.

It is clear how the instinct of hunger leads a predator to stalk its prey, then to kill it, then to eat it. But humans, in learning to hunt, are taught how to track animals (our natural senses cannot do this, like the eyes of a hawk, or the tongue of a snake), how to make tools to hunt with, how to use those tools, how to set traps, what strategies to use based on the conditions, how much food is needed for what sized group, what parts of an animal constitute food, how should that food be prepared (because it cannot be eaten raw), how far can one travel in chase of food before you have gone too far, how do you anticipate where food will be\/ where will you search. None of this survives as instinct for humans. It is conscious. It is only learned by some language, or semi-structured communication. This is a full understanding of what is &quot;proper&quot;. And because it is known, not just understood in instinct, it can be thought about, it can be protected, it can be changed, it can be improved.

It is a superstructure that connects us, and it does it through conscious knowledge across time and space. Animals are only connected by direct relationship.

His teachings are very clearly Jewish in origin, and yet do no reflect any recorded Jewish thought in his time period. The religion spread amongst some of the poorest and least literate people in the world, conveyed only by oral tradition. Despite this, a survey of oral tradition consistently found 4 distinct versions of the story, each of which verified most of the same events. The four versions were consistent with each other, and with themselves, despite multiple passings. The growth of the religion itself is remarkable. It follows a pattern unlike almost any other. You may say that it isn&#039;t true, but that still leaves you with a very difficult human event to try and justify.

However, the miracles of Jesus, especially his early miracles defy any known pattern of human storytelling. <br><br>Consider his turning water into wine. If you actually follow the story, you begin to realize how strange of a story it really is. As the festivities were drawing on, Mary asked Jesus to get more wine. At that point, no guests were aware that there was no more wine at all. Even Mary did not know. All they knew was that the jugs they were using were empty. Perhaps someone was counting and new that they&#039;d need to get more. It&#039;s quite possible Mary was asking Jesus to go out and buy more wine. Then Jesus went to the servants. The servants knew there was no more wine. After all, they were the ones pouring. Keep in mind, he did not speak to the servants in the main room, but in the servants&#039; quarters. He told them to pour water into the jugs, instead of wine. Let that linger in your mind. Effective slaves, told by one master to pour water, when all the guests were expecting wine. That can&#039;t possibly end well. But they can&#039;t deny his request. He commands them after all. They do as he says. Then they pour the water. But when the guests drink, they drink wine. The guests never know. It&#039;s only the servants who know. And of course, they&#039;re the only ones who aren&#039;t drunk themselves. But they are servants. They are not credible to anyone but themselves. None of the twelve, and therefore none of the four, were with Jesus at this time. If allegorical, it is a strange allegory. If literal, then how could this story of honestly spread? But it did. It must have for it to reach the ears of the 12. It must have for it to have made it into the gospel. These are collected stories after all. They predate the book. We know, because there were practitioners before the book. This is not a traditionally compelling messiah.","time":1491861024,"resto":120482057,"id":"Arf\/sl95","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120497390,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:50:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120496720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120496720<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why is a human made object in any way a comparison to the creator of the Universe?<\/span><br><br>Because I just told you that God put it there. <br>Why is this different from saying that God created the heavens and the Earth?<br><br>Why do you believe one statement when you can clearly recognize that the other is bullshit?","time":1491861031,"resto":120482057,"id":"0\/5E+P1C","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":120497430,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:50:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120495873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120495873<\/a><br>ftfy","filename":"1491860445709","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":745,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491861047458,"time":1491861047,"md5":"1nvvBId08aWL602oY6wOCg==","fsize":172370,"resto":120482057,"id":"hIRr23ZC","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120497524,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:51:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120482057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120482057<\/a><br><br> http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2015\/08\/28\/tech\/<wbr>mars-photos-alien-life\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; see picture of Mars surface with a fuzzy object that appears similar in shape to a life form or object on earth<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;THERE MUST BE INTELLIGENT LIFE ON MARS!!!!&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; consider all of known life here on earth with its complexity, beauty, and interdependency<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;It all just happened via evolution over time following a big explosion.&quot;<\/span><br><br>To deny that God designed and created everything we know is the ultimate delusion.

When the faithful are so easily turned, it makes it harder for any new belief to grow. Furthermore, the less involved people are with the physical church, the easier it is for corruption to grow. The superficial relationship most lay catholics have had with the Boston and Irish churches are a huge reason why pedophilia could run so rampant, and why guilt has become so excessive as to turn people form belief. No doubt, there were corruptions higher up in the institution that caused such distance and lack of passion, and allowed these crimes to continue, obviously such corruption protected those molestors, but the lay person is not judged on the strength of the priests. Furthermore, it&#039;s not the actions you display, but the choices you make, which are in the heart. It&#039;s not whether you went to church, by why you did or did not. Your entire universe will be taken into account. Your ending sentence is irrelevant; it&#039;s already given. We can&#039;t be certain, but the salvation of the ignorant has been supported within the theology since the beginning, even if not universally agreed upon. No pope has refuted its possibility.","time":1491861409,"resto":120482057,"id":"Arf\/sl95","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120498415,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:57:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120497524\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120497524<\/a><br>Watches don&#039;t self-replicate and mutate","time":1491861430,"resto":120482057,"id":"\/BfNqpGK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120498518,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:57:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120497708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120497708<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;never have to articulate my own arguments<\/span><br>Here&#039;s a couple of argument for you:<br>1) No one is watching over us (well, besides some other humans). <br>2) There is no soul, there is no life after death for an individual.","time":1491861471,"resto":120482057,"id":"BUAj6y2N","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120498593,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:58:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120496472\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120496472<\/a><br>Why can&#039;t there?

The story itself is rather boring, and the character of Jesus is unlike any other messiah or hero archetype ever encountered. His teachings are very clearly Jewish in origin, and yet do no reflect any recorded Jewish thought in his time period. The religion spread amongst some of the poorest and least literate people in the world, conveyed only by oral tradition. Despite this, a survey of oral tradition consistently found 4 distinct versions of the story, each of which verified most of the same events. The four versions were consistent with each other, and with themselves, despite multiple passings. The growth of the religion itself is remarkable. It follows a pattern unlike almost any other. You may say that it isn&#039;t true, but that still leaves you with a very difficult human event to try and justify. The fact is, Christian teaching, based on basic and primal human behavior, shouldn&#039;t have become popular. It is antithetical to almost all known created belief systems. It shouldn&#039;t exist, but it does.","time":1491859787,"resto":120482057,"id":"Arf\/sl95","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

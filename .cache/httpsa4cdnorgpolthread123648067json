Now there are multiple popular tv shows about people selling their houses and paying someone else to build a tiny house for them. Occasional it&#039;ll be a couple with no kids with a legitimate reason for wanting a small house on wheels, but most of the time they have 3 kids and end up paying the same as what you would pay for a full sized home. The rooms built for the kids are usually just big enough for the kids at the time of building and don&#039;t take into consideration how fast kids grow. They even have episodes where people get new tiny houses built because the old ones were too small.

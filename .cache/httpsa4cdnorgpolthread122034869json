Like any person actually has the brain capacity to comprehend what 900.000 people in one place looks like. In reality it looks like pic related.<br>According to wikipedia and as far as I remember, every single one was buried until orders were given from Himmler or something that they were to be dug up and then burned. They used wooden pallets which is well known to not burn hot enough to turn bone into ash (it&#039;s a common method of cremation in india, and require like 2 hundreds kilos of wood for just 1 person) which not even modern cremation ovens can do. It requires a totally different process that takes a few minutes aswell.<br>And all of this was done in an area comparable to the two fucking cornfields down my road.","filename":"1 million people gathering","ext":".jpg","w":962,"h":396,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":51,"tim":1492719239035,"time":1492719239,"md5":"XA6KPVQ5972oTvzjt3SYpQ==","fsize":157391,"resto":122034869,"id":"AcX1Esvb","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":122037130,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:16:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nobody was murdered or cremated at Treblinka, it was a camp ground for war refugees.","time":1492719396,"resto":122034869,"id":"pmr95xgK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122037405,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:18:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122037130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122037130<\/a><br>it is categorized as an extermination camp where anywhere from &quot;at least 700.000&quot; people (early West german estimates) to 3 million (soviet estimates) were gassed.","time":1492719506,"resto":122034869,"id":"AcX1Esvb","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":122037716,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:20:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122034869\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122034869<\/a><br>Remember goyim<br><br>Assad personally gassed and barrelbombed over 500.000 innocents already and these numbers are increasing faster than people die in Syria in general.","time":1492719634,"resto":122034869,"id":"osvvFiXy","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122037909,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:21:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;See this recreation<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;recreation<\/span><br><br>Implying.","time":1492719714,"resto":122034869,"id":"XqNImXze","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122038577,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:26:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122034869\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122034869<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How can you question the Holocaust \/pol\/?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;See this recreation<\/span>","filename":"1466821942947","ext":".png","w":480,"h":260,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":67,"tim":1492719995967,"time":1492719995,"md5":"J3PYhHrF+pQrvbL3uXYgsQ==","fsize":202802,"resto":122034869,"id":"j\/05sJ2i","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122038665,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:27:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122034869\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122034869<\/a><br>Give a man food<br>Give a man a home.<br>Give a man a job.<br>Give a man a ride to work.<br>And this is how he repays you.<br>With jewish lies.<br>Sometimes I wish the holocaust did happen.<br>They certainly deserve it","filename":"glory of gods","ext":".jpg","w":912,"h":1140,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492720035458,"time":1492720035,"md5":"J4lVmOqk3yrfQAd\/NWC43w==","fsize":255588,"resto":122034869,"id":"M6cOZXQs","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122039079,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:30:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122037405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122037405<\/a><br>Pretty sure it was just a summer camp and they did plays and arts and crafts.

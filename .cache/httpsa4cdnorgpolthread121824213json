There are many people that were &quot;full&quot; part time workers (AKA workers the company cheeped out on and didn&#039;t want to give benefits to) and ACA requires employers offered &quot;minimum care&quot; (or some term like that) to workers and so instead companies just cut their hours. <br><br>When you put more and more risk on your employees rather than the employer with things such as changing defined benefit plans over to defined contribution and also require them to be more flexible to pick up random shifts and such problems just compound. <br><br>Actual full-time employees have a little bit different reasons for not having money and those would commonly be: poor financial knowledge, (most people have no clue about anything financial) bad spending habits that got them into massive debt that is basically impossible to get out of. Or more than likely debt that was involuntary that now they can&#039;t get out of such as medical debt and student loans.<br><br>The way to beat those benchmarks ($1k in savings) in many cases as a family essentially boils down to find a good paying job (which isn&#039;t always possible) or have both parents work.","time":1492607805,"resto":121824213,"id":"yeM\/\/sOE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121842826,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:17:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121824403\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121824403<\/a><br>daniel","time":1492607867,"resto":121824213,"id":"GwrJvc2Q","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121842967,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:19:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121842566\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121842566<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I try to keep around 5k in my checking.

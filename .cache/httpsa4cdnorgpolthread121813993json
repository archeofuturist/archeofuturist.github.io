Dealing with problems with violence rather than reason, debate, thought, and rhetoric.<br>* No freedom of speech.<br>* No independent, critical, or philosophical thought, morality is whatever Mohammad said.<br>* General hatred of philosophy.<br>* Wanting things or supporting them not because they are good and you have thought it through, but because it&#039;s the Islamic thing to do. i.e. Shari-ah or the Caliphate. Both of these would make the world a horrible place, but don&#039;t expect Muslims to put any thought into that.<br>* Discouraging people from having any critical thought by claiming that they are not scholars. The scholars are mostly idiots with immoral opinions.<br>* Using ad-hominem attacks, slander, and libel to shut down debate.<br>* Mentally deficient ways of dealing with real-world problems by becoming more religious and praying.<br>* Obsessions with how the Prophet cut his nails and did other things, like come the fuck on.<br>* Need to control people&#039;s appearance.<br>* Blatant racism on every side.<br>* In conflict with everyone at their borders whether Muslims or not, historically and in contemporary terms. Like can any of your fuckers make any friends and get along?<br>* Hatred of pretty much everyone.<br>* No interest in getting along and being functional in the West.<br>* Always feeling like you don&#039;t belong.<br>* Total lack of leadership, not one idiot in this whole civilization that I am proud of.","time":1492583910,"resto":121813993,"id":"YhTS1Ndj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121814527,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)02:39:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121814485\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121814485<\/a><br>* Wasting time doing useless shit. Wasting time learning to read Arabic without understanding what you are reading.<br>* Islam as a brand is now shit. Failure to manage the Islamic brand<br>* Weird obsessions about everyone, especially the behavior of other people and your children.<br>* Obsessions with death rather than life. Obsessions with the so-called &quot;afterlife&quot;.<br>* Always deflecting criticism by saying that&#039;s not Islam, that&#039;s the people -- they are two sides of the same fucking coin. Islam makes the people by giving them bad advice. People are already insane, Islam makes them more insane.<br>* Always obsessing about other people&#039;s social problems while totally failing to address any of your own.<br>* Mentally deficient attitude towards girls and boys mingling.<br>* Mentally deficient attitude towards having children and raising them properly.<br>* &quot;Islamic science&quot;. There is one fucking science, Islam has nothing to do with it.<br>* For the vast majority of Muslims, reading the words of the Quran and not knowing what the fuck you are reading.<br>* Memorizing the sounds of the Quran and thinking it&#039;s a big accomplishment.<br>* Can&#039;t eat most things, have to eat magical halal meat. More reasons to feel socially isolated.<br>* Work to destroy independence and agency in children, obsessed with controlling their behavior so they will be good Muslims.<br>* Hypocrisy everywhere.<br>* Obsession with politics of distant lands, little or no interest in local politics.<br>* Giving money to distant causes and people, not worrying about your own community.<br>* Building more and more mosques for no good reason. All that&#039;s going to do is get more zombies to pray to a god that doesn&#039;t exist and will do nothing for you.<br>* Building schools with Islamic curriculum for children to make them even more socially isolated from society<br>* In-fighting in every venue of leadership, no group cohesion while at the same time insisting on the solidarity of the Ummah, there is no solidarity whatsoever and there is no Ummah","time":1492583945,"resto":121813993,"id":"YhTS1Ndj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121814550,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)02:39:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121814527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121814527<\/a><br>* False idealizations and propaganda about of home country.<br>* Past oriented thinking and obsessions with the past, always wanting to return to the past, no concern for the present or the future.<br>* Always looking enviously upon other more successful races, while at the same time doing nothing productive to further your own success, the success of your children, or the success of your people.

Not how can we make the lives of the Palestinians or the Kashmiris better, but how can we get rid of Israel or India.<br>* Obsession with sexual purity, while it makes little difference in the real world. Prostitutes have children just like pious Muslims do. Having a few partners before you get married again makes little difference in life.<br>* Obsession with ritual purity which again makes little difference.

Every major conspiracy theory has at least gotten some focus. So I decided, just this past Monday, 4\/10, that I would look at the &quot;stupidest&quot; red-pill I could find, and naturally it wasn&#039;t even a question...there was no second option....I decided to research the flat earth theory.<br><br>Just like all of you, I have seen snippets of this madness but I deemed it too ludicrous to consider. I may have even been able to flip a coin on the actuality of the moon landing, but even with that doubt, I never considered that the earth was flat and that we were being lied to . Hell, what would the purpose be for the lie.<br><br>I am a Bible-believing Christian, which is even more absurd that I would hold so fast to the heliocentric model when the scripture is full of one-sided flat earthedness.<br><br>I fully believe that people who believe they see aliens or that have been abducted are really dealing with fallen angels and demons and STILL I laughed at the possibility of the flat earth. But don&#039;t you see, the enemy HAD to make us believe in a limitless universe if they were going to extend the lie and &quot;return as our alien father&#039;s that seeded the earth with out evolutionary ancestors.&quot; How could beings from another planet be our gods if there were no planets, only different stars and celestial bodies of the same design.<br><br>My life has changed this week. And all glory belongs to the Father and to our Lord Yeshua ha Mashiach. I beg you all to look with open eyes and open hearts to this ridiculous notion. One thing this pill has shown me is that time is much shorter than I thought. When independent men start to learn and present the truth of our home, the enemy will have no choice but to speed up their end game.","filename":"Map Sun Moon flat earth","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492231129112,"time":1492231129,"md5":"\/jHCcRk\/fRn7FNSZFHDzRQ==","fsize":49208,"resto":0,"id":"ib13XXrZ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"in-5-days-i-went-from-scorn-to-reborn","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":4,"unique_ips":4},{"no":121170572,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:39:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121170474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121170474<\/a><br>refute this or eat shit","filename":"IMG_0398","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":569,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492231189688,"time":1492231189,"md5":"X25Y2xWsxqtL3m0NOOtKFw==","fsize":75385,"resto":121170474,"id":"rrOW29Rs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121170680,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:40:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121170572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121170572<\/a><br>that is a telescope<br><br>fucking phone posters","time":1492231258,"resto":121170474,"id":"VpvPr1eB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121171044,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:44:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121170474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121170474<\/a><br>I have been in several threads of this genre in the last year and I didn&#039;t understand the LARPing.

Now we hear the truth directly from obamas mouth and know that we were presented with an extremely altered version of who he is.","filename":"BBD0939B-1031-4A68-A16B-5D9341F72577-1210-0000016069D381B4","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":380,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":149,"tim":1493906002566,"time":1493906002,"md5":"YQd40jCmLqMfJHuj4vyGJw==","fsize":35615,"resto":0,"id":"FC7RNtA\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-amazing-how-news-of-obamas-gay-sex-endeavors","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":124063275,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:11:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124061752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124061752<\/a><br>No. Obama&#039;s gay stuff came out right when he was a candidate.

There is no way they would allow their magic negro to fall victim to truth and reality. The far left media saw a narrative they enjoyed, and so they embellished it. The far left media felt it was time to have the first black president, and they didn&#039;t care what the population thought about that. The far left media believes they know better than the population. The far left media believe it is their job to produce the outcome they believe is the best outcome, if is the majority of the population disagrees. The U.S. media has gotten away with social engineering for so many decades that they didn&#039;t know how to deal with Donald Trump who opened the eyes and minds of the U.S. people to the far left propaganda coming from the far left media. The far left U.S. media tried its hardest to produce the first woman president. All we heard right up until the night of the election is how Trump had no chance, that Hillary had a 98.5% chance to win the election. The far left media are shameless liars, and now the people have become aware of their tactics.","time":1493907916,"resto":124061752,"id":"hFdeHOoW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

His minions from TDS will shill for &quot;d&#039;nations&quot; and make some shekels. He likes to mock simple country folk, but he&#039;s suddenly pleading for them to show up. He wants a big scene. I&#039;d go, but fuck him and his shills shitting up these threads. I used to like him, but his whole, &quot;fuck dumb American rednecks and fuck drumpf&quot; deal is annoying as fuck.","time":1492449297,"resto":121549168,"id":"yjVLK5wH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Meanwhile, every state, no matter how tiny and\/or useless, gets 2 senators. These systems were put in place to make sure that a handful of highly populous states couldn&#039;t completely negate a large majority of states in politics.

When someone voted for a candidate, they weren&#039;t voting directly for the candidate themselves. Instead, we vote for who OUR STATE should vote for. Our state then gives the candidate with the most votes their electoral votes (again allotted based on population).<br><br>That means 51% of New York is worth the same as 99% of New York.

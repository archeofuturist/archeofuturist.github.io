The state has a goal, which is to protect civil society from itx external enemies and its internal disorders. It cannot be merely the &#039;night watchman state&#039; advocated by Robert Nozick, since civil society depends upon attachments that must be renewed and, in modern circumstances, these attachments cannot be renewed without the collective provision of welfare. On the other hand, the state cannot be the universal provider and regulator advocated by the egalitarians, since value and commitment emerge from autonomous associations, which flourish only if they can grow from below. Moreover, the state can redistribute wealth only if wealth is created, and wealth is created by those who expect a share.","filename":"roger-scruton","ext":".jpg","w":460,"h":386,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1490719117107,"time":1490719117,"md5":"PEhXk1a32SwXGuOnNY7DoQ==","fsize":23686,"resto":118664929,"id":"WcdPrrUo","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118666537,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:38:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118666069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118666069<\/a><br>Said who?<br> <a href=\"#p118666095\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118666095<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The English capital is less than 50% white <\/span><br>Oh sure we are the cucks","time":1490719138,"resto":118664929,"id":"PPoH0EOG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118666554,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:39:08","name":"Rightly So","com":"<a href=\"#p118666441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118666441<\/a><br>Haha, this is fantastic.<br><br>It is going to be exponentially more funny seeing the Scottish nationalists get BTFO the second time.","time":1490719148,"resto":118664929,"id":"Q\/\/fg4xO","country":"GB","trip":"!!sD6h8LgcbfU","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118666566,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:39:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118666123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118666123<\/a><br>ya got me there ,but I&#039;d argue was a much more effective ruler than Albert.","filename":"1488034838272","ext":".png","w":577,"h":509,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1490719152861,"time":1490719152,"md5":"+INlAyHDjHS8Llz3O64c2w==","fsize":218913,"resto":118664929,"id":"XnVsL9Xq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118666622,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:39:48","name":"Rightly So","com":"<a href=\"#p118666454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118666454<\/a><br>We are all British.

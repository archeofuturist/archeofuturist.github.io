Yes I know you already knew that and that its super fucking obvious, but for HIM its going to be the most frustrating thing; trying different methods over and over waiting for something to stick. He WILL relapse, and it won&#039;t be the end of the world (hopefully, i knew this one guy who drank for the first time in three years and threw himself off a bridge for it, from what we heard he didnt even have that much). It is an ongoing process, and he will never finish it. If he wants it enough he will find something that works best for him and you can only hope he clings to it. <br><br>There are honestly no solutions to quitting, just theories. Gotta try as many as possible in as many ways as he can think of.<br><br>The other, and even more important thing is something to say to YOU, and its another obvious one but you HAVE to remember it. You cant ever save him. You probably cant really even help him. You can offer yourself and your knowledge for him to lean on and use, but you will never be able to fix it for him, not in the slightest fucking way. Offer yourself as much as you care to, as many times as you can afford to, but you cannot help an addict. It will always be there passion, dedication, and reasoning that prevails. The self-manipulation that twists within the mind is mightier than the hand of God, and you, with your well meaning and good intentions are naught before it. Again, offer what you can, as much as you care to.","filename":"bKxpOW7","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1040,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":67,"tim":1493105672903,"time":1493105672,"md5":"HhDaIadpHAg1MFRNCjvG+Q==","fsize":186011,"resto":122705924,"id":"7YKUbuuM","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122708676,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)03:35:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"Just drink it all away...things won&#039;t get better, ever.

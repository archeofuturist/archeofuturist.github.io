Some immigrants do integrate, but a portion of them don&#039;t and they live in self segregated communities. <br><br>If we keep letting in more immigrants, sure we&#039;ll get some more who integrate, but the self segregated communities will only grow. <br><br>We can&#039;t have communities of other cultures who for what ever reason feel isolated and have no prospects. It doesn&#039;t matter if the reason they feel isolated is our own fault, if they are isolated they will grow resentful and they&#039;ll become pockets of the countries they left inside our countries.<br><br>If these pockets just keep growing it will only increase the problems we&#039;ve been seeing.<br><br>Just figuring out who to blame for this problem won&#039;t solve it, we need to prevent these pockets from growing for the good of our countries, and the good of the potential immigrants who would otherwise be stuck in a country that hates them.<br><br>We can figure out alternative solutions to the problems immigrations solves. If we need to keep our populations from declining we can figure out ways to increase the birth rate.<br><br>Once every country is developed we won&#039;t be able to rely on immigration anyway. We need to figure out how to get developed countries to have natural population growth before every country is developed and the world population starts shrinking. <br><br>For the good of the world we need to end this.","filename":"redpillblues","ext":".jpg","w":890,"h":876,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":246,"tim":1491393482369,"time":1491393482,"md5":"6xwIHcC2WIrfQ2Gu2RiaNg==","fsize":109429,"resto":0,"id":"rnDmKPNl","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"liberal-appeal-to-stop-mass-immigration","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

I dont mind that that they believe in a big happening and everyone who like Jehova or Yahweh gets to heaven , it&#039;s just that they are so shilly and cult like. Weird rules like the blood transfusion which comes from the jewish Kosher code which forbids eating blood , so they can&#039;t get blood transfusions because it wouldn&#039;t be Kosher? Also they don&#039;t practice any holidays , Christmas because the pagan sun god&#039;s day was on the 25th so they can not celebrate it and say that we don&#039;t know when Jesus was actually born , around September I&#039;ve heard from them. They are very globalist\/pacifist. They will not fight for their countries , they are just a tad better that the refugees. They are very smug about it as well like &quot;Jesus talked about love and the 5th commandment brother&quot; , also they call their other members brothers and sisters which is kinda weird. I don&#039;t hate them , but I won&#039;t like them for their religion either","time":1491843611,"resto":120456980,"id":"WPvNxWfA","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120459044,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:04:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120458573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120458573<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They will not fight for their countries<\/span><br>This one of the parts that bothers me.

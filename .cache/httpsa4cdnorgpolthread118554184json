Huma was emailing her information about Provigil, a medication used for all sorts of things, but most of all used to prevent fatigue. It is used off label for Parkinson&#039;s and Alzheimer&#039;s, which is where Cernovich made the connection. Thernovich is laughably sketchy and I don&#039;t like him or watch his content, but he did pretty well on 60 minutes and he isn&#039;t as terrible as David Seaman. Then again that isn&#039;t saying much!","time":1490645701,"resto":118554184,"id":"T3QRAuMX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

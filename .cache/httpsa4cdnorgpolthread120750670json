Of course they were Christian scientists, their society expected it. Maybe people like you wouldn&#039;t have taken their scientific work as seriously if the atheist scientists had been honest about their beliefs. I can gaurantee you, if the general public of the time knew that Einstein thought the Bible was &quot;the most childish superstition&quot;, his work would have been shunned or dismissed in many places around the world. Oh, what a blessing the Christian values of credulity and faith have been to our doubt-based science system...

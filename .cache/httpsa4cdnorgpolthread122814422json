I brought it up with my friends and told them the whole thing, except I left out any &#039;sides&#039;. Soon my friends were talking about the bike lock professor and being like thats pretty bad and one asked who was he fighting and I was like &quot;lol fighting haters does it matter he was using violence and thats wrong&quot;. Ideology gives weak people an excuse to not listen or engage in discussion because they think they have already defeated you. Just talk of individual actions - cuz really thats all there is - some &quot;leftists&quot; are all right and some &quot;rightists&quot; are all right. Theres a strong argument to be made that we are all centrists with a few loud insane people on the fringe of each side. So bring morality down to individual action, not to whether your on red team or blue team. But also dude whenever talking with normies about this every hit needs to be a swipe - no time for dillydallying, get your point out there strongly like a blitzkreig and dont let them down - if you have nothing clever to rebutt with then ask questions, always ask questions - if they cant explain to you why your wrong then maybe your not wrong.","time":1493167234,"resto":122814422,"id":"em34CE55","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122815180,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)20:41:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Tell her le truth and let her escort her self out of your life.

While it is true, the reason the system still perpetuates is because very few people end up understanding what \u201cmoney and corporations\u201d really mean. Lack of knowledge, and shame for even entertaining the idea of the real answer are two important reasons. Any good Youtube-video on the JQ gets blocked in all of mainland Europe, and you know that swallowing the redpill isn\u2019t exactly pleasant; threads about how \/pol\/ ruined someones life (depression, alienation) are not uncommon.<br><br>Some people are redpilled to the point where they agree that Jews have an enormously disproportionate influence, but at the same time are so incredibly bluepilled that they don\u2019t see a problem with that. \u201cThey\u2019re just smart and hardworking\u201d they say naively, thinking Jews have maintained their powerful positions by virtuous means.<br><br>The reason for this naivety is that whites are seldom racially aware, while other races see everything through a racial lense. Blacks tend to be more vocal (and violent) about it, but the fact that \u201cJewish\u201d is still a distinct ethnicity, despite them living among Europeans for thousands of years, proves the point. They have an extreme preference for their own kind, so extreme that at its worst it causes the death of millions of people, and at its best they subvert a nation to hate itself.","filename":"Le+_482f0157c9772bb0fc6b55923695d3f0","ext":".png","w":274,"h":242,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":220,"tim":1491187363636,"time":1491187363,"md5":"e1sQ5gU2XQ7U68tKS4JDMQ==","fsize":17720,"resto":0,"id":"CFIO+uV+","country":"NO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gonna-deliver-this-essay-on-the-jews-to-college","country_name":"Norway","replies":11,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":119280703,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)22:43:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"The former is what began during the Russian Revolution of 1917, when a group of Jewish communists (Bolsheviks) started and won a civil war, eventually leading to the formation of the Soviet Union 5 years later. However, the Bolsheviks didn\u2019t consider this a victory, because the goal of communism in Russia \u201cwould not be realized without a world revolution\u201d, in (((Leon Trotsky\u2019s))) own words. The Bolsheviks are responsible for the death of tens of millions, by civil war, famine created by the government, and people being worked to death in labor camps. <br><br>A year later, in 1918, Jews would attempt to bring this to Germany, probably as an effort to form a communist state composed of Germany, Russia, and every country in-between (and eventually, the whole world). In 1919, Bavaria in Germany was declared a Soviet state for a months time. Thankfully the communists were defeated. <br><br>So what do these revolutions have to do with Jewish supremacy and in-group loyalty? These Jews were not communists for the same reasons the useful idiots of today are; the latter lean that way because they\u2019re naive and stupidly think communism is the answer to poverty and other ills in society. The Jews however were communists because they wanted control. But by the 1960s they realized that communism was not a feasible goal. However, an other system of control that is almost as easy to manage are capitalism and \u201cdemocracy\u201d.","time":1491187432,"resto":119280572,"id":"CFIO+uV+","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119280743,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)22:44:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"When a country\u2019s banks and media are controlled by a small religious and ethnic group that accounts for 2% of the population, that is not democracy.

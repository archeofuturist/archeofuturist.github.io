He thought being President would be just as easy as being CEO ... which for him means someone else would do the hard work, and he&#039;d slap his name on the end result.<br>He really doesn&#039;t know what goes into the empires that he&#039;s run. He doesn&#039;t know how to build buildings. He doesn&#039;t know how to get permits. He doesn&#039;t know how to hire contractors.<br>He doesn&#039;t know how to write a script for TV, or what a real executive producer does. He doesn&#039;t know how to educate people, or how to write a book. He isn&#039;t a cattle rancher or a textiles manufacturer.<br>He&#039;s a name. A name and a suit and a hairpiece. His only advantages in life are his family fortune and the fact that a lot of Americans currently find blowhard assholes entertaining. If he had to work for a living, he would be fucked.<br>Trump doesn&#039;t know how to be President, either. He doesn&#039;t know how the government works. He doesn&#039;t know the limits of his powers, or why a Judge on &quot;some island in the Pacific&quot; can just tell him &quot;no.&quot; He doesn&#039;t understand why a one-page list of bullets isn&#039;t a real tax plan, or why people laugh at him when he presents it.<br>He doesn&#039;t know, but there&#039;s noone to do the hard work for him. This is uncharted territory for Donald Trump ... he actually has responsibilities.<br>So he&#039;s scared and lonely and angry, and he reacts to that the way any manchild would. He mashes his red button, summoning a manservant with an icy cold soda pop, and then he sulks off to the living room to play video games. It&#039;s just that for Trump, the &quot;living room&quot; is a million dollar resort, and &quot;video games&quot; are &quot;golf and classified discussions held in public settings.&quot;","time":1493536649,"resto":123450115,"id":"pNgJHjZa","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

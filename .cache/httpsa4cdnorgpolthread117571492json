I&#039;m Germany because I&#039;m secretly a national socialist. We&#039;re loading up the game and my brother is talking to my gf about this new Van Gough biography he is reading. I guess Van Gough had a pretty shitty art life, and he was only famous after he died so he never got to see real success. Since I&#039;m always hiding my power level I ask my gf &quot;did the nazis ever make any art? Or were they just burning everything?&quot; That&#039;s when my gf unknowingly made me love Hitler even more. She goes, &quot;actually, Hitler was trying to SAVE the art! He only threatened to destroy it when he was losing.&quot; My gf is by no means red pilled. She&#039;s a cut above the average woman or else she wouldn&#039;t be my gf, but for instance she says she regrets\/feels bad for voting for trump. I like talking to her about history because her art perspective gives me neat perspectives into things. She was the last person i expected to learn something cool about Hitler from for sure.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ITT post the art Hitler tried to save<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ITT discuss lesser known good things Hitler did<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ITT we discuss Hitler&#039;s good side<\/span>","filename":"42F94EB1-1EBB-4B88-ABD4-133AB9FF71B1-2392-000001EE06FE6ADB","ext":".jpg","w":744,"h":924,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490062194838,"time":1490062194,"md5":"HXwj2YpMMkELf6R6ZliKTQ==","fsize":320798,"resto":0,"id":"\/T2dblgG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"european-art","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":117571666,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)22:11:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is too long and gay to read.

I&#039;m Germany because I&#039;m secretly a national socialist. We&#039;re loading up the game and my brother is talking to my gf about this new Van Gough biography he is reading. I guess Van Gough had a pretty shitty art life, and he was only famous after he died so he never got to see real success. Since I&#039;m always hiding my power level I ask my gf &quot;did the nazis ever make any art? Or were they just burning everything?&quot; That&#039;s when my gf unknowingly made me love Hitler even more. She goes, &quot;actually, Hitler was trying to SAVE the art! He only threatened to destroy it when he was losing.&quot; My gf is by no means red pilled. She&#039;s a cut above the average woman or else she wouldn&#039;t be my gf, but for instance she says she regrets\/feels bad for voting for trump. I like talking to her about history because her art perspective gives me neat perspectives into things.

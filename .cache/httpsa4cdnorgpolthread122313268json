They struggle to put on muscle mass at the same speed that men do, and struggle still to keep it over time. One need only glance at training standards of the past several decades in order to identify that these standards have been consistently lowered in order to allow women to gain entry. This lowering of standards affects not just women, but the entire military and its capability. It is worth remembering that most soldiers are still required to carry up to 60lbs of equipment.<br><br>Typically men have twice the lean muscle mass as women, and this working in tandem with larger size allows greater strength and explosive power used in sprinting and throwing. It&#039;s also evident in organ size, where lungs and heart are typically between 10-12% smaller in size in women than in their male counterparts. Women also have 10% lower hemoglobin count than males, which is crucial in transporting oxygen around the body. <br><br>Unit Cohesiveness: Anyone in the military can tell you that individuals must work together in tandem in order to function correctly, common examples being tank crews or infantry squads. According to interviews with Soviet women who served in the army against the Germans during WW2, they were often forced to leave equipment behind or get male counterparts to carry it for them. When a soldier is unable to do his or her job and forced to get someone else to do it for them, it will break down unit cohesion and effectiveness. Additionally it was found that in mixed combat units belonging to the Israeli army, that casualty rates were far higher than the male-only units as the inability for women to adapt to an environment requiring greater physical strength led to a further break down in unit cohesion.<br><br>Source: http:\/\/www.dtic.mil\/dtic\/tr\/fulltex<wbr>t\/u2\/a262626.pdf","filename":"1475353725422","ext":".jpg","w":358,"h":353,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1492891738885,"time":1492891738,"md5":"CHhVvjfAaAgE73CyIe44qg==","fsize":34151,"resto":122313268,"id":"Gp\/9F\/Ys","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":122321349,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)16:15:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122313268\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122313268<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;women<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;stressful situations<\/span><br><br>They ARE stressful situations you stupid wanker","time":1492892115,"resto":122313268,"id":"kDJmXxcO","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122321749,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)16:18:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122313268\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122313268<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shoot 3000 rounds per minute<\/span><br><br>Who&#039;s going to carry those 3000 rounds for her?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;women perform better in high stress situations than their male counterparts<\/span><br><br>Women get upset over everything much less people shooting at them<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Leaf<\/span><br><br>Oh nevermind","time":1492892295,"resto":122313268,"id":"8nXsLWgt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122321906,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)16:19:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122313268\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122313268<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Studies have shown women perform better in high stress situations than their male counterparts and have less chances to suffer from PTSD after deployment<\/span><br><br><br>And yet they get PTSD from reading mean Facebook comments","time":1492892386,"resto":122313268,"id":"KJ1m49t2","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122322030,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)16:20:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122313268\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122313268<\/a><br>Not against it at all.

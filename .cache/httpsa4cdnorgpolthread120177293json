They targeted a Syria for several reasons - 1.) to get back at Putin for leaving Jacob and their club, 2.) to make it look like &quot;#ISIS&quot; did it, 3.) get the oil and money from the Middle East by creating a new war, and 4.) trying to make Vladimir so mad that he used a bomb to start WWIII.<br>They also coincided this with the #Chinese PM&#039;s visit to #MaraLago because China is one of the biggest targets - they want war between the United States &amp; rogue Russian military leaders (such as Val) and China, non-rogue Russia (VP and those working for him), North Korea, &amp; Islamic nations (Iran and Syria being the main countries).<br><br>From this thread, dont let them slide this! <br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120144114#p120144114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120144114<\/a>","time":1491683855,"resto":120177293,"id":"zo1hMrRG","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":120181245,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)16:52:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120177657\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120177657<\/a><br>He&#039;s playing all sides masterfully.

How did you become a fucking nazi? A bunch of real Nazis whispered poison in your ears while becoming your only community, your only \u201cfriends\u201d.

R9K\u2019s \u201cwho wont woman fuck me\u201d bs \u201canything goes and anyone who gets mad is just a normie\u201d vs endless outbursts of anger at everything. Pol here becomes less of an isolated phenomenon and more of a natural end point for all these circles crashing into one another. And pol, also being its own thing, emans it is rolled back into those communities amplifying your worst aspect then roll it back into pol.<br>So essentially you have an online pressure cooker to turn your typical teenage nerdy bullshit into honest to god fascism. The surrounding of hateful idedas, the detachment from the harm you do? Turning them into \u201cjust jokes\u201d becoming your only friends and that just your community you can see it in many others but again your not a fucking mystery.&quot;","time":1492367316,"resto":121391010,"id":"WIavKr5K","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":121393376,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)14:29:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121392810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121392810<\/a><br>In america we call it brass.<br>3 years isn&#039;t bad.

He lives in accordance with the seasons and the forests, and he identities not only with blood, but also the land on which life is sustained. He has space to move, the air is clean, the sky is blue. And though beautiful, man in nature understands the brutality of nature itself - especially among the animals and foreign tribes<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spiritual - which serves as a source of moral codes, truth, meaning, and creativity. Most major Greek play-writes appealed to Dionysius and the Muses for inspiration <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Local - localized, self-sufficient communities, where people could build relationships with one another. Familial and kinship relationships are most important. <\/span><br><br>Civilization as it ends: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Urban - your living conditions are far away from nature. They are covered in trash, smog, foreign people who share no relation with you. The air you breath is polluted, and you are crammed into small spaces.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The System - you are forced to work in a deeply complex system, over which you have no control. You cannot free yourself from the system, and this system ensures that you adjust yourself to its goal of production and homogenization of people and culture - through psychological technique mainly. You are a part of the mass, and atom. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nihilism - God is dead, and all things are meaningless. Confusion ensues as to what purpose you have in life, and no moral codes exist independently of social convention and government. Everyday life become difficult. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Community - is broken down, and you use people instrumentally. Short lived relationships serve you temporarily. You cannot find a wife, as technology gives her far too many options from which to choose. Women are common property of the strong.<\/span>","filename":"Oswald_Spengler_The_decline_of_the_west","ext":".png","w":388,"h":595,"tn_w":163,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490671463802,"time":1490671463,"md5":"7uB\/mkJwLvyDrPGNfUhjsg==","fsize":33638,"resto":0,"id":"xgpsEIVX","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"civilization-as-it-begins-and-ends","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118606732,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)23:47:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118604534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118604534<\/a><br><br>I will shameless self-bump this post once or twice.","time":1490672850,"resto":118604534,"id":"xgpsEIVX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118606849,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)23:48:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118604534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118604534<\/a><br><br>One moar bump.","time":1490672920,"resto":118604534,"id":"xgpsEIVX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118609290,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:15:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118606849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118606849<\/a><br>Interesting","time":1490674530,"resto":118604534,"id":"S+paLYu8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

And turning off the sirens also proved difficult, eventually prompting officials to shut down the entire system.<br><br>\u201cEvery time we thought we had turned it off, the sirens would sound again, because whoever was hacking us was continuously hacking us,\u201d Ms. Syed said.<br><br>Mr. Vaz said that Dallas had reached out to the Federal Communications Commission for help and was taking steps to prevent hackers from setting off the entire system again, but that city officials had not communicated with federal law enforcement authorities.<br><br>Security officials have warned for years about the risks that hacking attacks can pose to infrastructure.

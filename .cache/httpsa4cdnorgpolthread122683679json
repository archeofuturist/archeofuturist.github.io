Indeed, It&#039;s practically meaningless at moment; Although it might suddenly become relevant in case NATO starts shaking it&#039;s dick again.","time":1493095017,"resto":122683679,"id":"JkckcpSH","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":122693108,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:39:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122692892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122692892<\/a><br>Everybody loves Australia","time":1493095152,"resto":122683679,"id":"Sp9tALeI","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122693587,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:44:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122688079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122688079<\/a><br>i&#039;m not sure what to think of it desu<br>while i hate monopolies, especially those run by (((them))) and deals with social orders<br>if china goes with it, it may be the precursor to ww3","time":1493095452,"resto":122683679,"id":"HJS2gSJU","country":"MY","country_name":"Malaysia"},{"no":122693843,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:46:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122692658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122692658<\/a><br>Top kek<br>Literally nothing","time":1493095600,"resto":122683679,"id":"ToP5b0JG","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":122693961,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:48:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122693587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122693587<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw the BRICS vs NATO WW3 meme becomes true<\/span>","time":1493095680,"resto":122683679,"id":"3f\/mqIDw","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122694196,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:50:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122684163\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122684163<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The economic coalition that only benefits the corrupt leaders of member states. <\/span><br><br>Fixed.","time":1493095830,"resto":122683679,"id":"kd3KTFeV","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":122694216,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:50:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Mexico X Brazil. <br><br>Fight of disabled.","filename":"200_s","ext":".gif","w":284,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1493095845765,"time":1493095845,"md5":"7tT\/XOrOJBS4HX3ryIwuiQ==","fsize":31245,"resto":122683679,"id":"h6G3bMkd","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122694257,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:51:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122685510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122685510<\/a><br>At least you are not the biggest meme country in the meme coalition.","filename":"01ea4d342e30420484d65059c4b2c1cd","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":250,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1493095871929,"time":1493095871,"md5":"VMRAOYYsG8dgPjwSzEvB4A==","fsize":21504,"resto":122683679,"id":"kd3KTFeV","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":122694426,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:52:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122683679\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122683679<\/a><br><br>South Africa is about to go total Zimbabwe.","time":1493095979,"resto":122683679,"id":"sDBqcy6a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122694463,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:53:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122694216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122694216<\/a><br>More like:","filename":"tmp_5462-images-1495524750","ext":".jpg","w":740,"h":415,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493096009465,"time":1493096009,"md5":"huqHuJTM59WZKvulZLgHig==","fsize":53313,"resto":122683679,"id":"86Nv9qVn","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122694488,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:53:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122694257\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122694257<\/a><br><br>A green dick in the flag.

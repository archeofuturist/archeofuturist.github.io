Why not just be friends? Well, that&#039;s what I was for a while. I&#039;d come and hang out at the house and attend parties and have a good time, but never bothered joining or paying dues. I would say the main difference between a fraternity and a regular group of friends is that a fraternity has more organization, and everyone chips in cash every semester so that you can have a big house and have good parties. I joined because I made a lot of good friends and I felt like I may as well chip in. As a bonus, I can get free accommodation in most major American cities with a handshake, rent at the house was incredibly cheap for it&#039;s location across the street from campus, and for some reason, there are actually women who will suck your dick because you&#039;re in a frat.","time":1490564235,"resto":118405687,"id":"zFo7srMB","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118419729,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:37:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118418791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118418791<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;were both on \/pol\/ buddy, don&#039;t forget that<\/span><br><br>lmao, implying nu\/pol\/ is anything but homosexual plebbitors trying to get Daddy Trump to touch their buttholes","time":1490564247,"resto":118405687,"id":"ExxuWE1A","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118419774,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:37:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118405687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118405687<\/a><br> <br><br>No, pseudo-Masonic crypto-Jew clubs are degenerate","time":1490564266,"resto":118405687,"id":"b0z4RRPk","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":118420105,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:40:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118416545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118416545<\/a><br>most of this is right if you care about partying this much, but if you dont need greek life to network in uni, its incredibly easy with other organizations already.

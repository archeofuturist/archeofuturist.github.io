Hillary had been living in the swamp for millenia. She knows how to get her way in politics. Donald Trump is a political infant. Being a minor billionaire is meaningless when even the lowest-level players have just as much money and power as you ever did and probably more.<br><br>I doubt he ever thought he was going to be president. He is now out of his depth, like a domestic dog being thrown in with the wolves. There are superficial similarities, but the animals in Washington have politics flowing in their veins. This last weekend, I think we saw what happens when one man crosses the Establishment. That is to say, I think they got him. They probably did hack his whole life. You think Donald fucking Trump is as pure as the driven snow? Or, do you think he has secrets which if revealed would destroy not only him but his entire family legacy. If they had this info the whole time, they knew that all his bluster would evaporate as soon as a real threat to his money and family emerged and he would be utter compliant because now he is in waaaaaay too deep to make a classy exit. That&#039;s how you really play 3.14D Stratego.","time":1492110761,"resto":120943003,"id":"WIkENKT4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120948578,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)15:13:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120945875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120945875<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Every President moderates while in office<\/span><br>But not every one goes into a complete reverse.","filename":"Trump trust","ext":".png","w":618,"h":685,"tn_w":112,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492110799540,"time":1492110799,"md5":"NTv7iLkIYrEOZEhYCdsBJg==","fsize":371079,"resto":120943003,"id":"4WUi73nu","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120948596,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)15:13:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120948135\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120948135<\/a><br>This isn&#039;t about him being a white nationalist<br>Hell, if anything, that&#039;s the one thing he has delivered on, making this country whiter<br><br>But I don&#039;t know if that&#039;s going to matter if he evens things out by starting WWIII and continues shipping our jobs to China.

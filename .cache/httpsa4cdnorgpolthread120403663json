The turnout pales in comparison to the 2006 Mega March in Dallas that drew an estimated 500,000 and stretched many packed city blocks. In contrast the 2017 Mega March only thinly fills half the lanes of about six blocks as seen from aerial video by KXAS-TV.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;UPDATE: Dallas Police released their march attendance estimate: about 3,200\u2013less than one percent of the 500,000 who marched in 2006. \u201cThe #MegaMarch2017 is winding down.

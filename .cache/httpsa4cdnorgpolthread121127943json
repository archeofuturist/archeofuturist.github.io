Where they see miscarriages of justice, I see normal, healthy ways of being in the world that help individuals and collectives to thrive. Because let&#039;s be honest, I would rather not have my daughter and wives grow up in a country where they are not considered moral equals, like Saudi Arabia. But I also think that it is right and good for fathers to lead their families, and to have authority over their wives and children because it is the healthiest way to live; difference being that being a leader also comes with responsibilities and duties, and failing to uphold those duties is a serious misdemeanor. It&#039;s a power exchange of sorts. In an ideal world, women willingly give up some of their power for the benefits of being provided for, while men willingly take on responsibilities, and receive the benefits that come with that also, like respect, dignity, and honour.","filename":"greek-statue","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492235413233,"time":1492235413,"md5":"pCjkyLTPgDYW4ToMyICoKA==","fsize":53241,"resto":121127943,"id":"6\/8BrWWU","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121177073,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:51:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121127943\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121127943<\/a><br>I give more power to white race, you should have 50 white kids.","time":1492235502,"resto":121127943,"id":"zljwowQR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121177747,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:59:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121176229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121176229<\/a><br>You mentioned &#039;first world problems&#039;, but I think that doesn&#039;t quite address the problem. In order for there to be a problem, there has to be a moral norm which is being violated in some way, no matter how slight. The problem is that we have confused our moral values, where we have placed freedom (especially individual freedom) as the highest\/most important value, even to the point of supporting individuals who want to kill themselves. So you get scenarios where any kind of encroachment upon that freedom is seen as the ultimate evil, but the Catholic church (and the non-globalist Jews) always thought that life was the first\/highest value due to the divine spark which animates each and everyone of us. So when it comes to freedom, religious groups always taught that freedom was best understood as &#039;freedom to do what is right&#039; rather than the more shallow &#039;freedom from authority\/rules&#039; etc. <br><br>But the thing about individualism in the West is that we have imbibed copious amounts of Luciferian, rejecting authority in all forms, as we no longer believe that any authority except the individual is legitimate. Is it any wonder then when our kids grow up to be rebellious snots? We&#039;ve raised them to only trust their own judgement, but I don&#039;t really know how to undo this without rejoining the church","filename":"white family","ext":".jpg","w":418,"h":287,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1492235961296,"time":1492235961,"md5":"PpRM60ceafXwvQgYogoVTg==","fsize":156073,"resto":121127943,"id":"6\/8BrWWU","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

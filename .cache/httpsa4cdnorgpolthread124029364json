Lawfag here.<br><br>I have no fucking clue. The typical response is a vague wave to the CFAA or similar federal law that covers hacking. And it&#039;s true, the provisions are extremely broad and could apply to an enormous range of activities online, including activities that purely involve using a system in the manner in which it was intended (i.e., flooding a server with more legitimate traffic than it can handle).<br><br>So the quick answer as to whether it&#039;s a criminal offense: Probably yes. But will you get prosecuted? Probably no. The fact of the matter is you&#039;re not causing pecuniary harm to anybody other than, perhaps, an immeasurably small increase in electricity consumption by the server if your attack consumes all the CPU capacity and heats everything up. But really, I&#039;m not aware of any serious effort by the feds or even by states (to the extent that they can) to prosecute small-time pranksters that actually do not cause harm beyond annoying people.<br><br>The idea that you&#039;re using &quot;in-game mechanics&quot; isn&#039;t really a defense either.

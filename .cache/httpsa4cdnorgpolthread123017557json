I know of too many people who were in highschool with me who are single parents or five digits in debt or never even took a single job yet. Build a stable life and you can handle the worst.<br>Started out homeless and lost my dog the very day I got my associate&#039;s, now I have an apartment with furniture and half-assed studying for a better job. I&#039;m hoping in another 2.5 years I&#039;ll at least have the better job. Build up and only take a sip so you know how to not drown.","time":1493289240,"resto":123017557,"id":"WmBrdvhW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123022591,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)06:36:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"SORT YOURSELF OOT","filename":"1482370616355[1]","ext":".png","w":850,"h":1133,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493289400803,"time":1493289400,"md5":"CoeFk9Qs7cdPRb9ucLb4RA==","fsize":1940172,"resto":123017557,"id":"a3z17kLw","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123022662,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)06:37:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123017557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123017557<\/a><br>He&#039;s a sick cunt. <br><br>His political activism aside he really sees how fucked the under 30&#039;s are - how poorly raised\/ special snowflakey they are.<br><br>A lot of his lectures I see people ask questions and he has this subtext of &quot;you are nothing, this is normal though&quot;.

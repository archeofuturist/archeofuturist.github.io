I was born with an inherent repulsion from the light, clearly. I hate the light and it hates me. Sometimes it says it loves me. But actions speak louder than words. I drift off into oblivion. I can&#039;t even rage against the dying of the light, it&#039;s not even an option, the rocket has run out of fuel, the radio is broken, and apparently I&#039;m beyond the reach of any living being&#039;s signal detection ability. Maybe I&#039;m still on the radar of some living beings, but I&#039;m just a spot that soon will have drifted off the limit of the radar. And there&#039;s nothing anyone can do to stop it.","filename":"BOWIE2-634","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":481,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":189,"tim":1493116303202,"time":1493116303,"md5":"TuEKR8p9bQbJPpVOwi4sqw==","fsize":32519,"resto":0,"id":"lfG5Xuk\/","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"rage-rage-against-the-dying-of-the-light","country_name":"Sweden","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

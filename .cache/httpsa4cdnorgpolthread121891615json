A used one is often very affordable in the 20-25k range. New double wides can cost up to the 100k range. Also mobile homes have often are different from a traditional home when it comes to the mortage\/loan. They often repo your house like a car if anything happens. Im not saying dont do it but get informed before you do. Some things that can make the durability better is getting sheetrock walls instead of the plastic-like standard Hardwood floors and other things can make a difference too but increase the price.","time":1492635075,"resto":121891615,"id":"vamwG8Wg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121895577,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:59:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121894370\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121894370<\/a><br>Ok thanks man","time":1492635594,"resto":121891615,"id":"Z442+v0C","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121895578,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:59:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;d love to be able to own a tiny home one day.

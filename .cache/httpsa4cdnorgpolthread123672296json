I had a take home final for some technological anthropology course and one of the questions asked for me to talk about how women have it so hard in education in the 21st century.<br><br>Before I get into it, WHY THE EVERLIVING FUCK are we talking about women education. What the hell does that have to do with Technological Anthropology.<br><br>I swear to god colleges are trying to stick feminist bullshit into anywhere they can. I am a computer science major. Trying my best to avoid this crap but it still shows up.<br><br>Either way, I feel like garbage for not going on a rant about this question and probably getting a shit grade. <br><br>Why the hell do women care so much about STEM fields. I seriously had to write bullshit about how we aren&#039;t encouraging women enough in sciences and that they don&#039;t have the confidence they need to attempt to go into STEM fields. Had to talk about the bullshit wage gap which has been beaten into the ground as wrong. Women in CS get whatever the fuck they want. COMPANIES LOVE THEM. Who wouldn&#039;t want the fucking unicorn working for them. Everyone wants to advertise that they hire women. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Going to go find bleach to punish myself for my crimes<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;My uni isn&#039;t even that liberal<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fuck<\/span>","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-05-01 at 4.47.47 PM","ext":".png","w":657,"h":562,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":213,"tim":1493672472118,"time":1493672472,"md5":"G\/lVyEHRjqim1WZLod8Vbg==","fsize":119539,"resto":0,"id":"8FTr05JN","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-dont-want-to-be-a-feminist-fuck-social-sciences","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123673514,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)17:10:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; implicit association test<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; not real science<\/span><br><br>Bias studies don&#039;t hold up to replication<br><br>http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/<wbr>10.1111\/sjop.12288\/abstract","time":1493673016,"resto":123672296,"id":"I+mwLsFR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123673892,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)17:12:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123673514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123673514<\/a><br><br>Problems with the discrimination hypothesis (in the field of philosophy)<br><br>https:\/\/www.nas.org\/articles\/women_<wbr>in_philosophy_problems_with_the_dis<wbr>crimination_hypothesis","time":1493673174,"resto":123672296,"id":"I+mwLsFR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

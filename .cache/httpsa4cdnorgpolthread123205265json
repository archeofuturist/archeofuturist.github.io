Will invest that money for job growth leaving the means of the middle class that have the job and those seeking employment to pick up employment. TO get taxed.<br><br>That is where the rub comes in. 2 factors. inflation, and deficit, and fiat currency. Inflation and government spending. The Fed which most would screech at would say needs to be abolished but it is a partisan private\/publicly owned entity that operates within the means of the government and independently at the same time. Inflation helps growth as well but on a different scale. Government spending during recessions help the the economy as the government spends money the private sector picks up the revenues and contracts and spends that money to employ individuals. However that money should not overspend during an expansion as it will overshadow the growth and could cause a contraction within the economy.<br><br>Deficit, the deficit is really just a word game. Yes it is an issue, but the issue with the deficit is there is no deficit. Because of one simple theory. Modern Money Theory, and a term called Fiat Currency. Which is where a government becomes the issuer of the currency. This means that the government cannot become insolvent. Because the US government will not allow itself to such.<br><br>Fiat currency means that if the government needs to pay back a loan to china, or a debt. Then literally all it has to do is print more money. Now in situations like Greece. Greece is not a Currency issuer. The EU has 3 countries that issue currency. Greece is not one of them","time":1493394616,"resto":123205265,"id":"0pDEItvk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123208083,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)11:50:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123207515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123207515<\/a><br>That&#039;s actually pretty rare, outside of a few rare cases, and the ones that hq outside of the US don&#039;t do it because the corporate tax rate is really that high. <br><br>The effective corporate tax rate is already 17% in the US, with some even paying as low as 2 or 3%.

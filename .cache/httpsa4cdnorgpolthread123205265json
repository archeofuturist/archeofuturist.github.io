Welfare, which you also revile is for your COUNTRYMEN. Would you prefer abject poverty? Do you want dead bodies in the streets? Widespread disease outbreaks from lack of healthcare? Do you think these things will not affect you? Newsflash: not everybody&#039;s the same person; some people simply don&#039;t and won&#039;t fit into the society you like; do you want them invading your home to get by instead of getting paltry gimmes that you don&#039;t even notice coming out of your taxes? That portion is hardly what you think it is. <br><br>Here&#039;s a better question: what do the ultra rich need more ultra riches for? They NEVER use it to create more jobs or increase salaries. They squander it. Nobody&#039;s suggesting making the rich poor, and you aren&#039;t either of those, but you&#039;re much more likely to become poor than rich mo matter how aryan\/better than others you think you are.

If you don&#039;t, it&#039;s not the ultra-rich people&#039;s houses that&#039;ll be broken into. It&#039;s not the ultra-rich&#039;s daughters getting hate-raped for not being poor.

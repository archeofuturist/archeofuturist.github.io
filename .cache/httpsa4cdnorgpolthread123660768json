I danced with a few chicks, made out with one who then followed us to Cheetah Hallendale Beach, a strip club in Hallendale Beach. Afterward, me and the girl from the club got &#039;privatedances&#039; in the back and then I got my dick sucked in the car in the parking lot by the girl from Club Space. Once I came, I didn&#039;t even want to take her home like originally planned and proceeded to go home by myself and browse \/pol\/<br><br>The whole time I felt like I was taking part in a goy ritual. When I spent $500 for VIP for my friends and I, I heard &#039;good goy&#039; as I handed them my money. When I threw $100 singles on a stripper who was eating out the girl from Space all I could think was &#039;good goy empower women goy&#039;. When I gave the DJ $5 and requested a Kodak Black song all I could think was &#039;good goy, play the diverse music&#039; and when I was dancing to salsa I thought &#039; WHY ISNT THE MUSIC IN ENGLISH&#039; even though I am Latino and not white. <br><br>This place has fucked me up.

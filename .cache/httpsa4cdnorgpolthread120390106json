I was in college, used to say &quot;nigger&quot; on campus to kids and nobody ever batted an eyelash. we drew swastikas on everything to act cool. gave seig heils. made racist jokes. could openly say &quot;I don&#039;t want obama as president because he&#039;s black&quot; and people might disagree but nobody threw a fit. <br><br>then some shit changed rather fast and dramatically around 2011-2012 and just got worse and worse and worse up until 2015 when our lord and emperor trump finally stepped up to the plate. it only took a few years of SJW oppression running rampant in society for all that pressure to bottle up and pop (in the form of pro-trump movement). <br><br>now it&#039;s not really mainstream because there is no mainstream, there&#039;s two bitterly divided and opposing streams, BUT it&#039;s at least more in the open and more able to be talked about than it was before.<br><br>at least that&#039;s my own person thought on the matter, others might have different experience","time":1491797646,"resto":120390106,"id":"UaqRcxs6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120390725,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)00:14:53","name":"\u25b6AntiSJW\u25b6Libertarian","com":"<a href=\"#p120390458\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120390458<\/a><br>shut it down - the post","filename":"laughing-dog","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":337,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491797693463,"time":1491797693,"md5":"xQ2OxtELrfCKzUm1Kkirpw==","fsize":24935,"resto":120390106,"id":"5X\/\/xVIs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

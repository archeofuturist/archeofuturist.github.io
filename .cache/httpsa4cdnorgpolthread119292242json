War is meant to be 2 opposing sides using any means necessary to achieve victory, so wars nowadays are a constant case of each side holding back from each other and only exerting the &#039;right&#039; amount of force.<br><br>I agree that these weapons are dangerous and bad, but that should just be more of a deterrent to prevent war unless absolutely necessary. No more petty wars would happen.","filename":"515a75473438b450c3ef38301c2cabc0","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":525,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491195082087,"time":1491195082,"md5":"I2amIfMq2FD7DUyZcF27Ow==","fsize":89533,"resto":0,"id":"+nReLx73","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-find-it-odd-how-there-are-so-many-rules-to","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":7},{"no":119292473,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:54:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"In an all out total war scenario those rules have and will be outright ignored.","time":1491195262,"resto":119292242,"id":"AoLbi\/Jy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119292575,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:55:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119292242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119292242<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No more petty wars would happen.<\/span><br>God save us, because that leaves the big ones","time":1491195336,"resto":119292242,"id":"7TNMxrOi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119292675,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:56:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119292242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119292242<\/a><br>Regulations are set to keep soldiers from dying horrendously graphic and painful ways, ie: chemical gas and flamethrowers.

Using any of these tactics is likely to lead to a swift and decisive victory, as eradicating the civilian infrastructure or tainting the very earth in an area causes the support structures of the opposing military force to rapidly disintegrate. Now, to a layman like you this might sound like a good thing, because you yourself stated you think &quot;war is meant to be two opposing sides using any means necessary to achieve victory.&quot; The problem is, that&#039;s not what war is, and not what it has been at least since 1945. Probably longer.<br><br>War is about a jew-owned bank making enormous loans to two competing world powers (paid back with interest through tax revenues) in order to fund the state-subsidized military industrial complex. If you achieve your goals and &quot;win the war&quot; everybody has to go home and the factories and associated support businesses have to shut down, creating massive job loss and widespread civil unrest, which may eventually lead to bloody revolts.<br><br>War used to be about a bunch of young bachelors with no prospects getting together, killing all the men of another tribe, and taking their land and women in order to start new lives for themselves. You &quot;won&quot; the war when there was nobody left in the area to kill you and you had a hot wife popping out babies for you.<br><br>War now isn&#039;t meant to end. It&#039;s a shovel-ready jobs program propping up the world economy, and if war as a business were to end, World War 3 would definitely follow for real.

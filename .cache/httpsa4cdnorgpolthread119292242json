War is meant to be 2 opposing sides using any means necessary to achieve victory, so wars nowadays are a constant case of each side holding back from each other and only exerting the &#039;right&#039; amount of force.<br><br>I agree that these weapons are dangerous and bad, but that should just be more of a deterrent to prevent war unless absolutely necessary. No more petty wars would happen.","filename":"515a75473438b450c3ef38301c2cabc0","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":525,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491195082087,"time":1491195082,"md5":"I2amIfMq2FD7DUyZcF27Ow==","fsize":89533,"resto":0,"id":"+nReLx73","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-find-it-odd-how-there-are-so-many-rules-to","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119292473,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:54:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"In an all out total war scenario those rules have and will be outright ignored.","time":1491195262,"resto":119292242,"id":"AoLbi\/Jy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119292575,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:55:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119292242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119292242<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No more petty wars would happen.<\/span><br>God save us, because that leaves the big ones","time":1491195336,"resto":119292242,"id":"7TNMxrOi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119292675,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:56:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119292242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119292242<\/a><br>Regulations are set to keep soldiers from dying horrendously graphic and painful ways, ie: chemical gas and flamethrowers.

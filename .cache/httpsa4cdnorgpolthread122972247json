Over 4000 americans died. It completely destabilized the middle east and is the reason ISIS is here today. Thousands of innocent civilians were killed. All this sacrifice for nothing. It makes me so sad to look at the faces of those who gave their lives for nothing. To the Iraq war veterans who may be browsing this board, do you believe your fellow soldiers, marines, airmen, sailors, and coast guardsmen died in vain? Please tell me that their deaths meant something.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-26 at 8.14.28 PM","ext":".png","w":457,"h":548,"tn_w":208,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493256166721,"time":1493256166,"md5":"W3dfLuXFlbPcMP2Cw3Lt1A==","fsize":438840,"resto":0,"id":"6k4i0XtD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"did-americans-die-in-iraq-completely-in-vain","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Let&#039;s go with the idea that the missiles made it through Syrian airspace unabated.<br><br>The first thing which can cause a precision guided munitions to &quot;miss&quot; (as in, by a factor of a few meters) is Target Location Error. This is the difference between where you think the target is at and where it is actually at on the ground. A grid coordinate for a strike derived from a paper map can be up to 250m off from the actual location. Our best means of target location, satellite imagery, can by up to 6m off.<br><br>From that expected impact point, we now consider Circular Error Probable. This is the radius where the munitions is expected to impact, based on its physical, aerodynamic properties. All sort of things can affect where a TLAM lands such as wind speeds and earth&#039;s rotation. This could be up to 100m for a large warhead like a TLAM. <br><br>Finally we consider Weapons Effects Radius. A TLAM only has a 1000lb warhead. Significant but not massive.

At the end of the conflict, the major Arab powers denyed oil exports to the western world powers for their support of Israel. This kicks off the 1973 Energy crisis and its effects are felt around the entire world thus ensures foreign meddling in Arab countries for decades to come. Meanwhile, Europe is caught between a rock and a hard place. If it does nothing it will eventually be force to play second fiddle to whoever comes out on top in the next century. So a plan is created. If Europe could unify it&#039;s economy and become allies with the Middle east, it could become a super power to rival that of the USA and Russia. Europe begins to form the EU the Euro-Arab Dialogue begins. To two world powers, the intentions are obvious.<br>So what do two major world superpowers say when they see this power move?<br>&quot;Not on my watch!&quot;<br>Flash forward several decades. China becomes a first world nation and has started to flex it&#039;s muscles, Russia has managed to stand itself up after the collapse of the USSR and become powerful again is a short period of time, while the EU has become more an economic superpower. The USA and Russia feel their influence on Europe beginning to slip. Something needs to be done.","filename":"Eurabia_map","ext":".png","w":323,"h":330,"tn_w":122,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491671214336,"time":1491671214,"md5":"XVe1b0Jr457D1GSsOL9Uyw==","fsize":4489,"resto":120135066,"id":"PAww5IhW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120154351,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:08:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120135175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120135175<\/a><br>This.

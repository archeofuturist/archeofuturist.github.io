Hopefully you will help me and this thread will soon 404, leaving on it&#039;s trail, decent answers. <br><br>What i need help with : Redpill literature about the Frankfurt School and their true intentions.<br> <br>I know of their outer image : neo-marxists in disagreement with narrow-view communists and, later borrowing ideas from different schools of thought to synthetize something new.<br><br>What i don&#039;t know : Authors and books of trustable source (((not neo-con merchants))) who have exposed their secret ideas and plans of subverting the West. <br><br>Bear in mind that i would look for what i&#039;m requesting if i knew where to start, which is exactly what i don&#039;t know. Any names, book names, lines of thought. <br><br>I would really appreciate it.

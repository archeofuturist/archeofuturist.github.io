The common analogy is of the hot air balloon pilot who invites his friend up for a ride. We would generally agree that the balloon remains the property of the pilot, but that he could not throw the friend out to his death when he suddenly decided that he doesn&#039;t want him on his property anymore. <br><br>There is a crucial difference between this and abortion though. The friend going on the balloon ride was engaged in a contract, verbal or written, with the understanding that he would be returned to the ground safely. If he understood that the pilot reserved the right to toss him out anytime he pleased, he would not have gone up in the first place. A fetus, however, does not enter into a voluntary contract with the host, because it does not exist until the action of conception is taken. Without any such contract, the host cannot be held responsible for anything other than her own rights. <br><br>As well, the cost of hosting a fetus is significantly greater than safely bringing a balloon passenger to the ground, so the property analogy is a weak one. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;in the case of rape<\/span><br>Is the fetus devoid of rights just because it was conceived without the permission of the mother?

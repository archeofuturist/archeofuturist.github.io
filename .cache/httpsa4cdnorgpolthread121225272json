The common analogy is of the hot air balloon pilot who invites his friend up for a ride. We would generally agree that the balloon remains the property of the pilot, but that he could not throw the friend out to his death when he suddenly decided that he doesn&#039;t want him on his property anymore. <br><br>There is a crucial difference between this and abortion though. The friend going on the balloon ride was engaged in a contract, verbal or written, with the understanding that he would be returned to the ground safely. If he understood that the pilot reserved the right to toss him out anytime he pleased, he would not have gone up in the first place. A fetus, however, does not enter into a voluntary contract with the host, because it does not exist until the action of conception is taken. Without any such contract, the host cannot be held responsible for anything other than her own rights. <br><br>As well, the cost of hosting a fetus is significantly greater than safely bringing a balloon passenger to the ground, so the property analogy is a weak one. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;in the case of rape<\/span><br>Is the fetus devoid of rights just because it was conceived without the permission of the mother?

A newborn cannot fend for himself and yet it is unacceptable for one to throw out a newborn baby. What difference does the moment of birth make ? What is the difference between a newborn and an unborn child. They both rely on the host to survive. Following your analogy could we force a mother to look after hard child. And if the child is a result of a agreement between spouses, the mother cannot take back her word. In the west we consider women to be morally equal to men. So they must onorate an agreement or decision .","time":1492281420,"resto":121225272,"id":"MfgfxYNI","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":121241951,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)14:37:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121241604\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121241604<\/a><br>You are in no position of authority<br>although you seem to imagine you are","time":1492281461,"resto":121225272,"id":"SjsZ880B","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121242014,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)14:38:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121227433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121227433<\/a><br>rights and privileges are different things, anon. did they stop teaching brits about rights in british schools?","time":1492281494,"resto":121225272,"id":"r\/0WkEqY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121242165,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)14:39:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121241843\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121241843<\/a><br>If a car owner ejects his passenger doing highway speeds with the intention to kill and the passenger dies.

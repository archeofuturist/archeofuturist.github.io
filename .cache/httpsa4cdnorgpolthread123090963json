I have questions that I&#039;m not allowed to ask in any of the Democrat safe spaces. <br><br>For one, why does your party and media conglomerates continue to demonize the white man, but then wonder why you lost the election? I&#039;ve seen every excuse from &quot;Literally half of the country is racist&quot; to &quot;Donald Trump hacked the election with Russia&quot;, but never once has anyone questioned if the Democratic strategy of calling half of the country a bigot was maybe a poor strategy.<br><br>Is there anything you&#039;ve noticed? Any kind of real strategy or real talk about the inner workings of that political party to explain this? I just watched a segment on one of the popular liberal infotainment shows about how everyone in the South is racist for celebrating Confederate day, and how Whitey needs to kill himself. Do you really think this is going to win you the election in 2020?<br><br>Doesn&#039;t it say more about your party that Republicans could run Donald-fucking-Trump and still whip your asses? Please tell me there is some strategy here for winning people back instead of spiraling into progressive madness. You&#039;re letting people like Trevor Noah and Samantha Bee speak for your party, and it&#039;s hurting your credibility far more than anything else can.","filename":"CtykwGUVYAAYh-N","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":285,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":142,"tim":1493328410764,"time":1493328410,"md5":"e86bhx773yyhjejN4i\/z6g==","fsize":19221,"resto":0,"id":"E3FJnWEL","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-there-actual-democrats-on-here-i-have","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123093148,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)17:41:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123090963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123090963<\/a><br>There will not be any recovery.

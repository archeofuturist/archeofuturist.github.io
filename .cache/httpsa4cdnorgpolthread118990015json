Russia understood that those new to voting age (millennials) would help support Trump simply because they recognized him as a celebrity.<br>Russia not only exposed how ignorant the average millennial is, they showed to the world that the US doesn&#039;t take it&#039;s elections seriously. Just like Obama - who was elected simply because of race, and much like this generation, is nothing but a footnote in history.<br><br>I feel sorry for you mindless Trump supporters; I really do. You&#039;ll support your joke candidate to the end, just like you did with Milo. <br><br>But the end is near. <br>How does is feel to be so wrong, and to have so much hatred and fear that you&#039;d bet your entire points of view on such a pithy gaff?<br>Because even after you realize you&#039;ve been had, though, those feelings of hate and terror against anybody different than you will remain...<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Don&#039;t call me a &quot;shill&quot; - you don&#039;t know what that means<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Don&#039;t pray to &quot;Kek&quot; - that just shows you&#039;re autistic<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get help.

Hell, it&#039;s already happening on many of the nonpolitical subs. Who the fuck wants to be spammed with ThinkProgress articles on fucking r\/Scifi ? Nobody, that&#039;s who. But by all means, keep it up. Keep digging your own grave with your retarded astroturfing.<br><br>And don&#039;t even think you have a snowball&#039;s chance in hell of gaining a foothold on \/pol\/. I hate to break it to you sweetie, but this board has been under siege since the day it was created. And do you know how many of these invasions and raids were successful? Zero. Absolutely none. We stopped the JIDF dead in its tracks. We made r\/SRS leave with their tail between their legs after they got BTFO by our site&#039;s own admin and moderation team. Our shitposting was one of the many factors that led Moot to quit 4chan when GamerGate happened. We doxxed CTR with precision unlike anything you have seen before and got the shills to delete their LinkedIn accounts out of sheer terror.<br><br>Tell me sweetie, do you think your little raid will be any more successful than the ones done by the faggots we&#039;ve defeated in the past?<br><br>Um... no.<br><br>We&#039;ll learn your tactics and turn them against you.<br><br>We&#039;ll spot your threads and report them.<br><br>And if you still keep this sit up, we&#039;ll go on 8 chan and look for your personal info.<br><br>You won&#039;t know what hit you and we&#039;ll make a joke out of your pathetic little shill force in a matter of months.<br><br>So by all means, keep trying to fuck with \/pol\/. I hope you faggots like the taste of weaponized autism because that&#039;s what&#039;s coming for you.","filename":"4353534543","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":1236,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490918393342,"time":1490918393,"md5":"l53M7C2w6hoXYCxNG7OyPw==","fsize":160911,"resto":118990015,"id":"JqXArujQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

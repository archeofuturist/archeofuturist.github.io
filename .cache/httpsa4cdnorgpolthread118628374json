I recently saw Valhalla Rising. Oh cool, badass Vikings viciously killing each other. Then they show up in the new world and are completely murdered by natives without killing even one native in return. In the end, the main character walks up to the natives and lets them kill him. The director had no problem displaying the Vikings killing each other, but when it came to the natives they mysteriously turned scared and inept and helpless. I give the movie 10\/10 for cuckyness. Are other scandy movies suffering from cuck tendencies?","filename":"IMG_1696","ext":".jpg","w":1069,"h":1500,"tn_w":178,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490689537065,"time":1490689537,"md5":"ICxVbrhQBS4XewPbFlpEpw==","fsize":233117,"resto":0,"id":"0skReEye","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"scandinavian-cuck-movies","country_name":"United States","replies":132,"images":17,"unique_ips":56,"tail_size":50},{"no":118628470,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:27:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is typical Finnish movie<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=KJh<wbr>08NeXaD4","time":1490689643,"resto":118628374,"id":"xdckF6qn","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118628630,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:30:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118628470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118628470<\/a><br>Haha badass","time":1490689811,"resto":118628374,"id":"0skReEye","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118628704,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:31:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118628470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118628470<\/a><br>top kek","time":1490689876,"resto":118628374,"id":"fbzVCEAv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118628871,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:34:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118628374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118628374<\/a><br>The fuck you think would happen ?

But you got a couple involving more or less specific activity over there, like the one you read here. <br><br>Not sure but is the same one where I think \u00deorrfinn Karlsefni(not sure if it was him) falls at a place we&#039;re not sure is, named Krossanes in Markland? Starts with them coming over a village and 3 skr\u00e6lings, and they kill the skr\u00e6lings so they won&#039;t tell. Anyways I do mean to recall that the village is at the end of the bay and they are on the &quot;nes&quot; out part towards the sea, fights happens and he falls there and they raised a cross and named it crossanes. fireshit doesn&#039;t work but I got a theory of where it is. <br><br>Except mentioned sagas, interaction just pops up just here and there, I don&#039;t remember which but I suspect laxd\u00e6la saga is one of them. it&#039;s a scattered, once I collected these references, but my kit is gone. <br><br>But they fought, they traded. Not every person gets a saga either, only important or very notable people","filename":"77e80ec25b187cbcbfb57c695c5132c234f17ad5fb9b6e0d284183ae3a7483a6","ext":".jpg","w":267,"h":189,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1490698895294,"time":1490698895,"md5":"3+yQe2x28oN+GzI4eMIY1Q==","fsize":11883,"resto":118628374,"id":"6NQfQaof","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":118637494,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)07:02:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118628374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118628374<\/a><br>why u do dis mads","time":1490698935,"resto":118628374,"id":"ReF4kJFt","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":118637816,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)07:06:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yeah we have a legend of a great war between two tribes over a prized bull here in Ireland.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Over a bull<\/span><br>Some bandits from one village raided a neighboring farm and the locals turned out to tell them to fuck off.

Germany is at the geographic heart of the EU. It is also at least for the next two decades likely to remain the continent\u2019s largest economy and most populous country.<br>Ask the Greeks if you think I exaggerate: Germany runs Europe without firing a shot. It forces far weaker partners to stay in a currency zone that is crippling them, and uses its economic muscle to dictate immigration and other key policies. <br>We have learned our lessons and today we focus on destroying europe again with our influence and economic power.<br>What did you expect?<br>A friendly germany? A germany that got no influence anymore? On nothing?<br>Great products with the stamp &quot;made in germany&quot; are superior to your inferior products.<br>We hold europe, if germany gets destroyed it will influence all other states around the world.

He said &quot;we don&#039;t need any more roles, we have enough roles as it is&quot; with a tone of anger and disgust. <br><br>3- Just compare his general demeanor when they are discussing Libya\/Syria to when they are discussing something more positive like Italian-US relations. As soon as they start talking about Syria, Trump starts puckering his lips again, closing his eyes, darting his eyes at the camera and away from it.

They don\u2019t care at all. They are only interested in one thing: <br><br>Are you willing to be plundered? Yes or no?<br><br>Are you stupid enough to keep quiet in the process? Yes or no?<br><br>And when a democracy is stupid enough not to stand up, then it is good. <br>But when an authoritarian state declares, &quot;You are not going to plunder our people ...&quot; neither from the inside nor the outside, then that is bad.<br><br>In reality, money rules in these &quot;democratic&quot; countries.<br>They talk about press freedom, when in fact all these newspapers have one owner, and the owner is, in any case, the sponsor. <br>This press shapes then public opinion. <br><br>These political parties do not have any differences at all, like before with us. <br>You already know the old political parties. They were all the same.<br><br>What really matters is EXCLUSIVELY THE Existence of this group of \u2018democracy makers.\u2019 <br>That is, the existence of a few hundred giant capitalists who own all the factories and shares and who, ultimately, lead the people. <br>They are not interested at all in the great mass of people. <br>They are the only ones who can be addressed as international elements because they conduct their business everywhere.<br><br>It is a small, rootless international clique that is turning the people against each other, that does not want them to have peace\u2026<br><br>They can suppress us. They can kill us if you like, but we will not capitulate!<br><br>For the sake of the German folk, Hail victory!<br><br>These Jews used to laugh about it - these idiots. They thought it was a joke. They are not laughing anymore. <br>Today they realize the gravity of the situation - it\u2019s become a bloody gravity.","filename":"nuremberg-1933","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490059829498,"time":1490059829,"md5":"mrXsruLEr5nYnUjInwuKAA==","fsize":115222,"resto":0,"id":"pitZpprB","country":"TR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"it-is-a-small-rootless-international-clique-that","country_name":"Turkey","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":117566704,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)21:31:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"It was a fight, especially against the people who seemed to have omnipotent power in our nation \u2013 the struggle against the Jews; a Satanic power had taken over our whole country that had been able to grip key positions of intellectual and spiritual life, but also of the political and economic life. And from these key positions they were able to control and monitor the whole nation. <br>This power had, at the same time, the influence to persecute, even with the law, those who fought against this power, and those who were willing to oppose the advance of it.<br><br>Almighty Jewry thus declared war on us.

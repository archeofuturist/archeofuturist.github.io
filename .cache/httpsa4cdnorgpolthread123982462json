He has actual leverage with American military strength, and he&#039;s dealing with people who want to make deals because they aren&#039;t total puppets. The effects of successful deal-making are palpable, and he can literally watch as his diplomatic adversaries crumble under applied pressure. The way Trump separated China and Russia, brought Palestine to the negotiating table, and persuaded China to pacify North Korea amidst trade enforcement is nothing short of brilliance, IMO. Trump even had the good sense to have Arabella, Ivanka&#039;s daughter, sing Xi Jinping a lullaby in Mandarin... just think about the level of respect he showed to an equal adversary without resorting to groveling like Obama. Foreign policy allows Trump to be himself in a successful way, as a strategic thinker, as a personal charmer, and as a shrewd negotiater.<br><br>I don&#039;t know why he can&#039;t get his domestic policy up to par, though. I get that Trump has no legal or political allies because the bureaucracy, the court system, and Congress is filled with globalists, lobbyists, cronies, etc., but come on... you should be making progress at this point. I&#039;m happy that he&#039;s got the bare minimum of what he can possibly do out of the way, but he needs to start moving mountains if he wants a successful presidency by getting what it takes to leverage the American political system.

If Trump can slow the rapid collapse predicted to Obamacare to a gradual phasing out to something else while we wait for a 2018 sweep, then he can stop millions of people from getting hurt. Plus, he can have weapons to use against RINOs when he starts pushing them out in the 2018 primaries. <br><br>It&#039;s also not like Trump to reveal his hand to the public. Remember, he was talking about doing all he can to work with Paul Ryan on the first iteration of Ryancare while Breitbart released a tape about how Paul Ryan will never, ever help Trump... one week later Ryancare collapsed. I imagine that Trump needs to build his case to conservative voters about just how evil these RINO cunts really are. Maybe in 2018 Paul Ryan will go from 85% of the primary vote to 8.5%, once they see how hard Trump had to compromise with a REPUBLICAN Congress who was working against him.","time":1493859791,"resto":123982462,"id":"GNx++eTh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123994513,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:03:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123993664\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123993664<\/a><br>Then name something.","time":1493859818,"resto":123982462,"id":"K91zfNUb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123994526,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)21:03:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123991630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123991630<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We cannot abandon Trump just yet<\/span><br>We didn&#039;t abandon Trump, he abandoned us, starting with Gen.

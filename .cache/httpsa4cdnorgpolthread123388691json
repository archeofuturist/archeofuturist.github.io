The intersectional feminists that push transgender bullshit and general illogical feelings based retardation can only be broken by embracing the logical conclusions of their constructivism.

Dolezal is the perfect shameless troll.","filename":"607BA5B9-81E0-4F5A-B4FE-FC33B7C1E554-577-000000B822207828_tmp","ext":".jpg","w":467,"h":700,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493503500321,"time":1493503500,"md5":"lAx39kWk8ONzy5eGkMXvfg==","fsize":40252,"resto":0,"id":"REtYay33","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-ultimate-feminist-troll","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123389486,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)18:11:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123388691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123388691<\/a><br>I agree this mentally diseased sub human is hilarious","time":1493503880,"resto":123388691,"id":"He48kmpI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123391097,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)18:24:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s fucking hilarious to watch her use the exacts same logic and language of transgenderism and then have the feminist saying it doesn&#039;t make any sense.

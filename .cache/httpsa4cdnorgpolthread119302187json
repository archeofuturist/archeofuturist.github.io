Mere seconds before his death, Oswald was captured on camera saying &quot;This is all a setup... I&#039;m just a patsy&quot;. Ruby was immediately arrested, held without bail, and sentenced to die. From prison, Ruby sent letters to investigators on the Kennedy case claiming he had special information and that he &quot;needed to tell the real truth&quot;. In 1966, however, his conviction was overturned by the Texas Criminal Court of Appeals and he was released on bail awaiting his second trial.

Throughout his investigation, his office was bugged, vandalized, his family threatened, his coworkers offered much better, higher-paying jobs, and his health deteriorated significantly. In 1969, he indicted Clay Shaw on charges of conspiracy to commit murder and treason (the latter later dropped) in relation to the assassination of John F. Kennedy. His case was based primarily on ballistics, physiology and the testimony of witnesses and associated of Oswald, Ruby, Shaw and a handful of others, all of whom had coincidentally been incarcerated since the assassination of JFK.<\/span><br><br>How about now, anon?","time":1491203467,"resto":119302187,"id":"MR5gEvYB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119302983,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)03:16:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119302641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119302641<\/a><br>How is investigating who killed Kennedy going to do shit?

Johnson, signed an executive order mandating the creation of the Warren Commission. Personally chosen by Johnson, senators, congressmen, current and former members of the CIA, and a former president of the World Bank led the investigation into the death of JFK. Testimony was heard of gunshots heard by the Grassy Knoll (a hill 118 yards from where Oswald is believed to have fired), policemen aiming rifles propped up on fences before any shots were heard, plumes of smoke from nearby bridges, and men in suits quickly disrobing to reveal work clothes underneath. Most of this testimony was deemed &quot;unreliable, hearsay, false, or all three&quot; by Earl Warren, then Chief Justice of the United States. Following the publication of the Warren Report, professional attorneys have examined and tested the legal work done by the commission. In the words of New Jersey state attorney Matthew Steinler: &quot;there is no clear consensus on the quality or ethicality of the Warren Commission, but the general feeling out there is that, if the case were to go to trial, a jury would have concluded that there were multiple shooters.&quot; Surprisingly, two years after making that statement in 1974, Matthew Steinler died of a heart attack at the age of 38.<\/span>","filename":"list-9-things-warren-commission","ext":".jpg","w":840,"h":629,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491204718220,"time":1491204718,"md5":"6he57jF9RHy+ZrhHY9cknQ==","fsize":86208,"resto":119302187,"id":"MR5gEvYB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

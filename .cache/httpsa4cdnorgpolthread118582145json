They are progressive zombies, hoping for open borders, love universal healthcare, and don&#039;t give two shits about culture and heritage. If it were up to them this country would be worse than Sweden. And we&#039;re already pretty close.<br><br>Now that sounds pretty fucking bleak. And it is. But the lefties have idiotically given us a huge advantage. They&#039;ve split their vote. 3 times, 4 if you count Green. If this were the US, and the lefties all voted dem, then they would win 100% of the time. Luckily for us, the leftist idiots have decided to make three parties. NDP= Actual Communists. Liberals= Socialists that pay lip service to get elected. Bloc= Quebec&#039;s own brand of leftism (I know some Quebecois is going to complain about this, but 2 elections ago, you all went Orange in protest, not blue and not red, orange, so fuck off)<br><br>So that leaves some wiggle room to get Mad Max elected. The most important thing is to fracture the left&#039;s vote, even if it means giving the Greens and NDP a few more seats, as long as it comes out of the Liberal&#039;s seats and not the Conservative&#039;s. We must divide and conquer.<br><br>This also means 1 very important thing. No matter what, even if Mad Max isn&#039;t picked, even if the Grand Jew&#039;leary wins the nomination, we have to back them 100%. I don&#039;t like a huge portion of the conservative party platform. They still pander to old guard Neocons too hard.

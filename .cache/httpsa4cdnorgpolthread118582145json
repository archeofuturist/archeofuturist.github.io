They are progressive zombies, hoping for open borders, love universal healthcare, and don&#039;t give two shits about culture and heritage. If it were up to them this country would be worse than Sweden. And we&#039;re already pretty close.<br><br>Now that sounds pretty fucking bleak. And it is. But the lefties have idiotically given us a huge advantage. They&#039;ve split their vote. 3 times, 4 if you count Green. If this were the US, and the lefties all voted dem, then they would win 100% of the time. Luckily for us, the leftist idiots have decided to make three parties. NDP= Actual Communists. Liberals= Socialists that pay lip service to get elected. Bloc= Quebec&#039;s own brand of leftism (I know some Quebecois is going to complain about this, but 2 elections ago, you all went Orange in protest, not blue and not red, orange, so fuck off)<br><br>So that leaves some wiggle room to get Mad Max elected. The most important thing is to fracture the left&#039;s vote, even if it means giving the Greens and NDP a few more seats, as long as it comes out of the Liberal&#039;s seats and not the Conservative&#039;s. We must divide and conquer.<br><br>This also means 1 very important thing. No matter what, even if Mad Max isn&#039;t picked, even if the Grand Jew&#039;leary wins the nomination, we have to back them 100%. I don&#039;t like a huge portion of the conservative party platform. They still pander to old guard Neocons too hard.

I didn&#039;t say it was &#039;equivalent&#039; to tyranny; I said it was one of the trademarks and signatures of tyranny, which it is. It was a central statement of the Conservative party of Canada that they would deliver a government which was &#039;transparent&#039; in the development and dialogue over their policies. You may say it&#039;s &#039;weak&#039; for someone to argue that their betrayal of that electoral promise was more than a broken promise, but many Canadians would argue that you&#039;re diminishing it&#039;s significance. The fourth estate is what the people rely on after an election to keep a government honest, to keep them in check; that and the opposition parties. I&#039;m arguing that Stephen Harper&#039;s arrogance and haughtiness toward the people and the press was more than a broken promise. It was a outright betrayal of one of the central planks of the Conservative Party during most of his tenure. It was also a betrayal of one of the cornerstones of democracy, whether it&#039;s here, the US, or anywhere else. One of the reason Trump is so popular is because he&#039;s seen as open and willing to take questions .. he doesn&#039;t shy away when he&#039;s challenged on something. People love him for that. Harper was the opposite of what we&#039;ve seen with Trump and the press. The fact that you&#039;re willing to dismiss the importance of &#039;transparency,&#039; and that you seem willing to give the Conservatives a pass on that, suggests that you don&#039;t understand one of the core reasons they were so utterly rejected in the last election .. because of an almost complete vacuum in the area of transparency. Ask yourself how long a marriage will last without transparency, and you&#039;ll understand why a lack of it in government is perceived no less as tyranny.","time":1490665713,"resto":118582145,"id":"Km5gJY6Q","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118594563,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:49:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118589385\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118589385<\/a><br>thats to vote for the candidate of a party not for a real election","time":1490665766,"resto":118582145,"id":"fe6Zee2y","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118594650,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:50:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118587683\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118587683<\/a><br><br>There&#039;s Citoyens au pouvoir in Quebec, and also the Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec or Parti Qu\u00e9becois depending on who you ask","time":1490665818,"resto":118582145,"id":"JrVGaV+x","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118595042,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:53:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118585861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118585861<\/a><br>Harper sold us out to China, expanded TFW, expanded immigration, etc.<br><br>Why would Bernier be any different?<br><br>Repeat after me leafs: ALL MAJOR PARTIES ARE SHIT<br><br>The road to a new party is through provincialism and a Western\/Quebec alliance.

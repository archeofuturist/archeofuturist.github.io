I&#039;m 18 he&#039;s 17 FYI so inb4 underage. To get some background information im white and rich, my dad owns a law firm. This kid is black, comes from a relatively poor family and are are terrible with finances. The kid went into debt buying himself jordans and new T shirts. Before i continue i&#039;m just adding that because SJWs will argue that i&#039;m more privileged then him, i don&#039;t actually care about skin colour. So there&#039;s recent new anti-bullying legislation and my dad used it in a civil law suit against my bully since he beat me up off school property (during lunch hour). Now their family had to move out of the house since they didn&#039;t 24K (what they had to pay) PLUS they barley got money from the mortgage because the extra money they did get they will have to use to pay off their debts. They now are applying for state housing.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 how did u do this bruh<\/span><br>Well assault, harassment, bullying, intimidation, and extortion are all crimes. Plus when he punched me in the head a bunch of times it could have brain damage which is why the suit is so high.","filename":"belfort","ext":".jpg","w":704,"h":528,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493254523045,"time":1493254523,"md5":"5jUnjJ\/iZZ+P8kAPIvythQ==","fsize":24636,"resto":0,"id":"ECpbuFLm","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"my-dad-just-used-trudeaus-laws-against-the-sjw","country_name":"Canada","replies":160,"images":14,"unique_ips":83,"tail_size":50},{"no":122968936,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:56:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122968746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122968746<\/a><br>Actually, this just makes you sound like a pussy who whines to the establishment to solve your problems","time":1493254615,"resto":122968746,"id":"Kw7GGcr7","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122969080,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:58:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122968936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122968936<\/a><br>You do realize the courts, police, and criminal justice system is there for a reason right?","time":1493254686,"resto":122968746,"id":"ECpbuFLm","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122969134,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:58:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122968746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122968746<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;leaf<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pussy beta<\/span><br><br>like pottery","time":1493254711,"resto":122968746,"id":"7IvuhhaC","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122969215,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:59:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122968746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122968746<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OPs image is laughing at him<\/span><br><br>pussy.","time":1493254748,"resto":122968746,"id":"KTHotzg1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122969229,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)20:59:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122969080\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122969080<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh bullying<\/span><br>You sound like a cuck to me.

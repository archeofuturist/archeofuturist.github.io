So Vucic&#039;s party has so much more political power, monetary capacity and drowned out all the other candidates by essentially controlling all the media with his very powerful advertising campaign...<br><br>Think of it like this, you have the Democrat and Republican party (most countries have 2 strong parties), one in essence has a huge fight they all go their own seperate ways, sort of like the democrat party now in the US.

I&#039;m not going to go deep into why the wars started and who were the good\/bad guys, it doesn&#039;t matter for this topic. In Serbia as soon as the wars started, anti war and anti Milosevic protest started, first in 1991 when tanks cleared hundreds of thousands of people out the streets. During the next 10 years, at least 7-8 more similar semi-violent protest were held until Milosevic was brought down. During that time, as he had all the power in the country, the media was heavily censored and journalists and political figures were often assassinated. Somewhere around the end of 90s a government was formed along with the Radical Party (the first party ever in Yugoslavia to rule along with the Socialist) and here in story comes our current PM Aleksandar Vucic. At the time he was a information minister and notorious for his right wing policies and assassinations of journalists (many murders are associated with him, but no evidence was ever found, the witnesses always disappear or decide to stay silent) <br><br>In 2000 on 5th of October, the protests finally reached critical mass and Bulldozer revolution happened(see wikipedia for details), Milosevic was arrested and the Democrats took the government. Democrats ruled the country for the next 12 years, but nothing important happened in that time period<br><br>Fast forward to 2008, Vucic decides he is no longer a right wing nationalist but a centre pro european politician, he reorganizes a huge part of the Radical party and creates his own &quot;Progressive Party of Serbia&quot;.

In its most common usage, the word &#039;siddhi&#039; refers to an ability that is a natural and inherent faculty of our true identities as eternally alive souls. The soul is smaller than an atom and larger than the universe. The soul is infinitely small and infinitely large. The soul is ALL-PERFECT AND EVER-PERFECT. The soul is the storehouse of ALL ENERGY, ALL POWER AND ALL STRENGTH. The soul is PURE CONSCIOUSNESS. The soul possesses ALL siddhis and there are an INFINITE number of siddhis. Among all of these siddhis, there are considered to be eight major siddhis. Siddhis can be awakened through a variety of methods. In Patanjali&#039;s Yoga Sutras IV.1, it is stated:<br><br>&quot;Siddhis may be attained through birth, the use of herbs, incantations, self-discipline or samadhi.&quot;<br><br>Here is a list of the eight major siddhis (in no particular order):<br><br>Laghima siddhi: Making your body and\/or anything else as light as you want.<br><br>Garima siddhi: Making your body and\/or anything else as heavy as you want.<br><br>Mahima siddhi: Making your body and\/or anything else as large as you want.<br><br>Anima siddhi: Making your body and\/or anything else as small as you want.<br><br>Prapti siddhi: Having unrestricted access to any and\/or all places.<br><br>Prakamya siddhi: Fulfillment of whatever you desire.<br><br>Isitva siddhi: Control over any and\/or all of the laws of nature.<br><br>Vasitva siddhi: Being able to control any and\/or all beings.<br><br>&quot;A man is a god in ruins. When men are innocent, life shall be longer, and shall pass into the immortal, as gently as we awake from dreams.&quot; - Ralph Waldo Emerson","filename":"yogi","ext":".jpg","w":624,"h":850,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492528063026,"time":1492528063,"md5":"\/Ap+ej9b\/ZGb2IUpbxV\/7w==","fsize":75486,"resto":121693310,"id":"SoXa08vl","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121693981,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)11:07:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121693310\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121693310<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121693386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121693386<\/a><br>yes","filename":"d8d97a34-4292-42b9-b9b7-8087ca456779","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492528072365,"time":1492528072,"md5":"o93R9rIkfj69qbEtV\/fA3Q==","fsize":204882,"resto":121693310,"id":"gwMRkJdc","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

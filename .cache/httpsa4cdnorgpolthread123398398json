In chimp societies (Our closest living relatives), conflict doesn&#039;t exist, because there is hierarchy. The alpha automatically assumes respect from the other chimps; the beta chimps put their heads down, cover their groin, and act submissive. The females, likewise, play their own role as &quot;Alpha parents&quot; to the children. Without law, chimps live perfectly fine.<br><br>Without law, cities would fall into chaos, because the law fortified a system. Thieves only exist because they think they have legitimate claim to the stuff they steal; they fight for their treasures, because they don&#039;t recognize &quot;Alphas&quot;, except for family members.<br><br>How this relates to depression, is that depression, likewise, is a byproduct of a socially-repressed society. Depression is loneliness and unrequited validation. How can you be validated in a society that you don&#039;t validate? Modern civilization has the appearance of a &quot;society&quot;, but the validation that others give us is meaningless, because our bosses only pay us because they have to, and our wives only marry us and have our kids because they have to, and we have to pay taxes otherwise they will arrest us. We&#039;re given no room for genuine human-human socialization and validation. Without validation, we could be among millions of people yet feel so alone.","time":1493511037,"resto":123398398,"id":"XksVtcdI","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

The mass media danced his dance of fraud and lie. <br><br>Without exception, and they flew each day new attacks on the brains of the people, like on cities, which were already destroyed and still had to be devasteted. <br><br>The power of finance, the whole monetary system, was in the claws of the enemy since a long time. And with this weapon, he had crushed the world piece by piece. <br><br>The military had been bought by him and he sent out his dull mercenaries, who seemed to have no more own will, against everyone, who tried to resist him. <br><br>What would be in the future?

The majority, however, do. My company gives a woman 14 weeks full pay and she may ask for an additional 6 at her bosses discretion, though she must use it all consecutively. Men get a lump sum of 30 days to be used within a year of birth for any reason (basically a fuckload of PTO). There is no reason to force a small company to pay people to not show up. It is a benefit companies provide in lieu of compensation and a method through which they compete for talent.","time":1493134994,"resto":122743684,"id":"Bb96xyHB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

I&#039;m not going to allow myself to be completely hobbled into thinking control is bad just because I don&#039;t like who controls the media and economy now. The question is: Is the system of control over you in alignment with your own desires? If not, then people will rebel. If it is, people will live with it. <br><br>The current paradigm sucks because the powers controlling the media and economy are completely separated from the people. Communists think there are huge horizontal classes that blanket the world, and while this is true to an extent, the working class Joe of America isn&#039;t the same as the working class Li of China. Our media is meant for everyone, but it doesn&#039;t MEAN much to anyone. I would rather have blacks live in their own area, under their own rules, self actualizing their own control over their own media and economy. Muslims too. Asians and on and on. Hell, if you want to have a country like America where people are genuinely trying to carry on the experiment of diversity, that&#039;s cool too. <br><br>I would like to live around people that are already similar to me. My local world has gotten very alien to me. I feel out of place in an area that my family has lived in for generations. That&#039;s humiliating. <br><br>Strong self actualization is fascism. However, fascism is only truly achieved when the individual GENUINELY believes in the message because they also drive it. Its a self sustaining fusion, I believe, which can create extremely cohesive environments for people to concentrate and create. <br><br>I also encourage anons to imagine that the &#039;right&#039; version of fascism may not have been achieved yet. All I know is that I spent over two conscious decades-a-liberal in mind, but also depressed. Strong expressions of nationalism have really helped me get out of the fog more often.

I guess I should have been more clear. Certainly only tax payers should vote because otherwise the system breaks immediately and turns into shit, no question about it.

It should either be only white male tax payers who are landowners or just white male taxpayers, both landowners and not. Either way you get my general point, greatly restricted voting privileges like the kind america originally had. Suffrage is not a right that applies to everyone.

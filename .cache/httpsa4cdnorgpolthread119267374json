It&#039;s only at the expense of these very same people that you bring in all sorts of outsiders to live with them, and the outsiders form their own groups that fracture and split the society up until the fractures inevitably cause the collapse of said society. It&#039;s the natural discourse of man to separate. So it only makes sense that our form of government should mimic this in it&#039;s structure.","filename":"1474850233831","ext":".jpg","w":1774,"h":1602,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":112,"tim":1491182153796,"time":1491182153,"md5":"68si7dZqoeSZ+G8nzHlyLg==","fsize":536511,"resto":119267374,"id":"ZOEbWdJq","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119273364,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:25:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119270693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119270693<\/a><br>No, I meant against the non-white communities.

How can you say English is a Latin language when 90% of the used words are completely Germanic? Most languages have a shitton of Latin vocabulary because scientific terms come from Latin, does that mean every language is Latin? Are you actually this retarded? Besides, how is this even relevant? English is objectively a Germanic language and is the language that&#039;s used pretty much everywhere, not Latin or Italian.","time":1491347428,"resto":119507251,"id":"w2KhlFSa","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119531534,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:10:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119530973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119530973<\/a><br>It is not desu<br>Their are clearly sources about this war<br>http:\/\/web.mit.edu\/2.009\/www\/experi<wbr>ments\/steamCannon\/ArchimedesSteamCa<wbr>nnon.html<br><br>Also look at the mechanism of antikythera, an ancient analogue computer","time":1491347437,"resto":119507251,"id":"OgwxLasi","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119531705,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:12:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119531534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119531534<\/a><br>well shit<br>colour me impressed","filename":"merchant shock","ext":".jpg","w":187,"h":204,"tn_w":114,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491347528978,"time":1491347528,"md5":"zPFiyZhcf+T8rDby11FO\/g==","fsize":17194,"resto":119507251,"id":"G71xY75Z","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":119531709,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:12:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119507251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119507251<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mediterranean authoritarian family and low trust society vs high trust, absolute nuclear family, high iq nordic society<\/span><br>how is that even a question","time":1491347531,"resto":119507251,"id":"aloTH0k\/","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":119531710,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:12:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mediterranean was the beacon of culture and innovation for centuries<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nords have Legos and barbarianism<\/span>","time":1491347531,"resto":119507251,"id":"nYUWcX50","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119531799,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:12:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119530350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119530350<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they should have used romans swords and armors, but they used their own ones.<\/span><br>that has nothing to do with technology by itself but with a change in warfare<br>not even the Romans themselves were using classical Roman tools anymore late into the Empire, warfare was more cavalry based then and concentrated in mainland Europe<br><br>and in any case, he is right about production and organization, as well as urbanization<br>you&#039;d have to wait till the industrial revolution to see such large scale organization and raw material productions, as well as standards of living in many regards","time":1491347572,"resto":119507251,"id":"\/\/rhEP0T","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":119531866,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:13:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119531709\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119531709<\/a><br>we have higher IQ than nordic countries","filename":"countries by IQ","ext":".png","w":272,"h":502,"tn_w":67,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491347609470,"time":1491347609,"md5":"Mm8h8J+1gYefXNCKdnaKpQ==","fsize":26714,"resto":119507251,"id":"G71xY75Z","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":119531872,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:13:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119525076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119525076<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119529463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119529463<\/a><br>At least I&#039;m a Nord so you can&#039;t blame me for being retarded.","time":1491347611,"resto":119507251,"id":"QBo8yz0d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119531877,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:13:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119526402\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119526402<\/a><br>Their relationship makes me want to kill myself.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I&#039;ll never get a gf when she&#039;s 18 and still kind of innocent.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I&#039;ll never become rich and famous with her<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I&#039;ll never get to have beautiful Nord\/med children<\/span><br>I don&#039;t want to live in this cruel world.","time":1491347614,"resto":119507251,"id":"rWGMD7gi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119531907,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:13:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119531503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119531503<\/a><br>We have adopted a lot of romance vocabulary.

I&#039;ve been coming here a long time, but the fact that the entire city if Berkeley is like the fucking Stepford Wives of violent leftism is insane.<br><br>It&#039;s well understood that lefties control most universities with an iron fist, and they are probably, at the very least, in cahoots with the deep state that&#039;s been rearing it&#039;s head since Trump announced his campaign, but this? Boys, we&#039;re fucked if the corruption runs to a local level. How do you even combat that? The media doesn&#039;t care, and pretty much every single institution with ties to the government is pushing a leftist agenda.<br><br>Honestly, if liberals want to quit being filthy kikes and just openly advocate for more localized control around the country, I am for it. But that&#039;s never the case, as liberals always claim that it&#039;s the job of the judiciary to suppress the fuck out of state laws that run counter to their agenda. States rights for me, but not for thee.<br><br>tl;dr is BAMN&#039;s control of the city of Berkeley an indication of a wider issue of absolute leftist corruption at a local and state level, and if so is there anything we can even do about it at this point?","filename":"tmp_12987-images(2)1788148471","ext":".png","w":178,"h":178,"tn_w":178,"tn_h":178,"tim":1493208991985,"time":1493208991,"md5":"k1kMWWiKm1LT2EBKMnD7Yg==","fsize":4588,"resto":0,"id":"x4wrm3ex","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"leftist-corruption-at-all-levels-of-society","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122879187,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)08:36:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Get back to me when you&#039;re ready to impeach Trump and I&#039;ll take your whining about corruption more seriously.","time":1493210166,"resto":122877643,"id":"z2r+0Z1h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122879507,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)08:40:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122879187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122879187<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the entire government and media is against Trump and watch his every move<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the best proof of corruption they have is him using naughty language and unsubstantiated hearsay about him being a Russian spy<\/span><br><br>lel","filename":"tmp_12987-1492897071512149510652","ext":".png","w":469,"h":699,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493210418143,"time":1493210418,"md5":"3MYPzP8K+RR4CtvIDbI6UA==","fsize":524193,"resto":122877643,"id":"x4wrm3ex","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122879583,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)08:41:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"Voting doesnt work.

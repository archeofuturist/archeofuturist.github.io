The classrooms are oriented around the students, and teachers only visit the classes. Additionally, the retarded kids have a right to attend regular public schools as well, and many parents do push their retarded children into being in the same classes as regular kids. For the super dysfunctional retards, a special teacher is assigned, but it&#039;s not uncommon for a fully autistic boy or girl to be taught in the same classroom as regular kids, so low grades don&#039;t mean failure necessarily.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Teaching styles and teaching competency are shit<\/span><br>It was pretty rare for me to find a competent teacher - they tend to think of themselves as &quot;just any other civil servant,&quot; like some sort of pencil pusher in City Hall - but even the passionate ones heavily relied on rote memorization and other teaching styles from the past with limited effectiveness. The result is that kids don&#039;t really learn much in class, and often have to attend after school cram school in order to actually learn the material. Additionally, I found that classroom discipline was total shit, with many kids allowed to talk through the whole class and disrupt learning for the good students.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Just different attitudes about what is a &quot;good score&quot;<\/span><br>It was common for me to see average class grades of 55\/100 on tests in my schools. The teachers don&#039;t think this is particularly bad. They often told me out of a form of humility that their students just aren&#039;t very bright, without attributing any blame to their shit teaching style or shit classroom management. In general, most students don&#039;t try for a perfect 100%, though, and they understand that they could get as low as 60% and pass, so the goal posts are just different.","filename":"NCM_0017","ext":".jpg","w":3264,"h":1960,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1490050591221,"time":1490050591,"md5":"N0STa9eL5KCgfe6czxjv+w==","fsize":1661280,"resto":117539265,"id":"GrGEmNCX","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117545551,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)18:58:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117545155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117545155<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the letter grade doesn&#039;t mean anything<\/span><br><br>Then why did you create a handicap so your A is equivalent to our B?

Trump is damned if he does respond and damned if he doesn&#039;t. The problem is he sort of cornered himself into this box based off his tweets. If he retaliated too much by demolishing all three air bases it would be viewed as a serious act of aggression with an imediate response from heavy hitter governments, possibly even retaliatory action. If he bombed too weak, like some have suggested he did last night, it is looked at as a weak hand and nothing more than a bluff. His warning to the Russians an hour before the bombing supports such a claim, but holds very little water overall.<br><br>Ultimately, Trumps intervention into Syria has proven one thing without a doubt and that is his changed stance toward invasion let alone U.S. involvement. Either way, it should be a fun couple of months.","filename":"1491587259989","ext":".jpg","w":959,"h":1682,"tn_w":71,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491607453286,"time":1491607453,"md5":"IbJDtO3ADhxAMI6LZcO3nA==","fsize":317201,"resto":120043022,"id":"GSOqATHl","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

This law obligates all the citizens to obtain and to carry the biometric ID cards that will contain not only the holder&#039;s name, age and photo (like an ordinary passport does), but are also designed to encode fingertips and facial profile. By now, the Israeli citizens are obligated to submit the face prints and are also pushed to voluntarily give their fingertips.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU<\/span><br><br>The worrisome part of this innovation is that all the holder&#039;s information will be stored in the national biometric database, not on the card itself, like in other countries with a similar identification system. The problem with the consolidated database is not only a risk of it being hacked, leaked or illegally exploited in some other way.<br>Israeli police officers will be authorized to access the database to identify a person not carrying the ID card and they will also be able to copy and save this data into their personal gadgets.<br>At this point, the potential for misuse and mishandling of personal information becomes enourmous. <br>Moreover, the consolidated database potentially enables the authorities to collect information on the citizens every time they use the ID card.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;FOLLOW THE MONEY<\/span><br><br>According to a number of journalists and activists, the expansion of the ID card system seems to be pushed primarily by Hewlett Packard which has been working with the Israeli government on the matters of biometric databases since the 90s.<br>The next step will be to export this technology to other countries.<br>That&#039;s why this law must be of concern to us all.<br><br>http:\/\/therealnews.com\/t2\/index.php<wbr>?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31<wbr>&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=18591","filename":"1984","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490736987653,"time":1490736987,"md5":"UYnr5\/UVwAo3QHc087KHwQ==","fsize":71274,"resto":0,"id":"WbpQKquM","country":"RU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"serfs-of-the-state-biometric-database-edition","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118701685,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)17:48:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118700214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118700214<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that no man might buy or sell unless he had the number of the beast, or his name, on his right hand or forehead. <\/span><br><br><br>It&#039;s literally happening.","time":1490737687,"resto":118700214,"id":"RkYOj2KN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118702391,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)17:53:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118701685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118701685<\/a><br>Yeah, it will be easier to collect information on a citizen in allegedly democratic system than in fucking USSR and DDR","time":1490738018,"resto":118700214,"id":"WbpQKquM","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":118704829,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)18:13:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118700214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118700214<\/a><br>Bump<br><br>We need a meme war","time":1490739216,"resto":118700214,"id":"xGqFVuQ4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

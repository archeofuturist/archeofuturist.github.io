You guys have the upper hand here. The antifags dislike any kind of organisation and leadership, this is where you could shine. Employ riot police tactics. I&#039;m sure there are some of you that are familiar with this. <br><br>These are the basics - a defensive line with large shields in front. Behind each large shield you have a fighter with a baton or some similar weapon. Then you have extraction groups of 4-6, armed with batons, maybe smaller bucklers. The focus should be on keeping the defensive line intact. The fighers should work together with the shields to lash out counterattacks - shield blocks attack, fighter signals the shield to lower, hits the attacking antifag that&#039;s been left open for attack. Lastly the extraction groups should target agitators - the real troublemakers, if you eliminate these, the sheeple will scatter. The fighers lash out, maybe use pepper spray or some shit to temporarly tie down the antifags, shields open up, extraction group grabs one guy and drags them behind the shield wall, that&#039;s where you subdue them and effectively take them out of the fight. Last and most importantly, behind all of these units are the coordinators that lead the shields, reserves and extraction groups. Do this and you become the riot police that have been ordered to stand down.","filename":"150129105832327195_8","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":662,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1492942299258,"time":1492942299,"md5":"lRGoZkkcdlOXRUPKZykpoQ==","fsize":125449,"resto":0,"id":"O3D6XnZ+","country":"EE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"step-it-up-altright","country_name":"Estonia","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":122407523,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)06:22:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1492942928,"resto":122406834,"id":"O3D6XnZ+","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"}]}

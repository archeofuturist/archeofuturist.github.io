In Revelation 5:5, Jesus is referred to as the Lion of the tribe of Judah. In 1 Peter 5:8, Satan is compared to a lion, seeking someone to devour. The point is this, both Jesus and Satan, to a certain extent, have similarities to lions. Jesus is similar to a lion in that He is the King, He is royal and majestic. Satan is similar to a lion in that he seeks to devour other creatures. That is where the similarities between Jesus, Satan, and lions end, however. Jesus and Satan are like lions in very different ways.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The idea of a \u201cbright morning star\u201d is a star that outshines all the others. Satan, as perhaps the most beautiful creation of God, probably the most powerful of all the angels, was a bright morning star. Jesus, as God incarnate, the Lord of the universe, is THE bright and morning star. Jesus is the most holy and powerful \u201clight\u201d in all the universe. So, while both Jesus and Satan can be described as \u201cbright morning stars,\u201d in no sense is this equating Jesus and Satan. Satan is a created being. His light only exists to the extent that God created it. Jesus is the light of the world (John 9:5). Only Jesus\u2019 light is self-existent. Satan may be a bright morning star, but he is only a poor imitation of the one true bright morning star, Jesus Christ, the light of the world.<\/span>","filename":"1493382737998","ext":".jpg","w":445,"h":446,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493490446013,"time":1493490446,"md5":"fQnMlxiJ+g0A0QQHeNgIhQ==","fsize":22747,"resto":123347015,"id":"4L980+m3","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":123362651,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)14:27:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123360995\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123360995<\/a><br>Jesus is God.

Everyone talks about what meme division they were in during the meme wars and the ranks and roles they held, but what if we actually made it into a reality. What if we organized in groups each with their own specific task, with their own management, all of which would be part of a greater pol army. We complain over the the shareblue shills shitposting on pol yet we were made to do the same thing. In fact, we do it better than anyone else out there. Why don&#039;t we become the shareblue for the rest of the internet. We need to utilize the tactics of the jew and finally drive the stake through while we still have momentum. <br><br>pol is a silver bullet. <br><br>Anything that is on the other side of that bullet is good as gone, whether it&#039;s a presidential candidate or a livestream of a fucking flag. All we need is a gun to point that bullet. If we could focus our autism and our collective might at specific targets in an organized and deadly fashion, we could start being more than just a meme. More than a bunch nerds shitposting on their computers. More than a group of anons who share a hatred for jews. We could become one. As time goes on, society lives more and more on the web. We need to claim it for ourselves. Purge it of all the filth and grime that our society totes as progressive and strong. For the sake of our children and our children&#039;s children, this is the time that we must organize and show the world what we can really do.","filename":"kekistan","ext":".png","w":2133,"h":1281,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1490332374043,"time":1490332374,"md5":"selOP0AlnKHKfKmWpx8nKA==","fsize":143769,"resto":0,"id":"3D+ht2T6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-pol-army","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

They started WW1, killing millions of whites, just because they were jealous of the British Empire. Rather comically, they lost the war and lost territory to the British Empire as a result of their ineptitude. Also, unbeknownst to many, the G*rman invented communism and spread it to Russia during the war to weaken them. Eventually, this would kill millions of whites. The G*rman, deeply consumed by shame and anger, sought to re-establish himself as a somewhat relevant regional power. To try and achieve this, they elected a socialist, who fought in the aforementioned war and held a great grudge against the Anglo. In his bitterness, the G*rman created lies about G*rman superiority, to try and justify his lust for power and his neighbours\u2019 lands. Thus war was declared, and with all too much predictability, the G*rman lost another war, with many millions of whites being killed. Again, comically, the G*rman had his own lands taken over by Anglos. The G*rman was defeated. For now. Many years passed, and under the divine mercy of the Anglo, the G*rman was allowed to rebuild, and even to thrive. But the seed of guilt had been implanted in the minds of G*rmans, so as to keep them weak. The G*rman, utterly humiliated, now put his hope in the EU instead of his conquered homeland, and in his autism invited the Middle East to Europe. This was done so that G*rmans could finally live beside a people lower than them. And so it was the G*rman&#039;s blood lust continued, as these new guests killed many whites. But alas, just as the G*rman began to feel a fell hope, the Anglos had defeated them again with Brexit. Who knows what the future holds, but there is one thing certain - the Anglo will always be here to thwart the G*rman demon.","time":1493844123,"resto":123960297,"id":"Dw1CHTo0","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123960808,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:44:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123960297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123960297<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Neocons and &quot;Conservative Republicans&quot; being different<\/span>","time":1493844246,"resto":123960297,"id":"DSlywxpo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123961178,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:46:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123960297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123960297<\/a><br>Where is the &quot;industrial revolution was a mistake&quot; faction?","time":1493844397,"resto":123960297,"id":"q6ptEYyV","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123961362,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:47:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123960808\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123960808<\/a><br>They both are pro war, but the conservative republicans are more fiscally conservative than the noe-cons.

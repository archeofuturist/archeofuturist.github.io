He was found innocent and still executed. End of secular history. ACCORDING TO THE QURAN. Jesus was never executed. LOL!! They executed the wrong guy. Jesus lived long, got married and had kids.

Historical records however show that Alexander the Great died young at 33 years of age (356 - 323 B.C.), and believed he himself was divine, forcing others to recognize him as such. In India on the Hyphasis River (now Beas) Alexander erected twelve altars to twelve Olympian gods. Alexander died a pagan. Muhammed wasn&#039;t born until around 900 years later.

How can a Samaritan have led the Israelites astray at the time of Moses [about 1400 B.C.] when the city of Samaria was founded by King Omri in about 870 B.C. (see 1 Kings 16:24)?

It is obviously a fraud.<br><br>These are but a sample of inconsistencies in the Quran. A human historian would not have made such huge blunders. It is less likely a superior being like God himself would make such huge blunders. This book itself is so inconsistent that it proves Islam wrong from claiming inspiration from God.

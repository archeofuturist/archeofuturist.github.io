If you can get an equivalent service at $20, obviously demand goes way up. Perhaps another 700M people value &quot;airline&quot; tickets at $200 but not $400. In that case, economic benefits would also include $700M * ($200-$20). Start adding this into your pay off and you are getting closer to 1-2 years.<br><br>When you start taking a closer look, it gets better. For example, the airline industry is highly toxic. We still use leaded gas in planes and people living near airports have much high rates of developmental problems, lower IQs, etc. Humanitarian catastrophe plus tens of billions in damage every year we can do away with.<br><br>Consideration of these sorts of things make the ROI on a hyperloop start looking like something around 100% (one year pay off) pretty quick.

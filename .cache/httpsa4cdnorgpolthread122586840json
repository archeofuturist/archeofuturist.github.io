At this point is seems like our union is just holding together a bunch of people who are totally detached from one another, culturally, politically, and historically. The values and politics of Dixie are not at all like the values and politics of New England, and clearly such differences have been hampering progress in this country, creating strife, and creating political gridlock. I fear that if the country keeps its current course, things are going to start getting bloody. To an extent, we already see this in the form of brawls breaking out at pro-Trump\/anti-Trump rallies, how much longer until someone is killed? And how much longer until lots of people start to die? I think it would be a lot safer for everyone involved if we just parted ways.","filename":"HOLUP","ext":".png","w":100,"h":100,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":100,"tim":1493041449670,"time":1493041449,"md5":"gRvFaV\/gkP6LUT+ujTBBkQ==","fsize":20528,"resto":0,"id":"d7xLDEOf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dissolving-the-usa","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

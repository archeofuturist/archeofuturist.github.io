His fierce denouncement of globalism and neocon-interventionism, his passionate criticism of the &quot;disastrous&quot; Iraq war - gone. He hastily committed an act of military aggression against a sovereign nation in clear violation of international law, based on virtually the exact same kind of emotionally charged, ridiculous black propaganda that served as a pretext for the Iraq invasion. He subscribed to the deep state&#039;s and the &quot;lying fake news media&#039;s&quot; use of atrocity lie propaganda over rational thought, dialogue, the process of international law and impartial investigation, and instead cemented America&#039;s role as a terrorist rogue state, an &quot;exceptionalist&quot; country above the rules and obligations others have to abide by. This is the core of globalist neocon dogma. And this is why a large part of Trump&#039;s firecly anti-interventionist former support base has now (rightly) turned against him.","filename":"1462209885708","ext":".jpg","w":604,"h":604,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491642773647,"time":1491642773,"md5":"W8V9r8Ygju3D9NF7PCT3LA==","fsize":65120,"resto":120108464,"id":"I9jpFqlt","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120110831,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)05:13:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"Question for \/sg\/<br><br>If Assad turns out to be behind the chem attacks, would that change anything for you?

It doesn&#039;t and isn&#039;t able to. Government generally isn&#039;t able to regulate what people drink, eat, smoke or how they behave and live. Civil morality is always predominantly determined by culture. That is, social environment, heritage, religious beliefs, family values etc.<br>Not only is government fundamentally incapable of enforcing morality, but it is also inclined to enforcing immorality. In Australia and America, some states enforce better moral laws than others. Many states do not successfully enforce moral laws or enforce immoral laws. It is the existence of government monopolisation that better states are unable to able to act with sovereignty. This would actually force governments to enforce moral laws more efficiently under the pressure of competition (other states have to compete for population and revenue without the assistance of a federal government). The more decentralised our society becomes, the more power is given to groups that can now segregate themselves from others. This is the course of action required to establish a moral society, by decentralising all political power and allowing groups to secede from the wider culture.<br>A moral society will only be achieved by voluntary collectivisation and the efforts of culture.","time":1493483356,"resto":123319696,"id":"OUK3edZl","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123349755,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)12:29:44","name":"Anonymous","filename":"porco-espinho-renatofurtadocom-anarcocapitalista-ancap","ext":".png","w":1969,"h":1556,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":98,"tim":1493483384505,"time":1493483384,"md5":"v5Rvc0tKlGoIFifVZKNCtQ==","fsize":106183,"resto":123319696,"id":"O5hwcr1X","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":123349957,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)12:31:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123346579\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123346579<\/a><br><br>At the end of the day, preference is a black box which the government cannot see into.

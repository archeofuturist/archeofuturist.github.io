It utterly frustrates me and sometimes keeps me awake how what was once the greatest country of all, with such a rich heritage and such wonderous gifts to human civilization, has manged to utterly and irreversibly ruin itself in a matter of mere decades. There are people alive who saw France fall from the edge of revival under De Gaulle and who will see Macron inevitably repeat the mistakes both Hollande and Merkel made. We will live to see France snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. I can&#039;t deal with this feel.","filename":"262914e12a5d57eefcdd4c3e9ac59563[1]","ext":".jpg","w":236,"h":254,"tn_w":232,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490553402346,"time":1490553402,"md5":"T4xprh7n\/UyzunH05N2WWg==","fsize":9499,"resto":0,"id":"naBT1rVv","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"tfw-my-beloved-beautiful-france","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":12,"images":1,"unique_ips":8},{"no":118395709,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)14:38:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;We will live to see France snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.

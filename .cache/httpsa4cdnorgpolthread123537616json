Most flat Earth concepts have the north pole as the center of the disc, like OP&#039;s pic. If you want to find the truth, fly a plane over the equator record how long it takes. Then head south, much farther south, maybe 50 degrees, and fly over than line of latitude and record that flight time as well. If the second flight is shorter, and it will be significantly shorter, then it means the Earth is round. This is also proved by the fact that GPS, which works based off the latitude and longitude lines of the globe, still works in the southern hemisphere.<br><br>Another thing to consider is the existence of different map projections. There are a number of them out there (Mercator, WGS 84, etc.) and they are all different. Sometimes Greenland is the size of Africa and sometimes Antartica looks like the biggest continent. Why is this? Imagine you peeled an orange and were able to take the peel off in one piece. You now have a hollow circle. How do you place that orange peel on a flat, rectangular piece of paper (map)? There is going to be a certain amount of error every time. There would be no error if the Earth were flat.","time":1493592787,"resto":123537616,"id":"47Fk4Sal","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123540121,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)18:55:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123537616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123537616<\/a><br>Night sky is spinning in opposite directions on the two hemispheres.

When Mexico rejected the annexation of Texas by the United States, Polk achieved a sweeping victory in the Mexican\u2013American War, which resulted in the cession by Mexico of nearly the whole of what is now the American Southwest. He ensured a substantial reduction of tariff rates by replacing the &quot;Black Tariff&quot; with the Walker tariff of 1846, which pleased the less-industrialized states of his native South by rendering less expensive both imported and, through competition, domestic goods. He threatened war with the United Kingdom over the issue of which nation owned the Oregon Country, eventually reaching a settlement in which the British were made to sell the portion that became the Oregon Territory.<\/span>","filename":"pwXoy","ext":".jpg","w":964,"h":740,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1493063840620,"time":1493063840,"md5":"4y47YxOKez3WtoDwWaz3bg==","fsize":57430,"resto":122626747,"id":"6GOl2CWk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122629547,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)15:59:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122626747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122626747<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;George Washington <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Low tier<\/span><br><br>Are you fucking retarded?","filename":"1475434367180","ext":".png","w":691,"h":576,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1493063985614,"time":1493063985,"md5":"iaizCtpCy7Mg63Sugiqk9Q==","fsize":297901,"resto":122626747,"id":"DEzSL3CI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122630550,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:08:27","name":"Anonymous","filename":"fuku","ext":".png","w":1334,"h":1342,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493064507154,"time":1493064507,"md5":"rKuagqD8PYV6BDJYlwDCeg==","fsize":1065637,"resto":122626747,"id":"DEzSL3CI","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122630673,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:09:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122626747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122626747<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;&gt;reddit<\/span>","time":1493064568,"resto":122626747,"id":"CXzQSoRe","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"}]}

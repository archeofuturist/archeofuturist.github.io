When Mexico rejected the annexation of Texas by the United States, Polk achieved a sweeping victory in the Mexican\u2013American War, which resulted in the cession by Mexico of nearly the whole of what is now the American Southwest. He ensured a substantial reduction of tariff rates by replacing the &quot;Black Tariff&quot; with the Walker tariff of 1846, which pleased the less-industrialized states of his native South by rendering less expensive both imported and, through competition, domestic goods. He threatened war with the United Kingdom over the issue of which nation owned the Oregon Country, eventually reaching a settlement in which the British were made to sell the portion that became the Oregon Territory.<\/span>","filename":"pwXoy","ext":".jpg","w":964,"h":740,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1493063840620,"time":1493063840,"md5":"4y47YxOKez3WtoDwWaz3bg==","fsize":57430,"resto":122626747,"id":"6GOl2CWk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122629547,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)15:59:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122626747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122626747<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;George Washington <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Low tier<\/span><br><br>Are you fucking retarded?","filename":"1475434367180","ext":".png","w":691,"h":576,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1493063985614,"time":1493063985,"md5":"iaizCtpCy7Mg63Sugiqk9Q==","fsize":297901,"resto":122626747,"id":"DEzSL3CI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122630550,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:08:27","name":"Anonymous","filename":"fuku","ext":".png","w":1334,"h":1342,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493064507154,"time":1493064507,"md5":"rKuagqD8PYV6BDJYlwDCeg==","fsize":1065637,"resto":122626747,"id":"DEzSL3CI","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122630673,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:09:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122626747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122626747<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;&gt;reddit<\/span>","time":1493064568,"resto":122626747,"id":"CXzQSoRe","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122632185,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:21:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122630550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122630550<\/a><br>Much better","time":1493065305,"resto":122626747,"id":"6beVTMfz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122632504,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:24:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"andrew jackson was the greatest american who ever lived you fuck","time":1493065455,"resto":122626747,"id":"PYqGCIKf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122632657,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:25:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Eisenhower in shit tier<\/span><br>Holy shit, this list is fucking trash.

It&#039;s actually the exact opposite funnily enough, a Nazi-linked faction of the CIA (Allen Dulles, Walter Bedell Smith, George Bush) that were the key factions of the CIA that brought about the assassination. The people who think JFK got shot purely because of his executive order regarding the Federal Reserve are completely and utterly clueless about what happened behind the scenes. The only reason &quot;Jews&quot; (Israel) had an interest in his assassination was because he was against the US providing help to Israel becoming a nuclear power (remember this was before 1967, only after the Six Day War did Israel come into the US sphere of interest \/ offshore stabilizer against Arab Socialists). The Federal Reserve was minor, almost inconsequential when it came to his assassination, and if the CIA were against it, it would not have happened. The main players, Allen Dulles largely, carried it out because Kennedy was threatening the CIA power base and JFK was a dove who wanted peace with Castro compared to the CIA and deep state hawks. The final straw was when Kennedy&#039;s ambassador to South Vietnam Henry Cabot Lodge informed the agency boys that was going to make peace with Castro. Allen Dulles and the CIA top dogs were literally the opposite to the Jews... they were Nazi collaborators and he was personally involved with negotiating Hitler&#039;s escape to Argentina via Tenerife via a U-530. In return the US received tons of secret intelligence and information from the Abwehr, all the occult trauma-based mind control experiments, medical experiments by Mengele and co, Operation Paperclip and tons of other still-classified information from the Nazis. Dulles was also involved with negotiating peace with the Nazis after the Battle of Kursk Salient, which Dulles rejected. <br><br>Cliffs: \/pol\/ is completely retarded and views literally everything through their idiotic white nationalist lens.","time":1493066982,"resto":122626747,"id":"Bijpo6rX","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122635729,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:50:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122626747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122626747<\/a><br><br>Reminder that if you like anyone on this list, you are retarded","filename":"1478224899649","ext":".jpg","w":1836,"h":2761,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493067005191,"time":1493067005,"md5":"6Xiqo1wSxkjdaLFjYGdPPQ==","fsize":1720178,"resto":122626747,"id":"R+8qXz2F","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122635867,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:51:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122626747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122626747<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Either Roosevelt<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bad<\/span><br><br>These just are objectively untrue, even if FDR was a socialist hack<br><br>:^)","time":1493067067,"resto":122626747,"id":"GRNbXACr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122635933,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:51:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122626747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122626747<\/a><br>Where&#039;s the kike tier???

Why did Trump&#039;s foreign policy only change when McMaster became his chief national security adviser, while Kushner was by his side from the beginning of his campaign? The only kike-tier thing Trump has done is making Kushner a Middle-East &quot;diplomat&quot; despite his lack of experience in the area, and because he wants to solve the Israel-Palestine crisis.

About how well the refugees are integrating into the country and accepting the culture for what it is there. And how good it feels for Europe to be lending a helping hand to those in need whilst woman are ganged raped and children are dealt with in the same way. <br><br>Tell me one thing that I could look forward to once America tries accepting these types of refugees? I generally don&#039;t have hatred towards people for no good reason but I do hate mistreatment of woman and from what I&#039;ve seen in those videos, woman have become main targets for this type of shit. <br><br>So tell me a good thing about this new wAve of refugees. Don&#039;t have any? Then tell me some of the cons.","filename":"6tag-1370667496-1276050125846152594_1370667496","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":540,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493747410587,"time":1493747410,"md5":"0\/ubmid0sen991MHsOcqJA==","fsize":38067,"resto":0,"id":"hb5Tcwzu","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"islam-good","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123795000,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)13:55:51","name":"Anonymous","filename":"mmm fbbrtttplllpppt","ext":".jpg","w":456,"h":810,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493747751600,"time":1493747751,"md5":"yBHGKXUrPyhS+WJh6Lh37g==","fsize":103147,"resto":123794208,"id":"1VGRYcPt","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123795072,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)13:56:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123795000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123795000<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Saved<\/span>","time":1493747785,"resto":123794208,"id":"hb5Tcwzu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

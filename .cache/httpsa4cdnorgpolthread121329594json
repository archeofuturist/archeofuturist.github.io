The problem Tesla has is that while they get billions and billions of US taxpayer subsidies, they are still making big losses... and the US is already falling behind the charging infrastructure that countries such as Japan, Korea, Western Europe and China are building up. America traditionally hates infrastructure and this is not going to change. Lack of infrastructure will mean e-cars will not be adopted in America as fast as in Asia and Europe. It is quite similar as the Diesel story.","time":1492326553,"resto":121329594,"id":"gLENcDyo","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121331983,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)03:10:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121330888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121330888<\/a><br>A gallon of gasoline weighs 6 pounds, occupies a mere 230 cubic inches and contains the equivalent of 36 kWhs of electrical energy.<br><br>Most current EVs use lithium-ion batteries that store no more than the equivalent of 16-24 kWh of energy in a single charge.

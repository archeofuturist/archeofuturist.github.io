The problem Tesla has is that while they get billions and billions of US taxpayer subsidies, they are still making big losses... and the US is already falling behind the charging infrastructure that countries such as Japan, Korea, Western Europe and China are building up. America traditionally hates infrastructure and this is not going to change. Lack of infrastructure will mean e-cars will not be adopted in America as fast as in Asia and Europe. It is quite similar as the Diesel story.","time":1492326553,"resto":121329594,"id":"gLENcDyo","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121331983,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)03:10:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121330888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121330888<\/a><br>A gallon of gasoline weighs 6 pounds, occupies a mere 230 cubic inches and contains the equivalent of 36 kWhs of electrical energy.<br><br>Most current EVs use lithium-ion batteries that store no more than the equivalent of 16-24 kWh of energy in a single charge.

The tech is there for everyone. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tesla has the gigafactory to meet demand and lower costs<\/span><br>That is mainly supplied by Panasonic cells which are sold to other car makers as well. There are many battery makers. Making cells in low cost countries is also cheaper than making it in high wage countries. The Gigafactory is mainly a way to avoid battery pack tariffs and to get tax subsidies in America. This is why other car makers do not bother to build their own packs and rely on specialists to build them for them. Battery packs is not a premium business, it is a budget business and there is no way a high wage country can compete in the budget manufacturing segment in a globalised world... unless you have a protectionist country putting high tariffs on battery packs (as America does, but Europe does not).<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tesla has first mover advantage<\/span><br>Daimler had electric cars in production 130 years ago.

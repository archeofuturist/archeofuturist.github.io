They are almost entirely ethnically\/racially homogeneous. It is time to admit that multiculturalism has failed, and that radical egalitarianism is a flawed ideology. Multiculturalism is a cancer to any society it touches, and is indeed the cause of so much of the worlds ills.","time":1492373724,"resto":121404515,"id":"tDdqud9M","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121407895,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:21:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121406957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121406957<\/a><br>you say this as the Korean peninsula is about to nuke itself to death<br><br>also china has a bizarre militaristic relationship with Taiwan<br><br>the South China sea is a mess and possibly source of another war<br><br>I think the problem is empires and governments they get too big and conflicts arise from that<br><br>just like <a href=\"#p121404843\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121404843<\/a> said","time":1492374105,"resto":121404515,"id":"+X\/NeIPK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121409907,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)16:36:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121407895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121407895<\/a><br>States exist in an international anarchy. You can hold your own government to account but not others, if the US were to withdraw from the world stage all that would happen is that Russia and China would fill the void. I&#039;m not a fan of everything the US government has done abroad, and i don&#039;t want you to fight pointless wars or escalate things needlessly.

Since then, the SNP have gained support on the premise of increasing the scope of devolved authority and with the end goal of an independent Scotland.<br><br>Largely because of this the SNP went from being one of a handful of smaller opposition parties in Scotland to being the main opposition of the Labour monopoly. They gained support and eventually became the dominant party in Scottish regional politics.<br><br>This didn&#039;t really bleed through into UK politics - and therefore Westminster elections - until the Scottish independence referendum in 2014. All of the other significant parties in Scotland opposed independence, and the SNP used that to paint themselves as the only party that really represented Scots. Despite losing their referendum, they consolidated the nationalist vote just in time for the 2015 General Election.<br><br>Meanwhile in the wider country, resentment for the Blair and Brown governments was still running fairly high, which combined with the (dubious but well publicised) economic &#039;success&#039; of the coalition government and Ed Miliband&#039;s general lack of appeal and a handful of mistakes during the election campaign left Labour with a particularly weak hand.<br><br>This culminated in a mass swing of Scottish Labour voters to the SNP, which appeared sudden to everyone who hadn&#039;t been paying attention to the aftershock of the failed independence bid the year before.

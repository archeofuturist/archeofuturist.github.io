Fly the flag, wear it as a cape, get shoulder patches (NOT ARMBANDS) Tshirts etc. <br><br>The Last thing you want is to get kitted up like Antifa because you just know that MSM will post pictures of that all over the place and call you jackbooted thugs. Its much harder for them to do that if you&#039;re covered in the Stars and Stripes. <br><br>Some of the best images to come from Berkley were of Masked, black clad thugs facing off against a dude with the US flag flying as a cape and a crowd of relatively normal looking folks at his back. It plays to the what you are trying to invoke - the heroic struggle of the average american against liberal\/commie thugs. <br><br>My suggestion:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Working Mans jeans - invokes the american heartland, plus tough and can be mobile. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Brightly coloured, patriotic T-shirt - Contrasts with the Black clad Antifa, stands out.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Leather\/tough jacket - again, american imagery and practical. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Boots - Tough and durable. <\/span><br><br>Gloves, Sunglasses and a Hat too. If you wear a mask, try to avoid black or anything that invokes a &quot;intimidating&quot; image. At this stage, we want to inspire more to the cause. If things progress and the movement grows, then you can progress to smarter\/more intimidating uniforms but for now - grow the movement, set the narrative in your favour and act as heroes.","filename":"1359577983142","ext":".jpg","w":251,"h":201,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1492432758604,"time":1492432758,"md5":"ff3QMZYKbpUC7jntInKwbg==","fsize":10468,"resto":121518211,"id":"Je+4VbNL","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121520997,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:41:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121520728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121520728<\/a><br>The &quot;actual&quot; alt-right are natsoc.

Need your opinion!<br>I got this friend who looks pretty white, more pale than me in fact, but has no European ancestry. He claims his ancestors were from the Caucasus, between the Black and Caspian seas, and went east deeper into Asia ad then South Asia. I don&#039;t know about this guy, should I consider him one of our own? I mean, on top of all of that shit, he was born a muslim. He isn&#039;t anymore, but still. Not middle eastern though. He told me that he some DNA test shit and got R1a1. Don&#039;t know what the fuck that means. I mean, the guys pretty fuckin cool, more red pilled than I am, but I just don&#039;t know whether he&#039;s my brother or not. With the nigs it&#039;s pretty easy, but this is a difficult one. I can give you more information about him if you like. What&#039;s your opinion on this guys?","filename":"SBPDL Racial Classification","ext":".png","w":1119,"h":1600,"tn_w":174,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490750896582,"time":1490750896,"md5":"H3WgbVQuhbVgPvlTT0JT8w==","fsize":1526143,"resto":0,"id":"ZzK6dkrN","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"noneuropean-whites","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118730558,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)21:51:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118728073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118728073<\/a><br>Kys","time":1490752283,"resto":118728073,"id":"tlBUUuJ+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

This is because it obfuscates who it&#039;s stealing from to make it seem more legitimate. Think of how much your parents paid in social security tax, and if they invested that income. Realize that social security is not just theft from simply the person taxed, but every single one of their descendants. This is because wealth builds upon wealth through generations and social security denies this possibility. Notice how the main driver of income inequality is investment income and capital gains. Then think about how social security denies people money which they could otherwise invest.","filename":"ss_compared_to_stocks","ext":".png","w":1117,"h":1103,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":246,"tim":1491257595721,"time":1491257595,"md5":"bnVL1h7yWjMYgx4Q8oX8tg==","fsize":145731,"resto":0,"id":"H\/Hr3ZLd","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"social-security-redpill","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

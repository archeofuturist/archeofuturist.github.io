Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490214435737,"time":1490214435,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"EQP970tc","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":198,"images":47,"unique_ips":100,"tail_size":50},{"no":117820162,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)16:29:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117819855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117819855<\/a><br><br>Good.

I would understand if you used them merely as a moral guidance system, something like Thomas Jefferson did, but to believe them as fact is something I do not understand at all. Scripture is like a placebo: Its effects occur, but there is nothing in it to make you feel that way. It&#039;s all in the head. If people are willing to acknowledge scripture of all kinds can be wrong, then I&#039;d be happy. We should all be considering IF there is a God instead of arguing which religion is correct, because in the end all scripture is good for is moral guidance.

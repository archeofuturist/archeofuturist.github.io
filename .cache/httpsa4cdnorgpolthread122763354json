People who feel they are on the outside looking in at the prosperity created by globalization and technological transformation. That the game is rigged; that the deck is stacked against them; who feel that the house always wins. That definition includes many, many people who voted for Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. I suspect it also includes the majority of people who voted for Trump.<\/span><br>Yes, HuffPo is appealing to Trump voters. They will now admit what they&#039;ve been denying for years, but only if they can put a spin on it; the spin that this is just a &quot;feeling&quot;. And not hard fact.

They want to belittle and berate people over it, because they tend to mix in the &quot;polls show trust has fallen&quot; quotes with general &quot;people are getting stupider&quot; or &quot;trusting fake news&quot; or &quot;the scourge of isolated information&quot; talking points.<br><br>They also always mention jobs lost, because they&#039;re myopic. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Since 1990, more than a quarter of a million newspaper jobs have vanished, most of them at local publications. It\u2019s hard to see journalists as the enemy of the American people, as Donald Trump put it, if you see them covering your high school football games and town council meetings. But with fewer local reporters on the ground, it\u2019s no surprise that our audience trusts us less.<\/span><br><br>Local news had less room for an agenda and spin (though certainly it was a problem there too). And it was relevant to people, even if a lot of slow news days meant a lot of reporting on Aunt Annie&#039;s bottle collection or prize cows touring the city. <br><br>But like the HuffPo quote shows they don&#039;t seem to be aware of what the difference actually is. They&#039;re so blind to the routine distortion field they can&#039;t seem to grasp the reason people liked local news was that there was much less room for irrelevant spin. It just had to cover things that happened, even if those things are boring.<br><br>Y&#039;know, news, instead of opinion? <br><br>This is just part of the shift that&#039;s happened where all sections of the paper is just opinion.

It was widely used in press and political language to describe either direct competition (such as the White movement) or even internal fractions of the socialist movement, for example social democracy which was called social fascism. Also the Nazi movement in Germany was described as &quot;fascist&quot; until 1939, when the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact was signed, after which Nazi\u2013Soviet relations started to be presented positively in Soviet propaganda.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In 1944 British writer George Orwell commented that due to the widespread use in the European press, &quot;the word &#039;Fascism&#039; is almost entirely meaningless&quot; due to its non-specific use detached from its original political associations.[1]<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After 1941 &quot;fascist&quot; was used in the Soviet Union to describe virtually any anti-Soviet activity or opinion. According to Marxism\u2013Leninism, fascism was the &quot;final phase of crisis of bourgeoisie&quot;, which &quot;in fascism sought refuge&quot; from &quot;inherent contradictions of capitalism&quot;. As result of this approach, it was almost every Western capitalist country that was &quot;fascist&quot;, with the Third Reich being just the &quot;most reactionary&quot; one.[2][3] As result, after 1941 &quot;fascist&quot; was used in Soviet Union to describe virtually any anti-Soviet activity: for example, the international investigation on Katyn massacre was described as &quot;fascist libel&quot;.,[4] the Warsaw Uprising as &quot;illegal and organised by fascists&quot;.[5] Communist S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa described trotskyism, titoism and imperialism as &quot;variants of fascism&quot;<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/history\/places<wbr>\/berlin_wall<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Berlin Wall was officially referred to as the &quot;Anti-Fascist Protective Wall&quot; (German: Antifaschistischer Schutzwall) by GDR authorities<\/span><br><br>cont.","time":1490695265,"resto":118633276,"id":"uf4ecOuo","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":118633806,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)06:03:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118633276\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118633276<\/a><br>It doesn&#039;t have an exact definition.

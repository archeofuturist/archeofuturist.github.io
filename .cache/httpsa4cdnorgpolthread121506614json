perfectly natural.<br><br>in fact it is more natural to want to marry a 15-19 year old than it is to want to marry a 21-23 year old. the 21-24 year old is more fertile but she has less reproductive residual value. meaning that if you pursued solely long term mating with 1 person for life, the 21-24 year old would give you less children than the 16-19 year old. which means it is more adaptive to want to mate for 1 person for life with the younger girl. more children=more genes=moreadaptive.<br><br>however, if all you want is one night stands, the 21-24 year old is the more adaptive choice as she is more fertile and hence more likely to conceive from one night of sex. also being older she can more easily provision for herself as a single mother.<br><br>hence why r types keep trying to prevent marriage amongst younger women and have them go to college and not start looking for men until their early 20&#039;s. it puts them in prime one night stand\/cad territory and takes them out of

One in which things were broken up by federal region, which wasn&#039;t primarily democratic so as to avoid dumber group majorities from outweighing smarter groups? What characteristics exactly would it have to exhibit? Maybe some type of authoritarian meritocratic technocratic fascism? Some Europeans have expressed that they&#039;d be more okay with the EU if it allowed more national sovereignty and didn&#039;t pursue such obviously Left-Wing ideological goals. I believe that globalism and possibly even a one world federalized government are inevitable at this point so I&#039;m just trying to see what it would have to be like for people to even accept it as legitimate.","filename":"SoccerChicks1","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492225373390,"time":1492225373,"md5":"Wk7QONSyyqrGZYSE1tvisw==","fsize":45371,"resto":0,"id":"Ln3d8h7e","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-there-any-type-or-version-of-federalized","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":2,"unique_ips":10},{"no":121159381,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:04:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Globalism with \/pol\/ in charge.","time":1492225442,"resto":121159232,"id":"8iyNZTI7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121159456,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:04:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121159232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121159232<\/a><br>Globalism is fine so long as we get rid of all the colored people","time":1492225479,"resto":121159232,"id":"4ItJLZyV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121159483,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:04:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121159232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121159232<\/a><br><br>You mean like nation states?","time":1492225495,"resto":121159232,"id":"m\/LO9gAK","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121159502,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:05:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is there any type or version of federalized globalism that would be at least tolerable to you<\/span><br>if you killed all the non-whites first i wouldn&#039;t mind","time":1492225503,"resto":121159232,"id":"wDA4Q5eE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121161376,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:19:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121159381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121159381<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Globalism with \/pol\/ in charge.<\/span>","filename":"gangster","ext":".png","w":493,"h":356,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1492226385270,"time":1492226385,"md5":"vGnb7bS5yffIfOauWFJZeg==","fsize":323641,"resto":121159232,"id":"tpSy+HYM","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":121161582,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:21:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121159381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121159381<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Globalism<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/pol\/<\/span><br><br>Pick one, the two are exclusively disjunct","time":1492226477,"resto":121159232,"id":"ATFmJJgJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121162086,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:25:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alter<wbr>-globalization<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Alter-globalization (also known as alternative globalization, alter-mundialization\u2014from the French &quot;alter-mondialisation&quot;\u2014or the global justice movement) is the name of a social movement whose proponents support global cooperation and interaction, but oppose what they describe as the negative effects of economic globalization, considering that it often works to the detriment of, or does not adequately promote, human values such as environmental and climate protection, economic justice, labor protection, protection of indigenous cultures, peace, and civil liberties.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 hippie crap<\/span><br><br>You don&#039;t have to care about all of it.

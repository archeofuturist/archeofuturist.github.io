Equities up on Trump tax cut. POTUS signs EO ending Obama&#039;s massive Federal Land grab. Congress insiders say the government shutdown threat is over but not fight on Healthcare. Obama Accepts $400000 Fee for a Wall Street speech (man of the People?). Ninth Circuit rules against POTUS (AGAIN) on cutting funding to sanctuary cities. Ann Coulter cancels Berkeley event amid potential violent protests (Milo responds, I&#039;ll bring an Amry if I have to). Alex Jones sued by owner Chobani (could this be the case that redeems his brand?). Marine Le Pen ducks Euro-exit question as runoff looms with Macron (Anti-Globalist, huh?). Russia to send ground troops to Syria while Turkey calls for the removal of Bashar Al-Assad? U.S. and South Korean troops hold live fire drills; North Korea follows. And White House draws plans to withdraw from NAFTA.

There are several ways you can profit from it. Buy it and sit on it. Wait for the value to increase. Ive seen projections where 1 btc could be worth 17,000$ in 10 years. Another way is to purchase it, sit on it for a brief period, long enough so that it goes up enough so that when youre ready to sell it, the compensation is worth what you paid for it, including fees, producing a profit. For example, buy coins from your favorite exchange, coinbase charges a 4.5% fee, localbitcoin.com ranges from 5-10% or higher, sit on it so that the increase in value covers your fees, then resell your coins on your favorite exchange. I would suggest localbitcoins.com because there, you are in charge of how much of a fee youre charging. Typically, accepting cash deposits into a bank account will be charged higher fees, especially because its quick and anonymous.","time":1493247163,"resto":122938995,"id":"0f\/VDaTH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122953089,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)18:52:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122951888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122951888<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;blowing money on btc on it&#039;s current run<\/span><br><br>gonna wait for it to crash when it gets denied stock market access again","time":1493247175,"resto":122938995,"id":"dbQPHFsH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122953099,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)18:52:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Last week I was talking to some chicks.

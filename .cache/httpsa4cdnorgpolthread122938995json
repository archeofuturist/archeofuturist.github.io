Equities up on Trump tax cut. POTUS signs EO ending Obama&#039;s massive Federal Land grab. Congress insiders say the government shutdown threat is over but not fight on Healthcare. Obama Accepts $400000 Fee for a Wall Street speech (man of the People?). Ninth Circuit rules against POTUS (AGAIN) on cutting funding to sanctuary cities. Ann Coulter cancels Berkeley event amid potential violent protests (Milo responds, I&#039;ll bring an Amry if I have to). Alex Jones sued by owner Chobani (could this be the case that redeems his brand?). Marine Le Pen ducks Euro-exit question as runoff looms with Macron (Anti-Globalist, huh?). Russia to send ground troops to Syria while Turkey calls for the removal of Bashar Al-Assad? U.S. and South Korean troops hold live fire drills; North Korea follows. And White House draws plans to withdraw from NAFTA. Your calls, Twitter shoutouts and (maybe) Radio Graffiti.<\/span>","filename":"GhostNewAvatarLarge","ext":".png","w":1125,"h":1500,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493240682048,"time":1493240682,"md5":"KVBz1QoWZz9Y0dOHvtXraA==","fsize":63001,"resto":0,"id":"7bDQbYAj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"true-capitalist-radio-hosted-by-ghost","country_name":"United States","replies":22,"images":3,"unique_ips":16},{"no":122939107,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:05:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"True Squirrel Radio","time":1493240735,"resto":122938995,"id":"A4FRE5+g","country":"UA","country_name":"Ukraine"},{"no":122939274,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:06:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"CIA trained squirrels","time":1493240803,"resto":122938995,"id":"R+YOi8iw","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":122939364,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:07:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"What did I miss?","time":1493240845,"resto":122938995,"id":"HRyq6jIz","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122939429,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:07:54","name":"Nathan Bedford Forrest","com":"Ghost drives a Yugo<br><br>check my numerical ouija","time":1493240874,"resto":122938995,"id":"W45Dblug","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122939621,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:09:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"ghost will make Israel great again","time":1493240964,"resto":122938995,"id":"ymB6e\/pk","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":122939642,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:09:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Post Twitter names for him to shout out <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Squirrel 5000 Ghost 0<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;True Squirrel Radio<\/span>","time":1493240971,"resto":122938995,"id":"f2RP+hZE","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122939747,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:10:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122939364\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122939364<\/a><br>Ghost&#039;s wife dodging a squirrel and costing him 5k","time":1493241017,"resto":122938995,"id":"NILvN700","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122940113,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:12:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122939621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122939621<\/a><br>Greatest ally and friend","filename":"1458362962169","ext":".jpg","w":436,"h":318,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1493241177350,"time":1493241177,"md5":"3JhcbhhCUh+pcGSJlrythw==","fsize":15540,"resto":122938995,"id":"7bDQbYAj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122940152,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:13:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122939642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122939642<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Squirrel=CIA Operative<\/span>","time":1493241192,"resto":122938995,"id":"hfKxJakF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122940282,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:14:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"CIA Hacked Ghosts Car<br>Women Drivers<br>SquirrelCIASpook<br>SquirrelCIAInformant<br>N U T T E D<br>A C O R N E D","time":1493241260,"resto":122938995,"id":"EDDKBLbZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122940303,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:14:33","name":"Nathan Bedford Forrest","com":"<a href=\"#p122939642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122939642<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not Sandy 5000, Ghost 0<\/span><br><br>Need to get more creative leaf<br><br>Also<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;GhostsWalletBy5000%<\/span>","filename":"US Army Ranger Leaf Helmet","ext":".jpg","w":432,"h":600,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493241273786,"time":1493241273,"md5":"CZFtdh3p83XAKrDl8xxxDw==","fsize":46744,"resto":122938995,"id":"W45Dblug","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122940432,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:15:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"on a scale of 1-10 how much have you been enjoying Ghostler&#039;s show lately?

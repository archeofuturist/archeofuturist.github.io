It was<br>no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom<br>working, and at present the electric current was cut<br>off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive<br>in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up,<br>and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer<br>above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on<br>the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster<br>with the enormous face gazed from the wall.

The picture I posted is an excellent podcast series called, &quot;Orthodoxy and Heterodoxy&quot; that gives a detailed explanation on what Orthodoxy is, and what the rest is - Roman Catholics, major Protestant sects, non-Christians like Mormons, Unitarians, and pagan religions like Hindus and Muslims (since neither worship God.. Jews at least worship the Father).<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;See here: http:\/\/www.ancientfaith.com\/podcast<wbr>s\/orthodoxyheterodoxy<\/span><br><br>Orthodoxy reveres the Holy Bible by taking it in it&#039;s entirety, not just &quot;pick and choose like a buffet the verses I see as best and apply my own interpretation to it&quot;, as is common with Sola Scriptura (the Bible being their only point of authority).<br><br>For Protestantism, you have to remember the context in which is came about in that it was a reaction against the worldliness and abuses of the Roman Catholic Church, itself a heretical sect that broke away from the Church officially in 1054AD. Luther can&#039;t be blamed entirely, as wrong as he was theologically in some aspects... he was simply a monk that knew something was wrong with the Roman Catholic Church, but didn&#039;t know the resources to fix it. <br>He was like a man in a dark room, reaching for any light available, or a surgeon that knew a body was suffering from cancer, but then tried to take out a liver without realizing the cancer was melanoma. Hopefully those analogies make sense a little.","time":1491261341,"resto":119388123,"id":"IrqorfHN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119396099,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)19:16:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119394342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119394342<\/a><br>Any specifically are you questions about Christianity?

Likewise, icons and relics and even humans, can be so filled with the Holy Spirit that healing can occur, clairvoyance, etc by the grace of God. This is seen with the bones of a Prophet bringing someone from the dead in the OT. Likewise, the True Cross brought someone from the dead, and it is an icon.<br><br>Humans are living icons of God, as we are made in His image. Likewise, Christ IS the icon of God, since He is fully God and Fully Man. It&#039;s been in Christianity since day 1.

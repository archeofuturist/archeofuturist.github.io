The real issue is that we no longer live in a society which will stand up and say what is healthy and what isn&#039;t healthy. For a math autist\/absolutist, it is correct to say that there exists more than just XX\/XY chromosomes, and therefore we cannot say with 100% certainty that having XX chromosomes makes you a woman etc. However, it&#039;s an extremely Jewish way to argue, and if you haven&#039;t looked up pilpul, I encourage you to do so. This kind of thinking stems from the desire to have mathematical absolutism about everything, to have formulas which take absolutely every possibility into account. It&#039;s like saying that it is possible to find an electron a mile away from it&#039;s nucleus. Yes, from a statistical standpoint, anything that is not zero is possible, even if there is a 0.00000000001% likelihood of it happening, but it is the thought process of a neurotic mind to argue that we should spend any time looking for an electron a mile away from it&#039;s nucleus just because it is &quot;possible&quot;","time":1493303241,"resto":123036532,"id":"1F4bVfl0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123041479,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)10:27:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123036532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123036532<\/a><br>All these fat fucks on tumblr who scream about how &quot;fat is beautiful&quot;, I guarantee you that if a pill came out that made you thin every single one of these obese pieces of shit would gorge themselves on it.<br><br>They&#039;re just lazy and lacking any semblance of self control and it&#039;s easier to scream that they&#039;re being oppressed than it is to actually control their fucking eating habits.","time":1493303254,"resto":123036532,"id":"Ev2eXZGz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123041527,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)10:28:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"viz is great at taking the piss out of them","filename":"018_viz157_millie","ext":".jpg","w":1476,"h":2700,"tn_w":68,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493303286430,"time":1493303286,"md5":"Lb7AxYqffsqgdFsU6kqw\/A==","fsize":2046252,"resto":123036532,"id":"G0jvzIf2","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123041831,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)10:31:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123036532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123036532<\/a><br>what the fuck","filename":"028","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":1816,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493303494329,"time":1493303494,"md5":"m7x+YVBRxIRF1pmHonXRIw==","fsize":680737,"resto":123036532,"id":"5hdCfI0y","country":"SE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123041881,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)10:32:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123041457\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123041457<\/a><br>That&#039;s why we have the concept of normality.

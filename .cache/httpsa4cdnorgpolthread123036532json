In the Torah and the Talmud, the Jews are constantly referred to as the &#039;chosen people&#039; so much so that religious Jews believe that there is an essential, ontological difference between the Jews and non-Jews, and that this difference is what justifies their treatment of non-Jews. That Goebbels (?) quote about Jews attacking people for the things which they do themselves is extremely apt. Imo, part of the reason that the Jews hated the National Socialists so much is that it knocked the Jews off their pedestal as the &#039;chosen people&#039;. A group of goys dared to stand up and say that the Jews were nothing special, and this infuriated them. This is also why Jesus enrages religious Jews, because he said something similar. I have mixed feelings about religion, but Jesus and Paul&#039;s statement about &quot;there is no longer Jew nor Greek&quot; is a massive, massive blow to Jewish ethnocentrism. This is also part of the reason why Christians are such good goys for the Jews, because the Christians continue the universalizing project, which the Jews happily go along with, while privately believing that they are superior.","time":1493305646,"resto":123036532,"id":"1F4bVfl0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123046862,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)11:22:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123045338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123045338<\/a><br>Another example is feminism. <br><br>Part of the reason why there are so many Jewish feminists has to do with this idea of universalizing. The Jews would argue that because some women are possibly capable of being leaders and enjoying work outside the home, we should insist that all women be allowed to be leaders and work outside the home. Because some women are possibly capable of understanding politics, all women should have the power to vote. For a Jew, there is nothing worse than the rights of a minority being limited for the larger good, because for a long time in history, stuffed into the European ghettos where they belong, they were that minority. The Jew doesn&#039;t care about reality, or the practical consequences of their ideas, because the Talmud and Zohar and Tanya have conditioned the Jewish mind to masturbate over the imaginary ideal, to flee from reality and seek refuge in abstracted theorizing. Freud, Marx, Einstein are all perfect examples of this.","time":1493306563,"resto":123036532,"id":"1F4bVfl0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123047904,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)11:33:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123046862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123046862<\/a><br>This is why the Jew is a relentless force for democracy, feminism, mass immigration, pornography, and all kinds of things which sound good at some very, very high level of abstraction while being cut off from any kind of morality or restraining realism.

It&#039;s pretty much like two papercups with a string tied tied between them so sailors can communicate from one end of the the ship to another.

Well, these systems mainly exist for emergencies, such as firefighting or general quarters. They already have a J-Dial system for just regular business (hey, can you get down to the engineroom and pick this up for me). So the Navy&#039;s lesson happened during a fire when the generators were knocked off, knocking these new phone systems offline. Now, how the fuck can they communicate to battle a fire?

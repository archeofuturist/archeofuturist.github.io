It&#039;s pretty much like two papercups with a string tied tied between them so sailors can communicate from one end of the the ship to another. Old ass technology, so the Navy decided to update and put in electronic high tech systems for communications. Well, these systems mainly exist for emergencies, such as firefighting or general quarters. They already have a J-Dial system for just regular business (hey, can you get down to the engineroom and pick this up for me). So the Navy&#039;s lesson happened during a fire when the generators were knocked off, knocking these new phone systems offline. Now, how the fuck can they communicate to battle a fire? So the Navy scrapped that and went back to sound powered phones, an old as fuck technology that will work just by the power of your voice and can&#039;t be knocked offline if the ship is dead in the water.<br><br><a href=\"#p120686371\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120686371<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120686730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120686730<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120687729\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120687729<\/a><br>You&#039;re a fucking idiot.","time":1491958651,"resto":120677549,"id":"Vmn2DYFg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120688578,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)20:58:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120677719\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120677719<\/a><br>Top kek reyard","time":1491958733,"resto":120677549,"id":"\/snfrA23","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120688602,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)20:59:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120688414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120688414<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;same fagging this hard<\/span><br><br>stay mad hans","filename":"PattonLaughing","ext":".jpg","w":460,"h":288,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1491958743625,"time":1491958743,"md5":"rpBOFTpXZY0tf5jRbQtVTA==","fsize":24851,"resto":120677549,"id":"TQ8NJiBQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120688885,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)21:01:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120688060\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120688060<\/a><br>Kim doesn&#039;t know that.","time":1491958888,"resto":120677549,"id":"OGQEB6BN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120689040,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)21:02:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120677549\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120677549<\/a><br>we have the lowest IQs don&#039;t we folks?","time":1491958959,"resto":120677549,"id":"VRiSjKo8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120689236,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)21:04:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120688414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120688414<\/a><br>Oh yeah, here&#039;s a picture of sound powered phones, in case you were curious.

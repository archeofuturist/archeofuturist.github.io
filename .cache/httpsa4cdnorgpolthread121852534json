The links to our ancestors are, to most, unimportant and forgotten, but in the case of American blacks, they&#039;re creating a new identity incorporating their past while still being very separate from that of their African forefathers. <br>I think we&#039;re inclined to romantically look to the past for a way forward and for our identities as whites. To me it remains important to incorporate that into our identities, while still remaining aware that those times are past and that is no longer who we as a people are. Spouting old proverbs and philosophies of ancient Europeans just seems dated and goes over the heads of the wider public, because you have to want to absorb, or at least want to hear such things for them to have any impact.<br><br>The reason I&#039;ve never felt comfortable labeling myself as a member of the alt-right is because when I look at those who do, I tend to see a heap of individuals with loosely related ideologies spouting memes. <br>I sense that it may become a more cohesive movement if it&#039;s members, and not least the projected leaders, tidy themselves up a bit. Richard Spencer actually seems to be a fairly good role model for this but people like Milo and Sam Hyde, while funny at times, just detract from the public image of the alt-right.<br><br>I guess most of us have been to caught up in the gateway topics of a certain global syndicate and race politics to realize that we need to focus on our selves, make sacrifices, and work to establish a new identity instead of adopting a past one.","time":1492616009,"resto":121852534,"id":"7JnhJz9T","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":121856452,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:35:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121854992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121854992<\/a><br>Is this some kind of new pasta???","time":1492616139,"resto":121852534,"id":"KJCtM77r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121856470,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:35:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121855492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121855492<\/a><br><br>He makes the point later on that athletics serve a purpose as a show of physical prowess and human achievement.

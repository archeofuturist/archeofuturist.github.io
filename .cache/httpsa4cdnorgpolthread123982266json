Because whereas being a standard center-leftist has a finite limit, the inherent end goal of progressivism is a utopian philosopher-king tyranny and the end goal of socialism is communism.<br><br><a href=\"#p123991108\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123991108<\/a>","filename":"1430086302884 - Copy","ext":".png","w":322,"h":460,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493858251697,"time":1493858251,"md5":"NqwB8y7kVSGzzISdXX3EWA==","fsize":105302,"resto":123982266,"id":"ms1VV7Fy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123991628,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)20:37:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123987097\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123987097<\/a><br>Someoen should make a short comic where he runs towards the chaos, looking like he will save everyone, but becuase hes a true socialist he joins in in beating the protestors to silence them for making socialism look bad.","time":1493858258,"resto":123982266,"id":"TVXqDKIq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123991652,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)20:37:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123982266\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123982266<\/a><br>Sadly the average burger is so ignorant they think Venezuela is like Africa. <br>Still, what are your people waiting to KILL PRESIDENT MADURO?

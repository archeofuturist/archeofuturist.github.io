No you wouldn&#039;t, you wouldn&#039;t care at all. You might actually like it. Your fountain wouldn&#039;t have spit on the nozzle or gum attached to the handle, and the undamaged products on the organized shelves of the clean store would actually be cheaper as we wouldn&#039;t be bearing the brunt of the deferred cost of theft, damages, and loss prevention officer salaries. <br><br>But I&#039;m supposed to believe segregation is some horrible thing because we can look through the glass; I can see their culture and civilization is obviously inferior, they can see our civilization is obviously superior (a practical application is comparing even the moderately polluted white countries to third world disasters); they want in, and we have the &quot;audacity&quot; to tell them NO.<br><br>Seriously, how is anyone supposed to think segregation is bad for anyone but shitskins? I&#039;d vote to reinstate segregation in a second, but something tells me the entire world around us wouldn&#039;t be as enthusiastic; and since we can clearly deduce that it is not a distinction of them having certain virtues, one has to wonder if desegregation was just coincidental (((plot))) to undermine the beauty of Western culture","filename":"1484674545789m","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":708,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":172,"tim":1491588919586,"time":1491588919,"md5":"010tjMzz+7hiOhKkHO\/kaw==","fsize":147833,"resto":0,"id":"TGn2AtRd","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lets-talk-segregation","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119996787,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)14:25:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119995010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119995010<\/a><br>bump.","time":1491589528,"resto":119995010,"id":"5Wk8NbrJ","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119997422,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)14:28:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Are ghettos and jungles not considered a form of segregation?","time":1491589723,"resto":119995010,"id":"um5WHnNZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

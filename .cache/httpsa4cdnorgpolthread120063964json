It&#039;s a rush winning. It&#039;s also a rush losing. I play poker and have since before it was all over t.v. Started when I was still in highschool going to &quot;underground&quot; games before it was legal in my state (east coaster). Played a lot but was mainly interested in winning and figuring out how to win. My friend? Not so much. He would play well but would also just play anything a lot too. Why? Because win or lose he got a rush. The worse starting hand he held the bigger rush he got if he won. Of course, you don&#039;t win a lot with shitty fucking starting hands pushing all your chips in preflop. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tl\/dr the addiction is the rush. Win or lose. The worse your odds the bigger the rush when you win thus the incentive to play odds-down and subsequently &quot;gambling-addicts&quot; tend to be the broke types.<\/span>","filename":"1486089979544","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":448,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":116,"tim":1491616141514,"time":1491616141,"md5":"vRtnPBvnT0twDqfUphrYBA==","fsize":32220,"resto":120063964,"id":"DuhKdIdl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

So I am thinking of creating a hopper of memes. Basically, put memes u want added to video in hopper, run script, which renames the memes as per the convention and places them in a ready-to-go folder. once all the maps have been processed, get the ready-to-go memes and mix them into the production folder and make the video based on the date\/numbering convention. <br>that should create the memes in the video with the correct &#039;appearance&#039; time.<br>the same process would apply to any image file you place in the hopper - e.g. you could do a tribute to fallen, you could do weapons as they appeared on battlefield e.g. tow<br><br>And since you can annotate the base images, there ( getting to lots of work) is no limit to what you can do - e.g. draw red dots to mark location etc.<br><br>but i am really excited by the 2 levels thing. something entertaining, and something more meaty.","time":1490875657,"resto":118908654,"id":"9sk5Dmtz","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":118914887,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)08:10:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118914726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118914726<\/a><br>That sounds like a pretty sweet approach to keep it managable without too much manual rename stuff<br><br>Good luck man this is great stuff, I mean it","time":1490875816,"resto":118908654,"id":"j89IxtOW","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118915015,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)08:12:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118913747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118913747<\/a><br>MISSION ACCOMPLISHED","filename":"ES","ext":".png","w":620,"h":400,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":80,"tim":1490875939166,"time":1490875939,"md5":"67dUKqP4dIsLhop\/3HoiqA==","fsize":433408,"resto":118908654,"id":"NelocJnP","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118915160,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)08:14:39","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Pepe Nimr","ext":".png","w":530,"h":576,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490876079533,"time":1490876079,"md5":"bRpy03TQZrKvGFB5zkFY2A==","fsize":61543,"resto":118908654,"id":"bIDk0cw7","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"}]}

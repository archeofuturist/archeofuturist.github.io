There comes a time in every moderators life where despite how much time and love they have for this subreddit, its important to focus upon their own personal lives outside of \/r\/syriancivilwar.<br>I am fortunately the user with the longest length of time spent aboard the mod squad so have seen so much change and development within this subreddit. I remember the days when \/r\/syriancivilwar didn&#039;t even exist, and instead there was like 40 of us hanging out at the \/r\/syria. Since then I have the had the absolute honour and pleasure of seeing this subreddit grow from 50 subscribers, to 500, then 5000 and now the 50 000 we have today. I have seen the subreddit, the community, and the culture change and evolve so much over this period of time. From the creation of the IRC, to the the archive (RIP), to the glorious memes, this subreddit has and always will be both the most informative and entertaining place to study and analyse the syrian civil war.<br>However I now must depart from my formal role as a senior moderator and it with much sadness I now announce my formal resignation. I know this news may be unfortunate for some, but please know I consider my active role in the creation and development of this subreddit, one of my greatest achievements. Anyone who uses this subreddit on a daily basis is aware that this community provides an almost university level grade education on a topic so important and relevant to understanding international politics. I&#039;d like to thank my fellow moderators, many of whom I consider good friends in RL, but most importantly I&#039;d like to thank you, the users within this community. Without the contributions from each and everyone of you, this subreddit would not have prospered in the way it has.

There are some things you can never, ever, get away with. One of them is total genocide. Even Hitler acknowledged that and that&#039;s why the Jews made the holocaust up to keep Germans from ever questioning them again. Were they to wipe out the Albanian race from the world only they would boast about it, and briefly. Outside the world would see it as one of the greatest tragedies of mankind, and the generations later would do the same. In our removal they would forever immortalize us in history, and forever ruin their own image. Because this was a total genocide, no sort of revisionism would work. The coming generations would loathe themselves and their ancestors for this act. Everything Albanian, every shred of culture, every piece of clothing, every symbol, every poem or tale would become invaluable. The Albanian people would become subjects to historical, scientifical and cultural papers for the next few centuries, elevated to the levels of ancient Latins or Celtics, while the actors would be looked down as the devil personified, and themselves would cease to be.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":699,"h":900,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492865221280,"time":1492865221,"md5":"DCbIu0e2VuiDqzPK2oHqhQ==","fsize":86838,"resto":122270437,"id":"+30VAM9W","country":"AL","country_name":"Albania"},{"no":122273432,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)08:47:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122270437\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122270437<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I really hate the fags that say &quot;lol I have two degrees in engineering&quot; every time 9\/11 is brought up and similar shit about history debates.<\/span><br><br>So lemme get this straight: you get butthurt when someone with a RELEVANT degree can talk about a relevant topic and want ANYONE here to take you seriously coming to us with your high-hosr crap about you studying history in London and Moscow?<br><br>Are you literally retarded, you worthless sack of dog shit? <br><br>Who or what do you think you are?

Empires were largely composed of hundreds of ethnicities who adopted the language and culture of the ruling Empire. If Byzantium conquered you, you were Byzantine and adopted their language, if Franks conquered you, you spoke their language and adopted their systems.<br><br>Later on when nationality became a thing, language was used mostly by the people who ethnically and &gt;&gt;genetically&lt;&lt; belong to a certain group. <br><br>Language is still used as a cultural weapon, if you will, to this day. We are all speaking English, for example, but it is no longer the uniting factor in determining your nationality - ethnicity is. Germans speak German, Frenchfags speak French, etc. <br><br>USA is an exception since it is one of the few modern multi-ethnic states (but not multicultural!!! all settlers came from compatible cultures with similar value systems), because it is relatively a new country.

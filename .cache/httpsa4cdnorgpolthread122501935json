Like 1500-2000 each. A normal person should be eating that much a day, so imagine what eating three meals like that every day will do to your body. It&#039;s fine for soldiers, because they&#039;re so physically active anyway that they need those extra calories. But you&#039;ll get fat living on MREs and not exercizing.<br><br>The other thing about them is that they are designed to block up your digestion. In other words, if you live on nothing but MREs for two or three days, you&#039;ll only have one painful bowel movement a day. If you keep on like that for a week or more, you&#039;ll eventually stop having bowel movements.<br><br>That&#039;s right. You stop all together.<br><br>Then the next time you eat anything a little bit greasy- WATCH OUT! Because once you lube that up, you unstopper the cork, so to speak. Military professionals refer to this as &quot;rocket shits.&quot; <br><br>But aside from that, they&#039;re actually pretty healthy, well balanced meals that don&#039;t taste horrible (most of them). They&#039;re some of the most heavily engineered and processed food in all of history, but the government spends loads of money making them nutritious and palatable. They&#039;re also not terribly expensive. I was just at the PX where a case of 12 was going for about $110. There&#039;s far more expensive prepared meals you can get for that price. It&#039;s good camping food, if you&#039;re into that. Or backpacking. I like to keep a few in my truck just in case I&#039;m ever like snowed in or something and have to choose between cannibalism and survival.","time":1492987913,"resto":122501935,"id":"YCN8XZmR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122502610,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)18:52:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Those look like they lack fiber and would tear your asshole up.

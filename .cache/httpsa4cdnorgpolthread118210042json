I can&#039;t say I&#039;m the only Muslim man who finds it hard to take pride in his own country after having years of constant and needless attacks defaming my heritage from insecure losers here. Why not bully Swedes or Germans? Do they not have much more to be ashamed of than our peaceful country? Potato niggers get bullied less than us and yet we are the purest whites in all of the Middle East.<br><br>Like when its not just banter, when a meme is repeated over and over again, repeated systematically, it eventually becomes a truth irregardless of the intentions in repeating it. And that isn&#039;t just jokes any more then, then its harmful !<br>Would you call an Muslim man a &quot;shitskin&quot;(disgusting phrase) to his face? Would you say to a kind, peaceful and hard working salt of the earth Muslim refugee that they are &quot;not welcome in your country&quot;? Would you say those words to your fellow white brother? Are you starting to feel ashamed now? You fucking degenerate?<br>You&#039;re destroying national pride, you&#039;re dividing whites against each other, you&#039;re doing the opposite of what you claim to support when you engage in this incredibly abhorrent behavior.

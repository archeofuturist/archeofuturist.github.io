It&#039;s a national appellation, like &quot;Californian&quot;. Judea at the time was a multi-ethnic &quot;kingdom&quot; (thanks to Jews) with real Israelites mixed in. This is why Jesus preached in parables to the crowds but later told the disciples the true meaning, and that the message was only for true Israelites and not the whole multitude. <br><br>Anyway, the reason Paul was writing to the Galatians in the first place is because he knew they were lost white Israelite brethren who had been separated from their identity before the Israelites had received the mosaic law. They were the wild uncultivated olive tree that would be grafted back in to Israel and reconciled through Christ. The reason he is saying that there is no Judean or Gentile (of the nations of the known mediterranean\/Asia minor world, i.e. white civilizations) is because they are all Israelites by blood and able to receive Christ&#039;s gift. This is also why he tells the judeans not to be jealous just because they had the law of Moses. <br><br>From Christogenea: &quot;the Galatians to whom this is addressed were primarily Hellenized Gauls, who were Kelts, with some Greeks and Romans among them. Since Paul wrote to these people specifically, no one else can possibly pick up this letter, who has no relation to its intended recipients, and imagine that Paul could be addressing them also. Paul knew that these Galatians: Kelts, Greeks and Romans, were the \u201clost\u201d Israelites, as he demonstrates so often in his epistles, and here he tells them as much in this very chapter, and in chapter 4, verse 28 where he says \u201cAnd we, brethren, down through Isaac, are children of promise\u201d. As I\u2019ve said before, Paul certainly cannot be held responsible for the blatantly errant, judaized mistranslations of his letters found in all modern Bible versions today&quot;","time":1493409401,"resto":123228559,"id":"IGmElGnX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123237497,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)16:01:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123234717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123234717<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Quirinius<\/span><br>Quirinius didn&#039;t take over Syria or do his census until 12 years after Herod died. <br>As I said, the authors took events of minor notice from the general period and squeezed them all together so that they all happened at once.","time":1493409690,"resto":123228559,"id":"4jA5rRNK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123237715,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)16:03:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123237497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123237497<\/a><br>10 years after.

However in Genesis chapter 10, only two chapters prior to the call of Abraham, we read of the descendants of Japheth in verse 5: \u201cBy these were the isles of the nations divided in their lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in their nations.\u201d Then we read of Ham in verse 20: \u201cThese are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.\u201d Then we read of the sons of Shem in verse 31: \u201cThese are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their tongues, in their lands, after their nations.\u201d And finally of all the sons of Noah in verse 32: \u201cThese are the families of the sons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.\u201d<\/span><br><br>These are \u201call the families of the earth\u201d, which is not the planet but the land upon which the race inhabited, as they are the only families within the Biblical context, and they were the families which were within the scope of Abraham\u2019s consciousness. The families of other races which are never a concern of the Scripture cannot be justly forced into this Genesis chapter 12 context. This is why we have a genealogy in Genesis chapter 10, so that we may recognize these nations. If all of the world\u2019s races were descended from Adam, the identity of the families of Noah would not even matter and therefore there would be no need for such a genealogy. Yet history proves that all of the descendants of Noah were originally White, and we can identify them with this same list<br><br>List of Adamic nations: https:\/\/christogenea.org\/essays\/rac<wbr>e-genesis-10","time":1493410664,"resto":123228559,"id":"IGmElGnX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123239433,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)16:18:20","name":"k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a","com":"<a href=\"#p123228559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123228559<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jewish anons, why do you reject Christ when he fulfilled 353 prophecies in the Old Testament which to be random chance would be mathematically impossible?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;accordingtothescriptures.org\/proph<wbr>ecy\/353prophecies<\/span><br>poor jesus<br>will nobody be his friend?","filename":"1478842367761","ext":".jpg","w":711,"h":635,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":111,"tim":1493410700070,"time":1493410700,"md5":"44CO2zxafOzfhgfmuD8h4g==","fsize":564355,"resto":123228559,"id":"ubz\/dcif","country":"GB","trip":"!!8ulOY0Lj8qr","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

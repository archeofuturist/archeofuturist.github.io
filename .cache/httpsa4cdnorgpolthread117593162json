The warlords and nobles are explicitly allowed by their religions&#039; texts to own slaves and be polygamous.<br><br>Now as you know in the world there are roughly 1:1 males to females. Polygamy on a large level can only mean that some men are left out doomed to never have a wife and family.<br><br>This is fine in Islam. In Islam if you are not the sultan or an emir or a noble you are just a slavish commoner destined to live in poverty under your oil baron. If you are lucky you can kill yourself in a fanatical jihadi suicide attempt and finally have a wife and family in heaven.<br><br>The sexual frustration rampant in Islamic societies is well attested. Muslims are simply not allowed to have a woman unless they are rich or powerful.<br><br>Western tradition enforced monogamy for this reason. Western tradition ultimate descends from the ancient Germanic societies in which every man was an armed freeman of his folk with his own wife and family. Only foreigners, people not part of the folk were slaves. Islam hates this and wants us all to be tax cattle for the princes and kings.<br><br>TLDR In Islam all men are slaves, in the west all men are free.","filename":"conan the barbarian","ext":".jpg","w":873,"h":1224,"tn_w":178,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490074767037,"time":1490074767,"md5":"jWVc5XDrUB8pJf4DYPZ4VQ==","fsize":601224,"resto":0,"id":"9htFe\/8B","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"islam-is-not-traditionalist","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

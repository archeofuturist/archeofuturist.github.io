Some hangares are destroyed, but airway just needs to be cleared from debris and can be used again, and Syria plans to continue using the base.<br><br>None of the air defences around the base are destroyed nor were even targeted. Dunno what 70! tomahawks hit, probably just dig a hole striking the same point.<br><br>It looks indeed that was just a &quot;show of force&quot; action for media and Assad got warned beforehand and damage minimized.<br><br>Neverless, even if it was all coordinated and agreed with Russia and the current scandal is a media farce, it still done irreversible political damage and there is no way to fix or downplay it - th only way now for US coalition is to escalate.<br><br>So while the strike itself might have been just symbolic, its just a begining of process of inevitable war. Russia will not back off, politicians thinking they can force it, scare it or call its bluff are idiots since we dont bluff - Syria is vital for us and we simply cant afford to let it fall, because if we do we`ll show we cant protect our allies and inevitably next will be Iran. We`ll escalate as much is needed before US backs off or world burns - not at once, gradually small step by small step, but eventually if its not resolved it`ll pile up to actual war, and if actual conflict will still not cool down idiots, tactical nukes and base strikes. We dont have resources in Syria to fight full scal war against NATO, so only way for us to fight them off is escalate raising the stakes.","time":1491552061,"resto":119906479,"id":"FkDV4lb4","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119910717,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)04:01:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119906479\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119906479<\/a><br>pls be real","time":1491552069,"resto":119906479,"id":"teKhr2dM","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119910825,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)04:02:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Okay?

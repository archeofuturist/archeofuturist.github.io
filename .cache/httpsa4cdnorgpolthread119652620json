One of the many reasons I can think of for deporting all illegals is their enormous cost, they pay around 15 billion dollars a year in taxes while costing the taxpayers about 90 billion dollars through public services which tax dollars pay for. One example of this would be if an illegal immigrant has a child who attends public school. The average annual cost for one student to attend public university is around 15 grand, now this illegals parents are not paying any income tax like the rest of us, essentially their kid gets a free ride while others have to pick up the slack. So yes, they all deserve to be deported for entering illegally.","time":1491425520,"resto":119652620,"id":"EI0bepjQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119654704,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)16:54:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119652620\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119652620<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He did not have a criminal record <\/span><br>Yes he did, he came here illegally","time":1491425654,"resto":119652620,"id":"9E0w3ZYi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119654771,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)16:54:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"So tragic.","filename":"1487983282120","ext":".gif","w":350,"h":233,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491425689313,"time":1491425689,"md5":"gRVFFjACYSg6Vzx+HEUXjA==","fsize":357189,"resto":119652620,"id":"pcBEcV8B","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119655332,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)16:59:39","name":"Anonymous","filename":"burn t he constitution","ext":".jpg","w":673,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":111,"tim":1491425979486,"time":1491425979,"md5":"pwKabhZTZ4iuxkgz\/egkWw==","fsize":27461,"resto":119652620,"id":"eXUBDyHr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

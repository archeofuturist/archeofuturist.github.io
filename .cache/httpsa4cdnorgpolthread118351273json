In a civil society, there is a universal concept of implied consent, which refers to most laws that serve the public interest. Implied consent as a concept is part of what allows law enforcement to do their job. In consenting to sexual intercourse, you consent to the consequences you open yourself up to. In becoming impregnated, it was a risk that you have implied consent to by consenting to sex. In the current day and age, if you get pregnant, with everything there is to reduce the likelihood of it, and it was from sex you consented to, you have no right to bring harm to your child in its developmental stage.","time":1490528646,"resto":118351273,"id":"ZmhKeVBP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118353509,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)07:44:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118353011\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118353011<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That&#039;s why we need to re-introduce social pressure to act in a way that won&#039;t fuck everybody else around.<\/span><br><br>the people (\/mothers) that are likely to abort in the first place are almost always very low on the social totem pole, undereducated and underclass, and already have HUGE social pressures against them<br><br>so tell me, how the fuck are you going to introduce social pressure that doesn&#039;t fuck everyone else about to prevent the lower classes from fucking everyone else about?","time":1490528670,"resto":118351273,"id":"jpyJAXye","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118353548,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)07:44:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118351273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118351273<\/a><br><br>I love abortion, it&#039;s basically a legal genocide on shitskins, future criminals and general children of single mother scum that I never have to cross paths with or get to shit up society<br><br>if a woman wants to get an abortion because she doesnt think she&#039;d be able to be a good mother then I fucking believe her and the kid would probably end up suicidal anyway and I fully encourage it","time":1490528692,"resto":118351273,"id":"gJJbWuGL","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

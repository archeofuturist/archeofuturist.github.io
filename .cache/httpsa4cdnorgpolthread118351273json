The tests should be the same for adoptive and natural parents. If the test determines that you are unfit, the baby is given up for adoption automatically. That would speed up several year long adoption queues, and ensure optimal nurture to children even born to less desirable races. (Gypsies are criminals, because they are raised to steal. If a gypsy baby is raised by a white family, it will only carry its inborn racial inferiority, and will still be able to support the society as a low-paid worker in stead of being a leach unemployed alcoholic thief.)","time":1490532943,"resto":118351273,"id":"3yubTNgD","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":118358934,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)08:57:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"No one has the right to use another person&#039;s body to live without that other person wanting it.

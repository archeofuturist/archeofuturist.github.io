But one rider, 18-year-old Josh Goyne, is standing up to the hate he faces on community message boards. \u201cToday I was asked if I thought it was good that gays died of AIDS, and then the guy said he wished it was 1850 so he could shoot me for being a fag,\u201d Goyne said in a video he posted to Facebook. But Goyne pledges to keep speaking out. \u201cThe gay cowboy will never be silenced,\u201d he said. \u201cI will forever be an openly gay cowboy. I will happily give a voice to those too scared to speak up.\u201d<br><br>In his Facebook video, Goyne sticks his neck out to stand up for other gay cowboys without a voice. \u201cThey think they\u2019re gonna stop me from riding in this week\u2019s rodeo\u2014not a chance in hell. I will proudly stand up to any homophobe and say right to their face that I\u2019m a proud openly gay cowboy.\u201d Goyne\u2019s activism has earned him a free trip to to the United States to compete in the \u201cTexas Tradition Rodeo,\u201d sponsored by the Texas Gay Rodeo Association. A GoFundMe page with a goal of $7,200 for his trip was set up by supporters in Colorado and it has already surpassed its goal. &#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;<br><br>--<br><br>http:\/\/www.bbc.com\/news\/world-austr<wbr>alia-33878326","filename":"gayrodeo","ext":".jpg","w":420,"h":236,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490392729088,"time":1490392729,"md5":"d2ElYT6A\/YWRZutKI96IRw==","fsize":26924,"resto":0,"id":"Frm8o7L8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gay-cowboy-will-never-be-silenced","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

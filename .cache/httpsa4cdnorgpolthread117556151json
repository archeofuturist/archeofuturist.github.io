Off the top of my head I can think of several examples of areas that could be easily relieved of congestion if the city built small flyovers, converted retarded roundabouts into proper grade separated crossing or simply removed bus lanes that sit empty for most of the time. Jamaica Road could do without bus lanes and a flyover on the tunnel roundabout, Elephant and Castle was literally redesigned to become even more congested recently for some unknown reason, the junction between the N. Circular and A12 should be free flowing and grade separated, the A2 running through shooter&#039;s hill could be converted into a dual carriageway too with minimal impact on the surrounding areas (but that is sacrilege beause all the hippies would protest against it) etc. <br><br>Kill yourself.

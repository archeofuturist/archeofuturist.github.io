The 4th reason is that ESPN is embracing liberal politics that alienate conservative viewers.<br><br>Several libs have responded to Davis on twitter asking him to cite examples of this bias, as if his whole article was about liberal bias and as if there were no examples.<br><br>He obliged and filled his feed with examples of ESPN&#039;s biases.<br><br>I&#039;ve definitely noticed political bias at ESPN, and that in conjunction with them not having much real sports programming has led me to turn to other sports stations.<br><br>Have you guys experienced something similar?

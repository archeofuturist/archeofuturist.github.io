In Fascism man is an individual who is the nation and the country. He is this by a moral law which embraces and binds together individuals and generations in an established tradition and mission, a moral law which suppresses the instinct to lead a life confined to a brief cycle of pleasure in order, instead, to replace it within the orbit of duty in a superior conception of life, free from the limits of time and space a life in which the individual by self-abnegation and by the sacrifice of his particular interests, even by death, realises the entirely spiritual existence in which his value as a man consists.","time":1490909411,"resto":118971450,"id":"qt9uU5C1","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118971623,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:30:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;ethical conception<\/span><br>This positive conception of life is evidently an ethical conception.

I don&#039;t think anything is going to happen. Kim will just keep on being Kim and trump will keep doing little bullshit that makes his voters think they are actually helping or doing anything that makes actual sense to them. The military through the media will keep the masses in constant paranoia and suspense which wears down reason and makes people vulnerable to going along with utter stupidity. Same old song and dance , nothing new under the sun.","time":1492345281,"resto":121351921,"id":"0BbteeFO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

I have been living with general anxiety disorder and panic disorder for about 12 years now and yes, anxiety is real and uncontrollable for some people. For the record, anxiety != depression which is a common mistake people make. This mistaking is ingrained in a lot of people&#039;s minds because a lot of people in their moody teen years claim to be suffering from anxiety when in reality they have no idea what it is.<br><br>Anxiety is fear. It&#039;s that fight or flight reaction that you have when put in a confrontational situation where your life is at risk. I, like many people who have anxiety, will get this feeling in seemingly normal situations and most times I cannot explain why I feel this way. When this happens, my breath becomes short, my fingers and toes tingle, my heart rate increases, etc. People who are first experiencing these symptoms often mistake it for a heart attack. The symptoms are real, and while the fear is just in your head, the physical translation is pretty fucking scary. It can cause car accidents if you&#039;re driving it can become that serious.<br><br>To this degree, anxiety meds DO help, but only temporarily. The meds I&#039;m talking about are benzos like xanax, klonopin, valium, etc. In my experience, anti-depressants or SSRIs have no effect or even have an opposite effect, making symptoms worse. The truly effective way to deal with anxiety disorders is cognitive behavioral therapy. It involves learning what causes your anxiety and panic attacks and finding coping mechanisms. This can take time, but it does work. I haven&#039;t been on any meds for my anxiety for 5 years now and haven&#039;t had a panic attack in 3.<br><br>I just wanted to set the record straight, though I know this will fall on deaf ears for the most part.","time":1493498804,"resto":123359867,"id":"8fjhoZu\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123379247,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)16:46:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123378471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123378471<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123378723\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123378723<\/a><br><br>of course there may be anxious people who have an inherent disorder. but in most cases it is due to imbalanced lifestyle. the outer self we present to the public does not match t he true inner state. for example an isolated person who has no practice socializing, will naturally be more anxious.<br><br>just like a first day of work is more nerve wracking.<br><br>so the solution is not medications, but is instead turning the TV off and getting outside. or instead of sleeping, going to work and getting interpersonal and work experience.<br><br>any lack of work, inner or outer, causes anxiety. and practice and experience eliminate anxiety.<br><br>but of course it is more profitable to say someone has a chemical imbalance and blame it on some inherent biological issue.","time":1493498818,"resto":123359867,"id":"DGw1vEqd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123379323,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)16:47:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123377796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123377796<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but I think<\/span><br>Don&#039;t.

The biggest red pill for me has been the disappearance of our russian friends. That sortve confirms that some trump support came from Moscow paid posters. thats fine since nearly all of Hillarys support was paid by david brock. the thing that does concern me however are the outlets and reporters that have turned against Trump so harshly.

The biggest red pill for me has been the disappearance of our russian friends. That sortve confirms that some trump support came from Moscow paid posters. thats fine since nearly all of Hillarys support was paid by david brock. the thing that does concern me however are the outlets and reporters that have turned against Trump so harshly. Like Infowars and that watson guy. Kinda makes me believe their paychecks are connected to entites that support a pro-Russia stance. In a way its been good to see whos who.<br><br>As for what Trump is actually doing he said all along that if it were up to him he would bomb the shit out of anyone in the ME that got in our way and he said he would do safe zones and he said he would take the oil.<br> i also think the DNC did some reverse psychology blaming and accusing trump of putin loyalties when it was Hillary and Podesta actually making money dealing with russia issues. If anything it was Obama, hillary and Podesta in Putins back pocket and trump has fucked that deal up.<br><br>When you take out the element of paid posters what we see in the ME today is absolutley no different than any other time period. we have ALWAYS launched missiles at whatever government there that pisses us off. Reagan.Bush41, Clinton, Bush43, Obama and Trump have all done it. the difference is today we have the internet and legions of people making a living supporting one side or the other.","time":1491842463,"resto":120455706,"id":"dkihvVPF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120456613,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)12:41:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120455706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120455706<\/a><br><br>Tax reform isn&#039;t something you can just &quot;push through&quot;.

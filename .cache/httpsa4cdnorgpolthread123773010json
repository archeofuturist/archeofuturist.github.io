Germans are barbarians by nature, the great Germans of history have simply been civilised and enlightened by countries of culture: Austria, France, Holland, Italy. The autism, I propose is determined by their language and their insulatiry. Notice how the Prussians and Germans who were raised to also speak Italian, French, or English were on the whole more enlightened people. The abstruseness and humorlessness of the German is caused by the precision and rigidness of his language. And this mechanical language, with a specific word for everything, has produced many great philosophers and scientists, many great classifiers of esoteric and insignificant concepts and objects.<br><br>Is not the fluidity and beauty of French language reflected in the French attitude on life? English with its &quot;sea, see, see&quot;, and it&#039;s &quot;they&#039;re, their, there&quot;, and &quot;the thing he had had had had no effect&quot;, or sentences like &quot;a rough-coated, dough-faced, thoughtful ploughman strode through the streets of Scarborough; after falling into a slough, he coughed, houghed, and hiccoughed.&quot;. Has not the flexibility and paradoxical nature of English contributed to its tradition of wit, humor, and comical misunderstandings?<br><br>The German is immunized against all dangers: one may call him a scoundrel, parasite, barbarian, warmonger, it all runs off him like water off a raincoat.","filename":"1488927273463","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":529,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1493736756135,"time":1493736756,"md5":"tPAGeM8PlHL9VjZeiq\/bdw==","fsize":133339,"resto":123773010,"id":"9QSf5U\/y","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123775042,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)10:54:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123773010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123773010<\/a>","filename":"1480124791146","ext":".png","w":874,"h":1086,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493736876111,"time":1493736876,"md5":"RVlqjRZYQB7S22G5EqvuGg==","fsize":220095,"resto":123773010,"id":"ywH133vH","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":123775210,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)10:56:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123773010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123773010<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123774837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123774837<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The eternal anglo<\/span><br>is not the germans that are ruining europe, its the wars you and your burger friends are fighting in the middle east. but go ahead just blame everything on germany like everything","time":1493736965,"resto":123773010,"id":"vUtBa8BG","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":123776063,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:04:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"You bombed their countries, overthrew their governments, supported terrorists or fully invaded them.<br><br>Also 60 years of occupation to fully infiltrate our politics and media.

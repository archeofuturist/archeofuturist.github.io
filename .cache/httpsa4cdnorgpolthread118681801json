I did a first sum-up here ( <a href=\"#p118695573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118695573<\/a> ), but I really advice you to read his &quot;principles of philosophy of right &quot; with some help like little courses on the subject to understand the main idea of dialectics according to Hegel. <br><br>Marx use Hegel&#039;s dialectic in a non-spiritual and materialist way, that is to try to prove that the movement of history wasn&#039;t the movement of some hypothetical Spirit but of the concrete struggle of classes, he isn&#039;t a theorician of the Revolution, he right really few about how and when the revolution should happen, what he did was more a analysis of history as an eternal struggle of classes, the &quot;Manifesto&quot; vulgarize it and &quot;the Capital&quot; go much further in details, it&#039;s in it that you will find precise analysis about social phenomenas and sub-classes like the lumpenproletariat. <br><br>Lenin and Engels, on the contrary were theoricians of the Revolution and tried to see how you can apply the materialist dialectic and how it is possible to provoke a communist revolution. Read &quot; The State and the revolution &quot; to see how you manage to &quot; make the society communist&quot;, also another interesting read is the commentary he does on the The Science of Logic&quot;. You can read Hegel &quot; Science of Logic &quot; that is a more metaphysical and logical expression of his dialectic than the philosophy of the right, and then read the commentary of Lenin to understand well the differences between Idealist dialectic and materialist one, as well as the common points between the two. ( https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/cons-logic\/ch01.htm#<wbr>LCW38_103 ). <br><br>I wish to clarify though that I&#039;m not a commie, but not for economical reasons but for philosophical ones.

The cancer is in Hegel, and all the progeny of Hegel, wether it is Marx and then commies or fascist states, are infected by this cancer. The thing, is, it doesn&#039;t work because an human being is not simply a being for the state or a being for the victory of the proletariat, it is before all, a singularity, with spiritual needs, and that formal logic applied to the world negate that primordial character of the human being thus creating paradoxes that creates million of deaths.

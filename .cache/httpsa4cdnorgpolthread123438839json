The as-yet-unnamed carrier still requires much more additional work before it joins PLAN&#039;s fleet. But the ship&#039;s construction began less than five years ago (in November of 2012), and it only moved into full dry-dock construction in 2015. And China appears poised to churn out additional new aircraft carriers even faster based upon the experience acquired in this first homegrown carrier project.<br><br>Adding a second aircraft carrier will dramatically increase China&#039;s ability to project power in the Western Pacific. There are limits to the reach of the Liaoning and its new sister ship, however. Both are conventional steam-powered ships rather than nuclear-powered. The new carrier has a displacement of 50,000 metric tons (slightly larger than the Liaoning), which is half the size of the Ford. But while the Liaoning has been outfitted as a training ship, Zhu pointed out in March, the new carrier will be China&#039;s first real combat carrier. And as China military strategist PLA Major General Peng Guangqian explained, while China&#039;s new carrier is not on par with US aircraft carriers, the difference is partially &quot;because US Navy doctrine requires unchallenged global dominance, while Chinese carriers are mainly used for self-defense.&quot;<br><br>That &quot;self-defense&quot; is likely to be focused on &quot;sea denial&quot; operations, particularly in the disputed waters of the South China Sea and Yellow Sea. But the new combat carrier could also allow China to conduct operations much further afield.","filename":"ChineseCraftmanship","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":641,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1493528450126,"time":1493528450,"md5":"qjb\/mkk\/RTkFg7HHOLVnow==","fsize":129394,"resto":0,"id":"LBGG0qmv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"china-launches-domestically-produced-aircraft","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":3,"unique_ips":7},{"no":123440543,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)01:18:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123438839\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123438839<\/a><br>bump","time":1493529501,"resto":123438839,"id":"33UiPLts","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123440657,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)01:19:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"A<br>FUCKING<br>RAMP","time":1493529566,"resto":123438839,"id":"1K+eUllf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123440716,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)01:19:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123438839\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123438839<\/a><br>bump","filename":"JOE BIDEN PEDO","ext":".jpg","w":1020,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1493529597881,"time":1493529597,"md5":"K8r4gWI9wF6j8kad\/l72NA==","fsize":290012,"resto":123438839,"id":"6x6Y+etQ","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":123440938,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)01:22:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123438839\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123438839<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;oh look a fucking ramp<\/span><br>says the increasingly nervous americans for the 100th time this week","filename":"1493487260419","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":241,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1493529752695,"time":1493529752,"md5":"Gp9Mj0h8tdqfx3XA1TygRg==","fsize":6841,"resto":123438839,"id":"qWcaI9b5","country":"CN","country_name":"China"},{"no":123441138,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)01:24:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123440938\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123440938<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ching chong ling long<\/span><br>Says a chink for the 100th time this week","time":1493529860,"resto":123438839,"id":"UjzOu3ZS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123442687,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)01:42:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;It has a ramp<\/span>","filename":"chinese_kek_","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1150,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1493530923971,"time":1493530923,"md5":"LgqTj9XfSzR5xE7TGtp5wg==","fsize":202441,"resto":123438839,"id":"Q72teYTE","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

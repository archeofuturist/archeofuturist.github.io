The as-yet-unnamed carrier still requires much more additional work before it joins PLAN&#039;s fleet. But the ship&#039;s construction began less than five years ago (in November of 2012), and it only moved into full dry-dock construction in 2015. And China appears poised to churn out additional new aircraft carriers even faster based upon the experience acquired in this first homegrown carrier project.<br><br>Adding a second aircraft carrier will dramatically increase China&#039;s ability to project power in the Western Pacific. There are limits to the reach of the Liaoning and its new sister ship, however. Both are conventional steam-powered ships rather than nuclear-powered. The new carrier has a displacement of 50,000 metric tons (slightly larger than the Liaoning), which is half the size of the Ford. But while the Liaoning has been outfitted as a training ship, Zhu pointed out in March, the new carrier will be China&#039;s first real combat carrier. And as China military strategist PLA Major General Peng Guangqian explained, while China&#039;s new carrier is not on par with US aircraft carriers, the difference is partially &quot;because US Navy doctrine requires unchallenged global dominance, while Chinese carriers are mainly used for self-defense.&quot;<br><br>That &quot;self-defense&quot; is likely to be focused on &quot;sea denial&quot; operations, particularly in the disputed waters of the South China Sea and Yellow Sea. But the new combat carrier could also allow China to conduct operations much further afield.","filename":"ChineseCraftmanship","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":641,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1493528450126,"time":1493528450,"md5":"qjb\/mkk\/RTkFg7HHOLVnow==","fsize":129394,"resto":0,"id":"LBGG0qmv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"china-launches-domestically-produced-aircraft","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

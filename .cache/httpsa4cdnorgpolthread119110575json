As of May2015, $2.3billion in antidumping and countervailing duties owed to the Government remained uncollected, often from importers that lack assets located in the UnitedStates. It is therefore the policy of theUnitedStates to impose appropriate bonding requirements, based on risk assessments, on entries of articles subject to antidumping and countervailing duties, when necessary to protect the revenue of the UnitedStates.<br><br>_Sec_. _2_. _Definitions_. For the purposes of this order:<br><br>(a) the term &quot;importer&quot; has the meaning given in section4321 of title19, UnitedStates Code; and<br><br>(b) the term &quot;covered importer&quot; means any importer of articles subject to antidumping or countervailing duties for which one of the following is true: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) has no record of previous imports by the importer; CBP has a record of the importer&#039;s failure to fully pay antidumping or countervailing duties; or CBP has a record ofthe importer&#039;s failure to pay antidumping or countervailing duties in a timely manner.","filename":"1487271470564","ext":".jpg","w":4784,"h":2912,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":76,"tim":1491002151587,"time":1491002151,"md5":"AeQtP4RuZqFxFuVY0aM+kQ==","fsize":3016860,"resto":119110575,"id":"5A\/0IMaQ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119113478,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)19:16:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119113340\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119113340<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lightskinned and not overtly negroid<\/span><br><br>I&#039;LL ALLOW IT","time":1491002195,"resto":119110575,"id":"XrTugPra","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119113481,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)19:16:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119112888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119112888<\/a><br>What is Kek trying to say to me?","time":1491002196,"resto":119110575,"id":"EFrcJc6o","country":"PE","country_name":"Peru"},{"no":119113484,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)19:16:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119110575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119110575<\/a><br>Someone please explain to me why we have to use the nuclear option? <br><br>Why don&#039;t we let the democrats filibuster?

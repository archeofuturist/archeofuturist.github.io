Unless you&#039;re experiencing a period of HUGE growth in which you have a FUCKLOAD of jobs which NEED filling. And by NEED I don&#039;t mean &#039;people here won&#039;t work for serf wages so bring me 5000 Pajeets&#039; I mean &#039;We want to build a million factories and become a superpower so we simply need a lot of grunt labour that we don&#039;t have.&#039;<br><br>To put it simply like Friedman did, &#039;if they&#039;re coming for jobs immigration is good, if they&#039;re coming for gibs they&#039;re going to destroy your country.&#039; Paraphrased of course. And that&#039;s not even getting into the social impacts. Post-colonial semi-mongrel societies like the US and Australia can kind of take an influx of similar-ish immigrants without having our culture annihilated, Greeks and Italians coming in didn&#039;t completely erode our national identity. But if you&#039;re a nation-state you should preserve that at all costs. England should never have let itself stop being English. Australia has nothing to really live for anymore but that&#039;s no great tragedy since we were a young country. England actually had a strong a beautiful culture cultivated over thousands of years, now the Mayor of London is a Muslim. It was proven by Robert Putnam (who politely excused himself from the academia spotlight after the discovery so that the rabid left wouldn&#039;t have to) that diversity in all forms destroys social capital (a term which generally describes the strength and wellbeing of civil society). People are happier and more socially active when surrounded by their own. Neighbors who don&#039;t speak your language, odd coloured faces, a lack of shared history and cultural identity, these things all make people unhappy and cause them to disengage form society.<br><br>But of course I&#039;m a Luddite so take everything I say with that in mind.

(For those who don&#039;t know, these DNS logs set up half the Russian narrative and possibly were the trigger for an FBI investigation.)<br><br>Presumably she thinks that it will blow over if she remains silent and that Lorenzen won&#039;t be forced to explain herself in a job-threatening manner. Remember, one reason Lorenzen chose to remain anonymous is that she was terrified of losing contracts and being condemned within the tech community.<br><br>https:\/\/weaponizedautism.wordpress.<wbr>com\/<br><br>This link has been retweeted by prominent security researchers, including John Hopkins professor of cryptology Matthew Green and some other prominent folks in infosec, but has been largely ignored by even Trump-friendly news outlets.<br><br>I&#039;ve been trying to track down the website owner to no avail. I&#039;d like to recommend some changes to him so that the site doesn&#039;t look like a fucking kid created it. If what I suspect about the author is true, though, he has the cyber means to blow many of \/pol\/&#039;s pet targets wide open, so I think we should be encouraging this work way more than we encourage the work of all those fucking LARPers and rightcelebs with their &quot;secret sources&quot; and unverifiable crap.<br><br>In the meantime, here&#039;s how to help: Don&#039;t let @ljean off the hook on April Lorenzen (April Lorenzen herself stays clear of most social media). Blast the link to DailyCaller, TheGatewayPundit, Breitbart, and so on. Blast it to all the right-wing Twitter personalities you know. If you&#039;re extra brave, contact AlfaBank and bring the information to their attention. AlfaBank has already started legal proceedings but is apparently unaware of who &quot;Tea Leaves&quot; is (April Lorenzen) and unaware of the forged-logs information.","filename":"ljean","ext":".gif","w":636,"h":272,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":106,"tim":1493084431476,"time":1493084431,"md5":"g3EnKqDad81lsV+Fjc1unw==","fsize":19496,"resto":0,"id":"uMYDRNI+","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"notice-hillbots-have-been-nervously-silent-about","country_name":"Australia","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122673185,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)21:44:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"It seems like those still pushing this lunacy have moved now to saying that Baltic state IC agencies have lots of tape recordings.

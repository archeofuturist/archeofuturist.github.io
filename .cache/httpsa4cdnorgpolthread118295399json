Not everyone has jobs that give you insurance. Welders, electricians, plumbers, etc...all these careers I respect and admire but their employers don&#039;t give them health insurance. <br><br>Ironically everything I agree with is what Trump has advocated forever but most Republicans who voted for him thought he just wanted to repeal Obamacare.

A nigger in Alabama sues to force the federal government to do more, the case winds up in the Supreme Court. With 8 years of SCOTUS appointments, the Supreme Court reexamines Brown v. Board of Ed., distinguishing it and introducing a new doctrine of facial racial neutrality, but no requirement to actively desegregate schools. Neighborhoods successful self-segreate further to keep nigs out of white schools across the country, even in &quot;blue&quot; states like Massachusetts. Bussing wars never happen. Only shitty liberal schools continue to admit blacks.<br><br>In Europe, the European Coal and Steel community continues efforts at European unity, but the currency project doesn&#039;t get off the ground floor, the Bretton Woods system still being strong and functional. The European project develops only on free trade and cultural unity lines.

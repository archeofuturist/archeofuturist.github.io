The story of Star Trek is the complete opposite. Their most legendary figure is an anarchy-capitalist. There were multiple episodes about the danger of communism. The idea is that when it comes to production of scarce resources, capitalism is superior. When you can replicate anything with the push of a button, the need for work and trade is greatly minimized. That isn&#039;t communism as the means of production is not centrally owned in Star Trek. People still privately own the means of production. In fact, MORE people privately own the means of production in Star Trek than our current society as just about everyone owns a replicator.","time":1490649272,"resto":118557500,"id":"brRUDJ7v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118563172,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:14:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118560669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118560669<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That and every one somehow learned to act like white people<\/span><br>More like... 90% of people people learned to act like the most well-mannered 20% of white people act today.","time":1490649297,"resto":118557500,"id":"+0YUiN67","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118563239,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:15:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118562586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118562586<\/a><br>no, we need proper replicators that can create anything that you can be made to desire. it is the only way to end the grip that the marxist troublemakers have on society and create utopia.","time":1490649337,"resto":118557500,"id":"n2BCyI5J","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118563395,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:16:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118563172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118563172<\/a><br>Crazy what happens when people leave behind stone-age ideals and have everything they could ever want.","time":1490649409,"resto":118557500,"id":"fQpPiQFD","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":118563443,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:17:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118563012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118563012<\/a><br>well put. then that is what we need","filename":"t16-9","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490649429337,"time":1490649429,"md5":"DlfDCsjvLQ7vBnq8sSOViw==","fsize":1273324,"resto":118557500,"id":"ZK9Fi8Oa","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118563560,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:18:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118557500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118557500<\/a><br>If things go well, one day we will have to adopt a society similar to Star Trek.<br><br>What we need is for automation of goods and services to become so efficient that most jobs become a thing of the past and governments will have to transition into a socialist economy.

There is a reason Republicans and Cleetus see no issue with wages and Democrats do. Its cheap as fuck to live in bumfuck no where.

It&#039;s completely possible to live decently on minimum wage. You might have to share an apartment and ride the bus but it can be done. The issue is that many low income earners are just bad with money. They constantly make bad financial decisions. Giving these people more money does nothing to fix their behaviors. <br>In some cases, these people were actually worse off with higher pay due to losing their free government benefits. When forced to pay their own rent or buy their own food with their money they somehow couldn&#039;t manage.","time":1492064788,"resto":120874439,"id":"VsuJnlHO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120879080,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)02:38:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120874439\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120874439<\/a><br>You are going about this the wrong way.<br>Think supply and demand, get rid of immigrants, make jobs a surplus, make labour in demand then watch working standards and pay skyrocket, no minimum wage or government intervention needed.

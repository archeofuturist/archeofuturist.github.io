Where it is not true, it will generally be found that the writer is some kind of rebel, expressing his private opinions and not a \u2018party line\u2019. Orthodoxy, of whatever colour, seems to demand a lifeless, imitative style...When one watches some tired hack on the platform mechanically repeating the familiar phrases \u2014 bestial, atrocities, iron heel, bloodstained tyranny, free peoples of the world, stand shoulder to shoulder \u2014 one often has a curious feeling that one is not watching a live human being but some kind of dummy: a feeling which suddenly becomes stronger at moments when the light catches the speaker&#039;s spectacles and turns them into blank discs which seem to have no eyes behind them. And this is not altogether fanciful. A speaker who uses that kind of phraseology has gone some distance toward turning himself into a machine. The appropriate noises are coming out of his larynx, but his brain is not involved, as it would be if he were choosing his words for himself. If the speech he is making is one that he is accustomed to make over and over again, he may be almost unconscious of what he is saying, as one is when one utters the responses in church. And this reduced state of consciousness, if not indispensable, is at any rate favourable to political conformity.<\/span>","time":1492418803,"resto":121488607,"id":"QG\/HIxFm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121502925,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)04:48:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Drumpfies.

I know the pic is from UC Davis, but UC Davis got so much shit over this incident and has tried to scrub this from the internet.<br><br>I figure most universities would be too worried about liability to let these protests go so unpoliced. But maybe Berkeley knows that sending its police in will inevitably result in one of these types of incidents (police clashing with Antifa) that will be immortalized on the internet.

In it&#039;s broadest sense it was a description of the whole evolving far-right, reactionary zeitgeist that includes Moldbug, NRX, \/pol\/, frog twitter, My Posting Career, the identitarian movement, etc. But most of all it was the new, young white nationalism. <br><br>\/pol\/ doesn&#039;t need a label- If anything, we&#039;re just the Right, or the far right- you don&#039;t really need a cute term when you&#039;re actively calling for a race war. We should have no leaders, no group or movement that we&#039;re tried to because it could always go south. \/pol\/ doesn&#039;t hop on the ship and therefore can&#039;t go down with the ship. All we need are our principals and dank memes. But by the original, broadest sense, \/pol\/ was unquestionably included in the phenomenon that the alt-right described- to pretend otherwise would be like some leftist going &quot;Um no dude, I&#039;m not a COMMUNIST, Im just a guy who wants to see the proletariat rise up in a global revolution and seize the means of production don&#039;t label be brah&quot;<br><br>But this all changed in 2016 after the Trump phenomenon brought increased attention to us and Spencer evidently saw the change for gone and attention.

Giving it a logo, especially one that fucking shitty, is not in keeping with the original meaning of the term, which was more a broad description of a set of discussions. On the other hand, Spencer, unlike nearly all of the visible personalities who have ever been associated with the term, keeps the focus squarely and unflinchingly on white identity and white nationalism.<br><br>Doing college speaking tours and never ceding an inch on the focus of white, white, white is incredibly valuable in a world where everything inevitably slides left when it enters the public discussion.","time":1493406460,"resto":123220685,"id":"bXTsbFGi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123231110,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)15:08:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123229278\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123229278<\/a><br>Actually I found that article from googling and find it interesting.

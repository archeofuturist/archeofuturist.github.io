The Cornish, for example, (who were pro-Brexit) get a lot of money from the EU for infrastructure improvements. They asked the government to cover the shortfall, and were awarded about a fifth of what they&#039;re used to. Don&#039;t expect any high speed Paddington to Truro train lines cropping up any time soon. In fact, expect infrastructure to deteriorate as the UK can&#039;t afford to subsidize buses, broadband lines, airports etc. Farmers are dreading Brexit because the EU doles out masses of agricultural grants. Universities won&#039;t be able to continue their research with quite the same gusto either, because we lose access to EU co-operative research programmes and funds. Tim Peake was sent to the ISS by the ESA, not the UKSA.<br><br>Not only that, but they&#039;re trying to take our biggest industry away from us, by offering the London financial sector incentives to move to the EU. That&#039;s right, an estimated 9.6% of the UK&#039;s GDP comes from those fat cat bankers in the Square Mile. The average Daily Mail reader loves to hate them and their big bonuses, but like it or not, they&#039;re a tiny drop in a very big bucket. They prop up a vast proportion of the national economy, and that particular bucket&#039;s drying up really fucking quickly.<br><br>Speaking of lost income, you know what&#039;s really suffering now? The NHS. If we can&#039;t keep the banks in London, we don&#039;t get their taxes and we certainly won&#039;t be able to afford to pay everyone&#039;s medical bills, because that \u00a3350m per week sure as shit isn&#039;t going to materialize.","filename":"1490790622215","ext":".png","w":800,"h":1200,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491390525629,"time":1491390525,"md5":"ihmi4OAMLF52kTbIF79gMQ==","fsize":558962,"resto":119595034,"id":"d1Ea8YrH","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119595595,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)07:08:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119595034\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119595034<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anglo posting anti-other europeans threads<\/span><br>Nothing new i guess<br>Time for some enriching.<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tyh<wbr>mlS-CMsQ&amp;index=2&amp;list=FLw6PgPAS48GW<wbr>uSuvMY5WKzw&amp;t=212s&amp;ab_channel=Offic<wbr>ialGoodFellas","filename":"!

A RECRUDESCENCE OF ENLIGHTENMENT TRIUMPHALISM BUT ALWAYS AN ARISTOCRATIC GLEAM IN THE EYE.....

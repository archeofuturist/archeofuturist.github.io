Sadly, I have been suffering with severe depression and schizophrenia for quite some time. I can&#039;t take life any more and most of my friends have abandoned me because of my support for Trump. I can no longer live in a world that&#039;s run by globalists and whores and on top of that my own mental health. I want to live in a world were I don&#039;t have to talk to myself frequently it&#039;s not bad to be an American. One of these days I&#039;m gonna commit suicide. I need to know the best way out. I&#039;m reaching out to you because you are the only friends they never left me. You made me feel like I was a part of something. Thank you.","filename":"hitler-suicide[1]","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":440,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":171,"tim":1491183743426,"time":1491183743,"md5":"0rijUYSb\/SVTGgc+sFErvA==","fsize":49795,"resto":0,"id":"LbFWSP+3","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-and-mental-illness","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119275300,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:45:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why are these always posted here every couple of days?

I know schizophrenia is really hard to deal with. I really meant no offense, it is just that lately there have been a lot of &quot;im leaving&quot; posts which drive me nuts because they are shills.

Ive been in that position and I know sometimes it feels like you are in a burning building and you would rather just jump. You dont have to though, there are people who really care, and guide you out of the troubles, or at least make them worth fighting through. thats how I got through it.","time":1491184347,"resto":119274929,"id":"bMDghKs4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119276006,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:53:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119275541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119275541<\/a><br>met some cool people who are now my friends and care about me, started working on my future (music) something i&#039;m very passionate about, started seeing a psychiatrist and taking meds. as someone who wanted to kill himself every week, sometimes even everyday of the week (during the month i tried to kill myself mainly) for three years, the only problem i have rn is social anxiety something i&#039;m trying to overcome and is slowly getting better","time":1491184381,"resto":119274929,"id":"2iHFukp6","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":119276095,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:54:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119274929\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119274929<\/a><br>Make sure to stream your suicide.<br><br>The sooner the better","time":1491184447,"resto":119274929,"id":"WC4ucWcj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119276473,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:57:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119276095\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119276095<\/a><br><br>this","time":1491184675,"resto":119274929,"id":"egrdUoCy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

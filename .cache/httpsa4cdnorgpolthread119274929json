Sadly, I have been suffering with severe depression and schizophrenia for quite some time. I can&#039;t take life any more and most of my friends have abandoned me because of my support for Trump. I can no longer live in a world that&#039;s run by globalists and whores and on top of that my own mental health. I want to live in a world were I don&#039;t have to talk to myself frequently it&#039;s not bad to be an American. One of these days I&#039;m gonna commit suicide. I need to know the best way out. I&#039;m reaching out to you because you are the only friends they never left me. You made me feel like I was a part of something.

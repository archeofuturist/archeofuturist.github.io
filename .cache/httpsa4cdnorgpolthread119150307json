Everyone in the socialist 1970&#039;s with the dithering Jimmy Carter, failing US Foreign Policy (Iran, Peace Accords) hated &quot;Rotten Ronnie&quot;. But everything Ronald wanted to do, made sense to the average American and for the first time in 14 years, Americans felt like they were Awesome again. Music and pop culture followed. In the late 70&#039;s everyone was fixiated on the decline of the 1960&#039;s nuclear family, the rust belt &amp; a &quot;dead USA&quot;. Good example is the &quot;Cheers \/ Archie Bunker&quot; pop trend. 1980&#039;s wiped all that out overnight.<br>Its the same deal today. CBS will never admit it, but they are as dead as disco.","time":1491028259,"resto":119150307,"id":"5xzXjzE1","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

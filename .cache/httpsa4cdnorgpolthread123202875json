I dont want turks or kurds there. Honestly id rather have turks there than kurds, your proxies are mostly arabs and the Syrian Arab Army knows how to deal with them. Plus turks and arabs understand each other, kurds dont and take orders from Israel.<br>Dont underestimate how corrupt Erdogan is, him and Assad used to be close allies. Im sure even Assad would rather have turkish presence in the north than a US\/Israeli proxy he cant control or fight.","filename":"downloadfile-1","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":341,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1493395923986,"time":1493395923,"md5":"qjoVB\/\/cKrDY\/CkJXc4Uiw==","fsize":24193,"resto":123202875,"id":"kWn7Hi6J","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123210552,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:12:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123209755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123209755<\/a><br>tanks south Africa bro i m going now see you friends","time":1493395941,"resto":123202875,"id":"xej5Je19","country":"MK","country_name":"Macedonia"},{"no":123210604,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:12:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123210317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123210317<\/a><br>He gives me a lot more Turkish vibes, but could be Ar*b as well.","time":1493395967,"resto":123202875,"id":"DUSfa8M8","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":123210624,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:12:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123210528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123210528<\/a><br>are you palestinian? i need to know","time":1493395978,"resto":123202875,"id":"GeXsqKva","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":123210725,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:13:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123209972\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123209972<\/a><br>I think Erdogan will make a deal with trump, erdogan has more to offer the US than the kurds.<br>Otherwise Erdogan will go full Russia, Iran and China mode.","time":1493396035,"resto":123202875,"id":"kWn7Hi6J","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123210772,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:14:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123210552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123210552<\/a><br>Godspeed","time":1493396061,"resto":123202875,"id":"S0BCMmho","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":123210808,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)12:14:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123209755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123209755<\/a><br>Fucken hell.

Melgen, a prominent ophthalmologist, has been the longtime political benefactor of Mr. Menendez, a Democrat. Both face federal corruption charges in an unrelated case scheduled to go on trial in September in Newark. The senator is accused of trading political favors for free trips on the doctor\u2019s private jet, lavish vacations to his resort home in the Dominican Republic and a stay at a five-star hotel in Paris.<br><br>A jury in Palm Beach County, Fla., found Dr. Melgen guilty on all 67 counts of Medicare fraud, and according to prosecutors in the case, he could spend at least 15 years in prison. The conviction and the sentence he now faces could increase pressure on Dr. Melgen to cooperate with the authorities in the case against Mr. Menendez, his co-defendant in their pending trial.<br><br>After he is sentenced in the Florida case in July, Dr. Melgen, if he should choose to cooperate, could seek to have that sentence reduced. A provision of federal law allows a judge, upon a motion by the government, to reduce a defendant\u2019s sentence if the defendant is found to have provided \u201csubstantial assistance in investigating or prosecuting another person.\u201d","filename":"Melgen","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493498755420,"time":1493498755,"md5":"kHZVS8td6YEn819rpXbQNw==","fsize":38683,"resto":0,"id":"AB56rg4R","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"crooked-doc-with-ties-to-dem-senator-convicted-of","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123380729,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)16:59:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123379124\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123379124<\/a><br>bump","time":1493499593,"resto":123379124,"id":"Mbi8tTyd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

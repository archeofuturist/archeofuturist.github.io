After the champions of reason had gotten rid of God and destroyed any hope for paradise after death, the great ideologies of the 20th century took it upon themselves to create paradise on Earth. They failed and caused unprecedented suffering. <br>From one extreme to the next. From seeking paradise at any cost, the West went to seeking nothing at all. The age of postmodernity came. Society became cynical, truth became subjective, and morality became relative. There was no longer any good greater than the individual, no motive for the artists to depict, no purpose in life other than comfort and wealth. Anyone who suggested that people cannot have their own truths, that truth is singular and subject only to reason and evidence was shouted down, anyone who suggested that the morals of one culture might be superior to those of another was shouted down. But why? Out of fear that the past could return. After all, history had shown that once people believed they had the truth on their side, they stopped at nothing to crush those who opposed them. After seeing this, people decided that only a plurality of truths could safeguard the peace in the West. These people were the forefathers of the social justice warriors. They fought a singular vision of the truth because of the horrors that swept our civilization. They were wrong, but their intentions were good. This cannot be said of their successors, the SJW. They no longer hated just the ideologies of the 20th century, they hated all that the West ever stood for and they set of to destroy it and replace it with all things different under the pretext of inclusion and diversity. Thus was born a new ideology, a new cancer was created from what was meant to be the cure for all cancers to come.","filename":"The_Parthenon_in_Athens","ext":".jpg","w":1144,"h":804,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":175,"tim":1490740415789,"time":1490740415,"md5":"\/5XUFNrhba6oIRhthq9Bnw==","fsize":347181,"resto":0,"id":"Z4Wd0QNl","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-is-at-the-core-of-western-civilization","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118707462,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)18:34:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"part 2 of 2: <br>Today we, the children of the West are waking up to this cancer and we are beginning to look for a new cure. Today begins the end of postmodernity, but what will come in its place? A return of the far right and the far left or something more mature? We have learned from the ideologies of the past that believing to own truth is terribly foolish and now that diversity has failed to replace the culture of the west, we have learned that believing there is no truth at all is equally foolish. <br>The truth is out there and we must begin once again to search for it and to defend what we have found of it. This has always been at the soul of western civilization: the search for truth. The Greeks were the champions of reason, the Romans of law, the Christians of love and the men of the Enlightenment were the champions of science. Although different in innumerable ways, they all sought to find and defend the truth. Let us return now to that tradition and reclaim from the social justice warriors that which is sacred to us, the truth.","time":1490740443,"resto":118707400,"id":"Z4Wd0QNl","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118707860,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)18:37:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118707400\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118707400<\/a><br>The USA.<br><br>You live on the east side of the Atlantic.

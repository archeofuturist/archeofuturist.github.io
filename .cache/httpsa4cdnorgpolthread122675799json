his community) from the soviet union was him pulling me aside and ranting to me for a good half an hour about how communism was smuggled into russia from germany by jews with the goal of a jewish communist revolution to suppress and control the slavic goyim, and told me it wasn&#039;t something you could openly talk about while the soviet union existed, and isn&#039;t something many people openly talk about now. Talked a lot about the early days of the soviet state and the holodomor (family ancestry comes partly from the ukraine), I also remember my mother coming in shocked, hushing him and leading me away, and for most of my life before I started browsing \/pol\/ I just dismissed what he was saying as the ravings of someone that was old and senile. I&#039;m sorry I didn&#039;t believe you back then grandpops, wish I could go back and spend hours talking to him and picking up more information like that. Wonder how much word to word knowledge there is out there that was picked up by similar people in positions where they could gain access to truths like that that we&#039;ll never find out about because they passed away before they could share them or because nobody around them would believe them","time":1493087558,"resto":122675799,"id":"AaQHbzHe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122679352,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)22:35:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122678996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122678996<\/a><br>My grandfather used to try to tell me war stories from his days in the pacific, his time in the ME working for the CIA and for grumen, selling fighter planes.

Its essential, otherwise humans would only want sex and not even take time to eat. It spikes after sex... and it rises after relationships get older. At 1 year, then at 3 years it rises again. (Sounds like the typical stages of a relationship doesn&#039;t it?) It also rises more in women than in men, and although they cant put humans in cages, they found that monkeys they tested only had high prolactin levels after sex or... when they were brought in and put into cages, and they realized they were trapped. To me it explains why so many women have low libidos and then when getting out of a marriage, suddenly turn into fireballs of sexual desire: they aren&#039;t trapped.

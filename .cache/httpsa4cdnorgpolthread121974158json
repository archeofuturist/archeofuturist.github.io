They do because they want us to become better, because they want us to eventually become gods and goddesses ourselves. <br><br>This explains why the gods decided to create the Nordic race in Thule (Atlantis), in the harsh climate of Northern Scandinavia, and it explains why people living in harsh climates are generally speaking more industrious, inventive and intelligent than people living in less harsh climates. After all, they have to be in order to survive. It explains further why the gods (by the help of gravity) threw our world into an Ice Age after they had created the Nordic race, and basically forced the Nordic man to improve, and to improve fast. <br><br>The best individuals of the Nordic race, those who really understood ingr, followed the rim of the ice back northwards, when the ice melted at the end of the last great Ice Age, rather than move to places with a friendlier climate, like others did. They understood the need for them to be exposed to as much adversity as possible. And individual who knows ingr will rejoice when he or she is exposed to adversity, and in fact he or she will knowingly and willingly expose him- or herself to it, while those who don&#039;t know ingr will instead whine, pity themselves and try to avoid adversity at all cost.

The constantly recurring theme is the appearance of gods from above, who then fight and defeat a race of giants, that is often described as a dragon or a serpent. Earth and mankind is then created from the remains of these giants. <br><br>In the Scandinavian mythology we learn that the first human race was created when the gods gave the worms in the body of the giant a human form. The gods were not satisfied with this race, though, and \u00d3\u00f0inn told Heimdallr to go to Middle Earth and improve mankind, by giving them the blood of the gods. He used the name R\u00edgr (&quot;ruler&quot;) and the first improved race was called the kin of Trell (&quot;thrall&quot;), and was made up of ugly and stupid black men, with dark hair and wrinkled skin. \u00d3\u00f0inn was not satisfied with the result, and Heimdallr had to keep trying, to get a race worthy of Valhalla. After another failed attempt, the kin of Karl (&quot;free men&quot;), he finally succeeded in creating a human race worthy of Valhalla. This was the beautiful kin of Jarl (&quot;earl&quot;). This kin consisted of tall and fair men and women, with fair hair and fair eyes. They were wise and skilled in everything they did, and R\u00edgr taught them the runes (secrets) of the gods. The creation of the youngest of these kins, Jarl&#039;s kin, took place on an island we today know as Atlantis. <br>http:\/\/www.burzum.org\/eng\/library\/p<wbr>aganism04.shtml","time":1492682681,"resto":121974158,"id":"y\/5tZ4Ff","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121978419,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)06:05:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121974158\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121974158<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what is trial and error for 500?<\/span>","time":1492682714,"resto":121974158,"id":"H2RA3pW+","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121978436,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)06:05:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121978008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121978008<\/a><br>kekd","time":1492682727,"resto":121974158,"id":"gb9wk53S","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121978905,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)06:12:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121978008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121978008<\/a><br><br><br>lell","time":1492683121,"resto":121974158,"id":"RMOx+FhI","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

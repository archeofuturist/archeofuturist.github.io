I&#039;ve noticed that in the 4 leaf logo in the upper left, the bottom most leaf is smaller than the others and the black outline isn&#039;t as thick. As far as I can tell, this exists in every reiteration of the flag, and no one has corrected it. I&#039;ve even seen real life screen prints based off pic related with the weird 4th leaf. I am not a photoshoop wizard, however, and lack the skills to make a new master vector drawn version.<br><br>tl;dr will someone fix the fucked up leaf in the Kekistan flag already?","filename":"fuckedupleaf","ext":".png","w":2133,"h":1281,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1491662137869,"time":1491662137,"md5":"zWCzBmo2eJBhOVoR1tBvrQ==","fsize":149831,"resto":0,"id":"2gsFhUWr","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"kekistan-flag-improvement","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120138095,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)10:38:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120137841\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120137841<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;using an inferior flag<\/span>","filename":"BestFlag","ext":".png","w":3040,"h":1596,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1491662284341,"time":1491662284,"md5":"hM910mkkhQhYZBJgFMt\/+A==","fsize":217955,"resto":120137841,"id":"uYwEvwvj","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120138973,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)10:46:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;kek<\/span><br>You have to go back.","time":1491662804,"resto":120137841,"id":"iGyizQzu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

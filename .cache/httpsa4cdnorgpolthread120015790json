Obama doesn&#039;t want his legacy of a peacemaker questioned, so he gets a coalition bombing campaign and proxy war going instead of a full invasion. Que European migrant crisis. Assad isn&#039;t a saint, but he does what you have to do when you govern a country of mudslimes and don&#039;t want 100% Islamic totalitarian control. <br><br>The &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;moderate&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; rebels Obama arms turn Islamic in record time, Russia invades to back up Assad and act as deterrents to direct invasions. And...that&#039;s it. As long as Russia is there, America can&#039;t do a whole lot without starting World War 3.<br><br>Regarding Assad and chemical attacks? Who knows? Who gives a shit? This is what happens when you want to police the world without risking American lives. Assad&#039;s policies worked up until the west decided he was a problem, he knows what&#039;s best for Syria, and he&#039;s hasn&#039;t turned tail and ran even though the strongest governments, militaries, and intelligence agencies in the world wanted him dead. <br><br>That&#039;s enough to make him \/ourguy\/ in my book.","time":1491596836,"resto":120015790,"id":"Byjnh0tW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120017761,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)16:28:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120015790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120015790<\/a><br>Humiliated the jews in 2006<br><br>Now they want his head","time":1491596933,"resto":120015790,"id":"+bq7i5dW","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120017909,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)16:30:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120015790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120015790<\/a><br>Jews hate him","time":1491597003,"resto":120015790,"id":"SOhp+kKG","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":120018039,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)16:30:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120017507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120017507<\/a><br>Is this another oil thing?<br><br>How much of the stuff do you cunts need?<br><br>I swear if Trumps mum wasn&#039;t Scottish you would have invaded us by now.","time":1491597043,"resto":120015790,"id":"TYlK6Jg3","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120018406,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)16:33:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120015790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120015790<\/a><br>He&#039;s from Syria.

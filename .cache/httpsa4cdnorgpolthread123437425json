It&#039;s time to take down these shills for good. They do untold harm to the U.S. on behalf of foreign power(s), and the connexions run DEEP.<br><br>Literally the only purpose of this outfit is to undermine trust in U.S. institutions like the Congress, the Senate and the Presidency, as well as the media. They claim to live off individual donations but in reality they are taking millions from foreign countries and trying to mask it as individual donations, and this has enabled them to grow so rapidly even though their content is total 100% radical reactionary left-wing nonsense.<br><br>They bring paid Russian propagandists on their show all the time. Jimmy Dore is the worst, I honestly don&#039;t even need to give any pic evidence on this guy - you watch 3 of his videos and you&#039;ll know wtf I&#039;m talking about right away.

A heavy plane will crush its landing gear as physics wants it to keep going straight forward when it hits the ramp. The upside of the ramp is that its cheaper and simple to build, and allows aircraft to launch at lower speed from a shorter deck, requiring a less powerful catapult. The flat deck and powerful catapult requires more space, more power and more money, but allows you to launch heavily laden aircraft straight off the deck at high speed without the high G\/high angle launch. Basically you could never launch hornets and tomcats and vikings and other heavy aircraft from a ramp without massively reinforcing both the ramp and the aircraft\/landing gear, both of which would increase weight by a great deal and defeat the purpose of making a heavier plane.<br><br>TL:DR Ramp carriers can only launch light weight, slow, lightly armed fighters.","filename":"1460111284379","ext":".jpg","w":509,"h":447,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":109,"tim":1492490712230,"time":1492490712,"md5":"PaNCTuX8StRC+xzAdRD+LA==","fsize":26778,"resto":121631583,"id":"9QV25cJ9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121639707,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:45:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121639503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121639503<\/a><br>Its funny how leaf thinks its people when its just a mere by-product of Britain and the US.","time":1492490756,"resto":121631583,"id":"stoj5nZg","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121639863,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:47:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121631583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121631583<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Global Power<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1 Aircraft Carrier<\/span>","filename":"15-ways-to-tell-that-a-guy-really-likes-you6","ext":".jpg","w":661,"h":349,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":65,"tim":1492490839785,"time":1492490839,"md5":"Ei13b2iEzSoUE9ZubAeP+w==","fsize":45122,"resto":121631583,"id":"M8FVnTjs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121640040,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:48:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121639863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121639863<\/a><br>that file name kek","time":1492490939,"resto":121631583,"id":"stoj5nZg","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121640171,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:50:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121639707\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121639707<\/a><br>Believe me, this country tried to resolve that particular internal conflict of Canada&#039;s for centuries.<br><br>Now, however, this lack of resolution is on the verge of creating a national security hazard for us.","filename":"BlankMap-USA-states-Canada-provinces","ext":".png","w":2289,"h":1744,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1492491015415,"time":1492491015,"md5":"ozOeb5EiVnAaukIvtrxr2A==","fsize":136954,"resto":121631583,"id":"ABqoszN\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121640257,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:51:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121634039\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121634039<\/a><br>It even looks fatter.","time":1492491067,"resto":121631583,"id":"dzVSgi9q","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121640308,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:51:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121637091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121637091<\/a><br>Team effort Weeww lad hey btw question for you.

I am not joking about this. The majority of all modern medical aliments come from having a disrupted bacterial composition in our gut. Look into the GAPS nutrient system, but I suggest going further and adopting a raw primal diet. I&#039;ve ate primarily raw milk, raw grass-fed beef and raw eggs for a year and my nocturnal seizures, autism and muscle spasms are all gone. give your body the food it craves. Feed your brain and most importantly your gut. <br><br>I am not joking.

Sounds like residual schizophrenia or schizophreniform. Probably isn&#039;t that at all but if you&#039;ve had family with it is a risk. Schizophrenia takes 6 months to diagnose and predominately comes up in males between the age of 25-45.

Another part is a hard time focusing or getting from A to B mentally. You should see a doctor if you&#039;re that worried. I would absolutely avoid antipsychotics though, they are hell and will eventually give you tardive dyskinesia.<br><br><a href=\"#p122586815\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122586815<\/a><br>I&#039;ve been pretty interested in this lately, not so much just bacteria but how parasites effect behavior and personality.","time":1493042134,"resto":122583227,"id":"P5dryvCL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

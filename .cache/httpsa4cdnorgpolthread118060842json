Peach is the most frequently appearing female in video game history. Hands down. So naturally, internet culture critics focus their tangents on Toadstool, she&#039;s the biggest target. The critics can&#039;t blast her body like the do with Laura Croft who is usually the only other female these critics can name. They can&#039;t blast the body so they point to the fact that Peach is always being kidnapped or &quot;damseled&quot; by Bowser or whoever else wants to send the Mushroom Kingdom into anarchy. The argument is that Peach being kidnapped and held for rescue is a poor example for both the young men and women who play the Mario games. Men see that women have no agency, Women see that they are objects to be won or controlled. This mindset then leaks from the game to the impressionable youth, then to society. <br><br>HOWEVER, LETS LOOK AT PEACH IN THE MARIO UNIVERSE AND WHAT ROLE SHE PLAYS <br><br>Super Mario Bros: damsel <br>Lost Levels: damsel <br>Super Mario Bros 2: Protagonist, best jumps in a platforming game <br>SMB3: Damsel, sends supplies. <br>Super Mario World: Damsel <br>Super Mario RPG; Damsel x 2, best party member, holds own along men <br>Super Mario 64: Damsel <br>Paper Mario: Damsel, secondary protagonist who organizes own rescue <br>Super Mario Sunshine; Damsel, dropbeat mother <br>Paper Mario: TYYD: Damsel, secondary protagonist, final boss.<br>Super Paper Mario: Supporting protagonist, party member. <br>Super Princess Peach: Progtagoinst, PMS Powers <br>New Super Mario Bros 1 and 2: Damsel <br>NSMB2: Damsel <br>Super Mario 3D Land: Damsel, supplies <br>Super Mario 3D World: Protagonist<br>Super Mario Run: Top Tier<br><br>So yeah, Peach gets kidnapped frequently.

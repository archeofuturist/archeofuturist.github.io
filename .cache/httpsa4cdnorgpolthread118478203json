If you&#039;re trying to say that &quot;morality&quot; is a step beyond interpersonal interactions, and into the realm of metaphysics, I&#039;d say that I don&#039;t think that&#039;s the only way to look at morals. Morals are an empirical phenomenon, an observable human behavior. We have societal expectations, people react poorly when these expectations are broken, we use these expectations to justify punitive measures, and so on.","time":1490601850,"resto":118478203,"id":"y0plPkzQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118488724,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)04:04:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118488426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118488426<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nihilist<\/span><br>i don&#039;t believe in labels","time":1490601876,"resto":118478203,"id":"uk22R74O","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118488735,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)04:04:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118478203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118478203<\/a><br>That includes the religion of anthropogenic global warming.","time":1490601882,"resto":118478203,"id":"J75qKCJk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118488747,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)04:04:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118488630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118488630<\/a><br>So are &quot;morals&quot;<br>You&#039;re just making excuses <br>And I want you to prove what you just claimed too","time":1490601890,"resto":118478203,"id":"OF4XVZqj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118488804,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)04:05:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118488631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118488631<\/a><br>wrong.<br>women and betas vote liberal, there is your majority. nothing to do with beliefs.","time":1490601951,"resto":118478203,"id":"uk22R74O","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118488851,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)04:06:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118478203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118478203<\/a>","filename":"Screenshot 2017-03-27 at 4.06.09 AM","ext":".png","w":284,"h":283,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490602004987,"time":1490602004,"md5":"M2XJZmaRkbleNognkVL2KA==","fsize":138462,"resto":118478203,"id":"Y1IMRK6L","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118488869,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)04:07:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118488694\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118488694<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;almost sounds like you&#039;re a moral anti realist and you think morals are just emotions<\/span><br>Still not seeing those proofs only your question begging epithet, question dodging and question avoiding<br><br>Where&#039;s your proof for everything you claimed? <br>Stop dodging and avoiding the question","time":1490602023,"resto":118478203,"id":"OF4XVZqj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118488907,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)04:07:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118478203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118478203<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;prove it<\/span><br>pic related","filename":"trump will win 77777777 praise kek","ext":".jpg","w":1141,"h":503,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":55,"tim":1490602055585,"time":1490602055,"md5":"8IwOCWDfp4xNjGuVnRe\/Sw==","fsize":1406350,"resto":118478203,"id":"AYg7jmiT","country":"BE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":118488928,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)04:07:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118488804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118488804<\/a><br>Yeah you have beta women with beta minority faggots<br><br>And then christian women voting trump and men voting trump and a trump presidency.

So you say that we have plenty of time and space for life to happen? Let&#039;s run the odds. I&#039;ll be making some very generous assumptions for life&#039;s chances, but don&#039;t get your hopes up...<br><br>The universe has existed for about 4.35E17 seconds, and its estimated that there are around E24 planets in the observable universe. Lets assume both that there have been so many planets for all of existence and that each planet generates one potential life form per second (so around 5E41 life forms), defined as containing DNA or a equivalent data storage chemical large enough to hold the minimum code for viable life.<br><br>So now we need the minimum life code. According to a fairly recent project (link below) the minimum gene base a lifeforms can have contrains 531000 &#039;letters&#039; of DNA, but let&#039;s assume we can optimize the hell out of this and get down to just 531 letters. This means that the odds of spawning this code in a randomly generated sequence is 4^531 per potential life form, or something over E250. The calculators I have on hand don&#039;t want to deal with such large numbers, so a estimate will have to do.<br><br>These odds are SHIT. We only have a 5E41\/E250 chance of getting that essential first viable life form. That&#039;s 5E-209, or several orders of magnitude less than 5 divided by Google divided by Google. This is impossible odds. This is winning the lottery every single day on one ticket each for months.<br><br>If even such idealized conditions produce impossible odds, how much worse must reality be? It is absurd to belive in such contrivance.<br><br><br>https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/amp.ft<wbr>.com\/content\/8e67c552-f1b4-11e5-aff<wbr>5-19b4e253664a","time":1490602098,"resto":118478203,"id":"r860ViYu","country":"US","country_name":"United

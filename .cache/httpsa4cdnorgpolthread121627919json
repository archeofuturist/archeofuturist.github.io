But don&#039;t fool yourself, We are just the &quot;appointed&quot; court jesters of the neo-liberal establishment for spreading brainwashing propaganda under the guise of &quot;comedy&quot;. Over the years, we have successfully subverted the gullible minds of younger generations by inoculating them with already biased narratives peddled by the mainstream media. You must&#039;ve witnessed the extent of brain damage unleashed by our communications in the plague of celebrity-worshipping critical-skills-lacking mainstream-media-munching intellectual-yet-idiot liberal progressives in this world. We are heralded as &quot;talented comedians&quot; in the pop-culture for perpetrating the agenda of our corporate masters deeply entrenched in neo-liberal globalist politics. We would continue to shift the overton window further left as long as our trusted hipster liberal crowd crave their daily dopamine boost for feeling smug &amp; intelligent over hard-working masses.&quot;<br><br>Once you are red-pilled, you&#039;d realize that every person &quot;hyped&quot; &amp; incessantly venerated by the (((media))) serves a critical purpose in their bigger globalist agenda. For (((them))),Obama was a puppet ruler similar to the position of clowns like Stewart or Oliver as puppet propagandists.<br>Every personality, whether politicians or newscasters or comedians or pop-stars - they serve an all encompassing goal championed by neo-liberal globalist establishment.","time":1492489919,"resto":121627919,"id":"7q1PyFxi","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":121638572,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:34:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121627919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121627919<\/a><br>OH SHIT ITS 2017!!!!!!!!!!!!","time":1492490097,"resto":121627919,"id":"CZMvtzmJ","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121638772,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:36:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121638199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121638199<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you<\/span>","time":1492490219,"resto":121627919,"id":"kbcEdYty","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121639148,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:40:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121628154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121628154<\/a><br>Never interrupt an opponent when they&#039;re making a mistake.","time":1492490435,"resto":121627919,"id":"rkr8hee3","country":"GU","country_name":"Guam"},{"no":121639607,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:44:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121627919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121627919<\/a><br>That episode was hilarious. <br>You could almost hear him say &quot;you guys keep saying le pen wont win which is what i said about trump but look where I am now&quot;","time":1492490698,"resto":121627919,"id":"w3W9kx8+","country":"PH","country_name":"Philippines"},{"no":121640241,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:50:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"Pic fucking related.","filename":"tv john oliver","ext":".jpg","w":1798,"h":1571,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":109,"tim":1492491055843,"time":1492491055,"md5":"06jtdFuZvNQIL2Rp5LWnaQ==","fsize":411731,"resto":121627919,"id":"0XpCk0e\/","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121640862,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:56:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121628977\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121628977<\/a><br>He&#039;s never actually said \u201cI mean come on\u201d, he just sounds retarded when he speaks because the concepts that he tries to explain are very abstract and counter-intuitive in nature and therefore difficult to word eloquently because neoliberalism is about prioritizing facts and science instead of common sense and feelings which makes it awkward because speech is heavily affected by body language and non verbal interpretation, which is why the only people that it attracts are absurdly high IQ and ultra educated young city people with highly functioning brains.","time":1492491403,"resto":121627919,"id":"u4N4kOzn","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121641062,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)00:58:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121640862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121640862<\/a><br>Maybe not in this episode, but he does say &quot;I mean come on&quot;

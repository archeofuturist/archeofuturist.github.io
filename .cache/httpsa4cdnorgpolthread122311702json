They have not progressed at all from the habits of pastoral living. ..This is a filthy people, wallowing in vice. Of all peoples it is the least instructed in the rudiments of the faith. They do not yet pay tithes or first fruits or contract marriages. They do not avoid incest.\u201d<br>\u2014Giraldus Cambrensis<br><br>When compared to the other European nations, it seems like the irish just can&#039;t keep up. They were still living in tribes while england, france, Germany etc. were having crusades. They really just piggy backed on the rest of Europe&#039;s inventions by virtue of closeness. If Ireland were located in the africa or Asia they would probably just now be getting out of mud huts.

That extra $10 physically does not exist on this planet. <br><br>You have to go out and take the $10 from someone else&#039;s loan money to pay your own interest. This causes interpersonal competition and global competition among entire nations.<br><br>The debt based currency creates pockets of wealth and pockets of scarcity. Think USA and Africa. It&#039;s a natural progression of a debt based currency since one must compete for money. <br><br>Now because money is used to trade for resources, and there physically isn&#039;t enough money in the world to ever pay total debt, this gives the impression that resources are scarce.

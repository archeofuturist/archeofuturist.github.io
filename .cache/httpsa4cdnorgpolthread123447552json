There are many things that western science claims to be knowledgeable on, but also at the same time is stuck on dead ends and cannot be explained in conventional ways. If science has been basing its fundamentals on a theory which was created decades ago, it is less likely it will be erased. I just want you to consider this theory and see if my findings are at least plausible. Human beings have been on the planet for a long time, there are many ancient wonders, fossilized creatures of great proportions, and a cosmos of unimaginable size.

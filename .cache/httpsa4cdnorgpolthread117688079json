They also portray Clinton in a positive way.<br>Now what does the Qatar government have to do with the election? Well the Qatar government was also a donor to the Clinton Foundation and gave gifts to the Clinton&#039;s. The Qatar government is also a state sponsor of Sunni terrorist groups. During Trump&#039;s campaign he was running on the concept of a &quot;Muslim ban&quot; which would have caused potential issues for Qatar a country that is about 70% Sunni Muslim. A country who benefits from a regime change in Syria and is funding rebels to overthrow the Assad regime and stated they will continue to do so even if US policy under Trump no longer supports funding rebels.","filename":"382","ext":".gif","w":600,"h":399,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490139513373,"time":1490139513,"md5":"1cY\/BrBe1RcQHPj8btMavg==","fsize":165697,"resto":0,"id":"gSztibn+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-real-truth-of-foreign-influence-in-the","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":2,"unique_ips":5},{"no":117688151,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:39:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Example B: Mexico and the New York Times<br>The largest owner of the New York Times is Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim with an estimated 17% stake in the newspaper. Carlos Slim owns a large amount of different companies and benefits from NAFTA a trade policy that Trump has repeatedly spoken negatively about and made a campaign promise to renegotiate.<br>Under Carlos Slim&#039;s NYTime&#039;s primary ownership the newspaper had posted the leak of Trump&#039;s tax return and also started to push the allegations with no evidence or proof of sexual assault against Trump a month before the election, all timed around the release of the &quot;grab them by the pussy&quot; tape with the intent of destroying Trump&#039;s candidacy and leading Hillary to win the election.<br>Example C: Israel<br>One of Hillary Clinton&#039;s largest donors is dual citizen Haim Saban. Mr Saban also an owner of Univision who also was overwhelmingly negative of Trump&#039;s campaign, is known for his lobbying for Israel. For Saban, he was known to fund both sides of the aisle both Democrats and Republicans. Here is a quote from Mr Saban. He is also a close friend to the Clinton&#039;s and a donor to their Foundation.<br>&quot;I&#039;m a one-issue guy, and my issue is Israel.<br>After Saban though just a quick list at the top donors to the Hillary campaign one cannot help to notice how many Jewish donors head the list. Soros, Zuckerberg, Moskovitz, S Donald Sussman, Paul Singer. Even Jewish newspapers openly admit that the top donor to the Clinton campaign were almost all entirely Jewish. With George Soros as another dual citizen, and one who has been funding groups such as blacklivesmatter and moveon and refugee groups to flood into Europe.","time":1490139552,"resto":117688079,"id":"gSztibn+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117690440,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:59:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117688079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117688079<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117688151\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117688151<\/a><br><br>Look at this #CrystalGate<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why did this judge get married by Jeremy Hammond Judge?<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.pacermonitor.com\/public<wbr>\/case\/19421595\/v_Trump_et_al<br>http:\/\/archive.is\/RawCf#selection-2<wbr>45.0-245.165<br>http:\/\/archive.is\/EewzQ<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Why did she marry a guy who&#039;s mom owns a crystal shop in HH that&#039;s HQ is located in Dubai?

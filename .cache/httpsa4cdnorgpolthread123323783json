If you noticed most teligious countries are stupid and too dumb to produce things while hard working people who aren&#039;t preoccupied with fairy tales do all the work. Atheism is the response to Europe&#039;s problems. A revolution is needed to where Europe will ban religion and allow workers to finally not be exploited by capitalism. <br><br>It always shocks me that other people do not understand how obvious the answer is. Get rid of religion, get rid of your problem.<br><br>Also, I appreciate that tons of Europeans on \/pol\/ are already more red pilled than American. I wish we Americans aas a whole stopped believing in fairy tales, but that&#039;s impossible here because if indoctrination.

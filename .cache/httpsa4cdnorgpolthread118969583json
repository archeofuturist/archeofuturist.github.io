Communism is based around common property, which means the community determines how production is done, this is better than a capitalist system in which 1 individual, or a board of directors and execs determine everything, because you are guaranteed a say. Also because if Communism was bad, Capitalist governments wouldn&#039;t try to stop Communism at every opportunity possible. Look up &quot;The parable of the divided island&quot; on youtube for a look into this.<br><br>I&#039;d suggest reading The Conquest of Bread, The State and Revolution, and Wage Labor &amp; Capital for a general baseline understanding of the subject.

To put it simply, Russia had none of the things you&#039;re supposed to have to start a socialist revolution. It wasn&#039;t a capitalist industrial state, it was a feudalist state. There were no proletariat in Russia, just peasants. Kulaks had a monopoly on food, the soviet government had to work with corrupt bureaucrats from the former government, millions of men dying in war, and famines. China had most of the same issues. Yet Russia STILL became a worldwide superpower despite all these issues.<br><br>I could go on about Marxism-Leninism and Maoism, and how they aren&#039;t really socialist, merely ways of trying to get a capitalist economy ready for socialism, but honestly everything already stated is enough.","time":1490910297,"resto":118969583,"id":"78\/Ysrh2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118973736,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:49:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118973232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118973232<\/a><br>so Russia and China was not real communism because the revolution happened before industrialization and the generation of the working class.<br><br>Would any of the later states that fell to the international communist regimes, like eastern germany, Cuba or any of the eastern european states count as such?<br><br>Also the famines were created directly due to soviet leaderships mismanagement.

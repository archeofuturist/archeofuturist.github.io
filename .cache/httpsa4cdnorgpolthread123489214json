You spend hours and hours each day complaining about how the jew is destroying everything. You call yourself an environmentalist. You call for the destruction of cities. You go to the gym, read take all these redpills to &quot;improve&quot; yourself. Why can&#039;t you see the problem that&#039;s right in front of you? I thought this board was smart enough to stay partial and discern between what&#039;s right and what&#039;s wrong. The meat industry is the number one leading factor of massive deforestation, co2 emissions, ocean pollution, extinction, ecosystem displacement, degeneracy and plenty of other events you constantly complain about. Can&#039;t you see you are actively contributing to the downfall of our society? Please wake up \/pol\/. We are the last bastion of hope for these planet! We cannot allow ourselves to be blind when it suit us. Mcdonalds, Tacobell, Wendy&#039;s, Carls Jr., Burger King, TGI Fridays, and more many many more are the number one reason this world is going to destroy itself. They are destroying our world, our health and our society.

If country adopts a system that is more protectionist, free market capitalism immediately starts causing less problems in said country.

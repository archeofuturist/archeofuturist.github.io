It was viewed at the time as a xenophobic party, so when jean-marie lepen got to second round in the 2002 election even left wing voters voted voted for conservative liberal party&#039;s candidate Chirac, as they saw lepen as some neo nazi mad man. More people now find it socially acceptable to endorse the fn but a large group of the voting populations still assimilates them with fascism. Only this group tends to not actually vote as much as fn partisans.<br>Also there is a legal issue regarding marine paying one of her bodyguard with eu&#039;s money or some shit but fn partisans don&#039;t seem to give a fuck about this kind of stuff as long as immigrants are being deported.<br><br>Other contenders are fillon and macron, fillon being plagued with his own recent legal issues still gets votes from traditionally right voting folks who consider the fn as fascist, macron gets votes from left voters who somehow didn&#039;t get fed up by hollande&#039;s current mandate. Extreme left voters vote melanchon but idk these kind of parties never seem to really get relevant since left voters believe you have to vote for bigger parties in order to prevent a right - extreme right second round to happen as it did in 2002, so i expect him to do better than usual as people hate socialists now but would be surprised if he even made it to 2nd round.<br>So it&#039;d be either macron or fillon against lepen, in both cases i believe the 2002 secenario would repeat itself, there&#039;ll be street protests against the fn and the other dude would win. It seems unlikely to me that people no already voting marine would rather vote for her than for fillon despite his legal affaire, and lefties would in any case vote for macron even if he&#039;s a corporate shill.","time":1490070964,"resto":117582263,"id":"FImwaZlQ","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":117587492,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)00:36:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117587433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117587433<\/a><br>In any case marine will make a good score and be get to be smug for the next parliament \/ local elections and can expect to get seats, mad fundings and probably get reelected as eu deputy<br>here are my 2 cents, hope i didn&#039;t sperg too much","time":1490070993,"resto":117582263,"id":"FImwaZlQ","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":117587498,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)00:36:37","name":"Anonymous","filename":"le_pen","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":552,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490070997793,"time":1490070997,"md5":"kwXeeVXebt\/8LdGBvzL0HA==","fsize":88366,"resto":117582263,"id":"tv5CA477","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":117587688,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)00:38:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117586966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117586966<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Implying Queens haven&#039;t been some of Britain&#039;s most successful Monarchs<\/span>","time":1490071117,"resto":117582263,"id":"mf2Hqmkw","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117587734,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)00:39:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117582263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117582263<\/a><br>Will take more than trips, really straight 2s are next.

So far, 35 Senators have said they will filibuster when Gorsuch comes up for a confirmation vote on Friday, April 7. That includes Chuck Schumer, the Democrats&#039; leader in the Senate.<br><br>But that isn&#039;t going to be enough to stop Gorsuch. Unfortunately, both Joe Manchin and Heidi Heitkamp said yesterday they will vote for Gorsuch. That means there are only 10 more Senators left, and we need 6 more votes. Some of the undecided Senators include Patrick Leahy and Dianne Feinstein.<br><br>Neil Gorsuch is an extremist who has no business being on the Supreme Court. We can win but we need 6 more Senate Democrats. Can you call one (or more) of them and urge them to filibuster Neil Gorsuch?<br><br>Neil Gorsuch is one of the most extreme people to ever be nominated to the Supreme Court. Gorsuch can&#039;t be relied on to support women&#039;s rights, voting rights, and other key constitutional protections. His record is very pro-big business, and it&#039;s highly unlikely that he&#039;d overturn Citizens United.<br><br>Despite his extremism, some Senate Democrats are worried that if they filibuster Gorsuch, Senate Republicans would exercise the &quot;nuclear option&quot; and eliminate the ability to filibuster a Supreme Court nominee. It&#039;s unclear whether the Republicans would follow through. But the only other alternative is to give in and allow this awful nominee to be confirmed.<br><br>Resistance means resistance. Senate Democrats cannot say they oppose Trump while at the same time refusing to join a filibuster. It&#039;s time to call these remaining Senate Democrats and insist they join their colleagues in a filibuster against Neil Gorsuch.","filename":"download","ext":".jpg","w":970,"h":647,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490989887889,"time":1490989887,"md5":"eLlyngR3VjLHCqED7zTGlA==","fsize":50181,"resto":0,"id":"mPj+jStb","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"theres-just-one-week-left-to-stop-donald-trump","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119092664,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)15:53:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119092401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119092401<\/a><br><br>didn&#039;t read lol","time":1490990020,"resto":119092401,"id":"aejL0drx","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119094243,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)16:09:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119092664\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119092664<\/a><br><br>fpbp","time":1490990965,"resto":119092401,"id":"tCapI724","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119094619,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)16:13:01","name":"sage goes in all fields","com":"<a href=\"#p119092664\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119092664<\/a><br>friendly reminder to not bump this drivel","time":1490991181,"resto":119092401,"id":"LBsxwlUK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

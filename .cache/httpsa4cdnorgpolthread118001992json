If you can&#039;t do something yourself it means asking someone else, which can often be a truly harrowing experience for a man. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I have a theory that I&#039;m hoping to publish as a book (80k words so far) that it is a genetic advantage for women to have low self-esteem (to allow themselves to be penetrated, and even desire it; a very humiliating ) and low tolerance for isolation (which primarily encourages mating). Meaning their default state is one of helplesness and self-loathing, which, while being a state familiar to many men, is one they are genetically programmed to escape via obedience, submission and pleas for help.&quot;<\/span><br><br>This was posted by an anon and it sums up a lot of what I feel on a daily basis. I feel like my primary motivator in life is shame, followed by pride. I am most often compelled to do something out of avoidance of the shame it would bring me. I refuse to ask for help until I have implemented every trick and scheme I&#039;ve gathered over my life twice over and then some. If I do ask for help I feel like I&#039;ve been downgraded in the minds of those ask help of. For instance, if I&#039;m not &quot;top dog&quot; in an environment where a leader usually emerges, I feel like everyone looks down upon me, specifically the &quot;top dog&quot; in that environment. Rationally, I&#039;m almost positive that they don&#039;t because I don&#039;t think that way, I&#039;ve never felt any sort of antipathy towards anyone who is lower on the &quot;pecking order&quot; in situations where I&#039;m on top. <br><br>Was Anon&#039;s thesis correct about the differences between men and women? Am I just being an self-conscious cuck and over thinking every situation I&#039;m in or do you guys feel the same? Do you guys judge those below you? I&#039;m a relatively young anon, so if you are an older male here, does this animalistic shame\/pride feeling get stronger?","filename":"1489806025766","ext":".jpg","w":1235,"h":1600,"tn_w":192,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490311141533,"time":1490311141,"md5":"0qy6gU+LFq0KxZ6KXJaamw==","fsize":411625,"resto":0,"id":"TF5eg9TO","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-nature-of-men-and-women","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":6,"unique_ips":11},{"no":118002903,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)19:25:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118001992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118001992<\/a><br>Stick around.

Men seek social groups and approval of other men. Women seek the social approval of men but find social norms through other women, which is why women are so similar to each other. without the approval of men who are approved by other men women will fall into self loathing and feeling like a disappointment. one of the reasons things are so fucked up is men can&#039;t have social groups of just men, we have to include women which causes us to fight over them, worry about our sexual desire\/attractiveness, and makes us unable to fully relax in such environment(one reason I think 4 chan is full of young men). Men want to be the top dog in every situation, but are told that if you aren&#039;t in every situation you a weak beta, which isn&#039;t untrue but we need to keep in mind that your not going to be the top dog in every situation. Also women have no idea what they want, just what they are told to want, keep this in mind and you&#039;ll see a pattern, only time they know what they want they are much too old to get it.","filename":"7b423ae05e5cbf03380164dad4099caced3a53683407f71e04501fa28060307e","ext":".jpg","w":1210,"h":6307,"tn_w":23,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490312985994,"time":1490312985,"md5":"SN\/lQWjypjwZTQRDU1F4HA==","fsize":1716881,"resto":118001992,"id":"lDJFXfeV","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118006475,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)19:51:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118005614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118005614<\/a><br>THICC","filename":"VICTORIA LOMBA 5","ext":".jpg","w":554,"h":685,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490313074383,"time":1490313074,"md5":"Ao2PuJfYyL5x9ik8xOQQNQ==","fsize":106775,"resto":118001992,"id":"1w3hkkvC","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118006544,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)19:51:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118006475\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118006475<\/a><br>EXTRA-THICC","filename":"VICTORIA LOMBA 4","ext":".jpg","w":554,"h":644,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490313108394,"time":1490313108,"md5":"tW1Hgmsu8fH5PIC0p9cO1w==","fsize":105912,"resto":118001992,"id":"1w3hkkvC","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118006719,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)19:53:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118001992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118001992<\/a><br>The theory that promiscuous sex is genetically beneficial is pretty dumb.

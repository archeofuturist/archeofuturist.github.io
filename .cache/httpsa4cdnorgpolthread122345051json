Funny thing is, it was the Muslims who invaded northern Africa and captured them as slaves. Some of Africa still suffers from Islam today. And then the Africans sold their own people as slaves when it became profitable. <br>The black community should thank those that suffered slavery so they could have the 1st world life they enjoy today. If there never had been slavery, then most black folks would be suffering in 3rd world Africa with wars, Aids, hunger, poverty, slums, etc. Can we find any African-American here willing to give up their slavery descendence and go back to their roots, their African homeland? Or are they really just plain old Americans who should just live like all other Americans?","filename":"IMG_1321","ext":".jpg","w":121,"h":125,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492903701250,"time":1492903701,"md5":"gwKCzK1FAdnB63TCgndLcg==","fsize":23928,"resto":0,"id":"CsPxqjP3","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-didnt-write-this","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

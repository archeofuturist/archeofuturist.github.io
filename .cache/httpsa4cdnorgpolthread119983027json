And yes, I am aware of the shilling, and concern trolling, and World War 3 terrified posters turning their autism against trump. And I am also aware of the very possible upsides to this attack that he could have meant for. All things considered, especially that his whole &quot;support for israel and jewish daughter&quot; thing is starting to take shape in his decisions with this attack, can we TRULY support him or fully denounce him? I mean, just look at pic related. I think this is incredible. I don&#039;t honestly know how I feel at the moment and it sucks. On one hand, what he did was scummy and looked like he bowed down to the deep state with no upsides. On the otherhand, if the autism of &quot;4028 DIMENSIONAL BASKETWEAVING&quot; actually ends up being true, then it will have been a good decision. (I am aware of this being very unlikely.) Overall, I say we wait it out to see how this goes until we fully turn on him. <br><br>I think giving up on him when this COULD turn out to be nothing or even good for us is a bit rash.<br><br>But I am open to counterarguments.","filename":"Pedo_bust_during_first_month","ext":".jpg","w":1335,"h":1245,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":233,"tim":1491584803466,"time":1491584803,"md5":"X\/IcgvH2hBUAQ6cSPzOMgg==","fsize":494720,"resto":0,"id":"Zok+gMbF","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-fairly-disappointed-by-trumps-bombings-but","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

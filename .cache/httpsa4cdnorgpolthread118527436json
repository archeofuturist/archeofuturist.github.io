People then argue there is a direct correlation between the liberation and the unraveling of that society. More generally, I&#039;ve heard many people say there are countless civilizations in the past that in their last decades or centuries gave women rights they had never had ever before and then after that the society falls apart. <br><br>So, is there any scholarly evidence, academic papers or journals, or even just some kind of a Wikipedia page that can back this up? I need to see SOME sort of source on this to begin to consider it.","filename":"1490569832302","ext":".jpg","w":4920,"h":4161,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":211,"tim":1490631016237,"time":1490631016,"md5":"\/hu9UdJgndd+XHQkOnPW9A==","fsize":2816924,"resto":0,"id":"yTWSDjia","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"did-feminism-destroy-past-civilizations-and","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

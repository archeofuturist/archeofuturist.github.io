Still suspicious that BPD is using the term to describe arresting lefties to give the false impression that they&#039;re being oppressed and such. The article doesn&#039;t actually provide much counter evidence against this because in the article the term is being used from police chief to policemen, and the BPD is asking the rioters if THEY want symbolic arrests.

There&#039;s also 23% tax on everything you buy. So quite a lot.<br><br>The numbers add up because I make $40k per year in 12 salaries, but we have 15 salaries that are not reported in per annual talk and there&#039;s also some money you get for food and driving expenses from the employer.<br><br>So that&#039;s like 60-65% in tax, if you spend your money. It&#039;s a lot, but I know I will have a livable pension, I know I will have all medical treatment I can possibly imagine (throughout entire EU, not just Slovenia), I know my kids can get a phd &quot;for free&quot;, etc.","time":1490603926,"resto":118475829,"id":"iUhXjZAb","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":118491011,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)04:39:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118490953\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118490953<\/a><br><br>I mean we have 15 salaries per year, not 12.","time":1490603981,"resto":118475829,"id":"iUhXjZAb","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":118491018,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)04:39:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118490829\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118490829<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Be in Russia<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Call Putin a Manlet<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gulag for life<\/span>","filename":"IMG_1839","ext":".png","w":209,"h":228,"tn_w":114,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490603988258,"time":1490603988,"md5":"uBgdQOOo7ordDw20O+SZZA==","fsize":68120,"resto":118475829,"id":"1rHA+Xxo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118491028,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)04:40:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"I visited Russia last year on business.

An hello to all the other skeptical Youtubers of the world. A edgy hello to all memepage admins and shitposter. And &quot;Heil&quot; to 4chan!<br>What&#039;s this letter about? It&#039;s about an idea to create a network, an union, a revolution! We all have seen the &quot;power&quot; of shitposting, memes, skeptical youtubers and most of all the weaponized autism. Sargon of Akkad built the fondation of my idea; Kekistan! Why don&#039;t we all get some autism and fight under the very same flag. I know you dont agree eachother in everything, but i know you agree in some fundmental thing about the problems we have in our world and most importand in freedome of speech, science and the importance of haing a dialogue. <br>If we want to change something on a high level then this could do something. In my idea we would deveveloppe a official website of kekistan where we would get a big reach, like a hell of a reach, so we could plan shitpost the shit out of people who deserved to get shitposted. Also we should establish severals sectors like &quot;Oberkommando der Mememacht(Supreme commando of the Memepower)&quot;, &quot;Shitposters&quot; and the &quot;Memejugend(Memeyouth)&quot;. We have to organise ourself like 4chan did back in days, no even more, for example with ranks, which means we have &quot;F\u00fchrer&quot; and other german related ranks or setting up rules like a constitution. Imagine what we could to with this kind of a network, you could establish a online magasin to shitpost even more, you could change something. Let us fight under the flag of kekistan against censorship, poltical correctnes and all the madness(sweden, germany, france etc.). With the will of Kek, our Mememagic, Kekistan, the weaponized autism of 4chan and the skepticism of all you youtubers, lets fight, lets fight as allies not as divided shitposters. Kek wills it!","filename":"memepr1","ext":".png","w":2000,"h":1960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":245,"tim":1493306311563,"time":1493306311,"md5":"9IrrwFBNuWG7Sqst+6BwgA==","fsize":623612,"resto":0,"id":"9FiHmFb4","country":"CH","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"open-letter-there-may-be-a-solution-you","country_name":"Switzerland","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123047042,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)11:24:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123046435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123046435<\/a><br>What you propose is redundant as there is nothing more functional in meme warfare than \/pol\/ itself.

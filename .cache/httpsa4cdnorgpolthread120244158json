Syria has a right to defend itself.<br>Russia\u2019s position on Israel running airstrikes in Syria is clear: as there are Russian forces stationed in Syria, any unauthorized Israeli action is potentially putting Russian assets at risk.&quot;<br><br>Israel is aiding ISIS. Israel is treating their insurgents in their hospitals and they are actually bombing SAA (and not just empty airfields) stifling Syria&#039;s ability to combat insurgents as well as launching shit into Syria. <br><br>Putin told Israel to fuck off prior to this and now with what was essentially nothing but hot air from Trump, Putin gets to move in a shitton of manpower and equipment into Syria under the guise of &#039;US aggression&#039; that&#039;s really meant for Israel.<br><br>Trump false flag retaliated against a false flag gas attack and allowed Putin to move into Syria to put a leash on Israel.

What people are sperging about is a proposed regulation by the FCC that hasn&#039;t gone into effect yet. It won&#039;t happen if the FTC gets authority, but it hasn&#039;t happened yet, so your privacy doesn&#039;t get any worse if the bill passes.<br><br>Republicans all voted for it and Democrats all voted against it because moving regulation authority to the FCC was a power grab by Obama and they want to undo it.

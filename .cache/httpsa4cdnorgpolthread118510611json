You would still have some. But the issue isn&#039;t just money. You also have increased bureaucracy and decreased social status. Doctors in the US are quitting now because the bureaucracy is so bad; they get fed up with it and leave. The most successful of them quit medicine entirely and instead become professional expert witnesses in PI cases, making the same money for a fraction of the hours.<br><br>However, expert witnesses face the same problem: decreased status. People will do all kinds of things for social status and attention even at the cost of time, energy, and money, especially young men trying to attract women. Not all doctors become expert witnesses because there is a sleazy element to it which hurts their social standing. Communism is worse; it creates endemic tall poppy syndrome, so people are less willing to publicly treat doctors better than they treat other, less-skilled workers.<br><br>Side note OP: when arguing, don&#039;t let them confabulate communism (a world without money) and socialism (there&#039;s money but also tons of government redistribution).

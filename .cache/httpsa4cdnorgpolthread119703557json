People are legitimately complaining that we shouldn&#039;t screen for DS. This is genetic dead end. This is suicide.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hiya, I am Heidi Crowter. I am 21 years old and I was born with an extra chromosome!<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In England, we\u2019ve had a good stable government over the years, but now something seems terribly wrong to me. Our government has decided to roll out non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) on the National Health Service beginning in 2018. So as someone with Down syndrome, I didn\u2019t want to sit at home and think about it on my own. No, I decided to go public and speak out.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In April of 2016 I did my first speech outside parliament which went viral. Then in June, on Brexit day, I went to London to do a video for the BBC to talk about the stereotypes of people with Down syndrome \u2014 which again went viral. This got picked up by Vic Minett who talked to me on BBC Radio CWR about the testing. Then in October last year I went back to London to do more protesting.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sally Phillips (2nd best actress ever in my opinion) did a very light-hearted, upsetting , heart-wrenching documentary called, \u201cA World Without Down\u2019s Syndrome?\u201d It was very sad for me. But despite the sadness, I had the confidence to get back up again and I was once again invited to speak about it on Radio CWR with Vic Minett.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In February of this year I went to Oxford to speak more about my life with Down syndrome, which is when I starting mingling with the stars! One of them is Sally Phillips and she is one of the most amazing people I have ever met. In March of this year I went back to London to do more advocacy. It was challenging as I got to speak with the people who are doing the testing. I asked them a question, \u201cWhat is so offensive about Down syndrome, and have you considered how this makes me feel?\u201d<\/span>","filename":"Heidi-Crowter-1280x427","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":426,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491452267661,"time":1491452267,"md5":"KvqmtRHAW+hyvn2ii7+n1g==","fsize":89471,"resto":0,"id":"mXSO1ao0","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"holy-shit-just-saw-some-women-sharing-this-shit","country_name":"Australia","replies":6,"images":3,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119703732,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:19:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"A world without cancer?<br><br>As a crab, I am literally shaking right now.","time":1491452370,"resto":119703557,"id":"cjNqTuGT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119703851,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:20:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;As I was asking this question, I felt I had no strength to carry on.

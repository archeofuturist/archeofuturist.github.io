However I&#039;m sure things aren&#039;t going to go as smoothly as we like, considering what happened in Toronto when he talked there.<br><br>With that being said, I have a question. Are any fellow \/pol\/acks going to this event, and would any be willing to go to the gathering afterward? There will be quite a bit of us there and Antifa Vancouver has already started talking about it.<br><br>Luckily Antifa here is pretty small, although the liberal groups are quite large. I&#039;m not expecting any violence at all, but I&#039;d love for us to have each other&#039;s backs in case something happened and we turn Vancouver into Berkeley 0.5.<br><br>I won&#039;t be surprised if this doesn&#039;t get any replies, but it&#039;d be fun to at least brainstorm some ideas and organize some meetup spots if anybody at all is interested. The event starts at 7pm but I&#039;ll be there (with several friends) just after 6pm. And of course wearing our MAGA hats.<br><br>I unfortunately doubt anything is going to happen, but it would be great if something did and we were all there to participate.","filename":"Jordan Peterson","ext":".jpg","w":545,"h":365,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":167,"tim":1492661694761,"time":1492661694,"md5":"ZlMR8ZBlZcXSDP9D8Ool+Q==","fsize":44532,"resto":0,"id":"FpbiP1re","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"jordan-peterson-vancouver","country_name":"Canada","replies":35,"images":4,"unique_ips":26},{"no":121951932,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:29:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s happening at UBC?<br><br>I could actually be there.","time":1492662566,"resto":121950440,"id":"vVSjJodN","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121952231,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:32:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"Don&#039;t act like autistic faggots wearing MAGA hats.

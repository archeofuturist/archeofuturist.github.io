Ze hadden zoveel leden en invloed op de maatschappij dat men zelfs dacht voor eeuwig te kunnen regeren. <br>De linkse politiek is een pad naar vele nevenfuncties en banencaroussels, dat velen onnatuurlijk vinden. De PVDA werd zo machtig, dat het enige waar zij bang voor was, was de macht van het opkomende Forum voor Democratie. Wat uiteraard ook gebeurde. Helaas leerde Samson zijn leerling Asscher alles wat hij wist. Uiteindelijk stak Asscher hem in de rug. Ironisch.

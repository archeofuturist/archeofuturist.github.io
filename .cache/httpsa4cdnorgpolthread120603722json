So you saw us cosying up with China. Everyone expected Clinton to win and for this to continue, Clinton was definitely the Chinese choice for the presidency.<br><br>Then Trump comes in, starts reaching out to Russia and acting somewhat bellicose with the Chinese. The British Foriegn office scrambled to align itself with the new Administration, re-opening back channels with Russia and talking of rebooting its relationship with Russia whilst cooling its approach to China.","filename":"article-2532077-1A59CFC600000578-794_634x417","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":417,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":164,"tim":1491920838143,"time":1491920838,"md5":"ncLPbqIrlMvbwBmsWUaMHg==","fsize":94766,"resto":0,"id":"d0AVauth","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-pol-some-somwhat-insider-tidbits-for-you","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":17,"images":2,"unique_ips":14},{"no":120603762,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:27:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120603722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120603722<\/a><br>Now its all change again and they&#039;re learning that Trump is making deals with the Chinese over regime change in N.Korea.

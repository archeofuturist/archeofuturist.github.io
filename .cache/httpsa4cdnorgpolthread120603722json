So you saw us cosying up with China. Everyone expected Clinton to win and for this to continue, Clinton was definitely the Chinese choice for the presidency.<br><br>Then Trump comes in, starts reaching out to Russia and acting somewhat bellicose with the Chinese. The British Foriegn office scrambled to align itself with the new Administration, re-opening back channels with Russia and talking of rebooting its relationship with Russia whilst cooling its approach to China.","filename":"article-2532077-1A59CFC600000578-794_634x417","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":417,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":164,"tim":1491920838143,"time":1491920838,"md5":"ncLPbqIrlMvbwBmsWUaMHg==","fsize":94766,"resto":0,"id":"d0AVauth","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-pol-some-somwhat-insider-tidbits-for-you","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120603762,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:27:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120603722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120603722<\/a><br>Now its all change again and they&#039;re learning that Trump is making deals with the Chinese over regime change in N.Korea. Basically the plan is that China will do most of the heavy lifting in return for friendly trade agreement. The Chinese are meant to have people high up in the N.korean army ready to go and everyone is hoping the whole thing will be very smooth and over quickly. A Chinese puppet government will be installed and North Korea will open up.<br><br>Its basically a win\/win, China doesn&#039;t have to worry about the west knocking on its door because it will be running N.K as a satellite, it also get&#039;s the natural resources and a trade deal, Trump gets to stabilise the region and a huge diplomatic win. The Norks get a much better quality of life.<br><br>She&#039;s predicting that if it goes well in NK, Trump will try to convince Putin to go for something similar in Syria and that this time next year everyone will be talking about Trump as a Geopolitical heavyweight.","time":1491920862,"resto":120603722,"id":"d0AVauth","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120604205,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:32:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120603762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120603762<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump will try to convince Putin to go for something similar in Syria<\/span><br>My first thought is that Syria is not North Korea. <br><br>Very interesting.","time":1491921127,"resto":120603722,"id":"qwucNyqE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120604457,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:34:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120603722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120603722<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the Trump admin is so unpredictable, all plans are out the window.<\/span><br><br>Good, I was afraid that is was going to be a boring 8 years.","time":1491921271,"resto":120603722,"id":"A6ic\/gQk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120605805,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:47:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120604205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120604205<\/a><br>Yes but the question is what does Putin really want out of the Syria situation and what&#039;s the minimum Trump can get and have it look like a big win.

The Southern States did this legally through State conventions. The literally withdrew from membership in the Union. As was their legal right. Nothing in the Constitution forbids secession, and the tenth Amendment, as it rightly should, reserves that right to the States and the people of the States.<br><br>The problem for the North was not slavery. It was collection of the tariff. The tariff imposed on Southern agriculture to the benefit of Northern industrial interests had been a bone of contention since the 1820&#039;s and 30&#039;s. Lincoln admitted that the war was not over slavery stating that if it held the Union together the South could keep its slaves. <br><br>The occupation of Sumter in Charleston S.C. was strategic for the ability to blockade the largest tariff generating port in the South. Lincoln knew it, and the South knew it. Granted, firing on Sumter was a political mistake. But, the legally seceded South had every right to demand Union withdrawal from the fort. The Union knew that the South intended to open free trade with Britain. This meant that British goods which could be made cheaper than in the North, coming into the South, could then be smuggled North and sold in the Union. All of this with no tariff paid to the Union.<br><br>So, we had a war the winners have blamed on slavery and &quot;muh Union&quot; ever since. <br><br>Unfortunately, that myth has give the American Negro a club of guilt and angst with which to pummel the White man ever since.","time":1490311514,"resto":117995822,"id":"4xb0bYlp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118003165,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)19:27:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117995822\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117995822<\/a><br>is what true? that you are so stupid you dont even know how to post pictures to an image site?","time":1490311626,"resto":117995822,"id":"FdNxgKa3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118005816,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)19:46:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118002894\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118002894<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Being an educated and well read Southerner myself, no one was &quot;tricked&quot; into fighting.<\/span><br>The soldiers thrown to fight their brothers were tricked. They were told that Lincoln wanted the slaves to be freed and that the slaves will finish what James Brown started. As per an article released back then in the south and the south sending spears that John Brown had for his revolution to be viewed to further increase the fear. In addition, democrats threatened Southerns that Lincoln freeing the slaves would crush their economy, and they needed slavery. Which is why polls from back then had Southerns overwhelmingly supporting slavery, despite less than 2% of the entire US population owning slaves.<br>The Union never cared for the slavery issue. In fact, right after secession, the Union sent a treaty promising the South that they can keep slaves forever if they rejoin the Union. Keep in mind that at the time it was only SC that left the Union. So not much of a threat. <br>As for tariffs. Yes, the US had tariffs on the South, but not as for what you claimed. The North was a lot richer, and a lot more productive. In fact, by 1856, the US (Just the North, excluding the South) were the second biggest economy on the planet, very closely rivaling the UK. <br>The South didn&#039;t leave because Tariffs, it left right after Lincoln won and the main reason was because they claimed Lincoln was an abolitionist.","time":1490312795,"resto":117995822,"id":"DKfgWJcp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118007346,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)19:57:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118002894\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118002894<\/a><br>all you need to do to diffuse the slave ownership argument is to say we had that war to free the slaves. it works both ways.","time":1490313464,"resto":117995822,"id":"FdNxgKa3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

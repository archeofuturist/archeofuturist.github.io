About 2 months ago I swung by for a like party they had since I hadn&#039;t seen him in a while. Place was all antifa types, I didn&#039;t stay long.<br><br>I heard them discussing how they along with BLM are trying to turn up the heat and essentially lay the foundation for a chaotic summer. Apparently they are trying to set police up and instigate confrontational and make it appear some random passerby just happened to catch it. <br><br>They described exactly what the video that is making headlines shows. The same scenario of stepping in front of a cop to make him get out for low level crime, and to have a a &quot;random&quot; person record it. <br><br>They had another incident just like this, but apparently a truck was in the way and they were complaining because it was &quot;perfect had it not been for that truck&quot;.<br><br>What I&#039;m saying is I guarantee if you delv into who recorded this and who the guy was, that they know each other and are party of the same organization or friends. They set this cop up to react that way, the lady filming wasn&#039;t a random passerby, and that groups are doing this to lay the foundation for when the weather turns, to poor gasoline on the racial for for chaotic protests.","filename":"1488005371520","ext":".png","w":1500,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492100094178,"time":1492100094,"md5":"IuZGKGxCxh0X\/u9wEtkGpw==","fsize":306821,"resto":0,"id":"DPXQ7OIc","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-pol-the-police-video-is-a-setup-by-antifa","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

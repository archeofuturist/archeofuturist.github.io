You can finally experience what the people who were recreating the German reich experienced, the desire to work continuously to better the nation, the desire to rise up to the top and destroy all opposition completely, the feeling of comradeship when you&#039;re in a nation full of like-minded people, memeing together and fighting for a common, pure cause greater than all personal interests.<br><br>Truly an intoxicating feeling you can only get when the nation is united under a common goal, which we are.<br><br>When you join, you must have an unshakeable belief that we will WIN in a land-slide, that we will exterminate all those who oppose us to rise and become the power-players once more, that the only acceptable solution to the question of the Chanadian people is that they become the Gods of the server, that every member of ours must be worth 100 of theirs, and that every single build in our cities must be worth entire towns of theirs. This quest of superiority can only be achieved if our groups increase in size, but not only in size, in morale as well, in the belief that in order to win we must work together, regardless of board membership that we must all band together under a common goal and function as a single entity in order to give the degenerate Redditors the gas once more.","filename":"kUxj1zi","ext":".jpg","w":2885,"h":6714,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490451391778,"time":1490451391,"md5":"s27QeX+NXUD1T6W3jq++Sg==","fsize":919089,"resto":0,"id":"ju\/xQFnI","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpilled-game","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118228393,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)10:18:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Minecraft<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2017<\/span>","filename":"1462308338068","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1283,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490451506237,"time":1490451506,"md5":"FLESYFqNG3YslqGwQPdlaA==","fsize":307720,"resto":118228222,"id":"C1E2d2cr","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118229244,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)10:28:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Currently, we share borders with degenerates, who not only have more manpower, but also more shekels than us, this used to be different, long ago, before WW2, when we were the power-players of the server.

US officials said dozens of terrorists were killed, but those on the ground said at least 47 civilians also died in the strikes. The Pentagon denied that there were any civilian casualties but has launched a formal investigation into the incident.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; On Monday, a conflict monitoring group, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said a strike near Raqqa targeted a school that was serving as a home for multiple families displaced by fighting in the area, killing at least 33. The Pentagon admitted US aircraft were operating in the vicinity but, according to Pentagon spokesman Eric Pahon, the military is having a hard time rectifying the location of the building that was targeted with what was shown as destroyed on social media.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; On Thursday, Iraqi media reported that an airstrike in Mosul killed more than 200 people. The Pentagon is investigating the claims.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; After the fall of Aleppo to Syrian and Russian forces in December and the recent escalation of the US-led campaigns against the Islamic State in Mosul and Raqqa, claims of civilian casualties caused by American-led forces have outstripped those caused by Damascus and the Kremlin, according to Airwars.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Airwars uses varying methods to investigate and confirm civilian casualties, relying on a medley of local news outlets, NGOs, civilian volunteers and social media to determine if casualty reports are fair, weak, contested or disproved. For March, nearly half the alleged strikes are contested, according to Airwars data.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; According to Airwars, more than 2,500 civilians have been killed by the US-led coalition, which has admitted to killing only roughly 220 civilians. In recent months, the Pentagon said it has taken strides to investigate a backlog of claims while starting to release monthly civilian casualty assessments.<\/span>","time":1490470411,"resto":118260555,"id":"ZgpcMP3\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118261574,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:33:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118261134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118261134<\/a><br>GOD WILL KNOW HIS OWN.","time":1490470417,"resto":118260555,"id":"iIQdqp3J","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118261580,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:33:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Praise kek","time":1490470419,"resto":118260555,"id":"l1ZPdp1J","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118261725,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:34:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118260555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118260555<\/a><br>A &quot;civilian&quot; in most of these cases are ISIS sympathizers, potential recruits and trainees.

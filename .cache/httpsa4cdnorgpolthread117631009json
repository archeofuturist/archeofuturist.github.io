Two answers are guaranteed to be the same, while the third will either also be the same, or different. If its different, the one who gave the different answer is Kek. You also know that whatever Kek said must mean &quot;No&quot;, because Jesus and Baphoment have to answer the question &quot;Yes&quot;. If Kek is a dick and answers the same as the other two guys, you can try the same thing again with Baphomet. If Kek fucks you twice then lol gg<br><br>Then you go to one of the other two and ask, &quot;If I asked the other Lord if he were Jesus, what would he answer?&quot;, if you&#039;re talking to Jesus he&#039;ll tell you that Baphoment would say Yes, but if you&#039;re talking to Baphoment he&#039;ll tell you that Jesus would say No, which is how you can tell them apart.","time":1490110516,"resto":117631009,"id":"ywI32qdj","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117635112,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)11:35:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117631009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117631009<\/a><br>Are you Moloch?","time":1490110533,"resto":117631009,"id":"4SmudU8e","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

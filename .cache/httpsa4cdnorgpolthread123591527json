He reported that the outlines of the flowering plants would point to March or April and the environs of Jerusalem.[116][117] In a separate report in 1978 Danin and Uri Baruch reported on the pollen grains on the cloth samples, stating that they were appropriate to the spring in Israel.[118] Max Frei, a Swiss police criminologist who initially obtained pollen from the shroud during the STURP investigation stated that of the 58 different types of pollens found, 45 were from the Jerusalem area, while 6 were from the eastern Middle East, with one pollen species growing exclusively in \u0130stanbul, and two found in Edessa, Turkey.[119] Mark Antonacci argues that the pollen evidence and flower images are inherently interwoven and strengthen each other<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Some proponents for the authenticity of the shroud have attempted to discount the radiocarbon dating result by claiming that the sample may represent a medieval &quot;invisible&quot; repair fragment rather than the image-bearing cloth.[8][9][18][19][85][86][87][88<wbr>][89] It has been suggested, for example, that burnt residue,[12][13] or other types of residues,[16][90] might have skewed the radiocarbon date toward the present. These various challenges have all been refuted by experts based on scientific analysis of shroud evidence.[12][16][17][18][19][20] According to professor Christopher Ramsey of the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit in 2011: &quot;There are various hypotheses as to why the dates might not be correct, but none of them stack up.&quot;[21]<\/span><br><br>Never will be proven if it is or is not but this is what we have, and jesus need a face you know","time":1493648320,"resto":123591527,"id":"3vMx3qh4","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":123625645,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:20:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123624648\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123624648<\/a><br>Taking a look at jews, there is a distinct demonic taint in them.

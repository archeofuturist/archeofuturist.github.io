It put on a huge act to get support from the Soviet Union &amp; China after it&#039;s independence, but in reality, DPRK is closer ideologically to the 3rd reich, or Imperial Japan than it is to the soviet union. An Ultra-conservative ethnic nationalist state, against any kind of race mixing, totally opposed to liberalism, extremely conservative views on age, sexuality, gender, family, &quot;LGBT&quot;, etc.. Stories about &quot;Starving North Korea&quot; are rooted largely in fiction. Child Malnutrition rates in North Korea are around 14% - Average child malnutrition in the world is around 30% (With many countries, eg, India, reaching as high as 50% - Which North Korea did not come close to even in the worst years of the 1990&#039;s famine, which has been over for more than a decade now).<br><br>Stories regarding the cult of personality\/lack of information are also greatly exaggerated. Yes, the Cult is very large, but North Koreans do not believe Kim is a &quot;God&quot; or can &quot;Read their minds&quot;. American &amp; South Korean movies, television shows, etc, can be accessed fairly easily in Pyongyang &amp; much of the rest of the country.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":842,"h":960,"tn_w":219,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492468064936,"time":1492468064,"md5":"4mBL6XQ1NzDTGMTH5lKBrA==","fsize":154972,"resto":0,"id":"SGJoofHp","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"north-korea-is-and-always-will-be-best-korea","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

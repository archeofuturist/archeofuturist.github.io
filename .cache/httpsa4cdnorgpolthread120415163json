Yeah I agree about the flat earth stuff though, for example a lot of it based on those flawed experiments in Zetetic Astronomy, and I&#039;m sure if youre autistic enough you could show naval operations and movements pointing to the globe model. For example U-boat operations in the South Atlantic in WW2. Haven&#039;t done it myself admittedly. <br><br>Some people get hung up on certain things they have a hard-on for. Like Icke with his ooga-booga friend he always brings up, as if Zulu oral tradition means fuck all at the end of the day. Still though, I think it&#039;s important for us to remember where we all stand and not fall for another trap like Trump in the future.","time":1491814606,"resto":120415163,"id":"0Ob8g3mx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120416221,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:01:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Phelps is also an extremely strong proponent for separation of the races, and secession.

Pro tip : if you spend your energy and time tip-toeing around things to make sure you don&#039;t get branded with undesirables, you&#039;re never going to get anywhere. Yes, David Icke&#039;s reptillian shit is hogwash. That doesn&#039;t have anything to do with the fact that him and Phelps were the only (((conspiracy theorists))) or (((truthers))) who did not jump on the Trump bandwagon that I have found. Does that lend credence to certain other things they talk about? No, of course not. It&#039;s just a statement of fact. I think it is important to remember however that most every &quot;alternate media&quot; type was totally up Trump&#039;s ass until just recently. And Alex Jones on his show today (I hardly ever listen, but a video was posted earlier today so I clicked on his show) came out as a chesscuck.","time":1491816296,"resto":120415163,"id":"0Ob8g3mx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120418228,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:28:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120417916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120417916<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why is every religion full of dragon and serpent stories connected with great evils in mankind&#039;s past?<\/span><br>I highly recommend watching some of Heiser&#039;s lectures on that stuff.

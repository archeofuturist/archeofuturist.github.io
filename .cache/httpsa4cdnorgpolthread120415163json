Yes, David Icke&#039;s reptillian shit is hogwash.

Does that lend credence to certain other things they talk about? No, of course not. It&#039;s just a statement of fact. I think it is important to remember however that most every &quot;alternate media&quot; type was totally up Trump&#039;s ass until just recently.

Kings of medieval England answered to the Pope, not some Rabbi. Rome has not declined in power nor have their patterns of hating on Northern Europeans for being &quot;free thinking barbarians&quot; subsided. There is also a hell of a lot more archaeological evidence that Rome was an ancient power than there was of there even being a an ancient state of Israel ruled by a mythical womanizing king.

The only atheist Europeans here are autistic spastics that want to look smart. In reality it&#039;s a non issue. Nobody cares about separation of church and state here, nobody cares if the monarch head of state is also the head of the church of England. Nobody cares the church of England is the official religion of the state. <br><br>Nobody cares about these things because it has no adverse effect on society. God forbid you follow a religion that teaches selflessness and moral standards.

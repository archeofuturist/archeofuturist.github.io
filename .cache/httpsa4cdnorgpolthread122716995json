That&#039;s a mainstream claim that appeared in I think the New York Times.

Epstein&#039;s island is documented, and I know someone who saw a very rich Australian go out on a boat from Sydney harbour with friends and some little southeast Asian boys. Sydney also had a child brothel that was paying protection to the police right next to the Central Business District. The Sydney artworld also knew about one artist who was up to shenanigans in Bali with the kids there. Sydney was notorious for that kind of thing before the Wood Royal Comission, and our Catholic Church was\/is rampant with it also. That came out at some government investigation. Estimated something like 1\/10 priests, and up to 1\/7 in some orders were up to mischief. Pedophilia seems to be a delicacy amongst a lot of elites. I would guess it&#039;s a bit of fun, plus taboo breaking bonds and allows blackmail.","time":1493119552,"resto":122716995,"id":"q3o+Og3s","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122724160,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:29:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122723964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122723964<\/a><br>Except for the era of modern art starts in the late 1800s like 60 years before the CIA ever existed.","time":1493119746,"resto":122716995,"id":"LLraKygF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122724343,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:31:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122724160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122724160<\/a>","filename":"IMG_0851","ext":".png","w":750,"h":1334,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493119912163,"time":1493119912,"md5":"8R8BqQugjnyoMY3S3ag2AA==","fsize":138466,"resto":122716995,"id":"q3o+Og3s","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122724437,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:33:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Manson was a good boy who didn&#039;t do nuthing.

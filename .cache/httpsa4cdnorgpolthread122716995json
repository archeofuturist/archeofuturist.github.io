Sydney also had a child brothel that was paying protection to the police right next to the Central Business District. The Sydney artworld also knew about one artist who was up to shenanigans in Bali with the kids there. Sydney was notorious for that kind of thing before the Wood Royal Comission, and our Catholic Church was\/is rampant with it also. That came out at some government investigation. Estimated something like 1\/10 priests, and up to 1\/7 in some orders were up to mischief. Pedophilia seems to be a delicacy amongst a lot of elites.

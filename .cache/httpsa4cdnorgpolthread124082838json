Even the political science classes I&#039;ve taken were objective. This actually is an institution for higher learning and provides students with an opportunity to challenge their beliefs. The issue is with the mayor, who actually is a cuck and has ties to BAMN. I&#039;m all for defunding the city, but it&#039;s not fair to punish students for this bullshit that usually takes place FAR from campus (besides the Milo incident) and involves people that don&#039;t even fucking attend UC Berkeley","time":1493923883,"resto":124082838,"id":"OmVuiKJa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124093547,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)14:53:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"when are trump supporters going to properly organize and defend against shit like this. they act plenty tough during rallies. why not actually get together and make a difference as a mobilized force in these Universities that are blatantly thumbing their noses at constitutional rights?

Firstly we must understand that the Bible is a historical document and we should treat it as such. If we want to understand its reliability as a historical document (and therefore why I believe in it) then we must look at a few different things. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1. When the various books were written in relation to the events that took place.<\/span><br>Historically speaking, works of legend are generally considered to begin to appear some two generations after and event has taken place.We can see this for example in the writings of Livy. Generally speaking, the sooner something is written after an event has taken place, the more reliable it is considered to be. Now, some of the earliest writings in the New Testament are Paul&#039;s letters, some Scholars have placed these writings back to about 3-4 years after Jesus&#039; death, others have placed that about 20 years. There&#039;s room for error either way in the grand scheme of history, but ultimately speaking, this is would be considered to be lightning fast, especially when compared to other works of history that we still consider to be reliable sources, see Suetonius for example. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. Well how do we know that the writers weren&#039;t simply lying? <\/span><br>This is another important point. It is very easy to believe that the writers of the bible were lying about Jesus. I myself used to believe this when I was an atheist. However, this argument ignores the context that the Bible was written in. Christians were widely persecuted by Romans, Jews, etc. Now we know for a fact that Peter and Paul were both eye witnesses of Jesus and his resurrection. Lets run with the idea that they were lying about the resurrection. If they were lying, why would neither Peter or Paul have said so before being brutally executed? It speaks volumes about how reliable their testimony was. It would have been easy for them to do so and denounce what they wrote, yet they didn&#039;t.","time":1492281442,"resto":121208289,"id":"Kjle5V+E","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121242069,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)14:38:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121241775\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121241775<\/a>","filename":"Deus","ext":".png","w":500,"h":771,"tn_w":81,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492281521315,"time":1492281521,"md5":"EiJl5USgtzPkGWLnNyyRdA==","fsize":214207,"resto":121208289,"id":"rHp5EnaR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121242101,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)14:38:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121241021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121241021<\/a><br>Hmm not sure if I like the attendees snapping pics with their cell phones.","time":1492281539,"resto":121208289,"id":"a6YXla\/o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121242245,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)14:40:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121241909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121241909<\/a><br>Cont. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3.

Was it from Jesus? Or some other person?<\/span><br>That&#039;s a good question, it&#039;s one we could write a lot on. You may be surprised to know that none of the books in the Bible were written by Jesus, but by the people who were around him. Some of the books in the Bible are written anonymously, others are named after their author (Matthew, John, Luke etc.), others are given titles based on what the book is about and the authors name is mentioned in it (Corinthians, Galatians, Revelation). I cannot even begin to go into where all the information in the Bible comes from but I&#039;ll give a quick rundown. Virtually everything in the New Testament was written by the apostles of Jesus. We have the gospels of Mark, Matthew, Luke and John. Gospel means good news, it was essentially their way of spread the news of Christ, they all tell basically the same story and it&#039;s the story we all know, it&#039;s good news because Jesus has died for your sins.<br>We also have the letters of Paul. These are pretty well known as they are some of the absolutely earliest writings we have of Christian theology, in them he outlines Christ&#039;s teachings and how they are to be applied. <br>So to answer your question about where it all comes from. Most of he new testament all comes from the words and acts of Jesus, written down by his followers.","time":1492283194,"resto":121208289,"id":"Kjle5V+E","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121246669,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)15:14:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121245469\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121245469<\/a><br>Thank you for your good wishes and you have a blessed one too!","time":1492283671,"resto":121208289,"id":"pAB1PgZl","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":121247881,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)15:24:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121241909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121241909<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It speaks volumes about how reliable their testimony was.

The teacher is an overweight Mexican who talks about how much he loves playing video games and about how he browses reddit, just to give you an indication of the kind of person he is.<br><br>Some of the things we are taught include:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;race is a social construct, there is zero biological difference between the races. Intelligence differences are purely because of society and whites putting down minorities, and we need to do more to help them. But also intelligence and temperament are 60\/40 genetics, but I don&#039;t like hearing that because it sounds depressing (not joking or exaggerating whatsoever, the last part is actually what was said paraphrased)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Interracial relationships are a positive thing because it gives people a better understanding of diversity. Also, according to this chart, more than 95% of people born past 1980 are a-okay with it (I know that isn&#039;t possible just using basic logic)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the gender paygap is 77%. (Someone raises their hand and corrects him). No, that&#039;s pseudoscience. Even when accounting for the actual choices of women they still only get 77% (this is objectively false even if you ask liberals)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Frequent rants about police violence towards blacks; asks for people to raise their hands if they ever played with toy guns, then asks if we were ever shot for it; &quot;That&#039;s because you&#039;re white&quot; (this is an actual, direct quote)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Everyone always wants to put personal blame on people and say its their fault for making poor decisions, but you can&#039;t say that. Like when people say that blacks are violent and riot too much, yet forget that white people riot way more often and are just as violent!<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gender exists on a wide spectrum and is not binary<\/span><br><br>Etc. etc. I live in a conservative state too and half this shit is part of the curriculum. We need an awakening.","filename":"1474754234603","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":531,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":207,"tim":1493247778928,"time":1493247778,"md5":"wIBFy7+HAzYvfEO6O5fC3Q==","fsize":61753,"resto":0,"id":"k5gca44F","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hello-pol-im-a-senior-in-high-school-and-im","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122955303,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)19:10:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122954390\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122954390<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;psychology <\/span><br><br>I believe it.

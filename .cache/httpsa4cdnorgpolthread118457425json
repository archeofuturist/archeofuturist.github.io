It&#039;s that same stupidity allowed them to be brainwashed in the first place so it&#039;s actually better for the rest of us that they get locked up sooner rather than later.<br>When you&#039;re that susceptible to brainwashing you need to be locked away for _everyone&#039;s_ safety.<br>I am hopeful that this ignorant, delusional gash doesn&#039;t get anyone hurt beyond what they&#039;ve already done.

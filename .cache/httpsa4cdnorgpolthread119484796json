To an age when thought is free. From the Age of Big Brother, from the Age of the Thought Police, from a dead man - greetings!\u201d<br><br>These words can mean many things to many people, however, today, they hold special meaning for me. While liberals all over the nation head to independent movie theaters to protest President Donald Trump. They do this to demonstrate that Donald Trump is going to usher in the age of Big Brother.<br><br>Well, I would contend that Big Brother already exists. I will assert that the Thought Police are real. That your every single communication and thought are not intimate to just you, but are now common knowledge to corporations and government. <br><br>This did not happen overnight, but has been years in the making. Since 2001, our country has engaged in the practice of illegal domestic surveillance, citizen rendition and civil rights violations. Our government has allowed foreign intelligence services to collect intelligence on US citizens, in direct violation of our constitution. <br><br>Our constitution is the contract which binds the body politic to the government. When the government breaks the letter and spirit of this contract, the government becomes illegitimate. We, ladies and gentleman, have allowed our government to assume this position, via complacency. We have become too comfortable.<br><br>We have a choice however. We can choose to acknowledge it and do nothing or we can begin systematically re-writing the contract we have with our government.<br><br>The choice is up to you anon.","filename":"04042017","ext":".png","w":1851,"h":992,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":133,"tim":1491322729480,"time":1491322729,"md5":"dHV4PrZdkZVZB1U4wavfVA==","fsize":1887625,"resto":0,"id":"xkM59Y\/s","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"april-4th-2017","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119485138,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)12:21:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119484796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119484796<\/a><br>don&#039;t worry nothin&quot;s happenin&#039;.

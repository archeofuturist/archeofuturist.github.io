Because that&#039;s how it hast to be. Because that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been. American indignation in the face of premeditated attack has always been mighty, and conclusive. Because sometimes irrelevant, un-evolved nation states actually feel they have the right to take the territory and\/or lives of people who simply disagree with them, and want to retain their sovereignty. And unfortunately, sometimes such nation-states only speak the language of force, in which case it is prudent to be fluent in that language.<br><br>Honestly I&#039;d hoped that the USA and Russia could enjoy improved diplomatic relations after the election, I always wanted that. I felt it was a pipe-dream, but I always wanted it, because I grew up during the Cold War, and I know how it feels to grow up acutely aware that, at any moment, we are all less that thirty minutes flight time away from complete annihilation. One misstep is all it takes. But the Russian subterfuge makes everyone suspicious of that now. Suspicious of their true intentions, when we thought we were neighbors on this small planet who want to challenge each other to evolve, as we did during the Space Race. Stable bipolarity, as with most fields in Nature, is pro-evolutionary. And that metaphor extends to the Human Polity.<br><br>So how do we mend fences?","filename":"001_Michael","ext":".jpg","w":679,"h":679,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491510607287,"time":1491510607,"md5":"htb1hU9SwpKSM1DUmeSoSQ==","fsize":44140,"resto":0,"id":"ZG7uXeoZ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-only-possible-path-forward","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119789982,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:30:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119789900\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119789900<\/a><br><br>Russia should withdraw from Syria and allow the United States to neutralize Bashar Al-Assad&#039;s military-industrial complex either voluntarily by U.N. Resolution with Assad&#039;s permission under international pressure, or failing that, by force of a multi-national Coalition of Nations opposed to the use of chemical weapons of mass destruction against civilians, as prescribed by the Geneva Convention. Ideally Russia will be a member of that coalition, and tactics will be designed around minimizing civilian casualties, even if it takes extra time and money to action the mission, as an example to Assad (and the World) of how to wage war honorably, as we surgically neuter him.<br><br>Assad will eventually become marginalized in similar fashion as Saddam Hussein after Desert Storm, only this time we will not make the mistake of allow irrelevant enemy rhetoric in the post-operational environment goad us into unnecessary regime change as an overreaction, as we did with Hussein after Desert Storm (the sanctions were working, and he was denying U.N. inspections because he didn\u2019t want Iran to think him weak, not because he actually had WMDs). But we know Assad has Weapons of Mass Destruction, he just used them on a group of innocent children. <br><br>This Coalition of the Willing will bring Assad to heel, and neutralize his hardware, leaving his regime intact as a paper tiger. Such cooperation and successful application of military art by both superpowers will increase the likelihood that other nation states will observe the Geneva Convention, and promote an environment where future US\/Russian Joint Global Counterterrorism Operations could have a real chance of eliminating the scourge of Terrorism, borne of extremist dogma of any flavor, from the face of the Earth, once and for all. Led by this Joint US\/Russian effort, pan-Arab cooperation by moderate Islamic theocracies could usher in a lasting era of peace in the Middle East.","time":1491510643,"resto":119789900,"id":"ZG7uXeoZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119790064,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:31:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119789982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119789982<\/a><br><br>Regarding Crimea, Russia should immediately withdraw its forces from Eastern Ukraine as a condition of being invited to take part in the Coalition, and agree to allow a second referendum to be held in Crimea under U.N. inspection to determine whether or not the population really wants to become part of Russia. It may very well be that these people genuinely desire it, at this point in history, for better or worse. And if so, a fairly vetted referendum will determine the outcome, and the World should agree to abide by the free will of the majority. If Crimea decides to Remain within Ukraine, Russia should be willing to diplomatically recognize this outcome, and sign a future non-agression treaty. If Crimea desired to secede, then it will become part of Russia, and a financial settlement will be made to Ukraine over time to fairly compensate them for their loss, a financial settlement with which we can assist, because Russia is so cash-poor after years of sanctions. Once a financial settlement is litigated between Russia and Ukraine, the United States will unconditionally lift all financial sanctions on the Russian Federation.<br><br>The tradeoff here is Crimea for Syria, and my expectation is that Russia will take the deal if they feel a fair referendum will result in Crimean secession, otherwise they will not allow it. Therefore it will be prudent to do demographic studies of the likely outcome of such a fair referendum before extending the offer, otherwise the Russians are unlikely to bite.","time":1491510677,"resto":119789900,"id":"ZG7uXeoZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119790159,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:31:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;NO WAR IN SYRIA<\/span><br>NO WAR IN SYRIA","time":1491510716,"resto":119789900,"id":"Vdqa9MtD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119790196,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:32:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119790064\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119790064<\/a><br><br>With regard to North Korea, humanitarian aid should be offered to Kim Jong Un in exchange for U.N. inspections of their nuclear program. No inspections? No aid. Period. They should be isolated diplomatically and economically by China and South Korea as well. This will be difficult for South Korean factories that depend on North Korean workers crossing the border every day to work, and their loss must be compensated by the US and China, to secure their unconditional support, if there is conflict. China&#039;s cooperation should be secured by extending Most Favored Nation status with regards to trade, relative to competitor nation-states in the Asian economy. <br><br>Any further North Korean outbursts will be publicly ridiculed by the International Community. Kim Jong Il is a pathological narcissist, and what he most fears is the end of himself, and the false image he projects to his people and the World. He knows that any offensive attack will result in his certain demise, so for all of his bluster, he will never shoot first. He will resort to peacock-like displays of \u201cpower\u201d in the form of weapons testing. Consequently, public ridicule will be the most effective psychological strategy to demoralize him and blunt his imperialistic ambitions in the long term. To that end, the United States, China, and Japan should all publicly agree that any projectile fired from North Korea impinging upon International Airspace or International Waters should be immediately engaged and destroyed by available anti-ballistic missile technology (in the United States and Japan&#039;s case, using Arleigh Burke class Destroyers equipped with the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system).","time":1491510730,"resto":119789900,"id":"ZG7uXeoZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119790286,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:32:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119790196\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119790196<\/a><br><br>A successful intercept will completely demoralize Kim Jong Un, and the newly-forged Sino-American Alliance will bring North Korea to heel, in which case it will resort to begging for humanitarian aid, in exchange for eased \u201ctensions.\u201d It is very important to realize that they must also agree unconditionally to ongoing U.N. inspections of their nuclear program in order to receive any aid of any kind, especially after their technology has been shown to be obsolete relative to American state of the art.

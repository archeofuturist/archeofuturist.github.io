Even in the early 30s, Hitler was talked about as a buffoon and a political novice who could be manipulated by the more traditional conservatives (even after the Nazi party had grown to be the largest party in Germany). Communist attacks on Nazis grew in intensity, and streetfighting soon commenced (going from barroom brawls to fighting with clubs to finally shooting at each other). Many Nazis were assassinated by Communists and Horst Wessel Lied, the Nazi anthem, was a song written by one of the men turned into a martyr by Goebbels&#039; propaganda.<br><br>Watching what happened at the Battle of Berkeley and the way the police completely refused to intervene, I am beginning to think that conservatives\/alt-right need better organization and an outfit like the Sturmabteilung to protect people and make sure Communists can no longer attack old people or try to kick people to death on the floor.... or throw fucking explosives.<br><br>Look at the last thread for the history of the SA and its surprisingly similarities to what&#039;s happening now. The Beer Hall Brawl and the Battle of Berkeley.","filename":"Awoo Based","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492827072432,"time":1492827072,"md5":"1ZSsnuPcbJ4prvzaUeJidA==","fsize":55272,"resto":0,"id":"OZfJEsda","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"american-sturmabteilung","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":122220761,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)22:11:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122220669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122220669<\/a><br><br><br>Get armed and armored. The police are telling you to come unarmed. They&#039;re disarming you. Stop listening to that shit. They are not going to defend you when some Commie fuck drags you into a group so eight of them can kick and stab you to death.<br><br>Arms Basics<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shield<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mace\/Pepper Spray<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Flagpole.<\/span><br><br>People say the police were searching them. Well, first of all, you can fucking hide mace. Don&#039;t let the mayor of Berkeley disarm you via the police so his leftist thug friends can kill your ass. Besides, most of Antifa doesn&#039;t fucking protect their eyes. The only thing they wear, if anything, is glasses. Fuck them up if they touch you or start beating on someone.<br><br>Others have said that the police confiscated shields and poles: here&#039;s a hot tip. Try to get in some other way. The fucking Pepsi people somehow snuck in boxes of Pepsi when the cops were &quot;confiscating&quot; all the cans as projectiles. Alternatively, create a typical protest sign: a wooden board on top of a pole. Screw handles into the back of the sign. When you get behind the police line, take the sign off your pole and use it as a shield.<br><br>Armor Basics:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Helmet<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Goggles (eyepro)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Respirator or Gasmask (may incorporate eyepro)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cup (ballpro)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gloves<\/span><br><br>You may also want to include arm and shin protection. Hockey pads work (they&#039;re meant to take a slashing stick), but motocross, and even soccer shit if you&#039;re in a pinch. For chest protection, you can&#039;t go wrong with football pads, but a thick leather jacket works, too. If you go the football look, you can Caesar&#039;s Legion the fuck out of Antifa. If you have enough armor, you don&#039;t really need too much weaponry (though I&#039;d still suggest pepper spray if you can)","filename":"Complete the Look","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":586,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":76,"tim":1492827112398,"time":1492827112,"md5":"qH\/zKQNIIBF3AlXwg6ZGVQ==","fsize":70966,"resto":122220669,"id":"OZfJEsda","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

No. But Peterson is such a role model.<br><br>You can tell that Peterson is a man who was lost and confused in his 20s. It&#039;s pretty evident, from the fact that he switched between so many jobs. Also he is a man who has suffered from depression, which he has talked about on one of his television appearances.<br><br>But he sorted himself out. And he is a very successful man. He lectured at Harvard. He is now a tenured professor. He has been entrepreneurial, making money from his Self-Authoring Program (which was set up with some colleagues, not just him, I believe), and from a consultancy business he started (again with colleagues) to provide management advice, from a psychologist&#039;s perspective. And he does private practice which I&#039;m sure isn&#039;t entirely cheap.<br><br>And of course he has a traditional family, a wife that he has known for 50 years (she says so in one of his videos - they grew up in the same town in Alberta), and I believe he has two kids, a son and a daughter.<br><br>He has succeed in life. He slayed the dragon, and he became the archetypal male hero - at least, for his family he did.<br><br>Best of all, though, is that he doesn&#039;t deny the truth. He will tell you that males and females are different. What professors DARE do this these days? And he&#039;s not saying it to be controversial - he&#039;s saying it because it&#039;s TRUE!<br><br>Great man, in my opinion. I don&#039;t watch his videos obsessively, but every now and then I sit down and watch a 5 minute clip of him speaking, and I think &quot;shit this nigga knows everything&quot;.","filename":"jbp3","ext":".jpg","w":660,"h":371,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491139240045,"time":1491139240,"md5":"DhsIRVQAfuTFJYJ4k0JyCQ==","fsize":37498,"resto":119197595,"id":"3twAUKJl","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119198323,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:21:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"The axiomatic presupposition that he is based is predicated on the idea, at least in Piagetian terms, that he&#039;s not a bloody radical left-wing ideologue <br><br>And that&#039;s THAT","time":1491139263,"resto":119197595,"id":"b25bEcL9","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119198618,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:24:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119198205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119198205<\/a><br>There&#039;s a channel which uploads 5 minute vids of him, they&#039;re good.

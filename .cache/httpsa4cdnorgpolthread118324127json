They threw him in prison for breaking the law, but afterwards they&#039;d have to continue incarcerating him for doing absolutely nothing. Their futile attempts to bring him in line ultimately blow back in their faces as the public as a whole begins to turn on them while they have no basis to justify their actions.<br><br>Trolling for KEK is just like nonviolent civil disobedience in this respect. The internet in general is a place mostly devoid of real consequences especially for anons, thus satisfying the condition that everything you do for the lulz not actually harm anyone. (anything they do is just them harming themselves, like retards) This completely cockblocks them from ever gaining the moral high ground<br><br>An important difference that gives trolling an advantage over civil disobience is that every time Gandi protested something he was put in jail, not fun. However every time we troll an SJW or whatever we gain a pure sense of giddy joy, with no downsides. So even if they don&#039;t reform their ways we can still enjoy watching them hurt themselves.","time":1490505762,"resto":118324127,"id":"3iCZ86CH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

They had men eat meat diet or a vegetarian diet for two weeks and then took odor samples from their armpits. Then they had the men switch their diets and took samples again. The odor samples were given to women who rated them on level of pleasantness (there is one study I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t partake in!). The women consistently found that the vegetarian men\u2019s smell was \u201cmore attractive\u201d.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why do vegetarians smell better than meat eaters? One possible reason is because red meat causes toxins to be released into the bloodstream and large intestines, which then make it out through our pores. Another reason is because of the bacteria on our skin. The bacteria love to consume proteins and fats \u2013 things are plentiful in meat. So, the bacteria thrive on meat eaters and their waste produces a vile smell.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/plenteousveg.com\/vegetarian<wbr>s-better-lovers\/","time":1493942702,"resto":124133731,"id":"ajo\/YdKH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124134275,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)20:05:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124133731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124133731<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw you have that guys body.<\/span><br><br>Why live?","time":1493942728,"resto":124133731,"id":"QtlCmd7A","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124134471,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)20:06:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124133731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124133731<\/a><br>Health obsessed vegans are more likely to exercise, I hypothesise. <br><br>Correlation =\/= Causation<br><br>What was the study actually about?

On Wednesday, that wish came true, as Baby Donald completed his transformation into a standard chief executive of the United States by espousing many of the hallmark policies one would have associated with President Hillary Clinton.<\/span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Previously, Trump said NATO was obsolete. Now, he salutes it, Clinton-style, as a \u201cgreat alliance.\u201d Previously, he lavished kisses on Vladimir Putin and Russia. Now Trump and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson have taken a Clintonesque stand against Russia, admitting to low levels of trust between the two nations. Then: No war in Syria. Now, Trump is bombing Syria with the sort of glee Clinton would have brought to the mission. And on and on it goes, with Trump adopting Clintonian stances on Chinese currency manipulation (doesn\u2019t exist!) and the Export-Import Bank (for it).<\/span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidency would have been a family affair, with Bill and Chelsea mobbing the White House with their advice; Trump has seated daughter Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner at on his roundtable and acts on their guidance. Hillary Clinton would have recruited pros from Goldman Sachs; Trump has brushed the rafters of his administration a beaming gold with guys from Goldman. Hillary Clinton would have gone to war with the Republican Congress, vowing to campaign against them once they refused to pass her legislation; Trump has come close to realizing that goal, telling the leader of the troublesome House Freedom Caucus, \u201cMark, I\u2019m coming after you.\u201d<\/span>","filename":"1","ext":".png","w":687,"h":567,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":206,"tim":1492122820197,"time":1492122820,"md5":"+9+m4suvf5o1IzkPKxAs8w==","fsize":485368,"resto":0,"id":"vimZvUsk","country":"MY","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"donald-rodham-clinton","country_name":"Malaysia","replies":17,"images":12,"unique_ips":11},{"no":120974847,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)18:34:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Remember how Trump\u2019s surrogates said during the campaign that a Clinton presidency would be too hobbled by the ongoing FBI investigation to govern effectively? Instead, we\u2019ve gotten a Trump presidency tainted by an FBI investigation of several of his top campaign aides. During the campaign, Trump beat on Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen with the baseball-bat fury of Joey Ramone. \u201cTo a certain extent, I think she should be ashamed of herself,\u201d he said. That statement is now inoperative, replaced with the \u201cI like her, I respect her\u201d statement he gave to the Wall Street Journal. Reappointing her to the Fed is not outside the realm of possibility.<br><br>Elsewhere on the Clintonification front, Trump through his legislative bungling has preserved Obamacare, which he vowed to repeal, and is ready to make common cause with Democrats to pass an infrastructure pork bill. Had Clinton gone shopping for generals to stock her administration, she might have filled her cart with the likes of H.R. McMaster, Jim Mattis, and John F. Kelly.<br><br>When not drawing on Clinton for inspiration, Trump has turned to Barack Obama. Before and during the campaign, he criticized Obama for golfing instead of tending to whatever crisis in high fermentation that moment. \u201cI\u2019m going to be working for you. I\u2019m not going to have time to go play golf,\u201d Trump said last August. He\u2019s taken a mulligan on that pledge as president, exceeding Obama\u2019s devotion to the links with gusto. According to a Palm Beach Post tally, Trump played 14 times during his first 82 days in office while Obama averaged about 9.3 trips to the courses every 82 days for his entire presidency.","filename":"2","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":623,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":122,"tim":1492122893587,"time":1492122893,"md5":"tbScFLzAGlL\/2GILjwux+A==","fsize":67115,"resto":120974687,"id":"vimZvUsk","country":"MY","country_name":"Malaysia"},{"no":120974986,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)18:35:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;the Trump administration continues to blur into something resembling a triangulating Clinton presidency, especially as Bannon\u2019s influence on the president fades from full moon to gibbous.

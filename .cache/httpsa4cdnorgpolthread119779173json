Prominent journalist and Russia expert Peter Pomerantsev believes Russia&#039;s efforts are aimed at confusing the audience, rather than convincing it. He states that they cannot censor information but can &quot;trash it with conspiracy theories and rumours&quot;.<br><br>To avert suspicions, the users sandwich political remarks between neutral articles on traveling, cooking and pets.They overwhelm comment sections of media to render meaningful dialogue impossible.<br>\u201cThe effect created by such Internet trolls is not very big, but they manage to make certain forums meaningless because people stop commenting on the articles when these trolls sit there and constantly create an aggressive, hostile atmosphere toward those whom they don\u2019t like.

This makes it meaningless for a reasonable person to comment on anything there. \u201d<br><br>In 2015 Lawrence Alexander disclosed a network of propaganda websites sharing the same Google Analytics identifier and domain registration details, allegedly run by Nikita Podgorny from Internet Research Agency. The websites were mostly meme repositories focused on attacking Ukraine, Euromaidan, Russian opposition and Western policies.

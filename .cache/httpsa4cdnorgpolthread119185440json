So here&#039;s a quick rundown:<br><br>tl;dr:<br>Transgender = &quot;I don&#039;t feel like my sex&quot; (not a choice, &amp; is measurable)<br><br>Gender dysphoria (disorder) = mental stress due to being transgender, largely caused by being rejected or ridiculed by society. Basically, anxiety. They may not feel it 100% of the time just like a bipolar person may not feel depressed 100% of the time.<br><br>Transsexual = Transgender person experiencing gender dysphoria who has transitioned to their identified sex<br><br>Long version:<br><br>Gender dysphoria, or gender identity disorder (GID) is a physiological disorder resulting in a person having the phenotype of one sex, but a clinically diagnosed level of distress due to a conflict between their sex and the sex they mentally associate with, often represented in measurable differences in brain chemistry and hormones.<br><br>Psychological therapy has been shown to be ineffective; seeing a shrink can&#039;t fix a physiological issue, but it does help manage the other symptoms that may result from it, such as depression or other mental illnesses.<br><br>The leading biological treatment is hormone treatment, wherein a person is treated with the opposite sex&#039;s hormones, resulting in a more correct phenotype. Sex reassignment surgery is also another option. Hormone therapy has been shown to account for approximately 90% reduction in the rate of depression among trans people.(http:\/\/www.medscape.com\/vie<wbr>warticle\/827713)<br><br>Being trans has nothing to do with &quot;deciding&quot; to feel some way, or flipping back and forth. Being transsexual is literally the state of being treated for gender dysphoria.<br><br>Thanks for reading. I encourage you to rethink your predispositions about these people, and stop being part of the problem. This is not an ideological or religious issue -- I myself am a straight, married, jewish conservative -- it&#039;s an issue of rejecting accepted medical science.","filename":"for dummies","ext":".jpg","w":396,"h":127,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":80,"tim":1491127546388,"time":1491127546,"md5":"E881dj2uaUbMk76CRLgLqw==","fsize":12333,"resto":0,"id":"sO8pNM8P","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gender-dysphoria-for-dummies","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":119185478,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)06:06:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Important note for readers, gender dysphoria is not a synonym for transgenderism.","time":1491127584,"resto":119185440,"id":"sO8pNM8P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

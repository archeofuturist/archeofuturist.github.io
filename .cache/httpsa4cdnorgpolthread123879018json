I keep finding myself on the apathetic side of this argument. I&#039;m not terrified of dying, it&#039;s a pretty natural thing. I probably wouldn&#039;t ever leave my family with the burden of insatiable debt that is the cost of healthcare in America. I mean I get that people are emotionally attached to people\/scared of dying but why should we essentially make it a huge priority to save everyone we can when at most we as a species amount to termites on the planet?","filename":"CQq8KMdMQB-1","ext":".png","w":300,"h":250,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":208,"tim":1493790774395,"time":1493790774,"md5":"Prf\/VnoxkxA5130wTlorjA==","fsize":20050,"resto":0,"id":"xcBvvN5b","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"question-on-healthcare-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123879160,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:54:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123879018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123879018<\/a><br>Healthcare is a privilege, not a right","time":1493790868,"resto":123879018,"id":"pWbMUDjm","country":"MY","country_name":"Malaysia"},{"no":123879369,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:56:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123879160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123879160<\/a><br><br>I agree, I&#039;m just saying the otherside of the argument treats life as some sort of sacred and important thing.

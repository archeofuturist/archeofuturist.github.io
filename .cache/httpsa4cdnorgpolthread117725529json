I&#039;m no great hunter, but I&#039;ve killed a few white tail, and don&#039;t regret it, except for the one that I gut shot. Hard lesson learned. <br><br>It is important to me that the animals I eat have decent lives and are slaughtered humanely, and I pay more for that when I can (e.g., I only buy free range eggs), but there aren&#039;t always a lot of options. <br><br>If we have to improve livestock conditions in this country to set an example for savages, is there a good argument against that? How much would it cost? Would it wipe out the fast food industry? Would millions starve? You can buy chicken now that is literally put to sleep before it is slaughtered. It supposedly tastes way better. I get that it&#039;s more expensive, but if we had laws mandating that, it would get cheaper because of economies of scale.<br><br>What say you, pol?","filename":"Taiji","ext":".jpg","w":635,"h":421,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1490160621583,"time":1490160621,"md5":"Q+zeKgxGmGKtLMsTrplitA==","fsize":116545,"resto":0,"id":"kX5WPYcC","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"does-anyone-think-there-shouldnt-be-basic","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":117725768,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:33:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"God put animals on earth for our benefit.

A fucked up honor culture.<br><br>The ghetto is kind of like prison. There&#039;s the perception that if you let yourself get fucked with, you&#039;re an acceptable target. No one wants to be the bitch nigga. <br><br>So if there&#039;s the possibility for something to be interpreted as a threat, it gets treated as a threat. You can be all smiles one minute and fighting the next, because you never know where the first punch is going to come from.<br><br>2. Ebonics is a dialect of English. It has its own rules, with its own grammar and aspects. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;I been bought it&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;I done buy it&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;I did buy it&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;I do buy it&quot;<\/span><br><br>All mean slightly different things, and mark the imminency of the action in question. Ebonics is complex enough to mark the difference between something that has been done recently, something that has been done just before being asked, and something that has been done habitually. <br><br>They do use proper grammar, but it&#039;s only proper according to the dialect they speak. It&#039;s more sophisticated than standard American English in many respects, but you can&#039;t write a quantum physics paper with it, and it&#039;s more of a class marker than anything else at this point. Since niggadom is synonymous with poverty or has-been poverty, many don&#039;t want to drop it in exchange for a standard dialect.<br><br>3. Consonant cluster reduction.<br><br>Say the word &quot;cold cuts.&quot;<br><br>Unless you&#039;re anal about diction, you probably said &quot;col&#039; cuts.&quot; That&#039;s because languages have rules about getting to the heart of meaningful phonemes, and that can involve rearranging sounds to make words easier to say. Some consonants get dropped entirely, while others get put in a place where it&#039;s easier to wrap your tongue around it. West African languages err more on the side of consonant cluster reduction, and when you import West African people you get West African languages.","time":1492565628,"resto":121774145,"id":"LXr+pkej","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121779883,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:39:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121778123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121778123<\/a><br><br>You should host an AMA.<br><br>1.

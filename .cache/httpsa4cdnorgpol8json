There are millions of people fleeing war and famine from many middle eastern countries who are in urgent need of refuge. Western nations have the land and resources to shelter these people, and under normal conditions these people would be accepted into our societies. However, many working class people in the West don&#039;t want to let these people in. Why? Many will say that they don&#039;t want refugees because of the economy or because of unemployment and some genuinely feel this way. Others have more prejudice reasons. Racism and Islamophobia to name a few. As much as my heart goes out to the working class of developed nations, they are not in need. The refugees are in need. The way I see it we have a serious moral dilemma here. If we listen to the public: millions will die. The other option is to ignore the public, suspend our constitutions and force the people to let the refugees in. As much as it pains me to say this.

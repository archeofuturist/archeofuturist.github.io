Meetings go well, people like him, and things tend to move in a direction that is good for him.<br><br>Now this could just be The Art of the Deal. And it probably is.<br><br>Xi now moving troops to NK boarder, Putin no real reaction to Syria, now meeting with Tillerson. These two alone are pretty fucking huge wins when and no deals were even made.<br><br>One more thing about Trump, we know he has info we don&#039;t. And now that he is the president he has even more info. The wiener laptop is out there, and whatever other horrible shit, wasn&#039;t trumps uncle FBI, even older pedogate type shit. Anyways point is Trump surely has dirt on these motherfuckers; and we know is clean, they&#039;ve been trying like hell to bring him down, and got nothing.<br><br>Now lets step aside and look at the globalist, the deep state, the shadow government, the Rothschilds, whatever you want to call them. We know they operate on a leverage system, or a mutually assured destruction. Meaning they all got pedo dirt on each other, Or someone has pedo dirt on all of them, should they step out of line then dirt comes out. <br><br>Another assumption to make is the scale of the globalist pedo control network, the cover-up implies grand scale. The type of scale that could cause the world to burn itself to the ground were the whole truth to come out.<br><br>Now if you were like me, and you came across this evidence. And could protect yourself you would use it to gain money at first, then probably power. But what if you weren&#039;t a selfish piece of shit like me and everyone else what would you do?<br><br>Would you release it and cause the world to fall into chaos. Probably not. Would you use it to advance your own position in society and thus provide protection against the world to your family?

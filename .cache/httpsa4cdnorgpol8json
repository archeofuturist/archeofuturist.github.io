President Hollande visited one and, confronted to the criticism the p\u00e9nitentiary personal raised, said prison should only be a place to remove the freedom of moving, nothing more. Being a prison officer is difficult because people are expecting more from you than locking doors.<br><br>I actually agree. We are making things difficult for no reasons. Inmates cause troubles because they are many, can gather most of the day, have various games and hobbies leading to trafficking, hell they even host Periscope streams from their cells... And of course islamisation is everywhere.<br><br>Explain me why we don&#039;t just build individual cells, with just a bed, toilets, a place to eat the meals delivered threw the door and that&#039;s it. Hobbies ? Here&#039;s paper and a pen. I&#039;ll throw in some books and classical music but that&#039;s it. Physical training ? Here&#039;s a metal bar. <br><br>No meeting with other inmates, no &quot;community&quot; time, no frigging group showers, you just don&#039;t see anyone. Prisons should be monasteries, not highschool. What ? You think it&#039;s cruel and the lack of social interraction might destroy them ? Newsflash, nobody ever suicide in solitary, other people is what cause all the problems. Just don&#039;t allow prisonners to see other prisonners. I&#039;m sure it would fix a lot of things and drive the costs down even if you have to build individual cells for everyone.","filename":"tmp_5312-30dd5764-0a6f-11de-9a9e-3609e8d8136a-306074282","ext":".jpg","w":493,"h":277,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490903755001,"time":1490903755,"md5":"ZdTeaQSuziQ7+x3qFu9jyQ==","fsize":23000,"resto":0,"id":"eNFyCHDI","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"theres-something-i-dont-get-about-prison","country_name":"France","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":118961481,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:09:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118959892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118959892<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh human rights<\/span><br>Faggots have taken over and unless a global war happens where every pussies will get butchered, it will be even worse.

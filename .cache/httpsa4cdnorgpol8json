For since they hold it for certain that men destitute of all religious sense are very rarely to be found, they seem to have founded on that belief a hope that the nations, although they differ among themselves in certain religious matters, will without much difficulty come to agree as brethren in professing certain doctrines, which form as it were a common basis of the spiritual life. For which reason conventions, meetings and addresses are frequently arranged by these persons, at which a large number of listeners are present, and at which all without distinction are invited to join in the discussion, both infidels of every kind, and Christians, even those who have unhappily fallen away from Christ or who with obstinacy and pertinacity deny His divine nature and mission. Certainly such attempts can nowise be approved by Catholics, founded as they are on that false opinion which considers all religions to be more or less good and praiseworthy, since they all in different ways manifest and signify that sense which is inborn in us all, and by which we are led to God and to the obedient acknowledgment of His rule. Not only are those who hold this opinion in error and deceived, but also in distorting the idea of true religion they reject it, and little by little. turn aside to naturalism and atheism, as it is called; from which it clearly follows that one who supports those who hold these theories and attempt to realize them, is ALTOGETHER ABANDONING THE DIVINELY REVEALED RELIGION.","time":1492707539,"resto":122002821,"id":"gKtf3Uvc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122014227,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:01:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122002821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122002821<\/a><br><br>Let&#039;s see.<br><br>He said atheists do not have to believe in God to go to heaven.<br><br>He said he cannot judge whether or not homosexuality is a sin.<br><br>He said that Jesus literally turned himself into the serpent, that Jesus literally turned himself into the devil, on the cross.<br><br>Anyone who knows the Holy Spirit knows that He has nothing whatsoever to do with the Catholic church.","time":1492707672,"resto":122002821,"id":"ndNCmsVh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122014387,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:02:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122002821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122002821<\/a><br><br>Oh, and because none of you Catholics do any digging into your own foul organization&#039;s history, you might want to know how intimately involved he was in the murder of thousands of people during a junta in Argentina.","time":1492707764,"resto":122002821,"id":"ndNCmsVh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122014603,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:04:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122014227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122014227<\/a><br>Granted, the media spun some of that.

It&#039;s the top right (north eastern) corner of Hyde Park where, every Sunday morning from about 9am - 1pm, a load of weirdos go to preach random bullshit. Every week the same Muslim preacher is there, there is usually a Christian weirdo, and recently a bunch of MGTOW people and Trump supporters have been standing on stepladders giving speeches.<br><br>The crowd tend to heckle them a lot and there is a lot of &quot;healthy debating&quot; going on.<br><br>The most interesting thing about speakers corner though, is the prevalence of Muslims. There are always dozens of them, moving in packs with video cameras and recording iphones, and they approach you and ask you if you want to debate. They then talk at you endlessly about how rational, sensible and awesome the quran is, all the while filming you and recording all your comebacks and arguments. They try their best to be reasonable. To me it just seems a rather sinister way to appear rational and appealing while trying to convert people, recording their arguments so they can go home and work up a counter.<br><br>So, Britbongs of \/pol\/, I will be at speakers corner this Sunday. If anyone wants to come along that would be great. I&#039;ll be there from 10am, I&#039;ll make myself obvious in some way. At the moment the only thing I can think of is by holding a maroon coloured handkerchief in one of my hands. Either way I&#039;ll post closer to the time (Saturday night\/Sunday morning) to let you know where I&#039;ll be.<br><br>Come one, come all, let&#039;s have a good time.","filename":"speakers corner","ext":".jpg","w":1366,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492707883082,"time":1492707883,"md5":"\/OHXLInLCphOmPRMI6Ye4g==","fsize":213042,"resto":0,"id":"53RgbFMD","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"london-pol-meetup-speakers-corner","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":122014994,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:08:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122014596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122014596<\/a><br>In fact, this is probably a far better way to organise meeting.<br><br>Message me on Telegram (it&#039;s like a better, more anonymous version of whatsapp).

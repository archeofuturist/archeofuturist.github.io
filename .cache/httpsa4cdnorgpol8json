Two brothers of the rapist go to her school, from which she has had to be withdrawn. Now five or six times she has been attacked by the men and their friends in public, at the local shops and around the neighbourhood.<br><br>The most serious attack took place on March 24th, when she was discovered at a bus stop by the brothers. One of them pushed her down, while the other punched her in the mouth. Upon seeing the mother of the boys approaching, Ida told the paper: \u201cI thought she would stop them. But she kicked me\u201d.<br><br>The young girl was admitted to hospital with a head injury and two loose teeth. The police have been notified, but in defiance of the report the girl has been told she will be beaten six more times.<br><br>Now she says \u201cI dare not go outside\u201d, because friends of her rapist will telephone the brothers if they see her in town.<br><br>Speaking to the local paper, the chief of local police has urged the girl to get in touch \u201cas soon as something happens\u201d. He also suggests \u201cit\u2019s good to keep a diary\u201d of incidents should the events ever go to trial.<br><br>Ida had only turned 12 in the same month she was lured back to \u2018Muhammed\u2019s\u2019 flat under false pretences for the first attack. When he had her alone, the man tore off her clothes and held his hand over her mouth while he raped her.

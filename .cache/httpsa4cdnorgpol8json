The contemporary dispute over violence and non-violence in 1960s American politics is said to be irredeemably mired in \u201cideological rhetoric\u201d designed to either halt, slow or hasten change in the existing distribution of power and privilege \u2014 depending on the class position of the observer. Established financial and political interests identify violence squarely as illegal and condemns all challenges to the authority of the state and property rights. Middle-class liberals encourage some illegal dissent and disruption (rent strikes, sit-ins), but only so long as it does not challenge the economic social arrangements on which their success is based. For reactionary white working- class constituencies, \u201cviolence\u201d is any threat from the outclass \u2014 street crime, ghetto riots and civil rights marches. For the Black outclass and its sympathisers within the liberal wing, the application of \u201cviolence\u201d is typically reversed to the police not rioters, employers not strikers etc. \u2014 \u201cthe outclass naturally seeks to legitimise the riots, harrassments, and street crime which are its only weapons. Equally naturally, the rest of society labels such means \u2018violent\u2019 and suppresses them\u201d.<br>Uri Gordon, Anarchism and Political Theory: Contemporary Problems","time":1492983357,"resto":122491854,"id":"F7TvXm1g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122492223,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)17:37:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122491854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122491854<\/a><br>Have a nice day","filename":"die philosophie der macht","ext":".jpg","w":340,"h":510,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492983445661,"time":1492983445,"md5":"KTpO2nhYTeWSe6cdNx6gHg==","fsize":81558,"resto":122491854,"id":"IZPpUiDn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122492566,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)17:39:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122491854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122491854<\/a><br>*in no way","filename":"tumblr_oor9giQYiM1r1i9k6o1_400","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":490,"tn_w":81,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492983579318,"time":1492983579,"md5":"gro786l2WfKIem+amA2yBg==","fsize":175674,"resto":122491854,"id":"F7TvXm1g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122492935,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)17:42:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122492223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122492223<\/a><br>See:<br><a href=\"#p122492566\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122492566<\/a>","filename":"tumblr_oihey1uvIZ1ttrxmxo1_500","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":667,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492983730343,"time":1492983730,"md5":"4NRroCNqnDOQ6\/re0RQXgA==","fsize":156138,"resto":122491854,"id":"F7TvXm1g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

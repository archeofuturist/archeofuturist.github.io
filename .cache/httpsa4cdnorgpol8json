So many RPG gamers are hardcore leftists. Many of them have an &quot;eat the rich&quot; mentality, where they fantasize about living off of welfare and playing RPG games all day. Unemployment is common among gamers- which makes sense, since its very difficult to arrange 5 players around a table for a 6 hour session when they have jobs. <br><br>Communism, socialism, and anti-capitalism are very common among gamers like Varg. I only know about 14 or so people total who play RPG games in my small town- but TWO of them have gone on to become MTF transsexuals, and most of the rest are hardcore leftists, this is very strange behavior. <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=75P<wbr>cK_y0XnI","filename":"1493066404045[1]","ext":".jpg","w":350,"h":350,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493180671384,"time":1493180671,"md5":"7Iy09Cz537iL6L5YfNh\/bw==","fsize":104379,"resto":0,"id":"GXGrHWKm","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"rpg-gamers","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122842166,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)00:24:24","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Hey \/pol\/ what (unintelligible)","com":"What did he mean by this?","filename":"super duper asdfg","ext":".png","w":1159,"h":611,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":131,"tim":1493180664036,"time":1493180664,"md5":"3HkUk76QOxndq9bLVbZ8aw==","fsize":321197,"resto":0,"id":"Dbio98j2","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-pol-what-unintelligible","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":122842556,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)00:28:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122842166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122842166<\/a>","filename":"checkem","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":301,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1493180898322,"time":1493180898,"md5":"KdSG37cdFkgsUYfPdlajOw==","fsize":30459,"resto":122842166,"id":"Dbio98j2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122791800,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:39:50","name":"Anonymous","sub":"MGTOW","com":"let&#039;s see<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;western women are gold digging sluts<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cucked marriage and divorce laws<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;woman can take half your shit and leave with the kids whenever she wants<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;60% divorce rate<\/span><br>Why haven&#039;t you gone MGTOW yet, pol?","filename":"bigdaddy","ext":".jpg","w":3000,"h":1687,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493156390435,"time":1493156390,"md5":"I+0GqAgE30Fra\/9UQHrLKQ==","fsize":386504,"resto":0,"id":"22YiiThn","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mgtow","country_name":"United States","replies":256,"images":32,"omitted_posts":251,"omitted_images":32,"tail_size":50},{"no":122841587,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)00:18:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122841318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122841318<\/a><br>my best friends were black and brazilian growing up but shit, berkley was like a sesame street womans shelter where all the abuse was real through the power of imagination<br><br>did i say i hate berkley and its college students? well you should too.","time":1493180333,"resto":122791800,"id":"AJjyoym1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122841868,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)00:21:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122791800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122791800<\/a><br><br>MGTOW works for these guys because they don&#039;t care that a man without a gf or wife is seen as a creepy weirdo.

The ones built with a large capacitor and 1 big burst are better than small rapid burst ones. Plenty of DIY videos on jewtube. Mine, built using a disposable camera&#039;s flash capacitor, will brick any Android and reset iphones up to 10 ft. It also fucked up my voltmeter from across the room. For obvious reasons, i don&#039;t have footage of it in action and my phone is going nowhere near it (incase of accidental discharge).","filename":"mqdefault","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":180,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493180534796,"time":1493180534,"md5":"ESESoqGCpfP\/3u0jgTDZNg==","fsize":14462,"resto":122837972,"id":"iNlMXjQJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122813154,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)20:23:50","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Mandatory \/POL\/ Viewing : ULTIMATE REDPILL","com":"Elite Dutch Banker Whistleblower Exposes Satanic Child Sacrifices And Names The Jew!<br><br>Full Original Interview : https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nEp<wbr>cY5JU120&amp;index=2&amp;list=<br><br>Basic Gestalt : https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Nag<wbr>Yge8fSJM<br><br>What we learn:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Terrorist Organizations, Secret services, Intelligence agencies, weapons and drug trades are all being operated by the same people on a high level to maintain the illusion of chaos in order to maintain control. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lucifer is real and the elite who control the world worship him through child sacrifices(Connection to pizzagate).

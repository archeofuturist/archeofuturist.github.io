We are losing our traditions and embracing foreign ones which have nothing in common to ours, we are indoctrinated and enslaved in a world where we must obey what is being commanded from Luxembourg. We are working ourselves until exhaustion for minimum wage, yet the taxes and contributions we pay are being misused and are not improving our nation&#039;s healthcare, education, industry and transport system. We instead look at beautiful and useless expensive decorations, pointless architecture being built and events organised, all of these being made by our politicians, things which boost the masses happiness for a few weeks in order to vote them again.","filename":"acvila-romaneasca","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":281,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493499698362,"time":1493499698,"md5":"eqtPheu4AnRvWfw8hptIzw==","fsize":34642,"resto":0,"id":"spnJVL7+","country":"RO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nationalism-in-romania","country_name":"Romania","replies":31,"images":2,"omitted_posts":26,"omitted_images":1},{"no":123388968,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)18:07:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123388792\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123388792<\/a><br>Pretty sad, Codreanu was one of the most based persons I&#039;ve read about.","time":1493503635,"resto":123380949,"id":"yxbD49BX","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":123389070,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)18:08:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123387750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123387750<\/a><br>You are right on this one.

Oh look at that, your alt-right debater just stepped out of bounds short of the argument when they needed to get one. Are you a fucking drunk? Are you retarded? Are you autistic? You are a fucking idiot and you should never make a topic on this board again and I&#039;m fucking serious. I almost have a feeling you&#039;re the only guy making all these anti-Destiny topics because you&#039;re a faggot hater who doesn&#039;t like the guy because he&#039;s good. Fuck you, be good at something in YOUR life and then maybe try to troll these fucking guys on the board, like I give a fuck. It&#039;s so easy to spot out your threads now, you&#039;re a retard. Always doing stupid shit like this. Why don&#039;t you try to be a good poster? Just for once? For once in your fucking life try not to make a topic like this. That&#039;s just you, you&#039;re always right at getting it wrong. Fuck you.

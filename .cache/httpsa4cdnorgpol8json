It is said that &quot;if the Tower of London ravens are lost or fly away, the Crown will fall and Britain with it.&quot; Brexit was the beginning of the end, for Great Britain at least. Already we can see tears at the edge with a new Scotland independence referendum.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A killing bolt will shine in the night, but will not kill<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The rod and the ring will strike<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The bear will leave its cave forever<\/span><br>The killing bolt, despite talk of yesterday, has not yet happened. The hint is in &quot;Shine in the Night&quot;. It will be an EMP, my guess is that NK will launch a nuke that prematurely detonates, leading to no (direct) casualties, but an EMP that will still hit some stuff. The rod and the ring are references to the actual mechanism of detonating a nuclear device. After this, it is not the US, SK or even China that is first to respond. Russia will immediately mobilize its military and invade, and to be honest, they&#039;ll have the support of everyone to some degree. Russia will, however, not demobilize after this.

However, with the death of a Pope, a new one must be elected and I think he shall take upon himself the name Petrus.

I have written a book called The Foundation for Exploration in my spare time (I&#039;m a full-time neet) and I would really appreciate it if you could give it a read.<br><br>-It is pol&#039;s book. It has some very serious and groundbreaking ideas regarding the origins of a lot of emotions that a typical pol user may go through. Wrath, depression, madness, and hedonism all stem from powerlessness. In order to alleviate this powerlessness, you need courage, self-control, wonder, and humor. You also need collective organization because there are deeply entrenched society-wide problems that one man cannot defeat. That is why we need a full-scale revolution of our society. I believe my book can be a cornerstone of a revolution because it has a strong philosophical basis. Pol can be a strong cornerstone of this revolution.<br>-I dive into sexual dynamics in pol-fashion. Men need to cultivate masculinity and not be cucks, yet not be overly animalistic and women must cultivate femininity and not be roastie whores (shouldn&#039;t pursue hedonism and the animalistic nature of man) I go into this in great detail and explain that strong families are the provider of great happiness and power, and they come from a balancing of the two spectrums I call the Power and Animalistic-Artificial Spectrums. <br>-The focus of the brave new society I create is to inspire wonder back into people, with a bringing back to nature and in the end a focus on exploring the cosmos. The economics calls for cooperation between people, superseding the focus on profits and rigid structure.<br><br>WE MUST START A REVOLUTION.<br>This is not an advertisement, the book is free. I will commit seppuku like Yukio Mishima if this thread does not succeed in starting the beginnings of a revolution.","filename":"earth and moon","ext":".jpg","w":984,"h":984,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491272071082,"time":1491272071,"md5":"vlR2UpJgVH3bs0ztXaDYLA==","fsize":203020,"resto":0,"id":"744NH42w","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-foundation-for-exploration","country_name":"United States","replies":34,"images":8,"omitted_posts":29,"omitted_images":6},{"no":119424271,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)23:25:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119416592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119416592<\/a><br>So what proxy are you using?

It&#039;s quite similar to an old slave mentality in that blacks are afraid of not doing what they are told. Just as example, during the high point of American slavery, plantation owners told there slaves that if they left the farm, they would be killed due to the creatures that roamed around the property or they would just fall dead once they run far enough away. The same shit happens today, Democrats using the naivete of blacks and exploiting them to their own ends. Only now, blacks are even less useful now than during that time!

In our neighborhood, we know all the dogs and humans. Nobody does leashes most the time, when there is no traffic. We&#039;re walking and smelling, and some dude come walking up the street. My little protector goes to investigate the guy, and he freaks. Freezes up, while still walking. I&#039;m trying to get my dog on leash, but he keeps doing the autist walk, giving me the cat&#039;s asshole face as I apologize for just a little barking from a little dog. He still sys nothing and I ask if he speaks English. &#039;Dude&#039; goes insane. All up in my face about DOG OFF LEASH. I realize he&#039;s a literal faggot, and tell him I have outed him. He goes even more haywire.<br>Mind you, faggot is about 6&#039;2 and I&#039;m 5&#039;10. He actually gets nose to nose with me and tries to intimidate me. He starts pouring sports drink out in a manic fashion, and I warn him that if a drop hits me, he&#039;s going to sleep on cement tonight. My dog, still unleashed is freaking out. He slightly leans towards my dog and I tell him touching my dog will be his last action.<br>I kept my cool, explained that it was a dog neighborhood and nobody gave a fuck. Explained that he didn&#039;t get to enforce dog law with intimidation. Told him that I realized it wasn&#039;t about the dog, and was about his faggoty ways and identity politics. Acknowledged that it was just a small battle in the culture wars. I finally just walked off. On the way back I apologized to a couple neighbors with these nasty ass pugs. I told them the guy got in my face about dog off leash, and he was homosexual.

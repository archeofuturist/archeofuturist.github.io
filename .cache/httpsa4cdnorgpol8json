Doctrine was preserved in the Scriptures, Hymns, Liturgies, manuscripts, epistles, and sermons. The Church itself, as a whole, preserved knowledge about God (to the extent that humans are capable of understanding). <br><br>However, the Western (or Latin) part of it began to liberalize theologically and ecclesiologically. By the 11th Century AD, the prerogatives of the Pope of Rome were changed to include universal jurisdiction, and the Nicene Creed was modified.

The Reformation was essentially a scholastic movement that sought to establish doctrine exclusively (and in some cases almost exclusively) from the Scriptures. This approach to theology is a redefinition of what the Christian Scriptures are, and furthermore seeks to interpret those Scriptures using purely scholastic and rationalistic methods, devoid of the original context, and the broader Tradition, of which the Scriptures are a part. <br><br>Only the Orthodox Church maintains fidelity to the Apostolic Faith.

Especially if we go a bit authoritarian with compelling preventative care and incentivizing healthy lifestyles with big tax penalties.","filename":"typicaldoctor","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490406626073,"time":1490406626,"md5":"kZqIK9wdU3jXYGIglJb8Og==","fsize":24875,"resto":0,"id":"hqL2Em7S","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"health","country_name":"United States","replies":80,"images":9,"omitted_posts":75,"omitted_images":7},{"no":118184061,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:15:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118183670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118183670<\/a><br><br>Playing devils advocate. &quot;Because trump says so&quot; is all \/pol\/ has","time":1490415319,"resto":118168074,"id":"LEG+JqO2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118184531,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:19:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118182852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118182852<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118182383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118182383<\/a><br>I sit corrected I was mixing up overweight and obese.","time":1490415598,"resto":118168074,"id":"s8WQ8xJe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118184691,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:21:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118184531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118184531<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118182383\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118182383<\/a><br>On a side note I am considered &quot;overweight&quot; by BMI (which is a shit measure) and am a 200lb 6&#039;3&quot; brick shithouse.<br><br>bodyfat % is a better measure.

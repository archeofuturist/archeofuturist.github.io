I never knew he spoke about this until recently. Some of you might call people like this &quot;schizo&quot; but I have been tending to agree with him, of late. Tl;dr this Biblically and spiritually aware man says the female reproductive system looks like Baphomet--which it does--and that this is one of the biggest symbolic traps hidden in unbiblical but popular usage. Enjoy. https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=8ct3T<wbr>xCBjWo<br>To learn more, research &quot;the shekinah hoax&quot;; &quot;Platonic complementarity&quot;; and read this link. Basically. Everything you think you know about your own world view is a bumble of shit and is it &quot;Biblical&quot; and anti-gay? It&#039;s fucking wrong. http:\/\/chapelofsergeandbacchus.blog<wbr>spot.ca\/2009\/02\/what-does-bible-say<wbr>-about-homosexuality.html<br>Gays are not sick. Not any other stretches. Everything is explained above and is only getting better. In every single regard. There are lots of hidden dangers even in biology you know nothing about. You put men down and you know what they say about memes and getting things circulating. Gays are not pimps nor pagan temple hookers and cross dressers. They don&#039;t use female beds either. Get your heads screwed on correctly on all this. The 144,000, the Bible says, are made undefiled solely by their virginity of women. Serpent seed doctrine ties lots into this too. If you wonder where &quot;divine femininity&quot; comes from. Or the many modern examples of the same and how they come about.

The number 182558 is tattooed there in dark-blue ink.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The transport to Auschwitz took two weeks. His sick father died on the journey. Upon arrival, they had to strip and submit to an inspection. Ganon&#039;s mother and five siblings were then sent to the gas chambers.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yitzhak Ganon was taken to the Auschwitz-Birkenau hospital, where Josef Mengele, the so-called &quot;Angel of Death,&quot; conducted grisly experiments on Jewish prisoners.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ganon had to lie down on a table and was tied down. Without any anesthetics, Mengele cut him open and removed his kidney. &quot;I saw the kidney pulsing in his hand and cried like a crazy man,&quot; Ganon says. &quot;I screamed the &#039;Shema Yisrael.&#039; I begged for death, to stop the suffering.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After the &quot;operation,&quot; he had to work in the Auschwitz sewing room without painkillers. Among other things, he had to clean bloody medical instruments. Once, he had to spend the whole night in a bath of ice-cold water because Mengele wanted to &quot;test&quot; his lung function. Altogether, Ganon spent six and a half months in the concentration camp&#039;s hospital.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When they had no more use for him, the Nazis sent him to the gas chamber. He survived only by chance: The gas chamber held only 200 people. Ganon was number 201.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/spiegel.de\/international\/wor<wbr>ld\/a-666327.html","filename":"IMG_1815","ext":".jpg","w":860,"h":602,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":175,"tim":1490057865319,"time":1490057865,"md5":"lCBAn2UZOrzJBF7i8Ov1uw==","fsize":59270,"resto":0,"id":"tQEcypAw","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"his-family-were-gassed-and-his-kidney-was-cut-out","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":277,"images":51,"omitted_posts":272,"omitted_images":51,"tail_size":50},{"no":117604453,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)04:15:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117562553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117562553<\/a><br>fuckin hell we missed one! we need better gas chambers!","time":1490084144,"resto":117562553,"id":"Yd36\/iB6","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117604783,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)04:20:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117596828\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117596828<\/a><br>It happened Annon.","filename":"d20a927603a04fafcf0b6024002feeb5","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490084449149,"time":1490084449,"md5":"\/g5yfvIbpJn0TUQTsQX4Kw==","fsize":25786,"resto":117562553,"id":"ToEaHkXi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117604784,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)04:20:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"if the holocaust never happened... then what is this?<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Posen<wbr>_speeches","time":1490084449,"resto":117562553,"id":"lYo2VqPi","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117605171,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)04:26:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117562553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117562553<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117562860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117562860<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;only 200 in a day when apparently they did thousands a day<\/span><br>What happened, was it Frankfurter Friday?","time":1490084772,"resto":117562553,"id":"ra86Mi2D","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117605475,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)04:31:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117564673\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117564673<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gassing people with the fumes of their incineration relatives and friends<\/span><br><br>Fucking metal","time":1490085079,"resto":117562553,"id":"eNvVOX1A","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117605412,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)04:30:21","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Shit","com":"How many of you faggots have taken one of the health red pills and quit the sugar jew?","filename":"unnamed","ext":".jpg","w":407,"h":361,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":221,"tim":1490085021674,"time":1490085021,"md5":"ffmomD9QTqUgpVPH0INTGw==","fsize":21271,"resto":0,"id":"JKvIQT5f","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"shit","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":117605390,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)04:29:56","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Brexit Negotiations Thread","com":"Okay EU, what do you want?","filename":"1483228999426","ext":".png","w":4220,"h":6460,"tn_w":163,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490084996578,"time":1490084996,"md5":"XJLCZfi9FRKNF7hPLYysJw==","fsize":1139794,"resto":0,"id":"27ue\/kp7","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"brexit-negotiations-thread","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":117601791,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)03:35:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Communism doesn&#039;t wo-...","filename":"china trump","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490081754157,"time":1490081754,"md5":"H7Ui1vZSzGJ2\/tbf9TKLEQ==","fsize":143361,"resto":0,"id":"FgTk73VE","country":"LV","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"communism-doesnt-wo","country_name":"Latvia","replies":23,"images":10,"omitted_posts":18,"omitted_images":9},{"no":117604662,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)04:18:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117604347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117604347<\/a><br>What did that have to do with what I said?","time":1490084339,"resto":117601791,"id":"KeagK8xK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117604759,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)04:20:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117604242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117604242<\/a><br>Are you the same viet chinkposter that I see saying &quot;SINK THE CHINKS&quot; in most every thread? <br><br><a href=\"#p117604347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117604347<\/a><br>m8, regardless of whatever printed name they use, China&#039;s governing body is an oligarchy like most anywhere else on the globe.

No it&#039;s not happening and it will not happen. Trump never gave Meixco this ultimatum, and this tariff bullshit would never get past his own party who are vehemently against protectionism because they work for companies who rely on foreign goods.<br><br>2. Trump is acting like the quintessential republican. He was making concessions to the conservative shills in the freedum caucus before he pulled the bill for fuck sake. They were fighting to bring back prexisting conditions and the rule that allows coverage until age 26. The best we can hope for is for Trump to actually work with democrats to improve the bill, but it&#039;s more likely Trump will pass a draconian plan that lets insurance companies run amok.<br><br>3. Obama was the one that proposed these rules! And no they were not allowed to do this previously. These rules used to be enforced by the another agency but were repealed with the help of republicans. The FCC was meant to take over, but now the republican congress has repealed it and I can almost guarantee Trump will sign it into law. I know that because many of his campaign donors have direct ties to large ISP&#039;s and Trump so far has done everything he can to appease them.<br><br>4. No, you&#039;re just delusional.

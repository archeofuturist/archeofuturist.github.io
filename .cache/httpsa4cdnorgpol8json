Some industries needed to be cleaned up - I&#039;d like as little rat feces in my ground beef as possible. This latest wave of progressivism? A totally different beast. Fostering social unrest. No gender or racial equality - men and whites are to be treated worse. The family unit is outdated, it must be dismantled. Motherhood is discouraged. Work is unnecessary, the state should play the role of provider. No wonder women in their mid-twenties are fucking miserable. Modern progressivism is collapsing society and we&#039;re all suffering.

So with operation Paper Clip the took in a lot of these Nazi scientists and put their research into work for the CIA program MKultra. Monarch is a project of MKultra that deals with breaking someone down mentally and rebuilding them into a different person. Trauma based mind control was the emphasis in this circumstance. The idea behind it was that you could make spies who didn&#039;t even know that they were spies. From what I gathered though, that part didn&#039;t really work, but it probably did help them learn better techniques for less extreme forms of propaganda.","time":1492679888,"resto":121957467,"id":"NE1vj53O","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121973363,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)04:55:07","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Ching chong no ping pong","com":"Why did Japan attack Pearl Harbour? <br><br>What would have been different if they didn&#039;t? <br><br>Would America have joined the war?<br><br>Would the outcome of the war shifted?<br><br>What would Japan look like today if it was never nuked?","filename":"War_flag_of_the_Imperial_Japanese_Army.svg","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":853,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492678507951,"time":1492678507,"md5":"w4iXk+Hi2KL\/UlFrfcIdxg==","fsize":85548,"resto":0,"id":"BhtjKIP4","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ching-chong-no-ping-pong","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":121974744,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)05:15:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"A fucking leaf...","time":1492679713,"resto":121973363,"id":"MyR\/QJ6l","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":121974948,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)05:18:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121973363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121973363<\/a><br>We were fucking with Japan through-out the pacific, enforcing trade sanctions and embargos and blockades for what they were doing in China before Dec 7, 41.","time":1492679887,"resto":121973363,"id":"dGo0lOQV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

Welcome to Celt\/pol\/<br><br>Discuss your culture, traditions and how filthy Anglo-Saxon scum ruined and sullied our lands and stripped us of our native languages and culture.<br><br>Wee bit of history about our peoples:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;From around 750 BC to 12 BC, the Celts were the most powerful people in central and northern Europe. There were many groups (tribes) of Celts, speaking a vaguely common language. The word Celt comes from the Greek word, Keltoi, which means barbarians and is properly pronounced as &quot;Kelt&quot;.<\/span><br><br>A misconception that (((Anglos))) will spam in this thread is that all Celts are just Anglos with a different accent; this couldn&#039;t be further from the truth as almost ALL Celts are ethnically homogeneous excluding mixing from other celtic nations e.g Scotland and Ireland in which admixture between the two is very prominent.<br><br>What nations are Celtic? Contrary to what the Anglo-Saxon savage has taught you, Celtic nations are not exclusive to the British Isles, in fact we are one of the most diverse group of peoples in Western Europe, ranging from Asturias all the way to Breizh. Underneath this text you will find the celtic countries listed to spare confusion.<br><br>- Asturias: Between the regions of Galicia and Cantabria in northern Spain.<br>- Breizh: In Brittany on France\u2019s northwest coast.<br>- Kernow: In the county of Cornwall on England\u2019s west coast.<br>- Galicia\/Northern Portugal: On Iberia\u2019s northwest coast.<br>- Eire: Ireland.<br>- Mannin: The Isle of Man.<br>- Alba: Scotland<br>- Cymru: Wales<br><br>Remember brothers, the anglo has raped our women and pillaged our cities and villages for millennia. Never forget the fallen of our peoples who were sent to die across the world because of a bunch of fugly anglo neckbearded generals who used Scots, Welsh and Irishmen alike as cannon-fodder for their brutal wars against other White European countries.","filename":"1424902586261","ext":".jpg","w":434,"h":567,"tn_w":191,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492269545777,"time":1492269545,"md5":"XNrtT\/Zl\/MtmnGECSTEchg==","fsize":43078,"resto":0,"id":"tOHo3yDV","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"celtpol-brotherhood-edition","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":8,"images":1,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":0},{"no":121220673,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:27:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1492270064,"resto":121219805,"id":"g+NRUfMp","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121220759,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:28:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121220482\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121220482<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cucked by turkroaches before election <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;still vote like cucks <\/span><br><br>pathetic","time":1492270111,"resto":121219805,"id":"tOHo3yDV","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121221283,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:33:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"If I&#039;m pale, have freckles, green eyes and ginger beard, am I celtic?<br><br>I have pitch black hair, but my beard is definitely ginger.","time":1492270403,"resto":121219805,"id":"2cQdVD2X","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":121221360,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:34:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121219805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121219805<\/a><br>Are celtic women worth it?","time":1492270442,"resto":121219805,"id":"6\/FrbPmg","country":"PY","country_name":"Paraguay"},{"no":121223012,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:49:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121221283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121221283<\/a><br>not all celts are redheads, but you may have some celtic blood seeing you are from portugal. <br><br><a href=\"#p121221360\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121221360<\/a><br>only for white people (excluding (((anglos)))","time":1492271375,"resto":121219805,"id":"tOHo3yDV","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121222702,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:46:31","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Oops.....","com":"Hey, Europe... what happened?","filename":"7529840759823407593845","ext":".jpg","w":725,"h":900,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492271191514,"time":1492271191,"md5":"ScsUU3lqTJx8aIEd8ZgBIQ==","fsize":827555,"resto":0,"id":"f78eieXx","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"oops","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":121222920,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:48:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"look at your own country shitcunt","time":1492271312,"resto":121222702,"id":"lQ+a3pC3","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121223066,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:50:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121222920\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121222920<\/a><br>I didn&#039;t say anything about my own country","time":1492271405,"resto":121222702,"id":"f78eieXx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121177268,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)01:54:07","name":"Anonymous","sub":"The Black Mindset \/pol\/ help me understand","com":"There is a short documentary on Youtube<br>Empire of Dust i believe<br>about chinese businessmen investing into the african infrastructure<br>in return for mining rights, etc.<br>Literally the whole documentary is this poor asian man watching his business and materials collapse around him as niggers destroy his business and he just rants in disbelief of their stupidity<br>He is amazed at how previous Dutch investments such as a rail line were utterly left to rot as the people dont seem to understand the value of saving today for tomorrow&#039;s benefit.<br>The movie does a good job of showing the mindset between africans and asians\/westerners (not that they are the same)<br>its just no wonder they are in the shitholes they live in today as american niggers act almost identical, looking for the short buck in exchange of destroying ones city\/life\/country\/people","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1460,"h":913,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1492235647139,"time":1492235647,"md5":"m+MeijpMZFAnocDLumQI1A==","fsize":153427,"resto":0,"id":"4zyrbbJF","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-black-mindset-pol-help-me-understand","country_name":"United States","replies":254,"images":52,"omitted_posts":249,"omitted_images":52,"tail_size":50},{"no":121219545,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:16:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121218976\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121218976<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;We really need to sterilize them<\/span><br>Cheaper to just stop sending them Foreign &quot;Aid&quot;

The US is COMPLETELY run by neocons, Zionists and Jews. Amerifats are Israel&#039;s loyal Zogbots who fight all their wars for them. They bomb every country of Israel&#039;s choosing, with no regard for human lives. <br><br>The Jew controlled US made Germany lose both WW1 and WW2 (yes, by supplying the UK and the Soviet Union) and thus, are to blame for the current migrant crisis. We wouldn&#039;t have been in this mess if it weren&#039;t for the US. <br><br>I sincerely hope North Korea will nuke the lot of you.","filename":"drumpf","ext":".jpg","w":946,"h":798,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":210,"tim":1492263175214,"time":1492263175,"md5":"F5xeOW6PjGvxqS06+G9XaQ==","fsize":94571,"resto":0,"id":"7Gaa0xzP","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"us-hate-thread","country_name":"Sweden","replies":35,"images":14,"omitted_posts":30,"omitted_images":11},{"no":121220693,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:27:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"U mad?","filename":"tumblr_n94m1bKuWF1rjb2r3o1_1280","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":749,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1492270073621,"time":1492270073,"md5":"mwJik8pJzjLjF2WWqny6lw==","fsize":146020,"resto":121210548,"id":"i1lmiyqx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121220944,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:30:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121211736\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121211736<\/a><br>a fucking mutilated dick(ling)","time":1492270218,"resto":121210548,"id":"Ku82fwCm","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121222231,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:42:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121220693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121220693<\/a>","filename":"1488149677234","ext":".png","w":754,"h":495,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1492270938318,"time":1492270938,"md5":"nad1Xn++gjMXREIxN7\/9xw==","fsize":183884,"resto":121210548,"id":"7Gaa0xzP","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121222768,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:47:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why should we have regard for human lives, you socialist","time":1492271221,"resto":121210548,"id":"VABI\/oRb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121222850,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:47:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"i&#039;ve been on the America hate train again since kike lover Trump bombed Assad.

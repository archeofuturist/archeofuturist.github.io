Problem is: all he did was mocking and correcting others. At no point he actually made a clear proposition. For him, being president is more about morality and making decisions but while I kinda agree, you can feel the ideas he defends aren&#039;t exactly his convictions. He play the extreme left because it&#039;s his niche, that&#039;s all.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Fillon<\/span><br>Cold and defensive, he wasn&#039;t happy to be here and used most of his time to shut off anyone mocking him for the affairs. As usual, he was true to his convictions: the future is bleak, we need to make money, let&#039;s destroy public services and sell it to the private sector... except when he has to talk about &quot;urgent&quot; problems like terrorism and promise more public jobs against that while he was the one to reduce them in the first place. That&#039;s one of his true weakness, not the affairs.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Marine LePen<\/span><br>She barely said anything. I think she was too happy to not be the center of all attacks and choosed to be &quot;presidential&quot; by not going all out... but it ended up kinda weak. Her program ended up very social economically, with her defending public services the most (I was surprise by that) and very right-wing socialy (France is Catholic... Melanchon gunned her down for that one).<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Macron<\/span><br>Asselinaut destroyed him with this simple truth: he agrees with everyone. Why ? Because he&#039;ll say anything to get votes and have no convictions whatsoever.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Poutou<\/span><br>He was weird at the start and way too agressive but became a bit more interesting towards the end while discussing better issues.

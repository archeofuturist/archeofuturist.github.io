As the law currently stands if you die at 64, all those social security taxes you pay go poof and no one inherits your benefits. Consider an alternative scenario, where a person was mandated to invest in the stock market (such as S&amp;P500). They would have $500,000 to their name. Now what happens if they die? Their progeny get that $500,000. This can be spent on anything, including further investments. Look at image attached, observe what happens if that $500,000 is put into a high dividend yield ETF. Simply living off the dividends by the age of 80 that $500,000 grows to $3,300,000. What happens when they die now? Their progeny inherits over 3 million dollars.<br><br>Social security is the most regressive policy in the history of America, yet liberals will never admit this nor will leftists. This is because they don&#039;t want the poor to know how much money they&#039;ve been denied all this time. They rather point at the rich as if the rich are the ones who created this abhorrent policy.","time":1492592898,"resto":121824139,"id":"2PjerBE1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121827213,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:51:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bumping for quality thread","time":1492595507,"resto":121824139,"id":"DfARo0cm","country":"CY","country_name":"Cyprus"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121826041,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:35:39","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Holocaust","com":"Thoughts on this?<br><br>https:\/\/www.quora.com\/What-is-the-b<wbr>est-evidence-that-proves-beyond-rea<wbr>sonable-doubt-that-the-Holocaust-oc<wbr>curred<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;From 1945 onwards, thousands of Nazis were captured and hundreds tried for their part in the Holocaust and other crimes against humanity.

Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap among the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.<\/span>","time":1492595137,"resto":121826041,"id":"OJCAUF08","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121826966,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:48:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121826769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121826769<\/a><br>Not related in any capacity other than format, but alright","time":1492595310,"resto":121826041,"id":"J7dgK+3w","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121827199,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:51:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121826966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121826966<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not related in any capacity other than format, but alright<\/span><br>And genre","time":1492595496,"resto":121826041,"id":"OJCAUF08","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121819750,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)03:56:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"What is the \/pol\/est country in the world and why is it BULGARIA ?","filename":"Flag_of_Bulgaria.svg","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1492588572275,"time":1492588572,"md5":"ESkGO7YTH50Qr9vIy8Xwog==","fsize":4170,"resto":0,"id":"Z1Os7VW4","country":"BG","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-is-the-polest-country-in-the-world-and-why","country_name":"Bulgaria","replies":41,"images":17,"omitted_posts":36,"omitted_images":17},{"no":121825455,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:26:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"German cigarettes &quot;Bulgarian hero&quot;","filename":"warGER009","ext":".jpg","w":319,"h":450,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492594001654,"time":1492594001,"md5":"rYEdObm9zS4+IxfO2z\/B3A==","fsize":28714,"resto":121819750,"id":"Z6ZsnZR5","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":121825690,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:30:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121824183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121824183<\/a><br>TRI","time":1492594203,"resto":121819750,"id":"d0Rrm0aF","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":121825879,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:32:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121824600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121824600<\/a><br>Those watermarks ruin it.","filename":"Bulgaria-world-warII","ext":".jpg","w":610,"h":813,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492594379388,"time":1492594379,"md5":"9TD\/tc+mMqHEBV\/U82bPuw==","fsize":88719,"resto":121819750,"id":"q+1OULF6","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":121826014,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:35:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"\/our guy\/ second from top left to right","filename":"4942","ext":".jpg","w":1457,"h":1049,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1492594511604,"time":1492594511,"md5":"iz55Tu6SJFHOfeKdZukxcg==","fsize":632644,"resto":121819750,"id":"Z6ZsnZR5","country":"BG","m_img":1,"country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":121827188,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)05:51:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121819750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121819750<\/a><br><br>Never been to Bulgaria, but had a based friend from there.

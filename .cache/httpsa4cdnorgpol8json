This is not the same as humbling yourself before the almighty, who, according to his own will, can redeem and regenerate your soul.<br><br>From my understanding Zoro teaches that the God of light purges and redeems all those who serve him in the war against the forces of darkness. Admittedly a more difficult case for me to make. One issue is that to the Zoro, God is not one, or almighty. This is because the god of evil\/ darkness is considered his coequal. <br><br>Hence my point stands.

Starting with the question:<br><br>What should be done about gender dysphoria?<br><br>Depending on who you ask there is either no satisfactory treatment or treatment is easy as fuck. As a rule, hot button sociological studies tend to oversample people that confirm their biases. It really can&#039;t be determined for sure which are reliable and how reliable they are. That there are people who experience some sort of dissonance with their physical body is undeniable, however there&#039;s disagreement over causes and the level of concern that should be shown for the matter. However the question seems much more important now than in the past because medical science has advanced to a point where a reasonably feminine male can immitate a female phenotype. Which brings me to the second question.<br><br>What are the ethical implications of trapping?<br><br>It is essentially lying. You&#039;re presenting to propective mates that you&#039;re female and thus have a vagina and in principle procreation is a possibility. Even with full acceptance of physical and social transition this would still be a major issue. A trap will never be a real girl, so perhaps even if they can pass for one, is it unethical for them to even try?<br><br>And finally with ethics comes law. How should the law handle such people? Obviously they&#039;d like to be legally female, but they physically aren&#039;t. What approach should the state take to moderating the interactions of pseudo-females with persons who are unaware of their status? Should the state even take an approach at all?<br><br>What are your thoughts on the matter? As technology improves we&#039;ll only have more and more problems and questions like this in the future, and they&#039;re only going to get more and more strange.

We still look almost entirely the same in terms of bone structure, only under closer examination and measurement will we find slight differences in size and shape. It is nowhere NEAR as significant as birds for example. Why is this so? Why is it that a penguin is significantly different than a pigeon, or a hawk? one glance at two different birds and everything from their diet to color, wingspan, skeletal structure, beak size, head to body ratio, talon size, is immediately visible, not just color and hair texture like in us humans.

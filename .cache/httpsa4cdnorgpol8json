However as we are all aware men are sinful. But Jews have an ego and a pride about them about being selected by God in the covenant of Abraham that they think places them above or outside of having to follow the Laws.<br><br>Of course this was all before Jesus Christ but let me continue.<br><br>The account of the Old Testament is about how the Jews were told to do something a way that God told them to do, and then the Jews would do the wrong thing, or HUGELY the wrong thing. They would marry outside their people, marry pagans, marry people they were told to destroy, worship idols, eat sacrificial meat designed for offering to other gods, rob people, steal, be greedy, be uncharitable, sneaky, oathbreakers, etc.<br><br>They did this over and over and over again until their great homeland was divided in half. And then the half that was saved was divided again. And finally they were destroyed by the Romans. Forcibly removed, and scattered to the winds.<br><br>Jews are the Oathbreakers. They would be the Chosen if they did what they were Chosen to do, but they don&#039;t. Jews have no divine right to rule anything or anywhere. Israel should exist, it wasn&#039;t given to them by God it was stolen by sneakiness and evil and death. Jews plot to destroy the world and deliver it into the hands of the Antichrist because the Antichrist &quot;says&quot; he will give them the world if they just obey, just like Satan tried to tempt Jesus. Except Jesus only follows the will of God and the Jews follow the will of the Jews. And the will of the Jews is that they are above sin and above laws and above everyone else.<br><br>The truth is they are traitors to God and traitors to their own blood and especially traitors to the rest of the world. I&#039;m sure if you can find a Jew loyal to God 1st he would be an ally, and I&#039;m sure some exist but they are rarer than a 24 year old virgin with DD breasts and a pretty smile.","filename":"1465242505269","ext":".jpg","w":444,"h":296,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492023140001,"time":1492023140,"md5":"sr9lFH0NPSJr9xWJawiSkw==","fsize":45495,"resto":0,"id":"iHoTKepC","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"jews-arent-the-chosen-people","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":120791212,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:53:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120791013\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120791013<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Israel should exist<\/span><br>*shouldn&#039;t","time":1492023232,"resto":120791013,"id":"iHoTKepC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120767011,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)11:23:06","name":"Anonymous","sub":"WTF is up with this guy??","com":"I hate using the term &quot;controlled opposition&quot; but is he controlled opposition? <br><br>He&#039;s shilling for TULSI GABBARD a far left berniecrat!","filename":"Spencer","ext":".jpg","w":1053,"h":833,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":197,"tim":1492010586651,"time":1492010586,"md5":"0dyftJrDP2WvxfkL\/fV6kg==","fsize":140071,"resto":0,"id":"1Ae76Mzv","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wtf-is-up-with-this-guy","country_name":"United States","replies":205,"images":26,"omitted_posts":200,"omitted_images":26,"tail_size":50},{"no":120790411,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:47:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120779813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120779813<\/a><br><br>Cripplechan spergs here to shame us for facefagging.<br><br>You&#039;re cowards.","filename":"1490620928126","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":471,"tn_w":79,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492022854966,"time":1492022854,"md5":"8o\/rbaP88VsP2rGN91P27g==","fsize":15636,"resto":120767011,"id":"i5M9BPdT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120790805,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)14:50:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120789748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120789748<\/a><br>It&#039;s really convincing if you reply without making a point.

Recent reports have shown that machine-learning systems are picking up racist and sexist ideas embedded in the language patterns they are fed by human engineers. The idea that machines can be as bigoted as people is an uncomfortable one for anyone who still believes in the moral purity of the digital future, but there\u2019s nothing new or complicated about it. \u201cMachine learning\u201d is a fancy way of saying \u201cfinding patterns in data\u201d. Of course, as Lydia Nicholas, senior researcher at the innovation thinktank Nesta, explains, all this data \u201chas to have been collected in the past, and since society changes, you can end up with patterns that reflect the past. If those patterns are used to make decisions that affect people\u2019s lives you end up with unacceptable discrimination. &quot;<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/comment<wbr>isfree\/2017\/apr\/20\/robots-racist-se<wbr>xist-people-machines-ai-language","filename":"4385","ext":".jpg","w":1240,"h":744,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":150,"tim":1492934453675,"time":1492934453,"md5":"eUhdO9anw9PFJqUoMa71nQ==","fsize":52468,"resto":0,"id":"XSpRhbgo","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"robots-are-racist-and-sexist-just-like-the-people","country_name":"Canada","replies":9,"images":3,"omitted_posts":4,"omitted_images":1},{"no":122398345,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)04:10:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122398186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122398186<\/a><br>Bidet matters","filename":"1492621703291","ext":".jpg","w":901,"h":473,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":65,"tim":1492935003098,"time":1492935003,"md5":"wcWuFGpWps\/q00zkY4kZ5g==","fsize":66918,"resto":122397727,"id":"fupo7XJR","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":122398418,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)04:11:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122397727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122397727<\/a><br><br>wow... people can really be that retarded","time":1492935080,"resto":122397727,"id":"fci+Qi6f","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122398492,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)04:12:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"You guys ever notice how faceapp always tries to remove glasses of whoever you use the &#039;hot&#039; filter on?

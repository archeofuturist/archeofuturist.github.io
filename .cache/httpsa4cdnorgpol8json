A classic example arises from Hans Christian Andersens\u2019 fable of the Emperor\u2019s New Clothes: the fact that the emperor in fact has no clothes is mutual knowledge, but not common knowledge, because everyone (save, eventually, for a small child) is refusing to acknowledge the emperor\u2019s nakedness, thus perpetuating the charade that the emperor is actually wearing some incredibly expensive and special clothing that is only visible to a select few. My own personal favourite example of the distinction comes from the blue-eyed islander puzzle, discussed previously here, here and here on the blog. (By the way, I would ask that any commentary about that puzzle be directed to those blog posts, rather than to the current one.)<br><br>I believe that there is now a real-life instance of this situation in the US presidential election, regarding the following<br><br>Proposition 1. The presumptive nominee of the Republican Party, Donald Trump, is not even remotely qualified to carry out the duties of the presidency of the United States of America.<br><br>Proposition 1 is a statement which I think is approaching the level of mutual knowledge amongst the US population (and probably a large proportion of people following US politics overseas): even many of Trump\u2019s nominal supporters secretly suspect that this proposition is true, even if they are hesitant to say it out loud.","filename":"06d081a74c990871583f69fa892d2252","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":346,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":139,"tim":1490867226854,"time":1490867226,"md5":"BtCBp0yZCHFYP2n6iS0iUg==","fsize":40014,"resto":0,"id":"I7PSbxLf","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"in-logic-there-is-a-subtle-but-important","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":118906351,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)05:49:49","name":"Terence Tao","com":"And there have been many prominent people, from both major parties, that have made the case for Proposition 1: for instance Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee in 2012, did so back in March, and just a few days ago Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic presidential nominee this year, did so in this speech:<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=g_w<wbr>kSGLVpcE<br><br>I highly recommend watching the entirety of the (35 mins or so) speech, followed by the entirety of Trump\u2019s rebuttal.<br><br>However, even if Proposition 1 is approaching the status of \u201cmutual knowledge\u201d, it does not yet seem to be close to the status of \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d: one may secretly believe that Trump cannot be considered as a serious candidate for the US presidency, but must continue to entertain this possibility, because they feel that others around them, or in politics or the media, appear to be doing so. To reconcile these views can require taking on some implausible hypotheses that are not otherwise supported by any evidence, such as the hypothesis that Trump\u2019s displays of policy ignorance, pettiness, and other clearly unpresidential behaviour are merely \u201cfor show\u201d, and that behind this facade there is actually a competent and qualified presidential candidate; much like the emperor\u2019s new clothes, this alleged competence is supposedly only visible to a select few. And so the charade continues. <br><br>I feel that it is time for the charade to end: Trump is unfit to be president, and everybody knows it.

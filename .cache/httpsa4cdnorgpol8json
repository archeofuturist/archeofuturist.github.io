Man is to use His testosterone to make quick decisions. Be witty. A stall in the brain is a stall to our purpose. Each hair grown on thy face is a step closer to Kingdom. Each muscle fiber torn and regrown reminds us of the magnificent human body. However, God\u2019s stance on Pride still stands. It shall always stand. All of Man\u2019s accomplishments is possible through God\u2019s generous gift to Man: Testosterone. Thou shall not shave his arms or legs. Thou shall not shave his chest. Thou shall not have any purposeful resemblance of Woman. Do not be afraid of the effects of testosterone. Without testosterone, a Man would not be a Man. It is impossible for Man to exist without testosterone. We must obey God\u2019s vision.<br><br>II Authority: It is a shame for Woman to rule over Man. Hear me out, my Brothers, it is a shame for Woman to tell Man what to do. It is a shame for Woman to have any authority over Man. At home, in public, at the church, or in the work place. It is an absolute travesty for Woman to rule over Man. If Woman attempts to give you orders, you shall tell her to \u201cPlease, be silent\u201d. If Woman persists her orders, you shall ghostly count to 10. If Woman has yet to become silent, you shall smite her across thy buttocks. Woman relaying information or speaking to Man in casual terms is welcomed. Enjoy the Woman. Do not summon unnecessary harm upon her. She is to be adored. She is to be kept under a Man\u2019s authority.

The Bible tells us when Woman has started puberty, Woman is ready. No \u201cage of consent\u201d is provided. We must abide God\u2019s word and follow His instructions. Woman is to obey and submit to Man. Woman shall not reject Man on any physical attribute Man does or does not possess. If Woman rejects Man for His appearance, He shall smite her across the jawline. Evil acts upon Man prevents the relationship and marriage. God wants Man and Woman to be together. As one in the flesh. Man is to care and protect Woman. Woman is to obey and serve Man. Cursed is the Woman who judges Man on his physical appearance. Her blood will be upon her. When the light is upon us, Woman will be at Home cleaning, cooking, and nurturing the Children.

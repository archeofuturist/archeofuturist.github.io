Reality simply ends. All of you memories and thoughts and emotions are just a complex cell structure that makes up your brain tissue which is filled with electrical currents used for communication between different structures and areas of the brain. To a certain extent it is hardwired for survival, which is why you feel pain or hunger or tiredness. Basic emotions like anger and fear have evolved and expanded into higher emotions such as love and happiness because they are beneficial to a healthy society, which ensures the survival and advancement of our species. People think there is a god or a higher power almost everywhere in the world not because it exists, but because we are hardwired to follow a natural hierarchy, like a pack of wolves. We&#039;ve reached a point in our own evolution where we see how imperfect and flawed other people are, so the easy solution is to invent and invisible savior that is perfect. There is no perfection and no afterlife. We are unique in that we have a capacity for self awareness that other life forms simply don&#039;t have, but said self awareness is underdeveloped in many still today. <br><br>Basically, when you die your body shuts down and you simply cease to exist. After death there is no more emotion or thought, not even a blackness as some have said. You just become nothing. <br><br>This however does not mean that our existence is meaningless. We can still explore the universe and do great things. Just remember that you&#039;re not doing these good things for the glory of a god, but rather to secure an easier and more enjoyable future for our children, our children&#039;s children, and all who come after them.

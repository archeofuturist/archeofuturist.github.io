The opposition documents further state that Cernovich\u2019s motion to unseal mirrored earlier motions to unseal filed by celebrity attorney and close personal friend Alan Dershowitz\u2013 who is also named as being involved with Epstein\u2019s sex ring\u2013 and that Cernovich is acting as Dershowitz\u2019s proxy. They also noted how Cernovich has been a pro-rape advocate, often using rhetoric favoring the targeting of rape victims, as well as Cernovich\u2019s relationship with Dershowitz, most notably Dershowitz\u2019s appearance in Cernovich\u2019s movie \u201cSilenced\u201d.<\/span>","filename":"cernovich","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492317835254,"time":1492317835,"md5":"n03Ks4AzjbBCVdo23OWfMA==","fsize":50743,"resto":0,"id":"8Grqip9w","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-is-mike-cernovich-helping-jeffrey-epstien","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":121317997,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)00:44:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/overthrowdotcom.com\/2017\/0<wbr>3\/07\/mike-cernovich-alan-dershowitz<wbr>-and-the-jeffery-epstein-underage-s<wbr>ex-trafficking-case\/<\/span>","time":1492317899,"resto":121317884,"id":"8Grqip9w","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121302930,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)22:32:18","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Nork missile failure","com":"I wonder what happens to the people who are responsible for the missile failure?

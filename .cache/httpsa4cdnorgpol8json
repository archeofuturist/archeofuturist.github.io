Christianity can&#039;t compete, though it&#039;s second best overall. Christians have to rely on God for their salvation and generally can&#039;t do much on their own besides follow the teachings and be good people. Buddhists can directly, intentionally make themselves into good people, and go far beyond that, either by themselves, with the help of fellow Buddhists, or with the help of deified Buddhas if you&#039;re into those kinds of beliefs.<br><br>Buddhism solves all your problems and gives you full control and understanding if your mind, which is after all what determines whether you sin or not, and whether you have a good life or not. Why bother with any other religion, or with atheism? Fite me unbelievers<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 you are the worst kind of religious hipster<\/span><br>I don&#039;t associate with other Buddhists except online. The religion is good enough to make me put up with being in an easily hateable social group, having people assume I have bad motivations, and not getting to feel good by being part of a more popular group.","filename":"IMG_0111","ext":".jpg","w":1834,"h":1716,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":233,"tim":1491754872293,"time":1491754872,"md5":"7WtlCbRP6rv6QAq7K3Dutg==","fsize":748294,"resto":0,"id":"8oTzcmJE","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"buddhism-is-the-best-religion","country_name":"United States","replies":265,"images":26,"omitted_posts":260,"omitted_images":25,"tail_size":50},{"no":120342830,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:48:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120342296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120342296<\/a><br>What if Gutei was a member of ISIS?","filename":"tmp_3731-Gutei-crop1983427760","ext":".jpg","w":176,"h":664,"tn_w":33,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491774512341,"time":1491774512,"md5":"dDiV5J37lEIA8anJCBzQfw==","fsize":77102,"resto":120299923,"id":"V4f\/67S+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120344237,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:59:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120318622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120318622<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120318737\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120318737<\/a><br><br>Haha wow what a bunch of faggots.

Buddha in Sanskrit is like an adjective (a past passive participle) but in Chinese, &quot;fo&quot; has no set grammatical category. You see it in stuff like foshuo (uttered by the buddha), fojing (scriptures of buddhism), foxin (buddha mind, meaning mind that is in consonance with the meaning of the teaching as transmitted especially by Mahakasyapa which he received from the Buddha silently), and also just fojiao, the teaching of the buddhism or the buddhist tradition. There&#039;s also fo that means the Buddha as a god or pervading quasi-supra-deity (for some people) and fo that means an eternal principle of awakening or awareness. Actually there are three different literal translations of what &quot;buddha&quot; means, jue (awareness), wu (realization), and zhi (knowledge), but to Chinese the word fo is more like a proper noun...but it&#039;s really hard to say specifically since it&#039;s very fluid. But it pretty much means exactly what we do in english with any word that has &quot;buddha&quot; in it. I feel like I haven&#039;t actually said anything here. <br><br>The really interesting question to me is what the word Zen means.

They were mostly Jew merchants in the coastal cities, so no communism there. During the mandate more moved in, but the migration didn&#039;t really start until 1945. One big problem was that none of the kikes knew how to farm so they all piled into the coastal cities and tried to become merchants. Kibbutzim were formed because the cities were full of kike merchants and they had to get the newly arrived helpless fucks out of the cities and take control of the countryside from the goatfucking Arab savages. The kibbutzim were never self-sustaining and in the 1970s, after the initial need for them was over, the Israeli government stopped subsidizing them and they all succumbed to bankruptcy. They are pretty much just regular towns now.","time":1491885431,"resto":120545648,"id":"F1PbN15X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120554403,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:44:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"Never met someone who openly supports socialism\/communism, but for those of you who have, have you ever asked them what they think their role would be in this type of society?","time":1491885859,"resto":120545648,"id":"+G2\/4H7L","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120556235,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)01:00:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120545648\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120545648<\/a><br><br>socialism can work if its only one high iq tribe involved","time":1491886832,"resto":120545648,"id":"r8hz2H+z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120552095,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:24:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"meme ball thread","filename":"1488772129756","ext":".jpg","w":690,"h":505,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":182,"tim":1491884698159,"time":1491884698,"md5":"D5n72tJxVCsbGxaZsPNBVQ==","fsize":40583,"resto":0,"id":"70RdULi+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"meme-ball-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":30,"images":14,"omitted_posts":25,"omitted_images":9},{"no":120555363,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:52:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120552095\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120552095<\/a><br>Polandball or Memeball?","filename":"When Spain Blandas Up","ext":".png","w":394,"h":1920,"tn_w":25,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491886363072,"time":1491886363,"md5":"2jU6u6FgCtOcPEszDtyUUw==","fsize":249212,"resto":120552095,"id":"2nO+rm05","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120555464,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:53:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120554663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120554663<\/a><br>Gee, thanks for the eye opener, \/leftypol\/.","filename":"1420874895018","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":228,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1491886419498,"time":1491886419,"md5":"GsTxrkCW3upA64uuSpV3gQ==","fsize":23810,"resto":120552095,"id":"kiceVJXq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120555533,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:54:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120552095\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120552095<\/a><br>Quit playing.

There\u2019s a problem, though: It might not help. Research suggests that most people don\u2019t choose lighter meals after seeing calorie information on menus. Many consumers don\u2019t even notice it.<br><br>Restaurants, meanwhile, have learned to game the system, highlighting their lowest-calorie options \u2014 like salads without dressing \u2014 to improve their numbers.

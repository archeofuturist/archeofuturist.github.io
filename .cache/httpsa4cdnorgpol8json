Those groups also anly care about money so highschool to the end of college attendance was basically like speed dating and the only factor that mattered was how much money you have. Total scum. The one Baptist church even wanted to see pay stubs to calculate how much I had to give and membership was based on it.<br><br>The one place is rather famous, First Baptist of Orlando, anything but the early service is now a blasphemous lame ass rock concert with an auditorium half full of brown people. Most church activities are outreach to the community which just equates to white members giving shit to families in need, as if mybheavy taxes and tithing aren&#039;t enough already. Tithing mostly goes into paying rich leaders, upkeep on the building, and African Missions focused on bringing them food.<br><br>I hate to be selfish but what&#039;s in it for me? Or on a larger scale, my entire people, family, or country?<br><br>Why do we never sing hymns anymore? Or use that giant Organ? It&#039;s one of the largest in the world in a perfect natural amphitheater designed for it. The place should operate like a concert hall like it was designed for. We used to have a symphony and orchestra. Events included classical music recitals by the school&#039;s music students. Such things are now a distant memory. For the first time a few months ago they had something called a slam poem event. I went because poetry sounded like the classiest thing they were doing lately and I wanted to support it.<br><br>It was like a foreign country, half of it I couldn&#039;t understand, it was like ghetto rap without music.

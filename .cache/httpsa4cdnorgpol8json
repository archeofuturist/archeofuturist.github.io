No. I also recognize the ongoing problem of systemic oppression stemming from the loophole in the thirteenth amendment that encouraged the mass incarceration we have today that has utterly transformed them from slaves into criminals. Since slaves were free, the south had to criminalize them to keep its economy afloat, and that mode of exploitation has continued on in various shape-shifted forms since. In the post-Civil Rights era, those in power have been repeatedly caught admitting their intentions to target black people by changing their wording to be less direct, and thus more effective, when addressing the public.<br><br>The politicians, corporations, and the whole prison industrial system love black prisoners, easy targets, because they love money, so the politicians and corporations work together to come up with laws to give them even more reasons to incarcerate those people.

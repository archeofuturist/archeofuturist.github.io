Based on an advanced copy of America\u2019s budget for the 2017 financial year, it looks like there has been an actual increase in science funding across the board, and rather wonderfully, Trump\u2019s requests to have it cut have been comprehensively ignored.<br><br>Former President Obama signed off on the 2017 budget last year, but it overlapped with the ascension of the Trump administration and a resurgent GOP-controlled Congress. The Trump administration is one of the most anti-scientific governments ever to be in power in the US, and the president himself has committed himself to draconian cuts to science funding, particularly health and geosciences.<br><br>The threat of Trump\u2019s 2018 budget remains real, but his influence over the 2017 budget haunted plenty of scientists and academics across the country. Any spending bill has to be approved by Congress, however, and it seems that this time, bipartisan agreement between Democrats and (some) Republicans have produced a bill that\u2019s surprisingly pro-science.","filename":"extra_large-1493649458-cover-image","ext":".jpg","w":1100,"h":619,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493678326273,"time":1493678326,"md5":"Vgbm95no5Hg\/wHrXPyoLUw==","fsize":49183,"resto":0,"id":"CFwgc13F","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"congress-just-ignored-trump-and-boosted-americas","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":123684402,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:36:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Tell me about the pope.

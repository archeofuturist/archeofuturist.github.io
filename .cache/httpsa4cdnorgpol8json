Before &quot;open society&quot; initiatives they didn&#039;t refer to themselves at all. They were only referred to as spies, spooks, etc.. So you have to understand that with such label they imply that they are the ones that are intelligent while the rest of humans are the planet of the apes. So such project as SETI search for intelligent life is another joke on your expense - it&#039;s a spyware monitoring tool trying to see if any of those apes have any intelligence to use these powerful computers in more ways than banging randomly on keyboard. <br>But don&#039;t make mistake that this community &quot;exists&quot; as implied. Notice they are not exactly a community if they can&#039;t secure even their own operations dedicating new institutions to manage &quot;threatening&quot; &quot;insiders&quot;.

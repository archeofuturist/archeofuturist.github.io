But although the actor\u2019s assistant knew that the footage showed White last entered the home on Sept. 24, and had not left for more than a day, neither Carrey nor the assistant called police, according to Burton\u2019s complaint.<br><br>After White\u2019s death, Carrey engaged in a \u201ccharade\u201d by offering to pay her funeral expenses so as to portray himself as a \u201cgrieving good guy\u201d as opposed to \u201cthe individual who had illegally obtained and provided the drugs that killed White,\u201d according to Burton\u2019s complaint.<br><br>In reality, Carrey \u201cnever paid a dime of funeral expenses,\u201d the Burton suit alleges.<br><br>https:\/\/www.scribd.com\/document\/599<wbr>19163\/ALEC-Drug-Dealer-Liability-Ac<wbr>t","filename":"pills","ext":".jpg","w":3072,"h":2304,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492186515797,"time":1492186515,"md5":"oFvk2CPTJN7sSrzlCTlbjw==","fsize":1377162,"resto":0,"id":"BKihyQsZ","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"drug-dealer-liability-act","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":1,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":121078671,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:19:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121078217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121078217<\/a><br>bump","time":1492186740,"resto":121078217,"id":"KRpUaLPR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121078676,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:19:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121078217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121078217<\/a><br>Don&#039;t agree, drug consumption is the responsibility of the user, not the supplier.<br><br>Do we hold off-licenses liable if some kid purchases alcohol with a fake id and dies of alcohol poisoning, no.<br><br>Also, it&#039;s the responsibility of the user to decide what drugs to take and how much of those drugs to take, they&#039;re not mindless zombies, most druggies are smart cunts.<br><br>So no, I don&#039;t agree with this law at all, it&#039;s just a way for butthurt moms to get money out of their good boys deaths.","filename":"Mushroom_Concept_Art","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1492186745177,"time":1492186745,"md5":"\/Q7Mp6pksDoEuo0Fqfk4pQ==","fsize":68662,"resto":121078217,"id":"bs++7xaC","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121080258,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:33:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121078217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121078217<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The purpose of this Act is to provide a civil remedy for damages to persons in a community injured as a result of illegal drug use. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; These persons include parents, employers,insurers, governmental entities, and others who pay for drug treatment or employee assistance programs, as well as infants injured as a result of exposure to drugs in utero (\u201cdrug babies\u201d). <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The Act will enable them to recover damages from those persons in the community who have joined the illegal drug market. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; A further purpose of the Act is to shift, to the extent possible, the cost of the damage caused by the existence of the illegal drug market in a community to those who illegally profit from that market. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The further purpose of the Act is to establish the prospect of substantial monetary loss as a deterrent to those who have not yet entered into the illegal drug distribution market. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The further purpose is to establish an incentive for drug users to identify and seek payment for their own drug treatment from those dealers who have sold drugs to the user in the past.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; illegal drug distribution market<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; illegal drug distribution market<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; illegal drug distribution market<\/span><br><br>Dunno how that can be applied to this specific case.

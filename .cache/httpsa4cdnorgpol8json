I personally think this is a bit of hyperbole on the pro cannabis side; There&#039;s just nothing conclusive. Part of this problem stems from the fact that marijuana is still labeled as a class 1 narcotic; it&#039;s on the same level as heroin, and there are so many unreasonable hoops to jump through to test cannabis&#039; efficacy in treating various diseases.<br><br>It&#039;s possible that marijuana can be used, just like heroin or meth, to create powerful, helpful drugs, used to treat all manner of conditions. if only regulations would relax and allow for proper study.<br><br>As for teen use, I think it would be ideal for the human brain to completely develop before introducing mind altering substances to it. Despite the arbitrary age of adulthood in USA, human brains don&#039;t stop developing at that point. Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but the female brain is considered mature around 21, the male around 27. I&#039;m not saying drug use will positively or negatively affect the brain, but I think drug use, especially heavy drug use, will alter the brain chemistry, and therefore thought patterns, significantly.<br><br>I personally have never felt addicted to smoking weed. Sometimes I crave it, so I&#039;ll buy it, smoke till I run out, and then not think about it for months, or years. But it does make certain menial tasks more enjoyable.<br><br>For example: I can only play video games for an hour, two at the most. If I smoke I can spend an entire weekend playing a game. If I sit down to smoke while gaming, that is usually the result. However, if I smoke and decide to clean my apartment, I can spend the whole day cleaning and literally rearranging everything down to the inside of drawers and the pens inside my pen cup.<br><br>Maybe it depends on the mindset you go into it with.","filename":"1462759219877","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":800,"tn_w":78,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492403775338,"time":1492403775,"md5":"catA2Ym9u0xP4jxg0R08Fg==","fsize":1946671,"resto":121468851,"id":"zvDPZqcw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121480352,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:40:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121478552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121478552<\/a><br>You are correct it does mess with your sleep especially if you used 2-3 hours before sleeping.

For the record I live in SoCal so I know things are pretty bad here but, and advice? I hate feeling so &quot;boxed&quot; in, like I have to hide all my feelings and opinions from the world.","filename":"gggg","ext":".jpg","w":460,"h":287,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":155,"tim":1490929310260,"time":1490929310,"md5":"78ZOh4WcalXUIsniBbczrg==","fsize":39092,"resto":0,"id":"OCPXVvYT","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"anyone-else-feel-angry-all-the-time-ever-since","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1},{"no":119010773,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:03:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119010662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119010662<\/a><br>Try this. <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lmG<wbr>qG3grTrg","filename":"Screenshot_183","ext":".png","w":1283,"h":883,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1490929380536,"time":1490929380,"md5":"tcjYrY3oMhnCr5V87\/CnWA==","fsize":1599183,"resto":119010662,"id":"Te3Ps0I2","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119011022,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:05:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"we are in the end of the world<br>this is my opinion<br>its just too much to grasp and put in one post what the HELL is going on in this world<br>be safe, and may you be filled with grace","time":1490929531,"resto":119010662,"id":"nDJJvqSO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119011166,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:06:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119010773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119010773<\/a><br>fugg that is one of my favorites, however whenever I watch I am just filled with sadness that no one else sees him for the hero he was.","time":1490929609,"resto":119010662,"id":"OCPXVvYT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119011192,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:07:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119011022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119011022<\/a><br>Checked and thanks, I appreciate the kind words.","time":1490929630,"resto":119010662,"id":"OCPXVvYT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119010945,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)23:04:40","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Not shilling here.

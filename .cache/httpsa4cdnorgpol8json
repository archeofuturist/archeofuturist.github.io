Darker climates have a light bottleneck. <br><br>So the LT populations of N Europe, N India, Africa, and the Arabian peninsula evolved to favor a carbohydrate metabolism over hunting. One thing this proves is that a carb metabolism is superior to fat metabolism, so keto BTFO get fucked dumb paleo cucks. <br><br>HOWEVER, one thing that is overlooked is that yogurt has carbs, despite being fermented. Something like 75% of the original lactose remains in yogurt. Yogurt is also tolerated by lactose INTOLERANTS. Thus, it&#039;s probably the bacteria-cleaved lactose split into its glucose and galactose constituents, causing no problem for the intolerants. <br><br>But this brings up another question: if yogurt has sugar, how the fuck did LT evolve? Drinking milk would not give you a carb advantage. It has no natural vitamin D. Dairy can be eaten by intolerants in the form of yogurt and cheeses. <br><br>There is literally NO immediately logical reason for lactose tolerance to have evolved. Vitamin D is bunk. Calcium is bunk. Potable water is bunk. All these things are achievable through fermentation and very primitive cheesemaking. <br><br>I believe it&#039;s probable that there was a sort of systemic &quot;neoteny&quot; that was selected for in these populations, and that LT was just a side effect of that. Pastoralism is a unique lifestyle - it combines low density communities with high food availability. Civilization has high density with food, and paleos have low density without food availability.","filename":"milch","ext":".jpg","w":2218,"h":2216,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490595866815,"time":1490595866,"md5":"Q1FSo80CIkHjVVmY+uaNGA==","fsize":798782,"resto":0,"id":"XGKyeeF6","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"problems-with-lactose-tolerance","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":3,"omitted_posts":9,"omitted_images":2},{"no":118485929,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)03:19:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"and you may have something with your neoteny theory.

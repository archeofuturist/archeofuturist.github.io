God is to me truth, justice, and freedom all united into one. and i believe in God because i know that without the idea of the one, then things like justice have no meaning. if everything is not tied together, and there is no eternal, then why not be a degenerate, make money and fuck whores? but i can&#039;t do that - for better or worse. so despite the little proof of freedom and justice i see in the world, i still live for them.

Moreover, even if Christ did not have such powers, he was still a good man, who changed the world for the better. finally, although i say that God is my love for these things, this love acts upon me (it comes out of nowhere as conscience does). moreover, it is also a love for order and truth, which does not exclude hierarchy, natural inequality, violence against degenerates (Deus vult!), etc. maybe this helps.","time":1493614848,"resto":123556566,"id":"9Ln0Xp78","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123579474,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)00:44:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"\/pol\/ Can Sinead be trusted?

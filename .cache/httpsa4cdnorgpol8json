That morning the vehicles of the delinquents entered the ranch and stood in front of the house. The assassins descended, fired a blast into the air and exclaimed that they would seize the ranch. Garza Tamez responded by shots and the armed group responded against the house. The thieves increased the attack and went from the long arms to the hand grenades .

I heard my dad and his friend talking outside and I managed to overhear a little bit what they were saying. I am typing this on my phone but in order for this to not be the length of a short story I am going to condense it into a easy to understand paragraph Of text. You don&#039;t have to trust me but it&#039;s not my problem.: &quot;I can&quot;t believe &quot;we&quot; got them to vote for Trump, this is almost too easy, just make one side have an extremely unfavorable candidate (hillray), have the buddies at HQ (who control the media) to all put out that say said unfavourable candidate is going to win and get everybody to side with an underdog. (Said underdog is simply a distant family member who doesn&#039;t have any connections to us - fill said role of underdog. Get them emotionally attached then cut the draw bridges and let the underdog win. People will be so enthralled that they lose their revolutionary spirit even if things stay the same. It&#039;s the same thing with the Arab &quot;migrants&quot;, bring a few in them introduce the underdog to make it to away, and because their candidate won any legitimate people coming out with voters fraud leaks wil just be labeled an angry leftist. They will also have the people on the leftist media purposefully do a poor job acting on television saying that the votes where rigged in favour of trump (they were) but as I said It delegitimizes any real leakers, and that guy Seth rich?, he&#039;s just a guy who was offered an extremely high amount of money to play as a &quot;leaker&quot; and move to Israel with a new identity. I am not trying to perpetrate the stereotype but seriously you guys are dumb as rocks. Also we made a deal with the Arabs to support their colonization campaign in Europe if they would leave Jews alone","filename":". .","ext":".jpg","w":279,"h":207,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":185,"tim":1490592415471,"time":1490592415,"md5":"KcbWGMgQPJ+ROx1vrbyRSw==","fsize":8729,"resto":0,"id":"kn\/jrJnd","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-am-a-young-man-born-in-a-semirich-jew-family-in","country_name":"Canada","replies":4,"images":1},{"no":118476751,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)01:28:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"Cool LARP bro. 10\/10<br><br>Herbed","time":1490592531,"resto":118476595,"id":"H\/p9sJly","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118476952,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)01:31:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118476595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118476595<\/a><br><br>Fucking Canadians","filename":"image","ext":".png","w":768,"h":1024,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490592669098,"time":1490592669,"md5":"wqxXNXqUAFkoZ8wwbhRUHw==","fsize":1404131,"resto":118476595,"id":"RMP0CZ07","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118477128,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)01:32:59","name":"Joshua T","com":"I don&#039;t have proof but it looks the same way for this website, the &quot;CTR&quot; people just put out alt right garbage and everyone here eats it up, they have also conditioned the normal users to call anyone with decenting opinion (differentiating from the norm) shills or their &quot;stereotypical&quot; word for their name.

Some people are out to lose, and the more people they can take with them, the better.

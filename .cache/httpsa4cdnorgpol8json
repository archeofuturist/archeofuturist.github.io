The nationalists rarely have a platform to engage in violent acts. Antifa is being used because they are young and idealistic and easily manipulated. They are searching for an authentic experience. So Soros or whom ever has sent them on a path and they will continue to become more aggressive ,dragging out the aryans who are delighted at the idea of engaging in violent political conflict with kids from the suburbs.

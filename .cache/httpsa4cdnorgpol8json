The term refers to the situation of temporal, historical, and ontological disjunction in which the apparent presence of being is replaced by an absent or deferred non-origin, represented by &quot;the figure of the ghost as that which is neither present, nor absent, neither dead nor alive.&quot;[1] <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the 2000s, the term was taken up by critics in reference to paradoxes found in postmodernity, particularly contemporary culture&#039;s persistent recycling of retro aesthetics and old social forms.[2] Critics such as Mark Fisher and Simon Reynolds have used the term to describe art preoccupied with this temporal disjunction and defined by a &quot;nostalgia for lost futures&quot;.<\/span><br><br>Are we moody becuase we know the brightest days are behind

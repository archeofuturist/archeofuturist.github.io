He followed the works of Blavatsky, a Russian witch with connections to Alister Crowley.

Despite all the wrong happening in Germany now, focus on your relationship with YHWH, your Creator. That is what will save you brother. Torah (the ministry of Jesus), is the way to becoming the new man. But don&#039;t ask the Jews about how they interpret Torah - for they are blind guides and hypocrites.

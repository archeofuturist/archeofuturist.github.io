As a matter of fact it is described as a stateless society run by workers, sort of a collective direct democracy. Of course this has never been achieved and outside of the Anarchist experiment in Spanish Catalonia during the civil war never even attempted. Still the original attempts at Communism were far too simplistic and vague, so I &quot;altered&quot; them. As a distinction should really be made between Marxism and Marxism-Leninism, I realize that most communists see Leninism as being the practical application of Marxism, but not all communists do. Examples being Left communism, Luxemburgism, etc. and of course governments led by Marxists that have supported political openness.

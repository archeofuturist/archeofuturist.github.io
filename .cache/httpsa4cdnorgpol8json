The psyop comes from the same forces that destroy humanity. This is what Christian theology calls Lucifer. Whether or not its a literal entity or a metaphor doesn&#039;t actually matter because the end result is the same. Humans arrogantly believe that they can create their own path to truth without tapping into the collective unconsciousness. The fall of Lucifer is basically about humans separting fron God and going their own way due to arrogance. <br><br>Athiests like to pretend that they only believe in perfect rationality and evidence and such. But in reality they also have a system of faith. If you require hard proof for literally everything you believe in, you ultimately create a belief system with impossibly high standards of proof because its impossible to explore literally infinite scenarios with infinite variables. So atheists have to create a different way divide the labor of discovering truth. People of faith tap into the collective unconsciousness for things they don&#039;t understand while atheists replace faith in the collective unconsciousness with faith in an endlessly complicated system of (((experts))). Rather than search internally for intangible answers they just refer to the &quot;offical&quot; truth. The system that created the official truth (scientists, academia, media, etc.) is ultimately created by flawed humans so it can&#039;t possibly grasp the same fundamental truth that is encoded perfectly in the collective unconsciousness.","time":1491772415,"resto":120286740,"id":"76kgfVi6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120338130,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:14:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120337318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120337318<\/a><br>pic related<br><br><a href=\"#p120337771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120337771<\/a><br>probably. that probably also the holy spirit the bible mentions.","filename":"Hitler brain","ext":".jpg","w":859,"h":1196,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491772495386,"time":1491772495,"md5":"A9vCJDYGbUSy96sJ8PRBlQ==","fsize":208515,"resto":120286740,"id":"ZUJPWUoS","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120339350,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:24:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1491773052,"resto":120286740,"id":"ZUJPWUoS","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120339343,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:24:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;massive population booms happening in the Middle East and Africa despite war and famine <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;global warming making these areas even less habitable prompting migration<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;automation about to cause third world mass employment as sweat shops switch over to robotics<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;France will become a white minority in your lifetime<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sweden will become a white minority in your lifetime<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Britain will become a white minority in your lifetime<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Canada will become a white minority in your lifetime<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the USA will become a white minority in your lifetime<\/span><br><br>We&#039;re a dead people.

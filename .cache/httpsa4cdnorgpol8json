And i don&#039;t deny there was bad things about colonialism either, but there are actually many cases where those nations objectively were better off and even in some cases where the people would have liked colonial conditions back because they were better off, colonialists didn&#039;t kick them out on the contrary they built stuff there and taught them things, they were primarily there for ressources and foods and spices and that sort of thing and establishing also trade etc.<br><br>But the fact is majority white nations aren&#039;t that many nor were they historically, so if someone argues that yeah just let mass migration continue to those nations, so now that&#039;s great for the migrants because if they make the white people minorities in their own nations. Then they now essentially have a nation they have taken over that they can decide whatever they want to do in and change it completely, but the white people who built those nations, where the hell are they supposed to go? The migrants can at any point if things gets fucked up migrate back to their original nations with their massive majority and their original culture and values etc. <br><br>Where are the white people supposed to go when they can&#039;t even have their OWN nations that they have built and nurtured for themselves?<br><br>Whilst apparently the ethnicities the migrants belong to can have their own mass majority nations where they&#039;ve pretty much always been, aswell as the nations that used to belong to white people for centuries even over a millennia or more with same people living there.","time":1490107636,"resto":117616405,"id":"7qydqqJ1","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117622650,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)09:07:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wilders lost<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Le Pen will lose<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;AfD will lose<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SD has a chance<\/span><br><br>guys.... how is this even fixable? another 4 years and there will be even more non natives to vote against us...","filename":"IMG_7637","ext":".jpg","w":200,"h":197,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":197,"tim":1490101645849,"time":1490101645,"md5":"E4TGyi++gJsv\/LqEnpOcXA==","fsize":44807,"resto":0,"id":"WJBOndnW","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wilders-lost","country_name":"Sweden","replies":87,"images":17,"omitted_posts":82,"omitted_images":16},{"no":117630184,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:44:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump won because he benefited from (international) meme magic, due to everyone here speaking English.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wilders didn&#039;t benefit from meme magic, because no one could really follow the election.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wilders lost.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Le Pen doesn&#039;t benefit from meme magic.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Le pen will lose.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mfw Trump proved globalism works.<\/span>","filename":"schocked pepe","ext":".jpg","w":231,"h":218,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1490107463385,"time":1490107463,"md5":"QSCQdKVFRSsbwzPbktnhgg==","fsize":9185,"resto":117622650,"id":"hauxkOCo","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":117630215,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:44:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117628310\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117628310<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117628010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117628010<\/a><br>So, Mother Merkel again?","time":1490107483,"resto":117622650,"id":"RJMxCaFq","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117630320,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:45:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117630215\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117630215<\/a><br>Most likely","time":1490107550,"resto":117622650,"id":"gr2L3wHs","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117630418,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:46:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117623284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117623284<\/a><br>wtf 4chan political party<br>C = Chan?","time":1490107611,"resto":117622650,"id":"81+BwHe+","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117630459,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)10:47:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117622650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117622650<\/a><br>Wilders didn&#039;t lose, his partu gained 5 seats.

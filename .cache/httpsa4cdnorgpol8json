It&#039;s another media blitz on the issue.<br><br>I can&#039;t say for sure what sparked the interest on the issue at this time. The issue was raised before a few years ago in connection with a Canadian case, which was covered by Vice.<br>https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/<wbr>is-poking-holes-in-condoms-a-sexual<wbr>-assault<br><br>But the intention is clear. To increase the ever-expanding definition of sexual assault, likely to use it increase its scope as a weapon against exclusively straight men. In each of the articles, the issue of stealthing is presently almost exclusively as one of men committing it against women - hardly no consideration of how a woman might sabatoge a condom in order to commit paternity fraud, much less any consideration of how might &quot;forget&quot; to take her birth control in order to secure child support payments for the next 18 years.","filename":"i said no","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":250,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1493337224065,"time":1493337224,"md5":"VJijxhEF1EzvGyytlm5FHA==","fsize":25818,"resto":0,"id":"gEpFJQw1","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"stealthing-a-new-weaponization-of-sexual-assault","country_name":"United States","replies":127,"images":30,"omitted_posts":122,"omitted_images":30,"tail_size":50},{"no":123136897,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)23:10:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123126827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123126827<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he lives<\/span>","time":1493349023,"resto":123112463,"id":"Uf8iC+tt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123137383,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)23:14:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123121458\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123121458<\/a><br>Fuck off back to Proud Boys, faggot.","time":1493349252,"resto":123112463,"id":"9kHDPE8Y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123138450,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)23:22:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123125595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123125595<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123126981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123126981<\/a><br>We&#039;re cursed, lads.","time":1493349761,"resto":123112463,"id":"U5SKfU2+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123138512,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)23:23:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123121428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123121428<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That pic<\/span><br><br>I&#039;m fucking done.

longer.<br><br>Longtime anti-homosexual activist Bill Whatcott has been ordered to unmask the identities of his co-conspirator Gay Zombies, who have the ABCDEF pseudonyms of Adam Zombie, Brian Zombie, Christopher Zombie, Doug Zombie, Edward Zombie and Frank Zombie.<br><br>He\u2019s also been told by Ontario Superior Court Justice Paul Perell to divulge his sources of funding.<br><br>Whatcott has already vowed to ignore the court order.<br><br>Whatcott and his green bodysuited colleagues were disguised as the \u201cGay Zombies Cannabis Consumers Association\u201d to surreptitiously gain access to march during Pride and distribute 3,000 leaflets packaged as a \u201cZombie Safe Sex Package.\u201d The pamphlet message was actually a disgusting diatribe against the LGBTQ community \u2014 \u201cdisease, death and confusion are the sad and sordid realities of the homosexual lifestyle\u201d \u2014 complete with photos of anal warts and allegations that Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Premier Kathleen Wynne were supporting and involved in child sexual assault.<br><br>Last August, gay activist Christopher Hudspeth and former Liberal MPP George Smitherman launched a $104 million class action lawsuit against Whatcott and his fellow zombies, claiming their flyers promote hatred and were defamatory.","filename":"gayzombies","ext":".jpg","w":810,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":154,"tim":1491008810525,"time":1491008810,"md5":"5f8Aq2cl0R5RgGWE71VcFg==","fsize":70633,"resto":0,"id":"Z1GVqBg2","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"antigay-activist-ordered-to-name-compatriots-and","country_name":"United

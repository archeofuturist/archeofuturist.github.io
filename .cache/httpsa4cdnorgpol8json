Despite the perception of the epidemic as primarily afflicting the rural working class, drug overdoses account for a greater percentage of deaths among the young in large cities and their suburbs, with urban and suburban whites most at risk.<br><br>The crisis has hit particularly hard in New England and in parts of Ohio, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Those are the places where fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid, started to flood into the heroin supply five to 10 years ago. Bodies began piling up.<br><br>\u201cIt just blew through all the measures we\u2019d been taking,\u201d said Dr. Alex Walley, the director of the Boston University Addiction Medicine Fellowship program. Fentanyl, which acts on opioid receptors in the brain but isn\u2019t made from the opium poppy, is up to 50 times more powerful than heroin. Because of that potency, Dr. Walley said, there\u2019s less time after an overdose for someone to intervene.

A nuclear capable modern state against a WW1-tier trench warfare Iraq is not a war, it&#039;s not even a fight. <br><br>I hope to God that some day americans will understand that they are posers, straight up.","filename":"wwii-losses","ext":".png","w":800,"h":466,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":145,"tim":1492070536125,"time":1492070536,"md5":"YfG6KD8TK0j7kOIAoSSNow==","fsize":191372,"resto":0,"id":"JhPYBTLw","country":"AT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"daily-reminder-the-united-states-of-america-has","country_name":"Austria","replies":104,"images":16,"omitted_posts":99,"omitted_images":12,"tail_size":50},{"no":120896471,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)06:51:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120885717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120885717<\/a><br>So by your definition a war is when two completely equal countries fight each other?<br><br>How is a civil war not a war?

anyway? Spring. <br><br>It&#039;s sad but necessary what happens at the moment, but it&#039;s useful for what comes next. The weak whites that have brought this on themselves will die off, fail to reproduce and be purged from the genepool. It brings full circle and to closure the problem of having so many weak whites able to suceesfully reproduce after WWII killed off the best of a generation&#039;s genepool.<br><br>But the environment of militant leftism, invaders and mudshits is providing the adversity needed to forge a tougher, better, more united generation of whites. Fewer will be left after this transition, but what&#039;s left will be united and much better in quality. We can already see the green shoots of the next, stronger generation of whites emerging. I think it might even be as much as two thirds of our own kind we need to shed to end the problem But once we are through this we can push back properly without having to worry about internal divisions among our kind. <br><br>All these enclaves and nationalist groups beginning to form among young European whites, they are the future and and they are the generation that will begin turning things around. For now though we just have to be patient and wait for the cycle to complete no matter how bad things seem in the short-term. We conquered most of the world much as a small minority and forged new countries where we become the majority. If we did that, before from a position as a minority, we can do it again in our own homelands this time.","time":1493128438,"resto":122727200,"id":"ABXrZnPT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122736179,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)09:57:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122732917\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122732917<\/a><br>The one stolen in the form of land, ressources and labour.","time":1493128644,"resto":122727200,"id":"OKbtWyDA","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122736761,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:03:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122727313\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122727313<\/a><br>The Brit gets it.

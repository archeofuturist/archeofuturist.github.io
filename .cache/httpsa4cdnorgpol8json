As usual, this is an assault based on lies: today, the only force that has chemical weapons in Syrian territory is the US-sponsored Al Nusra terrorists. As is well known, thanks to Russian diplomacy, Syrian chemical weapons were deactivated three years ago under international control. Since Collin Powell&#039;s speech at the UN on non-existent WMDs, the US has accustomed us to blatant lies.<br>Now this new act of banditry in Syria undoes the hopes of peace aroused by Trump during his election campaign. Trump said nothing. Today he is a president controlled by the deep state, was neutralized by the neocons. His policy is little different from that of Hillary Clinton. The aggressiveness of imperialism increases as the economic crisis deepens. The installation of THAAD in Korea; The siege of Russia aggravated by the installation of missile bases in Romania and Poland; The provocations in the South China Sea; The gigantic increase of the US military budget indicates a preparation for war - and this can be nuclear. In that case, the 59 Tomahawks launched on Syria could be only an initial skirmish.<br>The world has never been as risky as it is now.","filename":"trumpwant","ext":".jpg","w":1100,"h":619,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491592080050,"time":1491592080,"md5":"Ew3GsKkOMrF0iL21NlKcxg==","fsize":91889,"resto":0,"id":"dvoEcsGb","country":"PT","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-lie-the-war-and-the-turning-point","country_name":"Portugal","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":120004926,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:09:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120004699\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120004699<\/a><br>And a Allahu akbar to you too, comrade.","time":1491592168,"resto":120004699,"id":"cHF7d2H+","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120005445,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:12:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120004926\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120004926<\/a><br>I&#039;m trying to be unbiased here, talking about the world as a whole.<br>Of course I agree muslims should get what they deserve.","time":1491592359,"resto":120004699,"id":"dvoEcsGb","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119997388,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)14:28:32","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Is Trump Playing 4D Chess","com":"Is it even a little possible that Trump is playing multi-verse chess and is several jumps ahead of everyone in order to achieve his agenda?<br><br>Or has he stabbed his loyal Constitution-loving traditional conservative followers in the back?","filename":"Assignment Earth","ext":".jpg","w":1286,"h":1313,"tn_w":244,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491589712486,"time":1491589712,"md5":"j6ZJ\/FYrIOc1javDd5LBXg==","fsize":252203,"resto":0,"id":"eNFZMrEM","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-trump-playing-4d-chess","country_name":"United States","replies":21,"images":10,"omitted_posts":16,"omitted_images":9},{"no":120003669,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:01:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"Of course he is.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;striking Syria in the middle of conversations with China<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;warned Russia as to not involve them directly and lower the possible casualties<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;other mayor countries like Japan, UK, Israel support the strike<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;served as a warning to Syria<\/span><br>50 missiles and he&#039;s taken everyone by the pussy","time":1491591717,"resto":119997388,"id":"vVOuW\/Kg","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":120004380,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:06:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119999111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119999111<\/a><br><br>Uh...

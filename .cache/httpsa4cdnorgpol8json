It is less than a zero sum game, its the end of civilization. All the \/pol\/acks like to LARP and think somehow they would be spared, but no. In an all out nuclear war you will die, I will die, your parents will die, your friends will die. Basically everyone you know will die. It wont be 1 warhead going off ontop of your city, it will be 7, and they will airburst, wiping out building with 3000 degree 800 mph wind. <br><br>No politician or military tactician thinks a nuclear war will happen. The only scenario which seems to make much sense is if there is a total global economic and agricultural collapse, and billions are starving to death. In that case maybe, just MAYBE, a nation would use nuclear weapons, but it would have to be an existential cause for them to do so. <br><br>Go back to your vodka and state run media roosky.","time":1493557228,"resto":123474199,"id":"CuMD1o+j","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123475443,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)09:04:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123474199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123474199<\/a><br><br>We&#039;re gonna burn together Ivan.","time":1493557442,"resto":123474199,"id":"o+tocVT0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123475812,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)09:08:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123474199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123474199<\/a><br>Only the cities.

This general is for the discussion of Marxism-Leninism, the ideology of revolutionary socialism and communism.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1480606481750","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493551143943,"time":1493551143,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"D7sf35X3","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":17,"images":9,"omitted_posts":12,"omitted_images":7},{"no":123473268,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)08:34:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123472983\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123472983<\/a><br>lol I&#039;m not a Marxist<br><br>go read the bread book","time":1493555672,"resto":123468019,"id":"8MkTHQrw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123473634,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)08:40:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123468019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123468019<\/a><br>communism has more fuckable leaders","filename":"MQkktoARGh0dHA6Ly9vY2RuLmV1L25ld3N3ZWVrLXdlYi81YmYyMjNiYi1lMzllLTQ0NDQtOGZmNi0zZTYyZjRkN2FmMjMuanBnkZUCAM0CWMLD","ext":".jpg","w":693,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1493556009802,"time":1493556009,"md5":"cPmkTRokgNoh8Z4fszGvwQ==","fsize":103154,"resto":123468019,"id":"Dn+Pbhwh","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":123473854,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)08:43:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"k","time":1493556181,"resto":123468019,"id":"4C2+NFCE","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123474619,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)08:53:59","name":"S&quot;ean&quot; AGE","com":"<a href=\"#p123468019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123468019<\/a><br>See my name.<br>You cannot convert \/pol\/.

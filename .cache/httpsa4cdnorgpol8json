China has long warned the US about the THAAD system as an infringement on their sovereignty and an escalation on the Korean peninsula, but both the US and South Korea had insisted that it was necessary for defense given the Kim regime\u2019s development of ballistic missile systems \u2014 which the UN had forbidden in the first place. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This conflict would have arisen anyway, but Beijing probably hoped that the political unrest in South Korea might have precluded the installation. The Trump administration\u2019s rush to install it ahead of the election in two weeks was clearly meant as a signal that it wouldn\u2019t be deterred. This is China\u2019s signal of message received \u2014 and a reminder that they have a big stake in the balance of power on the peninsula, too.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/hotair.com\/archives\/2017\/04\/<wbr>27\/china-thaad-installation-means-w<wbr>ell-test-new-weapons\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic related. what you&#039;ll eat when ww3 starts with China, not North Korea<\/span>","filename":"8764543","ext":".jpg","w":780,"h":439,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493352041829,"time":1493352041,"md5":"HTELH\/PPH396HdXKhZlyjg==","fsize":286662,"resto":0,"id":"W+tZwByq","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-north-korea-an-excuse-to-get-a-thaad-closer-to","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1},{"no":123143442,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:02:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123143282\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123143282<\/a><br>got the wrong pic","filename":"9873452","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493352125037,"time":1493352125,"md5":"qPK93Wu5yv537YpEzPEGGw==","fsize":169386,"resto":123143282,"id":"W+tZwByq","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123145071,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:15:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123143282\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123143282<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;china tries to leverage the US with NK<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fails to keep NK in check and fucks themselves<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;now they have no option but to get a nice big THAAD system right near their borders<\/span><br>get fucked ,commies","time":1493352901,"resto":123143282,"id":"66rF\/Vr3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123145331,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:16:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123143282\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123143282<\/a><br>bump","time":1493353015,"resto":123143282,"id":"MX\/Vp9Qj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123145318,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:16:46","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Antifa Terrorists Attack Trump Supporters at a Rally, Cops Decide They Will Eat Pavement","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1Cx<wbr>SKoG5lqg - A admirable exhibition of public servitude by the nation&#039;s finest: driving the faces of commie scum into asphalt.

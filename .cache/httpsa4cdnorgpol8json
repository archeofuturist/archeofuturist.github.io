You&#039;re paying a school tens of thousands of dollars to indoctrinate you with liberal ideals then leave you jobless. Half of the lectures are coming from fat feminists who are more focused on churning out mindless activists for their drum circles than they are on teaching the next generation of leaders, thinkers, and people who will actually make a difference. <br>Political science doesn&#039;t prepare you for employment. It doesn&#039;t teach you to think critically. Your classes are spent trying to kiss ass and follow the professor&#039;s subjective point of view to receive a good grade. If you disagree you are marked off. If you don&#039;t use their approved sources you&#039;re criticized. If you dissent you fail. All of this time spent trying to live up to someone&#039;s expectations, rather than analyzing data and thinking critically about solutions, results in poor analytical skills after graduation. Businesses are built off of thinkers, not cheerleaders. Nobody is willing to hire someone who only supports the man in charge.<br>There is a reason only 11% of political science majors are employed.<br>You receive a garbage education and you do not learn any valuable skills.

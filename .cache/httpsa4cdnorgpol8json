[1]<br>2.1.1.1.1 It remains up to debate whether women choose social jobs that coincidentally pay less because of natural inclination or because of environmental reasons. [2]<br>2.1.1.2 When aforementioned factors are taken into account, the wage gape is reduced by more than two thirds - to roughly 0.93 dollars for every dollar a man makes. [3] [4] [5]<br>3 Explaing the remaining wage gap is very difficult; it is called the &quot;unexplained wage gap&quot; by experts.<br>3.1 It could be explained by sexism<br>3.2 There&#039;s also the option that men just ask for a raise more often than women do, which is backed up by statistics. [6]<br>3.2.1 While the aforementioned theory is backed up by statistics, claims of sexism remain vague, often relying on unfalsifiable assumptions of cultural prejudice against women.<br>3.2.2 Some of the lack of asking for a raise women show can be explained by both genders showing unfair treatment to women who demand to be paid more, perceiving them as &quot;less nice&quot;.

These people&#039;s solution is to import as many people as possible for no reason (except feelings) and ensure the baker doesn&#039;t discriminate against transgender couples. These economic experts (20 year old women with thousands in debt due to their gender studies major and a job at a retail shoe store) then protest all business owners as privileged people and elect representatives that aim to tax the 1% more. The baker, though only owning a small business and living in a small apartment with his family in San Francisco, is determined to be a part of the privileged 1%.. Technically, the baker is living just above poverty because much of his income has to go back into the risky business of baking cookies but it doesn&#039;t matter because he is a part of the 1% and the enemy. Representatives are elected by a democratic majority of consumers (because business owners will always be a minority and thus underrepresented in any democracy) that increase taxes on these business owners. Now the baker gives 16 of his cookies to government only to be crumbled into the beaurocratic black hole but he retains 4 cookies. He&#039;s no longer able to support his business and forecloses. He tries to find work and the few major corporations left in the baking business but simply can&#039;t compete against skilled immigrants willing to work for wages that he couldn&#039;t provide for his family on.

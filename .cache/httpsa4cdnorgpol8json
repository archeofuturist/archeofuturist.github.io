It severely weakened the Russia\/Trump angle and finally allowed him to step into role of Pres. in the general public&#039;s mind. Ultimately though, Trump just needed to drop some missiles on someone, anyone, and it happened to be Assad who got pushed out in front (hate it for him). But Assad got a fireworks show, whether he used the chem weapons or not, the whole world was calling for drastic action and Trump comes in with a slap on the wrist and and now it&#039;s been atoned for without the full scale invasion McCain et al wanted. Meanwhile thanks to the timing of the Syria strike and Trump\/Chinaman meeting, the festering best Korea shit show has finally been put on the front page, and China appears to have gotten the picture and is looking like they might take control of the situation (they are the only ones who really can). <br><br>This worked out good for America and Trump so far (we will have to wait and see about escalation). Self interested nationalism is what it sounds like to me. <br><br>At this point it appears as if most of the haters are euros and other non Americans with the occasional American edgelord sprinkled in. It couldn&#039;t be more obvious that the Trump memes were fun and all for the rest of the world until trump strarted swinging his dick around with no care for your Assad and Putin mythologies and memes.

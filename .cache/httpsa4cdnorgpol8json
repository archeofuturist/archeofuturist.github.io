Then you move to the ranch, and you can claim a piece of land giving to the company-town hall the amount of coins that matches with the square meters you have claimed. These coins are then destroyed by sending them to a bogus coin address so actually records the transaction. Coins are never extracted from this address and for this matter, there is no private key (This can be done). <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So, if investors cannot use coins to actually settle (because they are not elegible to apply) what can they do with these coins?

My question isn&#039;t about his view on the idea of race mixing, in some abstract sense. My question is in regard to his view that mass race mixing is an eventual reality if whites and blacks continue to occupy the same territory. My point is that this idea is irrational when you take into account the world that this idea is speaking about. Which leads me to my question, why the fuck did Abe Lincoln have this fear.","time":1491159822,"resto":119229946,"id":"\/eH3ru7H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119231824,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:00:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"If Jews are behind Christianity then why did they murder Jesus ?","filename":"IMG_0572","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1246,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491159655949,"time":1491159655,"md5":"I\/21YaHxWtjPk3T4xofYmw==","fsize":251510,"resto":0,"id":"WXDr+icR","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"if-jews-are-behind-christianity-then-why-did-they","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":1,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":0},{"no":119232082,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:03:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119232021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119232021<\/a><br>You almost got me 4\/10","time":1491159783,"resto":119231824,"id":"r\/ESRljD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119232119,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:03:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119231969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119231969<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Roman&#039;s murdered Jesus <\/span><br><br>No you&#039;re brainwashed","time":1491159803,"resto":119231824,"id":"aJfYGq2F","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":119232254,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)15:04:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119232082\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119232082<\/a><br>Who did then?

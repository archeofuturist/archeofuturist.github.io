Well why are there so many &quot;living fossils&quot; on because those animals became perfect for their environment 65 million years ago? So that means the environment hasn&#039;t changed at all in 65 million years?

Maybe they have to adapt to expanding predator populations. Sometimes food sources die out and only animals with adaptations that allow them to access other sources survive. It really isn&#039;t that hard to understand. What about selective breeding in domesticated animals? Can you really look at a pug and german shepard side by side and tell me it isn&#039;t possible for a species to change over time?","time":1492043424,"resto":120826906,"id":"fDcoOitM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120838430,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)20:35:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120828569\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120828569<\/a><br>Most people who don&#039;t believe in Bible&#039;s God or other Abrahamic Gods, believe in other Gods :)","time":1492043717,"resto":120826906,"id":"DoUsPMW8","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"}]}]}

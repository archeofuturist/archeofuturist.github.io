At the Third Battle of Berkeley, pro-white groups were instrumental in beating back Antifa. However, we lacked organization and a consistent uniform. This is where the idea of the Blueshirts comes in. We are trying to create cooperation and organization between various pro-white groups to engage in street activism.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What are our goals?<\/span><br>As previously stated we want to create cooperation and a universal uniform for pro-white groups. The uniform will help reduce friendly fire, and create a distinct, professional appearance. It will also help with recognition of the Alt Right&#039;s role. Ultimately, we are trying to get to organizational capacity that is currently lacking. Right now, the Blueshirts is essentially just a uniform and a set of rules. Currently we plan for social media presence and hopefully a website in the near future. In the present, we hope pro-white groups and individuals take up this idea.<br>RULES AND GUIDELINES:<br>1. NO INSTIGATING VIOLENCE, AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR OR THE LIKE<br>2. NO LOOTING, VANDALISM, RIOTING OR GENERAL DEGENERACY<br>3. COOPERATE WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT<br>4. NON-LETHAL WEAPONS ONLY!<br>5.

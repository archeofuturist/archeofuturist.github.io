Once they are aware of these techniques the operation can completely fail, and the forum can become uncontrolled. At this point other avenues must be considered such as initiating a false legal precidence to simply have the forum shut down and taken offline. This is not desirable as it then leaves the enforcement agencies unable to track the percentage of those in the population who always resist attempts for control against them. Many other techniques can be utilized and developed by the individual and as you develop further techniques of infiltration and control it is imperative to share then with HQ.","time":1491955621,"resto":120680684,"id":"t+nk5VRO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120682750,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)20:13:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"\u061c <a href=\"#p120681832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120681832<\/a>","time":1491956015,"resto":120680684,"id":"CorZB3aK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120683414,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)20:18:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120680684\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120680684<\/a><br>shill detected","filename":"proofs2","ext":".png","w":956,"h":631,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1491956311332,"time":1491956311,"md5":"lFKVIhpBoEbTsRFYl5Pz\/w==","fsize":470288,"resto":120680684,"id":"1WaUIeKn","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":120684387,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)20:25:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"\u061c<a href=\"#p120682750\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120682750<\/a> <br>very nice","time":1491956756,"resto":120680684,"id":"PyNYf67M","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120684361,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)20:25:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"We all know that a major aspect of the Brexit vote was white bigots scaired of the growing racial diversity in the country, Farage manipulated these fearS with he infamous van poster depicting brown refugees swarming the &quot;white man&#039;s&quot; homeland. which worked and he managed to trick people into thinking the reason we have people of colour here is due to the EU and not the Commonwealth and people thought they were voting to maintain a white country.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SFj<wbr>fbL1KWNI <br><br>This of course will not happen, post Brexit will lead to more beautiful commonwealth immigrants from Pakistani, Nigeria, India and will speed up the decline of the whites in Britain now I am worried, how will the Brexiters react?

If you knew me in real life, you would ridicule me to no end. I am much too liberal to fully be apart of your community, so I mostly lurk. However, I am very much interested in the protection of those with European descent. We as a people have been demonized and marked for death the past few years especially. It&#039;s only going to get worse unless action is taken. I am based in LA (yes go ahead and call me a fag) and am very immersed in the art scene. I know a lot of people. I know how anti-caucasian people think.. the arguments they use, etc. The hot button issue everyone is talking about is Islam, so of course that is my primary focus. I&#039;ll be blunt, it has no place in the west. The only Muslims I have known have actually been nice people, but the ideology, the passive behavior towards radicalists, and the fact that their religion permits them to lie to persuade or kill infidels is evidence enough that their ideology is incompatible with western societies. We need to organize and tackle these matters. I&#039;m talking about some heavy shit that may include arms dealing. This sounds really LARPy but someone needs to do it. A long term goal is a caucasian ethno-state, though at the moment that is unrealistic. Genocide and ethnic cleansing are not at all apart of my agenda. I have many friends of different ethnicities and orientations that I love dearly, but I also long for the caucasian people to live unmolested by the foreign hordes. I could see this thread getting deleted or meme&#039;d to death, but let&#039;s try and have a discussion anyways.","filename":"article-0-1975158400000578-382_634x802","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":802,"tn_w":197,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491936328363,"time":1491936328,"md5":"5H2cWKW\/LqoASDb1gArD5w==","fsize":152852,"resto":0,"id":"J\/llRiZV","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"california-takes-action","country_name":"United

Pic related, I illegally pulled about $100 worth of gold from a creek in 2 weeks. Nobody can touch it, the lobbies shut down resource extraction so fuckin hard the mining industry just uprooted and moved to south americs. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ranching&quot; animals are people too, muh dust pollution<\/span><br><br>Out of state activist organizations are trying super hard to shut down the family owned ranches in the area with a bunch of regulations they know nobody can comply with. <br><br>Its my opinion that they actually work for the globalist interests you mentioned earlier. My arguement is that they assist globalist ventures that are ultimatley more harmful to the planet by destroying local industry, repackaging it as enviromentally conscious, then hide even worse pollution out of sight out of mind in the 3rd world.","time":1493589772,"resto":123490273,"id":"8oGi3Aah","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123533996,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)18:04:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123533739\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123533739<\/a><br>My bad, forgot pic. <br><br>How can I have this in the mountains behind my house and not be allowed to dig it up,?<br><br>Short answer: environmentalists<br><br>Long answer: globalists use environmentalist shills to keep local industry suppressed.","filename":"20170101_180502_002","ext":".jpg","w":4032,"h":3024,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493589886369,"time":1493589886,"md5":"38qUdzIHvIxXO+uD1aq4nA==","fsize":2838246,"resto":123490273,"id":"8oGi3Aah","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123533993,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)18:04:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is this what life in ancap would actually be like?","filename":"1493588703769","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":586,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":236,"tim":1493589886620,"time":1493589886,"md5":"jYC3z5JF1LdFSPVnob57dw==","fsize":73627,"resto":0,"id":"wwvnS2Pr","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-this-what-life-in-ancap-would-actually-be-like","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":123492963,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:15:08","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Try not being yourself today","com":"Sunday Buddhism thread<br><br>Previous <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/122426742#p122426742\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122426742<\/a><br><br>The last thread didn&#039;t get much traction, maybe due to the OP being too long, so I&#039;ll keep it shorter this time.

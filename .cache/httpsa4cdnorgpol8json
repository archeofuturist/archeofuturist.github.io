Time is not metric. There&#039;s no point in converting &quot;almost&quot; all your units to round numbers when one very important one isn&#039;t. Imperial works better with time. What is the typical highway speed in Canada? Approximately 100km\/h. But 60 doesn&#039;t evenly divide 100, so 100km\/h is 1 and 2\/3rds of a kilometer per minute. Now what is the typical highway speed in the US? Approximately 60 mph, a mile a minute. When a highway exit sign says your exit is approaching in 2 kilometers, it&#039;s not immediately clear how many minutes away it is (1 minute, 20 seconds). On the other hand, if a highway exit sign says your exit is approaching in 1 and 1\/4 of a mile, it&#039;s immediately obvious that it&#039;s coming up in 1 and 1\/4 of a minute. Easy conversion that doesn&#039;t require any thought.<br><br>2. Humans don&#039;t perceive changes in orders of magnitude. According to the metric system, all humans are roughly 1 meter tall (rounded to the nearest order of magnitude), or roughly 2 meters tall (rounded to the nearest meter). But clearly we see differences in peoples&#039; heights. That&#039;s why we measure in feet and inches, it makes more natural sense. You can visually see the difference between 5 and 6 feet. But if you measure that in meters it&#039;s 1.5 and 1.8 meters. Before you say &quot;b-b-but centimeters!&quot; remember that centimeter is not an SI unit. In meters both people are approximately 2 meters tall, even though there&#039;s a clear visual difference in their height.","time":1491975480,"resto":120699840,"id":"GqdZ1Uin","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120722879,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)02:12:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120713322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120713322<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The meter was originally defined as 1\/10,000,000th of the distance from the North Pole to the equator along an imaginary meridian that would run through Paris, but because the faggot calculated wrong, it was later retconned to be the distance travelled by light in 1\/299,792,458th of a second, in a vacuum.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So, once again, explain how the metric system is more scientific than other systems of measurement.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Unless you believe that the size of the earth is a holy measurement of some sort.<\/span><br><br>Step up, faggots.<br>There are plenty of Eurofags, syrupeans, and bogans on at this time.<br><br>The metric system, like the Imperial system, is based upon measuring the Earth.<br><br>Justify your smugness, faggots.","time":1491977541,"resto":120699840,"id":"cJcZVApX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120724723,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)02:34:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120709106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120709106<\/a><br><br>If a normal person wrote this book, not some autistic fat fuck, then thered be no point writing the book. <br><br>Equivalent questions would be <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how many calories does it take to raise the temperature of an oz. of water one degree. <\/span><br><br>To which id reply about 20. <br><br>But to answer their dumbass question- 270k calories to boil a gallon of water.","time":1491978881,"resto":120699840,"id":"12Tggk9G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120719569,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:31:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"If you guys hate atheism and nihilism so much why don&#039;t you just disprove it?<br><br>Why don&#039;t you just provide reasons for it being unsound?<br><br>Isn&#039;t ignoring the truth the definition of blue pilled?

How do you think a website like Daily Stormer is still up? It&#039;s Jewish run and Jewish funded. Yeah, the normies at the SPLC think it&#039;s a hate site and Soros probably hates it, but it&#039;s probably funded by hardcore Jews who have realized that getting blown up by brownie is a more likely fate than getting gassed by whitey at this point.<br><br>Look at things like Fox News versus the rest of the media, Shapiro at Breitbart, Milo versus the rest of the Jewish fags - some of the Jews got a little woke and realized that their survival depended upon the survival of western civilization.

Trudeau was more sympathetic to communist nations than other heads of government. Trudeau wanted to lessen Canada&#039;s reliance on the United States by forging closer ties with other countries and breaking out of the Cold War straitjacket. During a trip to the Soviet Union in 1971 he identified the United States as a bigger threat to Canada than the remote Soviet Union. The Americans, he said, are &quot;a danger to our national identity from a cultural, economic and perhaps even military point of view.&quot; Eventually Trudeau backed away from his &quot;Third Option&quot; policy and returned to the Western fold. However, at the end of his tenure, when he believed that tension between the US and Soviet Union were again too high, he launched a peace mission to Moscow which the Americans did not approve of. Tensions between the US and the Soviet Union eased soon afterwards.<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Canad<wbr>a%E2%80%93Soviet_Union_relations<br><br>Wtf I hate snow niggers now.","filename":"1449597026505","ext":".jpg","w":425,"h":344,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":202,"tim":1493546719326,"time":1493546719,"md5":"k1zoYZNb3MsNdT5sy6Z4ww==","fsize":35654,"resto":0,"id":"gD9ri7dg","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"after-pierre-trudeau-came-to-power-in-canada","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":123463132,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)06:05:12","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/ourpastor\/?","com":"is he \/ourpastor\/, pol?

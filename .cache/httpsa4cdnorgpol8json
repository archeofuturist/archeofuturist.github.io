So you are completely wrong. They never had any idea that any of those emails would become public. Comet Ping Pong Pizza is central in the Washington DC area to pedophilia and child trafficking. That&#039;s why James Alefantis threatened Ryan O&#039;Neal. Alifantis literally took the risk of openly threatening him online. Obviously there&#039;s something incredibly significant there to hide. Also, it makes no sense that Alefantis would be described as one of the top 50 most powerful people in Washington DC unless there was something there. The stupid thing about Comet Ping Pong pizza is that some people tried to push the narrative that there was child trafficking going on right inside the place. Although that is possible it&#039;s unlikely. But at the end of the day Comet Ping Pong Pizza is the front. There may have been deals there to organize the buying and selling of children in the back rooms. There may have been weird sex parties and all kinds of other shit going on because let&#039;s face it these people are fucking weirdos all around. But the incessant narrative that Comet Ping Pong Pizza is some kind of central Clearing House for child sex really made researchers look like idiots. Basically you take any mob front like an Italian restaurant or a barber shop. The crime doesn&#039;t go on there. That&#039;s where all the criminals hang out and organize their plans. It&#039;s not rocket science for fucksake.","time":1493260936,"resto":122968321,"id":"mRxv8EJr","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122979554,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)22:17:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fuck yes!

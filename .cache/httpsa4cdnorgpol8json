Judges aren&#039;t in a position to &quot;get rid&quot; of laws. They can find laws to be unconstitutional, and strike them down. Gorsuch is great to the extent that he brings balance back to the court and arguably brings it closer to a conservative, originalist position. This is besides the point. If you really think that Hillary would have nominated Gorsuch, or someone like him, or that it doesn&#039;t matter that there&#039;s a conservative, origainalist Justice on the court in the vein of Scalia as opposed to someone like Garland or even more leftist, you&#039;re an idiot.","time":1493353360,"resto":123133033,"id":"HJxJN4V\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123147070,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:31:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123133033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123133033<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Japan shitposting<\/span>","filename":"The Japanese Solution","ext":".png","w":552,"h":1500,"tn_w":46,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493353899485,"time":1493353899,"md5":"Oyv+kD1mUVbu6hW5hcDMuw==","fsize":434694,"resto":123133033,"id":"3AUaaGOO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123147361,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:34:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123146023\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123146023<\/a><br>Dude if you think that i would think that anyone from the dems would done better well then you would be very wrong but gorsuch dosnt seem that good scalia wasnt really that good i dont care if a judge is conservative just that he interprets the constitution the way the founders wrote it and i dont think he cares about that no one seems to care not trump no one most of our laws are unconstitutional including whole departments like the dea the doj the irs the epa","time":1493354051,"resto":123133033,"id":"OBS8Jwx4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123147777,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:37:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123147361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123147361<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; i would think that anyone from the dems would done better well then you would be very wrong<\/span><br>And that&#039;s the choice you make at each election, a choice between two people, one of which is incrementally better than the other, and in this case, however small, it&#039;s preferable to have had Gorsuch nominated than anyone else Hillary would have nominated, which is why its asinine to say that Republicans and Democrats act the same way.","time":1493354275,"resto":123133033,"id":"HJxJN4V\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123148511,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:44:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123147777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123147777<\/a><br>But this time its different the world is in crisis america is in crisis the only way we would of had a chance was if trump would have been able to do more than even what he promised but not we just keep going down the path we had set upon along time ago i had hope but now its gone","time":1493354646,"resto":123133033,"id":"OBS8Jwx4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123139380,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)23:30:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"What is the core reason for protestant superiority?<br><br>Is it:<br><br>A) superior genetics<br>B) just coincidence lmao<br><br>Answer the strawpoll, please.<br><br>http:\/\/www.strawpoll.me\/12798840","filename":"protestant superiority","ext":".jpg","w":2092,"h":1510,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":180,"tim":1493350206554,"time":1493350206,"md5":"IaNc+8r4bTvvD9NDEqktuQ==","fsize":799856,"resto":0,"id":"\/YRZWn1m","country":"NL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-is-the-core-reason-for-protestant","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":5,"images":0},{"no":123141402,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)23:45:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1493351122,"resto":123139380,"id":"\/YRZWn1m","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123143477,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:02:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123139380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123139380<\/a><br>Superior genetics, higher intelligence, higher amount of neanderthal dna.

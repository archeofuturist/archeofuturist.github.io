This is assuming the US military could easily win a short-lived war against Mexico to force the primary Mexican government to be subjugated. I don&#039;t think the US military would have any problem doing this, and then immediately turning around and whipping the Cartels like the ragtag fuckwads they are doesn&#039;t sound like a huge challenge.<br><br>I say legalize marijuana and hemp first because let&#039;s be honest, you can easily grow tons of it in Mexico and it would immediately be a cash crop, spurring investment into the region due to the recently increased levels of security and safety in the concept of Mexican agricultural investment.<br><br>They could keep their current organization of government, though many things would become redundant and therefore would be completely eliminated due to lack of need. Whether it would be broken down into many states is up for discussion, but the general concept of taking it and using their land to increase the overall federal budget via taxes sounds worthwhile due to long-term profits.<br><br>Not to mention, annexing Mexico would, in a relatively short time, bring up the general quality of life for all Mexicans and resolve the immigration crisis. They can just stay the fuck home and build an economy there.

When \/pol\/ leaps to blame everything on jews, they aren&#039;t really correct.<br><br>The problem isn&#039;t merely one certain malicious ethnic\/religious group, and it&#039;s not even just greedy bankers. Perhaps in the past it was. But today, what we were really facing is an out of control priestly caste of society that constantly throws itself into massive holiness and other purity spirals.<br><br>All of these bloggers, celebrities, academics, and others that create both culture and context have risen to fill the void left by the collapse of more formal religion. These people who make their living through talking (or don&#039;t need to make a living at all) rather than direct work, have different incentives from the rest of the population. Their value, and often profit, comes from how virtuous, holy, and pure they can seem. And so they compete. This turns them into sanctimonious virtue signalers that are happy to sell out their cultural heritage (and everyone else&#039;s) to look a little bit more progressive, and send us all down slippery slopes. We understand financial greed well, but this sort of holiness greed is a cultural blind spot.<br><br>The people that fall into this new priestly class that is currently destroying our society are going to be upper middle class sorts that go to college. The optimal IQ is going to be 115-125, where they are just smart enough to play more complex games, but not quite smart enough to have become a high end programmer or physicist. Due to this, most Jews fall into this class with their average 115 IQ (mostly that high due to speech and language), and the rest is made up of liberal whites.<br><br>Pol is wrong to blindly blame Da Joos, but they are correctly identifying the problem, and they are mostly right about the demographics.

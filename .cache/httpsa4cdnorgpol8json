The whole tuition system is one big spiral. Tuition fees are so high in America because universities need that money to pay for all the massive amount of different kinds of degrees that contribute only little to GDP. American universities educate people with completely useless degrees straight to the job register and this is possible because those students pay for their own education. If it was paid by government then the universities would only educate the needed amount of people and only for needed fields. This is why there isn&#039;t such a huge push for Marxism in Europe since people don&#039;t get brainwashed in universities since universities don&#039;t simply have money to do that.

Basically we have way too many billboards on every single fucking highway, cementing our white trash status, and the county i live in (vernon) is extremely sexually violent and poor, and addicted to meth. The small town of 98 people my fiance is from has about 90 meth users that are all farmhands that law enforcement simply tolerates because if the farmers lost their help the county&#039;s economy would melt down. Ive had big ol fuckin white trash mongoloids block the main street in that town and threaten to throw bricks through my windshield for driving 2mph over the limit when their kids were out. Theres about 5 to 10 arrests a week in the county for statutory rape, about 50% of which was probably consensual, but degenerate. We only have about 20 black people living here, and most of them are perfectly respectable, normal citizens, but we had a family move here from saint louis and their son was a nigger who promptly slept with all the white bitches at school and just got thrown in jail. <br><br>We dont have anything to do other than each other, and shitty overpriced drugs.","time":1493228869,"resto":122905759,"id":"IeGBAt8G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122912695,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)13:50:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Your not living the Missouri experience if you don&#039;t have to worry about human sex trafficking and bands of roving methheads terrorizing you and your family.","time":1493229030,"resto":122905759,"id":"vG1t7SY+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122912831,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)13:51:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Its a neat State.

You can be sure they above everyone else wanted to end those riots with force. The issue comes from liberal police chiefs and their appointed higher ups. The local city gov hires the police chief so they hire one that fits their ideology and lo and behold you get the chief holding back his or her department from dealing with liberal rioting retards so that they can appease their liberal city gov. You don&#039;t normally get that issue with the sheriffs department because the sheriff is elected. <br>If it&#039;s not a liberal police chief it&#039;s a decent police chief being threatened with being fired by the liberal city gov.","time":1492516710,"resto":121673799,"id":"i\/zohqML","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121676191,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)07:58:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"How do we stop the white knight nu-males?","filename":"1492515291292","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":540,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492516709121,"time":1492516709,"md5":"7r2YK18Fy2pGCqEXvfmnoA==","fsize":37768,"resto":0,"id":"aZNbOGbI","country":"RS","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-we-stop-the-white-knight-numales","country_name":"Serbia","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121675852,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)07:55:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;there are &quot;people&quot; on \/pol\/ who still smoke<\/span><br>Undermensch much?","filename":"1492514218243","ext":".jpg","w":757,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":198,"tim":1492516501614,"time":1492516501,"md5":"9VojyMPeG1kVSKjfzCjW7A==","fsize":83681,"resto":0,"id":"CGM70Ef4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"there-are-people-on-pol-who-still-smoke","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":2},{"no":121676156,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)07:58:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121675852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121675852<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw not a smoker or alcohol drinker<\/span>","filename":"nazi pepe","ext":".png","w":736,"h":951,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492516689253,"time":1492516689,"md5":"G1fZ2AiyCh6rqMYon9CLsQ==","fsize":404115,"resto":121675852,"id":"TaR3qZvK","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":121676571,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:02:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121676156\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121676156<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw don&#039;t drink as well<\/span>","filename":"hqdefault","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492516952184,"time":1492516952,"md5":"kdJjTAiuQX7nsNhc3B3GXw==","fsize":23928,"resto":121675852,"id":"CGM70Ef4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121676148,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)07:58:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"I bought one of these, now I can save a lot of money and it&#039;s very ecofriendly since I do not buy plastic bottles anymore.

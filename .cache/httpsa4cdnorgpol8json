There&#039;s a lot of good quality uranium mines up north in the Amazon forest, a lot of it gets smuggled already. The brazilian military has already buit guiding missiles under contract for the U.S. in the 90&#039;s. There also nuclear plants too, no incidents ever recorded. It could happen in 5 to years, if there was enough effort really.","time":1490064953,"resto":117519521,"id":"S97OSplA","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":117577100,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)23:00:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Because our army uses junk from other countries","time":1490065205,"resto":117519521,"id":"8PTu+Z2M","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":117577661,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)23:05:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117520567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117520567<\/a><br>Please delet.","time":1490065509,"resto":117519521,"id":"52xCG5Y6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117571492,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)22:09:54","name":"Anonymous","sub":"European Art","com":"I was with my art major gf talking to my brother on FaceTime who I was about to play some civ v with. I&#039;m Germany because I&#039;m secretly a national socialist. We&#039;re loading up the game and my brother is talking to my gf about this new Van Gough biography he is reading. I guess Van Gough had a pretty shitty art life, and he was only famous after he died so he never got to see real success. Since I&#039;m always hiding my power level I ask my gf &quot;did the nazis ever make any art? Or were they just burning everything?&quot; That&#039;s when my gf unknowingly made me love Hitler even more. She goes, &quot;actually, Hitler was trying to SAVE the art! He only threatened to destroy it when he was losing.&quot; My gf is by no means red pilled. She&#039;s a cut above the average woman or else she wouldn&#039;t be my gf, but for instance she says she regrets\/feels bad for voting for trump. I like talking to her about history because her art perspective gives me neat perspectives into things.

Deep state just threw down the gauntlet and Comey basically issued their declaration of war against Trump. Too bad Trump&#039;s return shot just tore them a new asshole.<br><br>The msm is trying to ignore and suppress the fact that Trump was right about wiretapping. As always, they&#039;ll try to dominate the narrative by dismissing it as happening years ago, while carefully dancing around the fact that Obama is the de facto authority over intelligence agencies at the time and would&#039;ve personally authorized any spying on an American citizen like Trump. They&#039;ll try to spin it as how it didn&#039;t happen &quot;as Trump described in his tweet&quot; or that it didn&#039;t happen during his campaign (Trump formally announced his candidacy in 2015 but was publicly known to be preparing as far back as 2013). So when Crimea happened in 2014 and the US began extensive investigations into suspect Russian agents in order to ensure the sanctions cover everyone, this will be the likely time where Trump Tower was bugged. And in doing so, members of Trump&#039;s campaign (and likely Trump himself) were wiretapped under authorization of Obama himself. The motive may likely be to prevent Russians from bypassing sanctions through 3rd party agents but I wouldn&#039;t be surprised that Obama passed some some juicy pieces of intel to HRC&#039;s campaign. Would be hilarious if there was nothing of interest or it showed that they were so disorganized and underfunded at the time that she dismissed his campaign as a joke up until it was too late to recover.","time":1490242612,"resto":117877958,"id":"KfjmRsbx","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117886694,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:25:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117877958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117877958<\/a><br>Biggest regret of my life is voting for Trump.

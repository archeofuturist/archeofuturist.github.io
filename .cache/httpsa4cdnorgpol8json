Australia has no real identity (DUDE VEGEMITE LMAO) outside of Sydney (which doesn&#039;t even want to be a part of Australia). &quot;But that&#039;s not fair, Australia has culture!&quot; you say. Very true. Kangaroos and proto-brit slags are well-known icons world-wide - a STRAYA icon. The only thing close to iconic culture that (Anglo) &quot;Australia&quot; has are the emus. One of Australia&#039;s folk heroes is a cu\/ck\/ who got killed by a stingray. Can you honestly think of anything more pathetic than that? Great Britain doesn&#039;t give a fuck about Australia. Just because you say &quot;Zed&quot; instead of &quot;Zee&quot; doesn&#039;t mean they care about you. And why would they? You threw away your British heritage for a bunch of chinks and what do you have to show for it? You&#039;re a bargain bin Australia, basically an oversized Vermont. Australia is blessed that they happen to live next to the single most benevolent and peaceful military superpower in Western History. Nobody else would let a pathetic joke like that exist right on their doorstep. And they don&#039;t even have to. With NATO and the gradual erosion of anything remotely uniquely &quot;Australian&quot; your grandchildren will be begging New Zealand for annexation. I just hope that they have the good sense to reject it.

This is just not true. Jew semantics have convinced people that are for all intents and purposes slaves, that they are free, simply by loading the word &quot;slavery&quot;, and then isolating it in the modern lexicon, the vast majority of slaves don&#039;t even realize they&#039;re slaves simply because they are not called such. The Jew has perfected slavery, and there are different levels of slavery. I&#039;m essentially a modern day slave. If you do not own land, or are not self employed, you too are a slave. Perhaps slavery just means not having any expendable income, whatever it means it is still with us, that I know to be true. Maybe the prison industrial complex is the closest approximation, it certainly is demographically. You may be a rich slave, but you are still a slave. Being &quot;free&quot; whatever that means nowadays isn&#039;t always easy or sweet.

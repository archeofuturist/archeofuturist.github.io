Across the United States, human rights advocates sometimes called \u201cintactivists\u201d have consistently declared that it is unfair that the United States protects girls from genital mutilation, but does not protect boys from circumcision. Generally, the argument has been that female genital mutilation is much crueler than male circumcision, because of the amount of tissue that is removed from girls during procedures completed to abuse girls. Now, we read an FBI agent\u2019s complaint stating that the procedures done to two female victims constitute illegal sexual acts on the part of the doctor, even though the procedures may or may not have been done to prevent urinary tract infections, given the victims\u2019 statements.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Then, Assistant Attorney General Kenneth A.

By contrast, a small and insistent group of (mostly American) scientists have taken it upon themselves to promote infant male circumcision, by conducting study after well-funded study to determine just what kinds of \u2018health benefits\u2019 might follow from cutting off parts of the penis.

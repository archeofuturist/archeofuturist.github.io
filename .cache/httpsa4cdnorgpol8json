A group either wanting to preserve their society or their culture. From there a series of events will take place, wherein the belief system which garners the most influence and power will be the one to decide how the &quot;other&quot; is treated. Of course, those who would work so hard for such power are indeed zealots, even more so if they worked this hard for their beliefs. Because of this, new laws will be put into place and acts of violence will occur against the &quot;other&quot;. How else can you ensure they don&#039;t ruin all you had worked hard for. This will culminate in arrest, execution even.<br><br>I should also note that, while certainly a tragedy in it&#039;s own right, it&#039;s not inherently evil. It is merely how a belief system, or any culture for that matter, survives the best.

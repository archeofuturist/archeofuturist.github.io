Collectivist minded and servile society with no regard to human life. They don&#039;t care about their personal wealth, freedom etc as long as Mother Russia and the Tsar is fine. They lack empathy, incapable of establishing a friendly relations on equal terms. Apart from Moscow and St Petersburg and some oil regions Russia is extremely poor and undeveloped - as the Russians are incapable of producing anything sophisticated almost the entire wealth of the country comes from it&#039;s natural resources. Except for the art and architecture directly derived either from the Greeks(all the Orthodox architecture they have horribly bastardized, icons) or Westerners(these fancy palaces in St. Petersburg) they barely have contributed to the culture at all. Considering a very large population their scientific contribution is utterly underwhelming, vastly inferior compared to the Western Slavs. Entire society is subjected to brainwashing propaganda blaming the Americans for everything, making them praise their Tsar Putin and support all the vicious acts of violence and terror. They can&#039;t even into geopolitics - Russia still pretends it&#039;s 19th century and the best way for the state to succeed is to be egoistic, xenophobic, expansive, imperialistic, overly-nationalistic and authoritarian. Russia is the true cancer of humanity and I sincerely hope it breaks apart as soon as possible.","filename":"Patton-with-quote","ext":".jpg","w":490,"h":598,"tn_w":102,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492723202713,"time":1492723202,"md5":"XJRwJkTj0aOax49LJOUQsw==","fsize":133237,"resto":122043304,"id":"P7UEGghw","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":122046330,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)17:22:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122045672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122045672<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Inb4 terrorist attacks are made by innocent muslims hacked by Putin<\/span>","time":1492723348,"resto":122043304,"id":"mkmson6o","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122046358,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)17:22:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122043304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122043304<\/a><br>You are 100% correct<br><br>Russia is third world","filename":"mum growing out hair","ext":".png","w":1436,"h":1065,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1492723363518,"time":1492723363,"md5":"nf0X4TmUmBq\/8MTBNiPfiQ==","fsize":2035040,"resto":122043304,"id":"HIMlX4pE","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122016314,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:19:51","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/brg\/ - Boston Rally General: MAY 13th EDITION","com":"\/brg\/ - Boston Rally General<br><br>On May 13th, a free speech\/pro-Trump rally will be held in the Boston Common on 139 Tremont St.<br><br>Libertarians, conservatives, classical liberals, or anyone else who supports Trump [spoiler] or just hates leftists [\/spoiler] are encouraged to attend.<br><br>Bring stickman basics at LEAST.

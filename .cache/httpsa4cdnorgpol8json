Today, Moslem countries are undergoing a similar growth in population that could well have similar results.<br><br>Throughout the 1400s, a Europe that had been reduced from 80 to 50 million people by devastating outbreaks of bubonic plague found its borders under constant pressure from conquering Moslem armies. In 1456, Constantinople fell. In 1492,Columbus sailed west seeking new paths to the orient. The old trading routes hadfallen under Moslem control. By 1500 the Christian nations of Europe were locked in a desperate struggle for survival.<br><br>Suddenly everything changed. Europe\u2019s population began to grow exponentially. Numerous explanations have been offered for this stunning increase.Some experts cite the arrival of new foods, such as the potato and maize. Others point to economic expansion and lower mortality rates. My own research has shown that after 1484, when Pope Innocent VIII decreed the death penalty for those who practiced birth control, European women began to have an average of six or seven children each, compared with two or three in earlier times.<br><br>Because a father\u2019s land went to his oldest son, Europe\u2019s \u201cpopulation bulge\u201d produced large numbers of young men who had no secure place in society. In the 1500s many of these young men became soldiers, providing ample manpower for the European armies that turned the tide of battle against Islam.","filename":"01","ext":".jpg","w":835,"h":474,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":141,"tim":1492921077240,"time":1492921077,"md5":"d2GZUmLpFjSIUQ\/R+K3TaA==","fsize":146770,"resto":0,"id":"YuIcP7S7","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gunnar-heinsohn-population-conquest-and-terror-in","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":3,"images":3},{"no":122378666,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)00:21:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122378265\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122378265<\/a><br>But Europe\u2019s rapid growth in population also placed severe strains on land and the economy. There was only one place for huge numbers of excess people to go. Europe\u2019s teachers and priests preach imperialism. Thanks to a private property-based economy and advanced military weapons, European control of the globe became child\u2019s play. Throughout the world, European explorers were followed by Europeanconquerors and settlers. Spain had a name for its youthful conquistadors. They were known as<br>&#039;Secundones&#039; second sons and those who followed. With so many youngmen seeking a place in the world, Europe \u2014 like a never-ending Mongol horde \u2014conquered nine-tenths of the Earth. When there was nothing left to conquer, European nations began to fight for each other\u2019s colonies.<br><br>Right up to the end of the first World War, Europe continuously produced large numbers of \u201cfighting-age males\u201d \u2013 i.e. between 15 and 29, the prime age for military service. In 1500, among every 1,000 men in that age bracket worldwide,about 100 came from Europe. In 1914, among every 1,000 young men worldwide,350 were either born in Europe or European in origin.<br><br>However, after Europe suffered 10 million dead in World War I, things went downhill fast. During World War II, Japan, Italy, and Germany became the last great powers that tried to take land and colonies away from others. In the years following that war, Europe\u2019s aging population lost every war it fought against young men from emerging countries.","filename":"02","ext":".jpg","w":554,"h":426,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":96,"tim":1492921288338,"time":1492921288,"md5":"c4WBnIULYXDbAQR0wm7waQ==","fsize":60171,"resto":122378265,"id":"YuIcP7S7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122378977,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)00:24:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122378666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122378666<\/a><br>Today, the \u201cwhite\u201d population level has fallen back to where it was in 1500.

With fewer \u201dfighting-age males\u201d available for military service, and with each loss on the battlefield reported in painful detail in the press, it is no surprise that today\u2019s professors and social activists preach pacifism and anti-authoritarian beliefs.<br><br>On May 9, 2005, \u201cNewsweek\u201d reported that supervisors at the Guantanamo detention camp were supposed to have put copies of the Koran into the latrines. In the violent mass demonstrations that followed in Islamic countries, 15 people were killed. The battlefields in Afghanistan and Iraq saw new waves of attacks by Islamic militants. Even the streets of London ran red with blood.<br><br>It wasn\u2019t only European pacifists who blamed an American \u201cdesecration of the Koran\u201d for these terror attacks. President Bush seemed to agree. On May 20 he sent his wife Laura on a goodwill tour to the Palestinians and the pyramids. Mrs. Bush reassures everyone that America must not be identified with misdemeanors against the verses of Allah, but only wants to bring democracy to Muslim countries. But I can\u2019t help but wonder: does President Bush know what\u2019s really happening here? Or does he agree with those who naively believe that the kings of the Aztec and Inca empires could have saved themselves by venerating the Bible and converting to Christianity?<br><br>On November 16, 1532, a Spanish priest named Father Valverde handed acopy of the Holy Bible to Atahualpa, ruler of the Incas. An interpreter explained tothe God King that the voice of the only true God spoke from this book. Refusing to convert immediately to the Catholic faith would mean a commencement of hostilities with the Imperial House of Hapsburg.","filename":"03","ext":".jpg","w":306,"h":203,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1492921446228,"time":1492921446,"md5":"C\/ULI\/m1YMSNpgcXJKqzkw==","fsize":13362,"resto":122378265,"id":"YuIcP7S7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122379302,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)00:27:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122378977\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122378977<\/a><br>Atahualpa took the sacred volume and listened to it carefully. When the pages remained mute, the Inca threw the Bible into the dust. Instantly, a special unit from the Spanish army seized Atahualpa and dragged him away. The other Spaniards opened fire. The hail of bullets killed 6,000 Indian nobles and royal bodyguards, a massacre so atrocious that 50,000 Inca warriors fled in panic. The 180 Europeans did not lose a single man. For his desecration of the Bible, Atahualpa is condemned to death by burning. His last-minute conversion, however, brought an act of mercy. He was strangled instead.<br><br>Due to this abominable desecration of the Bible, the Spanish king is told, the Inca Empire was to be subjugated and its heathen civilization is destroyed. A fifth of the Inca gold will, of course, go to the crown. <br><br>All of Europe understood that a less violent punishment for this act of desecration would not have been acceptable. But it soon became clear that a defense of Christianity was not the cause \u2014 or even the primary cause \u2014 that incited young Secundones to undertake such slaughter. Even if Atahualpa had immediately converted, the Conquistadores would have found a different justification for his elimination. The Spaniards would not have calmly and happily sailed back home toCadiz. Yes, they threw themselves to the floor and called on the Virgin Mary to assist them before they set to work. And after each victory they praised the lord. But in their war cry -- \u201cGold, fame, and gospel\u201d \u2013 we see their real motives on display.Religion takes third place.<br><br>However, in troubled times religions are very useful. Whether conquistadores or Islamic radicals, young men do not want to come to power as ordinary murderers or suicidal psychopaths. In order to become honorable executioners, they search for a lofty standpoint from which the killing appears to be the last bloodshed before salvation. Therefore Europeans become Christianists and Muslims, Islamists.","filename":"04","ext":".jpg","w":237,"h":262,"tn_w":113,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492921632045,"time":1492921632,"md5":"mNJy+2rZBJgmlQWSuvGsCg==","fsize":13826,"resto":122378265,"id":"YuIcP7S7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122373253,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:32:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Imagine her laying down next to you whispering sweet nothings into your ear like..<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;stupid kikes, fucking Jew bastards<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dumb niggers<\/span><br>Etc etc<br><br>Should could have been \/ourgirl\/, instead we chose a Jew loving cuckboy.

Sure lots of people that are gay due it for aesthetics, but most do it to keep their body in shape so they can do chores and take care of their family.","time":1492993480,"resto":122507633,"id":"XC6PG7OH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122514934,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:25:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122510340\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122510340<\/a><br>because gyms are for poor faggots that cant into free weights","time":1492993538,"resto":122507633,"id":"NWH5b1wv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122516273,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:36:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122507633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122507633<\/a><br>Worth it.<br>A few workouts a week help you look a lot better and blow off stress of work or grad school or family, whatever else you&#039;re dealing with.","time":1492994216,"resto":122507633,"id":"M5oKyBMu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122516228,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:36:36","name":"Anonymous","sub":"BILL MAHER IS ANTI-MARS!","com":"what do you say to this cunt<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=mrG<wbr>FEW2Hb2g","filename":"MaherEarthFI-678x381","ext":".jpg","w":678,"h":381,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492994196860,"time":1492994196,"md5":"cY8P8tN2x1ck8q5a8ZwC8A==","fsize":19142,"resto":0,"id":"2c1BVFvQ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bill-maher-is-antimars","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122513951,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:17:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do you plan on voting for my dad in 2020, anon?<\/span>","filename":"it","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492993072553,"time":1492993072,"md5":"MKfaeBQ65ixBrX1pyf+GTA==","fsize":42497,"resto":0,"id":"E7FJu8pt","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"do-you-plan-on-voting-for-my-dad-in-2020-anon","country_name":"United States","replies":45,"images":13,"omitted_posts":40,"omitted_images":13},{"no":122515778,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:32:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fuck Trump and fuck Jewish people!","time":1492993959,"resto":122513951,"id":"3faW5vWd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122516051,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:35:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122515376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122515376<\/a><br>That&#039;s a pastie, you faggot.","time":1492994103,"resto":122513951,"id":"Mq0NNkkd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122516115,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:35:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122515550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122515550<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;man of the house<\/span><br><br>Implying his dick wasn&#039;t cut off and sacrificed to the kikes","time":1492994136,"resto":122513951,"id":"JMps7YLS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122516127,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:35:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122513951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122513951<\/a><br>I would but I&#039;m getting raptures on September 23rd, so...","filename":"TheRappening","ext":".jpg","w":1160,"h":6760,"tn_w":21,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492994140136,"time":1492994140,"md5":"LDZhDFxSabJauiT4wi9dOg==","fsize":1436767,"resto":122513951,"id":"l6VA9yXl","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122516204,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:36:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122513951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122513951<\/a><br>Ivanka is very proud of her daddy.","filename":"Proud of daddy","ext":".png","w":639,"h":491,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1492994187201,"time":1492994187,"md5":"qr3FOOcICYdRtOQN\/kpBHA==","fsize":85021,"resto":122513951,"id":"DDe\/MT\/o","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122506147,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:18:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Look at the future president of France, so patethic with his mom, he should find a wife, or husband, i dont know","filename":"ZfnBABm","ext":".jpg","w":682,"h":1024,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492989490108,"time":1492989490,"md5":"3oR+7ikQMRC34lMcnhSRsw==","fsize":168307,"resto":0,"id":"QXVUPDcW","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"look-at-the-future-president-of-france-so","country_name":"Spain","replies":22,"images":2,"omitted_posts":17,"omitted_images":1},{"no":122515292,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:28:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122513876\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122513876<\/a><br>Man, the mememagic is strong with Mecruck","time":1492993715,"resto":122506147,"id":"LmjSAQ5D","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":122515319,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:28:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122506147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122506147<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he should find a wife, or husband, i dont know<\/span><br><br>This.

White people are the current day native Americans, we must stop squabbling about whether or not we like their country as a whole because in truth we are all brothers. Americans have niggers and spics in our country, it is not as our founding fathers would have wanted it, and it is not how we want it. Great Britain, France, Sweden, Germany, all of Europe really has problems with Muslims and Africans surging into their country, are they cucks because of it? No, they do not wish this to happen to their country, they are here for that very reason. This is not a time to divide our countries into countries, but a time to rise together under a new defined identity of whiteness. Any who subvert this cause are the enemy, banter is all good and well, but true hatred for another country where white people struggle against leeches is evil. There is a huge problem in this forum of people who are simply angry at their own lives, and therefore have a lot of hatred inside them, this is not conducive to our goals, look at the skinheads, they are laughed at and are in summation, merely white criminals. We must be more than simple oafs who work in factories, our message not of hatred but of love of your people. This is the critical mistake, and it must end. I encourage you to call out this anti-white subversive commentary when you see it, no matter the country. If an American calls a Swede a cuck or if a Swede calls an American a nigger, this cannot stand, A house divided against itself cannot stand. <br><br>This thread is dedicated to the Unity of the White race, feel free to post anything which makes you proud of white achievement or merely discuss your observations on this site.","filename":"1486589874247","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492987188012,"time":1492987188,"md5":"Qj3MKtZcAfvqzN4vzcjkiQ==","fsize":80426,"resto":0,"id":"A9xjq+fq","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"unity-among-whites","trip":"!P6sRzr5956","country_name":"United States","replies":336,"images":67,"omitted_posts":331,"omitted_images":67,"tail_size":50},{"no":122516988,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:43:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122516837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122516837<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;uneducated retard is a civic (((nationalist))) leaning cuckold <\/span><br>Surprise surprise","time":1492994604,"resto":122501010,"id":"DfYKcECu","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":122517038,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:43:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122516781\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122516781<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Certainly we can ally with non-whites in the short term if there are mutual interests<\/span><br>You can literally ally under MAGA and civic nationalism (inb4 hurrrr kosher nationalism) and work to reform the immigration system.<br><br>Fun fact: Trump DID say during the campaign that he supports reforming the legal immigration system back to historic levels (pre 1965).<br><br>If you abandon Trump like Richard Spencer has done, what the fuck do you have?

It&#039;s better to tear it down, start again and proceed with more caution.","time":1492992397,"resto":122500842,"id":"j80aHBPx","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122513268,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:12:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122501698\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122501698<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we just need mo money fo dem programs<\/span>","time":1492992764,"resto":122500842,"id":"jPkmBrnI","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122513875,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:17:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122508014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122508014<\/a><br>Careful there mate, you don&#039;t wanna go to prison for antisemitism by insulting Goldberg&#039;s favorite president.","time":1492993035,"resto":122500842,"id":"V1DA1IXo","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122515080,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:26:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122500842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122500842<\/a><br>He&#039;s kinda cute tbqh","time":1492993610,"resto":122500842,"id":"RBMYr6qM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122516151,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:35:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122500842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122500842<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(((Emmanuel)))<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Macron paid \u20ac50,000 to buy himself out of his government contract in 2008, and left to work as an investment banker at a highly-paid position at Rothschild &amp; Cie Banque.<\/span>","filename":"1491581903551","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":1024,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492994155062,"time":1492994155,"md5":"80TAEwQiYRu84QUnAO4hWg==","fsize":62850,"resto":122500842,"id":"a3duVHMt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122493728,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)17:47:44","name":"Anonymous","sub":"HAHA Antifa faggot instantly arrested after assaulting a guy","com":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JackPosobiec\/st<wbr>atus\/856250305029300224","filename":"Captura de pantalla 2017-04-23 a la(s) 16.46.16","ext":".png","w":497,"h":274,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":137,"tim":1492984064277,"time":1492984064,"md5":"zvgPC\/84Oojkdyg73nivuQ==","fsize":241954,"resto":0,"id":"6x0DV2xv","country":"MX","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"haha-antifa-faggot-instantly-arrested-after","country_name":"Mexico","replies":73,"images":22,"omitted_posts":68,"omitted_images":21},{"no":122514311,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:20:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122514056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122514056<\/a><br>ISBN 978-0670132638","time":1492993242,"resto":122493728,"id":"EtZ24Zos","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122514652,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:23:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122493728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122493728<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122495942\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122495942<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122499450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122499450<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122505348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122505348<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122512722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122512722<\/a><br>oh boy here we go","filename":"Lord Farquaad","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":280,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492993404946,"time":1492993404,"md5":"5lM\/By3aUgwnE8jSZRDD+Q==","fsize":66521,"resto":122493728,"id":"AFdRk36S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122514935,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:25:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/lacymacauley<br><br>leader of AFA in DC","filename":"c1660f2b5c70404b45bb36ba8649d318[1]","ext":".png","w":650,"h":250,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":48,"tim":1492993539708,"time":1492993539,"md5":"wWYPK1xwQEtFuza6hknTGA==","fsize":32656,"resto":122493728,"id":"sE3JsyaR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122515053,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:26:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122493728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122493728<\/a><br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH<wbr>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br>*inhales*<br>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<wbr>HA<br><br>bump","filename":"smilingTearPepe","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":495,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1492993600238,"time":1492993600,"md5":"NqjodXR4GF\/F+OCWhtSzzQ==","fsize":61577,"resto":122493728,"id":"EUBAKOht","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122516140,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:35:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122514935\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122514935<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Video clearly shows that nothing happened.<\/span><br>I..

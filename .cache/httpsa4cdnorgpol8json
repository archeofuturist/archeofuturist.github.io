He agreed.<br><br>That still wasn\u2019t enough, Alabi says.<br><br>In addition to the 24-hour notice, and the prayer times, they also wanted him to text in advance. But when he texted them, they didn\u2019t reply - so he stopped.<br><br>And then there was the issue of removing his shoes. At the tribunal, the couple said they prayed in their bedroom and the floor had to remain clean. Yet Alabi claims the couple never had a problem before when he wore his shoes to make repairs in the apartment. And he wasn\u2019t wearing outside shoes, but the shoes he wore in his own home. He\u2019d come around to their apartment wearing rubbers over them and then take them off at the door. For that, he was accused of being racist.","filename":"(((macleans)))","ext":".jpg","w":501,"h":676,"tn_w":185,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493908772548,"time":1493908772,"md5":"7Y8q4\/CiU0AnLCo7xS07NA==","fsize":37112,"resto":0,"id":"v5pTvSH0","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"canada-is-a-muslim-country","country_name":"Canada","replies":54,"images":16,"omitted_posts":49,"omitted_images":13},{"no":124079876,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:57:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124068865\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124068865<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124068531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124068531<\/a><br>You chinks need to be flayed alive.<br><br>Fucking vile parasites and invaders.","time":1493917074,"resto":124065860,"id":"EJmnC1Nc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124080033,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:59:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124078260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124078260<\/a><br>What do we do if Trudeau wins another term?

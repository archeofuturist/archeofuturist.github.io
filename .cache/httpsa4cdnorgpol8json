I&#039;ve come here from r\/politics to debate with you the virtues of modern socialism. I will try my best to answer reasonable questions and will ignore obvious trolling. I would encourage you to debate us on reddit but the userbase here seems averse to leaving it&#039;s hugbox and judging by a quick glance at the lowbrow content posted here, the average user probably wouldn&#039;t meet community standards. I would love to keep our discussion light and somewhat informal, but please refrain from using profanity as I frown upon distasteful discourse.","time":1492667198,"resto":121959456,"id":"uBt\/iYZn","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121933623,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)21:51:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s that time of the year \/pol\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Go to wikipedia<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Select random article<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You have 3 clicks to get to Hitler<\/span><br><br>Hard mode: You can&#039;t click &quot;WW2&quot;<br>Jew in Auschwitz mode: You can&#039;t click &quot;Germany&quot; either.","filename":"1440078291563","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":960,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492653097850,"time":1492653097,"md5":"4tjoykJEe5fr\/SSd25S+Ig==","fsize":77767,"resto":0,"id":"VB7YV8gt","country":"AR","bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-that-time-of-the-year-pol","country_name":"Argentina","replies":306,"images":36,"omitted_posts":301,"omitted_images":36,"tail_size":50},{"no":121959911,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:50:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"hard challenge: you have to get to <br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Blond<wbr>i <br>but you cant click on hitler or german shepard","time":1492667419,"resto":121933623,"id":"qtqg5wYE","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":121959934,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:50:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"1957 Grand National &lt;click&gt; Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother &lt;click&gt; Nazi germany &lt;click&gt; Addy","time":1492667434,"resto":121933623,"id":"jqfE+GJf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121959936,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:50:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"I did it!<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Madri<wbr>d_Metro<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Dicta<wbr>torship<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Adolf<wbr>_Hitler","time":1492667436,"resto":121933623,"id":"nIw3H+Ty","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121960370,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:55:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121933623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121933623<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lis<wbr>t_of_one-hit_wonders_in_Ireland#\/ra<wbr>ndom<br>https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Uni<wbr>ted_Kingdom<br>https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Naz<wbr>i_Germany<br>https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ado<wbr>lf_Hitler<br><br>Not bad","time":1492667711,"resto":121933623,"id":"3hJHWtal","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121960494,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:56:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Renaissance Centre (Erie, Pennsylvania) (starting location)<br><br>Roaring Twenties<br>Albert Einstein<br>Adolf Hitler<br><br>worship me fuckfaces","time":1492667788,"resto":121933623,"id":"jqfE+GJf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121954518,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:54:26","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Bike lock antifag identified","com":"He&#039;s a philosophy professor who teahces a class called &quot;A feminist critique of human nature essentialism&quot;<br><br>https:\/\/www.everipedia.com\/eric-cla<wbr>nton\/","filename":"berkeley4","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":375,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492664066458,"time":1492664066,"md5":"sqDdZ5z3srOytm9osPYOiw==","fsize":33987,"resto":0,"id":"gaEsD3kJ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bike-lock-antifag-identified","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":2,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":2},{"no":121955846,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:07:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"What&#039;s the proofs?","time":1492664879,"resto":121954518,"id":"nINcWj6i","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121956105,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:10:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121954903\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121954903<\/a><br>I did call campus police.

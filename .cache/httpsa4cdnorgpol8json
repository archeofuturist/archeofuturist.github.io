Why do you think certain areas of the globe haven&#039;t really advanced like the West? Look at the Middle East, it&#039;s like they are still living in the times of Jesus.

It&#039;s no paradise, but it seems like they are better off than most other parts of Africa. I think it&#039;s because the British colonized South Africa and spread &quot;civilization&quot; to them.

Can they cope with a potentially declining customer base and rising import prices?<br><br>For Anish and Minal Shah, the jury is out. The couple first started selling east European foods at their south-west London convenience store in 2004. Anish says: \u201cOur initial inspiration was one customer, a local childminder from Slovakia. She made the case for us to try a small test order. We sold our first batch in three days and thought we really could be on to something.\u201d<br><br>Following this success, in 2006 the Shahs launched e-commerce site Halusky selling EU speciality foods. Now their business is the UK\u2019s biggest importer of Czech and Slovak confectionery, grocery and drinks.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-10 at 11.50.15 AM","ext":".png","w":629,"h":638,"tn_w":246,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491817972147,"time":1491817972,"md5":"Tw1hS24GHESuNGVTPZbmGg==","fsize":506183,"resto":0,"id":"uxF27vIh","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-dont-know-what-to-say-brexit-seems-to-be-4d","country_name":"Germany","replies":216,"images":41,"omitted_posts":211,"omitted_images":41,"tail_size":50},{"no":120436234,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)09:08:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120435215\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120435215<\/a><br><br>Think of it as an investment, lose money now so you can make more money latter without a giant group of low IQ trash ruining everything.","time":1491829708,"resto":120419986,"id":"WmbQxwrt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120437903,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)09:27:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;this fucking thread<\/span><br>Divide and conquer shills hard at work today.

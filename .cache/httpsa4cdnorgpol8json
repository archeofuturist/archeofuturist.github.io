The ability to perform the logically absurd is not included in the definition of &quot;omnipotence.&quot; Just because God is omnipotent and omnibenevolent, does not necessarily mean evil shouldn&#039;t exist.<br>Evil is not necessarily what is meant by &quot;evil&quot; here, anyway (for example: &quot;Anything that causes pain or goes against muh fee fees is evil :(&quot; is not necessarily a true proposition). Whether or not God can be &#039;malevolent&#039; depends on what is meant by &quot;evil.&quot;<br>It is only assumed that there is no possible case in which allowing evil is not evil (counterexample: if it were necessary for the existence of good).<br>&quot;Evil&quot; is never defined. If evil just means &quot;consciously causing suffering or harm,&quot; then allowing it doesn&#039;t mean God is malevolent, no matter how much Epicurus wants to whine about it.<br>Pain and suffering are often necessary to bring people to God and to truth in the first place, as people are forced to humble themselves and relinquish their pride.","filename":"1490570697398[1]","ext":".jpg","w":613,"h":412,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":168,"tim":1490574058110,"time":1490574058,"md5":"zMlDGhSg7tZERXGtdp7GIQ==","fsize":154203,"resto":0,"id":"ixu\/Aa\/n","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"that-atheists-cite-pic-related-like-theyre-saying","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":0,"omitted_posts":9,"omitted_images":0},{"no":118446050,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:44:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Better than when they post the God is dead quote, but don&#039;t understand it was a warning from Nietzsche, not a celebration.","time":1490575453,"resto":118443178,"id":"enMad1N+","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118446081,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:44:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118445453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118445453<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;burden of proof<\/span><br><br>the last refuge of the atheist.

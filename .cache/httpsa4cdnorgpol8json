The first thing to remember is that equality and tolerance is the virtue that&#039;s being preached to kids these days. Everyone gets a trophy, women are just as strong as men, and just because someone is better than you in every way doesn&#039;t mean that they are. And of course, most millennials grow up in an era of vast income inequality and with their equality lenses, see only injustice. And because communism is all about equality, that means it&#039;s good right? Of course, anyone who knows anything about communism knows that it&#039;s absolutely awful and will skullfuck your individual freedoms into oblivion. Which brings us to the second point, millennials are either not learning about communism at all, or if they are they are getting a heavily pro-communist message. This is all because of the strong Marxist presence in the education system. They&#039;re everywhere and they have a stranglehold in academia to the point that they call the shots on what your kids learn. But why are these educators Marxists? They don&#039;t have the excuse of ignorance like millennials. But they do have a common factors with millennials and that is the anti-nationalist mindset. Nationalism is what created Hitler and got us into Vietnam, Korea, Afghanistan, and Iraq. Both these hippie era educators and millennials grew up during times when resentment towards foreign wars and as a result, became hyper-critical of not only their own government, but their entire civilization as a result of critical theory and postmodernist schools of thought that they learned in universities. Critical theory is a school of thought that originated in the Frankfurt school but moved over to the United States, courtesy of good old Adolf.

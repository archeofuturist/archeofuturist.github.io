lived in a suburb with many 1st and 2nd gen Asian immigrants, dated 2 Asians in highschool and college and pursued STEM in the UC system, I feel I&#039;ve gotten to know enough Asian-Americans to make

So I&#039;m asking \/pol\/ not from a state of ignorance but genuine curiosity as to the nature of my personal observations.<br><br>In my experience they are more tolerable than shitskins of all variety but absolutely unequal mentally to white people. We all know the meme that Asians have high IQ. We observe that they have somewhat of a drive toward measurable personal achievement, and that they strictly abide by a general moral code albeit an overly collectivist one. These are undeniably positive cultural traits and in the end they are the redeeming aspects of gooks. <br><br>However any mildly intelligent white person is unable to avoid the concurrent observation that even highly Americanized Asians are nearly invariably boring\/intellectually empty\/humorless\/conformist\/milqueto<wbr>ast retards.

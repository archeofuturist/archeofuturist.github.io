All you need is a thought, a catalyst, some basic understanding of how the human mind works and in a bit of time, presto, you can change the course of history with a strategic use of words. When you learn an idea that completely goes against everything that you once believed. A preconceived notion shattering, an idea that is too ludicrous or illogical, you as a conscious person, a person with a natural bias, an ego will treat the idea with skepticism or flat out dis-reject the idea on a conscious level. But its funny how the brain works. What you learn and choose to reject or not reject on a conscious level, will still end up getting absorbed by your subconscious mind irregardless of your selection, on an unconscious level to you. And within some time, albeit with a few weeks, a few months, that seed, that new idea, will eventually grow and take form till it eventually consumes your thinking and belief system. That idea that you completely forgot about and initially rejected, will have you consciously come to terms with it on your own accordance, believing you came up with the idea, or not, but what does hold objectively true is that you agree with the idea. You can call it subliminal marketing but instead of selling a product, your shifting the make up of society. With a bit of dedication, what you truly believe in can alter and change the ideas of thousands of men who will eventually shape up the ideas of millions of men, who will then go out and shape up the meta functioning of the society as a whole, and on a grandiloquent scale, the direction of where history is heading towards. Whenever your brain will make you realize that new idea, you believe you came onto on your own terms according to your ego, but do know that the conclusion came to realization by the manipulation of forces outside of your understanding or perception.<\/span>","time":1491018500,"resto":119139348,"id":"0poyz3tu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119140426,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:51:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119139641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119139641<\/a><br>what&#039;s that site? i&#039;m thinking of bhying a house","time":1491018691,"resto":119139348,"id":"6N9v0QKi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119141469,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:02:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119140116\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119140116<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;irregardless<\/span><br>written by a dumbass","time":1491019367,"resto":119139348,"id":"hvkOBgiK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119138966,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:36:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying a Turk would hug a Jew<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that nigger on the right that was to lazy to finish the equation on his shirt<\/span>","filename":"doodle-4-google-2017-us-winner-5145189378162688-thp","ext":".png","w":402,"h":220,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":136,"tim":1491017776157,"time":1491017776,"md5":"wdL6D\/uQP744uaMc8gnzkg==","fsize":27817,"resto":0,"id":"9cGlL3K9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"implying-a-turk-would-hug-a-jew","country_name":"United States","replies":17,"images":5,"omitted_posts":12,"omitted_images":5},{"no":119140606,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:53:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119140471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119140471<\/a><br><br>Very nice canada, it took me a second there.

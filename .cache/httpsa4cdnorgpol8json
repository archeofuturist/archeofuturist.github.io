This of course doesn&#039;t mean that all black women are less attractive, but on average they are. According to the study, men among all races thought this was the case. One possible explanation could be that black women got way more masculine traits than women of other races, and that&#039;s why they are perceived as less attractive among men.<br>Why do you guys think that black women are less attractive than others? Personally as a self-claimed race biologist, I just think that they are inferior in terms of looks and intelligence since black people are an outdated version of humans.

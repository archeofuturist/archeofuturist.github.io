I dated her when I was a teenager so I spent a considerable amount of time with her family. <br><br>Even when I dated her when bluepilled I said that &quot;jewish memes are set up so to make a successful diaspora population, such as extreme in group preference and the limiting of interethnic marriage ensured that the jews would not just get absorbed by the host culture.&quot; At the time I didn&#039;t think this was a bad thing because I had not yet put the pieces together. <br><br>Her dad seemed very redpilled in a way and he said things like &quot;jews should not run countries&quot; which I assumed meant he disagreed with the policies of israel but looking back might have been something more because he also said that situations like nazi germany only ever happened when jews begun to leave their tight communities and become part of the wider culture and politics. Me being naive assumed that this meant they were giving up the extreme ethnocentrism but they actually don&#039;t give up the ethnocentrism. They are contributing to the wider culture and politics without actually being a part of the wider culture so they have zero incentive to preserve it, and in some cases might actually work against it for the good of the jewish community. One of these ways is rejecting nationalism because when you engage in ethno-nationalism the natural question arises &quot;what do you do about the jews?&quot;. the origin of the Jewish Question predated hitler and the nazis and is just a natural thing that arises from nationalism. <br><br>It was naive to assume the jews were not ethnocentrist because her parents clearly were because her mom complain that a jewish piano guy would not help her son do some piano stuff. she thought he would help her son because they were both jewish.

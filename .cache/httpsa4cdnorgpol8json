As fetuses develop, all are outfitted with the anatomical precursors to nipples, although they only offer a direct reproductive advantage to women for feeding their babies. But since that&#039;s such a favorable trait, evolution didn&#039;t go to the painstaking trouble of weeding nipples out of the male population. In other words, men have nipples because women do. Likewise, clitoral and penile tissues are borne of the same embryological stuff, developing into one or the other once biological sex traits set in. The hooded glans, packed with 8,000 nerve endings, is just the visible tip of the internal clitoral structure that extends up and around the vagina and engorges during arousal much like the penis [source: Gonzalez]. Therefore, female orgasms could exist because that clitoral anatomy was under no evolutionary pressure to disappear.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/health.howstuffworks.com\/se<wbr>xual-health\/sexuality\/orgasm4.htm<\/span><br><br>Thoughts?","filename":"orgasms-4","ext":".jpg","w":360,"h":240,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490420025878,"time":1490420025,"md5":"EUrzSNpMy\/OVfsE0fbMVYQ==","fsize":8409,"resto":0,"id":"oXfcAT7Z","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"female-orgasm-is-an-evolutionary-byproduct-from","country_name":"United States","replies":117,"images":18,"omitted_posts":112,"omitted_images":17,"tail_size":50},{"no":118204936,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:43:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;d rather just not know this stuff","time":1490431388,"resto":118191051,"id":"b7i3wg2+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118205276,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:48:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118204834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118204834<\/a><br>Oh no my gf is Murcan.

It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490432380419,"time":1490432380,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"lit19FvC","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":11,"images":2,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":1},{"no":118206890,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)05:13:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118206846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118206846<\/a><br>Thank you, i will.","time":1490433188,"resto":118205996,"id":"lit19FvC","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":118206946,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)05:14:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Agnosticism is the only true intellectual position.","filename":"9b1038eda4c79eccf5d232e463844ccc","ext":".jpg","w":312,"h":445,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490433244469,"time":1490433244,"md5":"Z4IFJaoFJRU1P4AhM1pfBg==","fsize":45142,"resto":118205996,"id":"oxF11bQ5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118206965,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)05:14:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118206890\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118206890<\/a><br>Maybe you should take a tour of Christian sub-Saharan Africa to prepare yourself for the future of your religion?","time":1490433260,"resto":118205996,"id":"qHo3yzIT","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118207389,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)05:21:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118206965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118206965<\/a><br>Maybe you should jump into a furnace to prepare for your onw?","time":1490433674,"resto":118205996,"id":"lit19FvC","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":118207824,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)05:28:17","name":"Saged","com":"<a href=\"#p118205996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118205996<\/a><br>Not this retarded thread again..<br>Atheism isn&#039;t a religion.<br>Stop virtue signalling already.","time":1490434097,"resto":118205996,"id":"AjgQ+bcy","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118182283,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)23:58:13","name":"Anonymous","sub":"I FLY THIS - THINGS ARE SOON TO SHTF","com":"Ask me almost anything","filename":"8675309","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":1312,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":164,"tim":1490414293187,"time":1490414293,"md5":"VsZdmVUWNxjFeaqUj9bhSA==","fsize":580795,"resto":0,"id":"iSVO1Nfm","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-fly-this-things-are-soon-to-shtf","country_name":"United States","replies":184,"images":40,"omitted_posts":179,"omitted_images":39,"tail_size":50},{"no":118206945,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)05:14:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118182283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118182283<\/a><br>Thats just a Viking refueler. bah.

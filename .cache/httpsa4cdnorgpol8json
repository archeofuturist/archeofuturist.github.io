But very rarely did people see that activity as inherent in their personalities.<br><br>The people who support homosexuality would be the first to admit that sexuality can be messy. Men are wired to like women and women are wired to like men. But the differences between men and women in the human species are subtle. They are not cartoonish musclemen and bimbos. For most people, the differences are slight variations in shoulder width, hip size, facial features etc.<br>Men are mostly attracted to females, but would they be attracted to men with female features? Society&#039;s recent obsession with sexualized crossdressing gives you the answer. And that is just the physical aspect. The main part of sexuality is about psychological things like dominance, submission, etc. We all want to be dominant, or submissive, or both. It makes things even more messy.<br><br>Considering this, the very label &quot;homosexual&quot; is pointless. LGBT activists think that it is &quot;empowering&quot; to reduce their entire identity down to sexual acts. But that is a serious mistake. &quot;Homosexuals&quot; just don&#039;t exist. Just as people aren&#039;t totally wholly and discetely fixated on the opposite sex, no one is 100% gay with no turning back.

Sexual problems like these shouldn&#039;t be treated as identities or even sicknesses unto themselves, but as symptoms of a larger problem.<br><br>The best way to help people with same sex attraction is to discourage labeling themselves, and make them aware that, no matter what the circumstances, blindly chasing after lustful pursuits, whether in the same sex, opposite sex, or by yourself, is never going to bring you lasting happiness.

2020 census might start including LGBTQ subjects were raised and then quickly dashed on Tuesday after the U.S. Census admitted that it had &quot;inadvertently&quot; included &quot;sexual orientation&quot; and &quot;gender identity,&quot; in a long-awaited report outlining new categories for the survey. In response, GLAAD&#039;s CEO, Sarah Kate Ellis, branded the move as a &quot;systematic effort on behalf of the Trump administrationn to erase LGBT people.&quot; Last year, various federal agencies urged the Census Bureau to include sexual orientation and gender in their data as it was crucial to their role in enforcing the law. The survey, which has been conducted every ten years since 1790, includes a wide range of questions designed to gather data on everything from languages spoken to household plumbing facilities. The current census, however, only allows for a snapshot of same-sex households, but Democrats in Congress had pushed for more specific questions around sexual orientation and gender identity to improve results. The logic was simple: With more focused questions law makers would be better equipped to ensure appropriate legislation to improve the lives of LGBTQ citizens.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Although the Supreme Court, in 2013, struck down the Defense of Marriage Act, paving the way for the census to change the way it tracks same-sex households, the White House has sent yet another powerful signal that it considers LGBTQ concerns as frivolous.<\/span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Meghan Maury, Criminal and Economic Justice Project Director of the National LGBTQ Task Force released a statement:<\/span><br><br>Cont.","filename":"ayrans","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490840854176,"time":1490840854,"md5":"u61vFsXs+DiifPlAOX7xVg==","fsize":238521,"resto":0,"id":"riLVNqRW","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-omits-people","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":1,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":0},{"no":118870723,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)22:38:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118869534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118869534<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;we don&#039;t need to know what you identify as or what you like in the bedroom<\/span><br>OH FUCK<br><br>IT&#039;S OVER<br><br>DRUMPH BTFO","time":1490841531,"resto":118869534,"id":"bVRuL5zZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118872454,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)22:54:44","name":"Anonymous","com":".<br>Join the OFFICIAL \/polgb\/ Discord:<br><br>https:\/\/discord.gg\/cUU3J","filename":"polgbt2","ext":".jpg","w":1420,"h":1922,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490842484630,"time":1490842484,"md5":"ADb2VxQmSSjdFAk\/qMUCew==","fsize":103728,"resto":118869534,"id":"KzyZMTm4","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118872887,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)22:58:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118869769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118869769<\/a><br>Can you get rid of those gay people out of my thread?","time":1490842731,"resto":118869534,"id":"riLVNqRW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118872954,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)22:59:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"why do you guys need a discord to talk about fags?","time":1490842767,"resto":118869534,"id":"ssbLC+1x","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118873264,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)23:02:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118869586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118869586<\/a><br>what does sexual orientation have to do with the census?

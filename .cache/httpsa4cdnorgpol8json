It originated when the Normans conquered England. The plebs of England were not allowed to speak Old English and either couldn&#039;t learn or weren&#039;t allowed to speak the Norman language, which resembled modern French but with more Latin. <br><br>A &quot;pidgin&quot; language was born, which is when two languages are bastardized for easy communication, like using the phrase &quot;number 1&quot; during the US-Vietnam war to mean &quot;very good&quot; or &quot;high quality&quot;<br><br>Over time this evolved into middle English, which looks like German took a shit on Modern English (or conversely, that French and Latin took a shit on Old English)<br><br>The printing press, combined with the English love of story-telling and the literary genius of guys like Shakespeare and Christopher Marlowe actually caused English to evolve into the most descriptive and variable language in history. <br><br>Most languages don&#039;t have dozens of synonyms for every word, they don&#039;t (or didn&#039;t at the time) borrow words from other languages as readily as English-speakers always have, and because English became the language of some of the most influential literary and philosophical minds of the last 500 years, it is remarkably intact and verbose. <br><br>This might have just been a fluke though, because only recently (relative to history) have common people had access to education, literature, and written communication. <br><br>Educators have become increasingly less strict when teaching English and more emphasis is put on teaching contemporary work. Writers are not as valued by society now that we all have infinite videos, music, gaming, etc, so you have a population that generally doesn&#039;t care about grammar and vocabulary the way previous generations have valued those things. <br><br>Combine that with street slang, internet slang, and technology and in 50 years a love-letter written in the 90s might be like reading King James&#039; English.","time":1491809403,"resto":120400124,"id":"eRPptD9B","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120409221,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)03:30:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120402195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120402195<\/a><br>Haha fuck you I was at multiple Trump rallies ALL UP IN the protesters shit every time.

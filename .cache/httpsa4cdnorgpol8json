Last year alone, there were 431 such acid attacks \u2013 a rise of 170 cases from the year prior. The figures match a general UK trend, in which the crime rate for such attacks has risen by 50% since 2005.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Globally, roughly 80% of victims tend to women. Attacks are often carried out by vengeful men who have had their marriage proposals or sexual advances rebuffed. However, acid attack charities in the UK estimate that British victims are predominantly men, at roughly 71% of victims. Jaf Shah, the executive director of the support group Acid Survivors Trust International (ASTI), told the Guardian: &quot;Looking at the data in general, there is a fairly large probability that a high percentage of the incidents are male-on-male attacks and most likely to be gang-related.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;The numbers appear to be very high and suggest an increase, which is very concerning.&quot; A former gang member described how acid attacks had become more acceptable and were not seen as a &quot;big deal&quot;. &quot;People don&#039;t think of the consequences,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#039;s easy to buy most of the ingredients legally\u2026One of my cousins was done a few years ago. He was attacked on his shoulder and my uncle just dressed it for him at home.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/archive.fo\/2hi2g<br><br>This is some third world tier shit.

I&#039;m very disillusioned at the moment. For all that right-wingers kick up a fuss about leftist bullshit, there&#039;s no actual way to stop their values from sinking in. The female vote was once an outrageous concept, and conservatives 100+ years ago resisted and complained about it. In spite of this, it is considered as normal now as a man&#039;s right to vote was in the early 1900s. The same thing is happening again with the acceptance of transfags. People aren&#039;t fully convinced yet, but the idea that gender can be decided by the individual will be as normal in the year 2120 as our conception of biologically determined gender is now. The point I&#039;m trying to make isn&#039;t about transgenderism in particular, though. I&#039;m just using it as an example to illustrate the inevitability of left-wing ideas rooting themselves into society.<br><br>The conservative mindset operates under the false assumption that the two sides have an equal chance of winning \u2013 that, by resisting lefty bollocks, you can keep tradition intact. But, in reality, it amounts to nothing more than a delaying tactic. Once a libshit idea enters mainstream consciousness, the battle is already lost. The best conservatives can do is slow down the rate at which it is accepted by the populace, but its eventual acceptance is inevitable at that point.<br><br>If you look back on history, our overall movement has been towards the left rather than the right.","filename":"8fjd52bf","ext":".jpg","w":745,"h":1119,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490185111120,"time":1490185111,"md5":"XgroyT4VetXH9kz8t1hwOw==","fsize":117914,"resto":0,"id":"A6ARSFPJ","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-you-deal-with-the-fact-that-youre","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":43,"images":12,"omitted_posts":38,"omitted_images":10},{"no":117758954,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)09:41:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117752508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117752508<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the idea that gender can be chosen will be accepted by the 22nd century<\/span><br><br>not even that, in a more or less distant future, we might fully be able to reconstruct human bodies on a microbiological level or create androids and transport conciousnesses into different bodies whether they&#039;re male\/female<br><br>unless we do discover that a spiritual kind of &quot;soul&quot; exists and can&#039;t be seperated from a conciousness or even be interacted with at all, these changes will take place and boy is it gonna get weird","filename":"1487429920212","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490190106270,"time":1490190106,"md5":"T3iAs2386ctzyzSab1q2Og==","fsize":55169,"resto":117752508,"id":"9hk9svY2","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":117759196,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)09:44:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117752508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117752508<\/a><br>OP, start working out, learn practical skills, learn how to use a gun if that&#039;s legal on cuck island.

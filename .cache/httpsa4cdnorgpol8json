It would cut our costs of going to orbit from about $2000\/kg to about $1\/kg. There are individual asteroids that have tens of trillions of dollars in materials on them that could be mined. One mission could easily pay for the cost of building the Orbital Ring.<br><br>We could then deploy solar power satellites in orbit above cloud cover and return the power back to the surface with near zero loss by running power transmission cables down the elevator, and sell the power at a profit.<br><br>With increased luminosity in space, enhanced exposure time, and the ability to deliver base loads, solar panels pay for themselves in only 1-2 years while having a 20 year life time.<br><br>In other words, if you put $5 trillion of solar panels into space, you get your $5 trillion back by the end of year two and a $5 trillion income stream each year thereafter.<br><br>In other words, the US could cut everyone&#039;s taxes, both personal and business, income, capital, death, or otherwise, all to 0%, not even cut any benefits or current spending, and pay off the national debt within a decade.","filename":"550d5f17cd7048699ca487f16b3e90d9","ext":".png","w":900,"h":545,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":151,"tim":1493083921521,"time":1493083921,"md5":"GRcW3nZH4GxjDP75aEs\/bw==","fsize":942938,"resto":0,"id":"AZpPleHB","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-can-build-an-orbital-ring-space-elevator-today","country_name":"United States","replies":59,"images":29,"omitted_posts":54,"omitted_images":26},{"no":122679133,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)22:33:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122676315\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122676315<\/a><br><br>Also, in 45 years of constant terrorist attacks, we had only one idiot muslim trying to detonate himself with a grenade.

Jews barely rely on the bible similarly how catholics barely rely on the bible. They all rely on their extrabiblical shit such as rabbis or their &quot;saints&quot; in the case of the catholic church. In both cases they both rely on their own version of rabbi. <br><br>Theres a verse that goes something like &quot;All to well you ignore the word of God for your tradition&quot; and that&#039;s what&#039;s really common.<br><br>Jews if they were really to follow their bible would find it necessary to sacrifice for sin. However they do not. They are condemned by the same God they worship as they all retain all their sin. Jews took up the christian theology of prayers of forgiveness which is pretty useless.. since Jesus himself said that belief in his righteous works of water and blood is the only way to be forgiven. 1 john 5:6<br><br>In the end times prophecies the jews will regain their country israel. They then will rebuild the temple. Then they will begin sacrifices again. Then the anti christ will come and stop the sacrifices effectively starting the end of the world as we know it. 7 years of tribulation then the 1000 year reign of christ will begin on the earth. Course you will be lucky to make it that far if you&#039;re an unbeliever. We&#039;re getting closer, Israel is back and the temple is about ready to be rebuilt or is in the process of it. <br><br>As far as spin offs go look at all the different sects of christianity. they all tend to focus on one part of the bible though. well, good luck not going to hell and stuff boys","time":1493087443,"resto":122653870,"id":"536FTG3L","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122678860,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)22:31:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122653870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122653870<\/a><br>TRUMP ACCEPTS JEHOVAH&#039;S WITNESSES SEEKING ASYLUM IN USA FROM RUSSIAN BAN<br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/122678119#p122678119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122678119<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/122678119#p122678119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122678119<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/122678119#p122678119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122678119<\/a>","time":1493087496,"resto":122653870,"id":"nN9lXJTg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122679060,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)22:33:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122678403\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122678403<\/a><br>I was trying to explain it in a way that people not accustomed to theology or the bible itself could understand. <br>But I guess my explanations were a bit vague. <br>But how can you describe it to someone who does not understand the simplest description of the holy trinity without going a bit outside the box?","time":1493087590,"resto":122653870,"id":"7ftL2E0\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122679505,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)22:36:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122653870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122653870<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=P9T<wbr>n8bvV5s8","time":1493087785,"resto":122653870,"id":"xARL1grY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122681134,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)22:48:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122655110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122655110<\/a><br>I remember being in high school too","time":1493088514,"resto":122653870,"id":"ZCyJD9dc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

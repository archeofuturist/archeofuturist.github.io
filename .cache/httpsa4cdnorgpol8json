It&#039;s impossible. Therefore, pragmatically speaking, there really is no point in wasting time to read holocaust denier material, because it&#039;s either, or: either you are a rational person who agrees that the Jews do not control the western world, and therefore the holocaust historiography is legitimate as there is no reason for it not to be, just like historiography about any other historical event (and therefore reading holocaust denier material is at best just a character study into the minds of these folk who peddle it) or you are a paranoid conspiracy nut who concludes it has been faked on purpose because Jews control the world and want the &#039;goyim&#039; to support the legitimacy and continued existence of Israel, providing it with a moral blank check to do whatever it pleases, as well as eternal reparations. There is no middle ground. But if, for whatever reason, you still are on the fence, then by all means, continue reading. Hopefully this blog will help you understand there always is a logical explanation for all crackpot theories deniers present that calls historiography into question (my future project is to dedicate a blog to debunk 9\/11 theories involving controlled demolition, interestingly something most deniers also believe in).&quot;<br><br>So before he even gets into any of his material he starts with setting up an obvious false dichotomy and asserts &quot;there is no middle ground&quot;.","time":1492172960,"resto":121045990,"id":"u3gaxmRQ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}]}

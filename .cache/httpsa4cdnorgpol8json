What matters is that on average, humans don&#039;t. Look at modern day, with it&#039;s nihilism, hedonism, degeneracy, debauchery, and atheism. Are we living in a healthy society because of these things? No, it&#039;s clearly leading to the destruction of our society, both in the spiritual\/literal death of our own people, the lack of children, and the mass colonization of shitskins taking over our countries.

But when this is actually applied, it just results in the death of a society and replacement by another. It&#039;s natural selection of memes (memes meant in the original sense of the word). This is why every major society out there over the past however many thousands of years has had some sort of belief system, whether it&#039;s called a religion or something else like buddhism or confuscianism, etc.","time":1493811270,"resto":123895636,"id":"fuRS1zkk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123888237,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)03:51:22","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Zuckerberg 2020","com":"You scared, drumpfkins?","filename":"Screenshot_20170503-011617~3","ext":".png","w":1080,"h":1095,"tn_w":246,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493797882065,"time":1493797882,"md5":"RIsMuA4MFJUkHG1sHOsnvg==","fsize":381519,"resto":0,"id":"uN6yTiOM","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"zuckerberg-2020","country_name":"Brazil","replies":145,"images":20,"omitted_posts":140,"omitted_images":20,"tail_size":50},{"no":123901416,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)07:09:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;That prediction about Obama being the last US president was true<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After Trump we&#039;re going to have a wave of meme candidates with no political background until the county is run into the ground<\/span><br><br>what a time to be alive","time":1493809789,"resto":123888237,"id":"lcgItmdJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123901432,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)07:10:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Facebook buys twitter, Facebook buys Netflix, own instagram, own Facebook, blocks trump and trump supporters as hate speech. <br><br>Unlimited h1-b visas<br><br>Don&#039;t underestimate this psycho","time":1493809800,"resto":123888237,"id":"nPuNHSg9","country":"SA","country_name":"Saudi Arabia"},{"no":123901732,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)07:14:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123891453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123891453<\/a><br>Based Swede.

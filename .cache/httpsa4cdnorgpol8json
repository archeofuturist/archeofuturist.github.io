Of course the SJW&#039;s are totally silent on this issue, other than to attack anyone who disagrees as being racist or something. Anyway Reza Aslan wrote a book saying Jesus wasn&#039;t the son of God, and he lives in the USA, which is mainly christian. I think you see where this is going! We need to get the hashtag #HangRezaAslan trending, to a) piss off Muslims and expose their hypocrisy when it comes to their feelings, b) piss of an troll SJW&#039;s as they reveal their double standards for christians and Muslims. And c) Just generally trigger some butthurt.

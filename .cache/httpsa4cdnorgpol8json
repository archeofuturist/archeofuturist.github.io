Unless we start inventing weapons that can accurately differentiate between civilians and enemy soldiers, we&#039;re going to kill civilians. Even then, killing civilians may serve a tactical purpose. It&#039;s not pretty, but war is never pretty. If you can&#039;t handle it, try having a peace treaty between the belligerants. Last time they tried, they used the cease-fire as a tactical device to attempt a surprise attack on one another.","time":1490506453,"resto":118317866,"id":"V7KHrQUu","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":118325881,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:42:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118324816\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118324816<\/a><br>Kek","time":1490506974,"resto":118317866,"id":"PrYB+Rjn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118326086,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:45:04","name":"Thos","com":"<a href=\"#p118317866\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118317866<\/a><br>Shillfag, why do you think we give a shit?","time":1490507104,"resto":118317866,"id":"0unYANVG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118326196,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:46:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118317866\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118317866<\/a><br>Didnt see you complai when obongo was doing it.

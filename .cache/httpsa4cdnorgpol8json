Millennials are on average 20% poorer than their parents at the same age, and that&#039;s why people don&#039;t have kids. Contrary to what pol believes, women in developed countries actually want to have between 2 and 3 kids, but they don&#039;t because it&#039;s too goddamned expensive. Housing is too expensive, school is too expensive, and in the US medical care is too expensive because there are so many goddamned people.

Socialism is pointless because it doesn&#039;t increase the amount of arable land, so it will not increase the carrying capacity of the Earth.

Are they all in on the conspiracy?<br><br>A. No. People from Finland genuinely believe they&#039;re from Finland. In reality they are from small towns on either the Eastern part of Sweden, the Western part of Russia, or the Northern part of Estonia.<br><br>Q- What about all of Finland&#039;s other exports other than Nokia?<br><br>A. Finland&#039;s three biggest, and three most well known areas of industry are Oil, Tech, and Software. The oil is gathered in offshore platforms where the rest of us believe the landmass of Finland is, (again the Japanese get to avoid rigging regulations in this respect), the Tech companies have already been explained above with the Nokia post, and Software companies can easily redirect their IP Address through the Finnish sea. As for other Finnish exports, well, claiming Santa comes from your country isn&#039;t a viable way to get people to believe in it.<br><br>Q- What about Helsinki? That is an enormous city on the world stage.<br><br>A. Helsinki is located in Eastern Sweden. It&#039;s not like the people flying there would notice.<br><br>Q- What about everywhere else in Finland? There&#039;s a lot to it and it couldn&#039;t all be made up.<br><br>A. 99% of Finland is forest. A lot of it doesn&#039;t need to be accounted for when addressing Finnish geography. <br><br>Q- I&#039;m Finnish and your attack on my people and culture is insulting.<br><br>A. I&#039;m not insulting Finnish people or culture. I don&#039;t even deny that there is Finnish culture. When you have a collective of a few million people identifying as Finnish then of course a culture will be built around it. I&#039;m simply saying that that the landmass of Finland isn&#039;t actually there. It doesn&#039;t mean there can&#039;t be a culture or identity of being Finnish however. <br><br>JUST THINK ABOUT IT. HAVE YOU EVER READ ABOUT THE FINNISH LANGUAGE? IT&#039;S COMPLETE NONSENSE.

The numbers:<br><br>Le Pen - 25%<br>Melenchon - 21.7%<br>Macron - 21.0%<br>Fillon - 20.2%<br>Hamon - 5.2%<br><br>Shut up an trust me on that. I will be right. Le Pen historically always overperforms her polls unless there is another credible right wing candidate for her votes to go to. There isn&#039;t. I have used a variety of other methods to calculate the other numbers; to be very brief, always remember that Macron&#039;s base is FRAGILE (1\/3 of voters could change minds) and is attracted to Melenchon&#039;s base, where as Fillon has stalled because of Penelopegate, and there is no reason to vote for Hamon as Melenchon becomes the candidate for the Left. <br><br>2nd Round will be 51.43% for Le Pen and 48.51% for Melenchon. Polls after the first round will show roughly a 54\/46 race, favouring Melenchon. <br><br>The crucial moment will come when Fillon ENDORSES Le Pen (or several prominent members of his party). Why would he\/they do that, you ask? Because they support Le Pen AGAINST the commie Melenchon (he wants 100% tax on rich). ALSO, they will have a parliamentary majority, and want to get shit done. THEY CAN GET SHIT DONE WITH LE PEN, BUT NOT WITH MELENCHON. This is crucial to remember.<br><br>This will be the FINAL BLOW. Currently (((polls))) predict the abstention rates of Fillon supporters in a 2nd round Le Pen\/Melenchon to be approximately 50%. (i.e. 50% do not vote at all). Fillon\/his party&#039;s endorsement of Le Pen will reduce this rate to approximately 30%, which results in the 51.43% victory I described above. So, add all these factors in and Le Pen will Make France Great Again. I&#039;m waiting, \/pol\/. Shortly, you will see that I was right.","filename":"presidentlepen","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492589938472,"time":1492589938,"md5":"df5FUFBiXd\/yCZVKj6QXiw==","fsize":110927,"resto":0,"id":"KxqN++CX","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"le-pen-will-win-guaranteed-i-explain-how","country_name":"Australia","replies":306,"images":67,"omitted_posts":301,"omitted_images":66,"tail_size":50},{"no":121841424,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:03:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Here&#039;s what I predict.<br><br>In the day before the elections, a massive terrorist is going to happen and Le Pen will make it through. <br><br>There are far too many state actors interested in the break up of the EU for it not to happen.","time":1492607010,"resto":121821130,"id":"CoHIb5yn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121841566,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:04:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"The stars (vedic astrology) are in favor of her winning.","time":1492607067,"resto":121821130,"id":"hJeDdp60","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121841589,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:04:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121841371\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121841371<\/a><br>the status quo is a ultra-socialist, borderline commie, state<br>Merdenchion wouldn&#039;t change much to what we have now: just a little more of the same old shit","time":1492607082,"resto":121821130,"id":"z2Tkgo6d","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121841603,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:04:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121837474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121837474<\/a><br>Uhm ... no.

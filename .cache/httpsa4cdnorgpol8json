This man is a globalist, and along with Ivanka, is fully committed to the goals of the NWO. <br>My proposal to you today is to utilize your weaponized autism to expose any and all of Kushner&#039;s shady dealings, and compile them in \/jkg\/ in the same way we did with \/cfg\/ - Clinton Foundation General. There has been good work being done here already, such as pointing out his 666 building, digging into Lucent, connecting his lawyer to the Clinton Foundation, and more. However, all of these facts and details need to be compiled and a thorough autistic investigation needs to take place. We need infographics, easily digestible memes, more leads, and more anons digging. The only way to bring down these people is to expose them as the criminal scum that they are. <br>Thank you for reading and thank you in advance for your contribution.

Hmmm well since I was in the womb. Just hearing those apes through that thin line of stomach made me clench my fists, I even tried to strangle myself with the cord once. That moment when I was delivered by a black person I was like pls put me back in, KEEP THE APES AWAY. So after about 10 years in this ape infested jungle I began to study these &quot;apes&quot; closely and came to the astounding conclusion that no matter how hard they try, deep down there will always be a little bit of ape hidden in their small little minds. After I realized that death was the only way to truly escape the &quot;jungle&quot; was death. This sent me into a deep depression. How can I make them go away? Why don&#039;t they act like us? I asked myself these questions countless times every day and still can&#039;t figure out why. After countless studies I concluded that maybe it&#039;s in their nature because they were oppressed in slavery for so many years. Maybe they can&#039;t help it. But then I see the albino apes mimicking their actions. Why would you aspire to be something so useless. Maybe they wanted to fit in. Maybe they were oppressed in another life. These &quot;apes&quot; have invaded and destroyed everything I have of known to love.

It is characterized by a number of psychiatric symptoms such as throwing yourself into the path of lorries driven by Muslims, asking Muslims to sexually assault you in a public, asking Muslims to shoot you in crowded places and asking Muslims to behead you underneath the Eiffel Tower.[1] Similar syndromes include Jerusalem syndrome whereby sufferers may constantly repeat false claims relating to fictional accounts of genocide [2] and Berlin syndrome whereby afflicted males may ask the nearest person of the same sex to repeatedly pleasure their wife. The condition is commonly viewed as a severe form of culture shock. It is particularly noted among Japanese travelers.<\/span>","filename":"jap","ext":".jpg","w":465,"h":465,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490396920181,"time":1490396920,"md5":"dYMtCnlRWg6s+LVozXtwnA==","fsize":27751,"resto":0,"id":"t49hmj+r","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"paris-syndrome","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":19,"images":2,"omitted_posts":14,"omitted_images":1},{"no":118152194,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)19:41:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118147831\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118147831<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mostly old mangas and such portray Paris as a wonderful and beautiful place<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Want to visit such wonderland<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Be faced with crude reality of 2017<\/span><br>I&#039;m surprised I&#039;ve managed to befriend few pale looking french girls, too bad they are obnoxious as fuck but agree their country is a shithole thanks to the dark skinned ones, and want to move far away asap.","time":1490398894,"resto":118147831,"id":"M0U1J3y6","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118152390,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)19:43:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"When I went to Tokyo, it got me a fucking Tokyo syndrome, too.","time":1490398992,"resto":118147831,"id":"85Gp1ChQ","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118152594,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)19:44:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118150771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118150771<\/a><br>It can be nice if you navigate from one tourist place to another, preferrably by subway.

He made it his goal to prevent any further kind of escalation and to reduce nuclear arms before they wiped out humanity.

He was also establishing a backdoor channel to communicate with Castro to work on an rapprochement, and was exchanging letters with Khrushchev to further better relations between the US and the USSR. <br><br>By the time the test treaty was ratified in later September 1963, Kennedy was a dead man walking.

And seems to me like the liberal intelligentsia reject western\/christian values mostly out of pure pigheadedness at this point. It&#039;s all &quot;problematic&quot;. They try to come up with their own value system but they can only agree on the lowest common denominator. Social justice is very simplistic thinking, but they try to justify it at length with postmodern nonsense. They &quot;deconstruct&quot; everything in this way and try to come up with an ideology that is immune to it.<br><br>And yeah I think there&#039;s a spiritual void. People cling to remnants of christian spirituality without even realizing it. As much as they hate it, it&#039;s mostly their values. Those that make any sense anyway. I think it&#039;s more important than I realized. People need a spiritual system of sorts or they start trying to fill the void however they can.<br><br>Like some pointed out, social media replaces it a bit. It&#039;s not god watching and judging you, it&#039;s everyone else. People voluntarily expose their whole lives to judgement this way. Not just people, algorithms too. I think future forms of social control will be based on (semi voluntary) mass surveillance and AI, not culture.","time":1491634533,"resto":120098510,"id":"kn197cts","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120101395,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:56:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Militant athiesm is a cancer designed by marxist jews to destroy western civilization.

My grandfather was one of the chief military figures in developing the neutron bomb in the 50s and early 60s. He went to graduate school for nuclear physics, and they put him on as the military officer in charge of the project (I think we was either a Lt. Colonel or a full Colonel at the time, strangely enough as an armored officer). His team basically brought Cohen&#039;s theories to life as the first generation of high radiation\/low yield thermonuclear devices. Basically, neutron bombs are useful because we can&#039;t just drop a hydrogen bomb on all of our problems. Sometimes you want to go nuclear to show your serious without going top shelf with a 10 megaton device. The neutron bomb solves this by lacking the tamper (usually made of non-reactive U-238) the regular hydrogen bomb does (obviously with other alterations I don&#039;t know about because I&#039;m not a nuclear physics\/don&#039;t have Q clearance with the DOE or TS\/SCI with the DoD). The tamper reflects neutrons back into the reaction of a thermonuclear device causing the reaction to complete more, which means more energy -&gt; a bigger explosion. Without a tamper, the reaction doesn&#039;t reach completion before being blown apart by the energy created, so radioactive isotopes are blown all over the fucking place. Basically, a neutron bomb is kind of like if a dirty bomb fucked a hydrogen bomb and they had a baby.","time":1491634594,"resto":120101271,"id":"akk5O9rS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

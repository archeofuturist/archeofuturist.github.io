The Left&#039;s Multiculturalism is a sham, mainly diversity of food and dancing. The Left&#039;s Social Evolutionism, with its belief in Progress, implies a rejection of the Past, except insofar as it can be used to create an &quot;Origin&quot; myth; other than that, the Past is a museum of privations and errors, not to be allowed today, forbidden by &quot;standards&quot;, &quot;consumer protection&quot; or \u00d2welfare\u00d3 laws. Even today, Aboriginal marriage practices such as marriage below the &quot;age of consent&quot;, a European convention pronounced &quot;Universal&quot;, are not recognised by our so-called &quot;Multicultural&quot; society. Nor are aboriginal punishments such as a-spear-through-the-leg, a punishment distasteful to Europeans because it is physical, while long prison terms, which emotionally harm the prisoner and nurture further crime, are deemed &quot;Universally&quot; acceptable. Smacking a child is an abuse because it is physical, but emotional deprivation by the withholding of affection, or by having 3-month-old babies reared by 9-to-5 &quot;professionals&quot; in day-care centres while mother looks after her &quot;career&quot;, is OK.

Jesus was an Arab Jew and white Christians grovel at the feet of that Palestinian Jew like total cucks meanwhile the last remnants of our true European heritage you call &#039;pagans&#039; and &#039;witches&#039; and other snarky names. You are scum. Whenever Arab Muslims kill some Arab Christians you wail and cry as if these people were one of your own just because you share the same love for the same non-white Gods. I&#039;ve seen some of you dirty race traitors actually saying that the West should let in these Arab savages because they are Christian. If you love Christianity so much why don&#039;t you go live in the Middle East or Africa or Latin America? Those people are your true brothers and sisters. I&#039;ve also seen you Christians claim that your religion is compatible with white nationalism when we all fucking know that is not true. Christians promotes weakness &#039;turn the other cheek&#039; and says that &#039;there is no man or woman, Jew or Greek all are one in Christ&#039; you see those shitskins in Africa and The Middle East? According to your religion those are your brothers and sisters. <br><br>Look if you&#039;re going to partake in religious worship and ritual at least do it in a European context otherwise become an Atheist.","filename":"Star-of-David2","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491793534652,"time":1491793534,"md5":"PY6Cumpynp6f52cx6n5bhw==","fsize":16649,"resto":0,"id":"nCmhfUGR","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"reminder-that-christians-are-race-traitors-for","country_name":"Australia","replies":17,"images":4,"omitted_posts":12,"omitted_images":3},{"no":120384545,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:22:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120382518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120382518<\/a><br>I simply cannot respect christcucks anymore.

It urged the United States to take steps to acquire stockpiles of uranium ore and accelerate the research of Enrico Fermi and others into nuclear chain reactions. They had it signed by Albert Einstein and delivered to President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Roosevelt called on Lyman Briggs of the National Bureau of Standards to head the Advisory Committee on Uranium to investigate the issues raised by the letter. Briggs held a meeting on 21 October 1939, which was attended by Szil\u00e1rd, Wigner and Edward Teller. The committee reported back to Roosevelt in November that uranium &quot;would provide a possible source of bombs with a destructiveness vastly greater than anything now known.&quot;[3]<\/span>","filename":"1482614962438","ext":".jpg","w":1396,"h":2000,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493805073359,"time":1493805073,"md5":"EwrdklAcm8mbMiQ4apZnVQ==","fsize":466486,"resto":123881639,"id":"S7N5EGz7","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123896590,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)05:58:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"That&#039;s easy, you kill Hitler of course.

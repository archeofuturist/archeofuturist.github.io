These officials then vote on bills to either turn them into laws or to reject them, like a European women rejects her unborn baby with down syndrome. They also create and enforce policy with &quot;OUR&quot; ideals in mind. So with that said. If we were to make a petition to get rid of the Gov from taxing our tax returns, this petition would get passed, it would then wait months in bureaucratic limbo for fuck all until finally making it to capitol(he&#039;s just a bill sitting there after all) just to have it immediately shot down by the very people that we elected to portray our thoughts and ideologies and opinions.

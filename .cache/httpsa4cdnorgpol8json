I see it as splitting hairs. I can see where you come from with the distinction, I think, but the intent behind my usage was to use the two interchangeably. I believe this to be justified as insanity is the property of being unable to make rational decisions and being deluded is the property of having a conception of reality that is, in some way, aberrant. To me, these properties seem to go hand in hand. How can you make a rational decision without a coherent conception of reality?<br><br>Semantics aside, I do not like the idea of normalization or accommodation because I see the issue as being one of health and illness. My father suffered from dementia before he died. He did not really know he was sick, but had treatment been available, he would undoubtedly have been ecstatic to return his mind to a state of normalcy. So too, the transgender individual may not want treatment, but upon being treated, may very well be glad that the treatment had been carried out. I see the issue as one that needs to be treated for the sake of the individual, to restore a coherent conception of reality, and allow them to live a more normal life. It seems to be the most humane thing to do. The problem with accommodating or normalizing is not the actions in themselves, rather, it is the fact that these attitudes preclude treatment. If you have normalized the disease, then treatment becomes a heinous invasion of someone&#039;s personal rights. I think that it is false compassion, for what if the individual in question could have sincerely benefited from treatment? It is now denied to him\/her for such treatment is trying to correct something that is now &quot;normal.&quot;<br><br>Being open to the treatment of the transgendered does not preclude their accommodation, though it does preclude their normalization. Normalization precludes their treatment.","time":1493682962,"resto":123670322,"id":"OkOOP1Qt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123694210,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)19:56:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123693896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123693896<\/a><br>No, it isn&#039;t.

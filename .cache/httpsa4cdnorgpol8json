Christianity is what held European nations together for hundreds or thousands of years. Their unity through faith kept Muslim incursion at bay for centuries. Look up the Reconquista of Spain or the 1683 Battle of Vienna, where an alliance of Christian nations fended off the Ottomans. When they abandoned God for material wealth, they suffered for it. See the 1204 Sacking of Constantinople by the Fourth Crusade. Their desire for physical wealth was greater than their love of God.<br><br>None of these examples are in the Bible, yet they point to the same truth.<br><br>There are numerous examples of this: the zeal given by Christian faith saving nations and material greed destroying them. The modern invasion of Europe is just another example.","time":1492148079,"resto":121002130,"id":"bTrwAIFD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121014153,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)23:53:30","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Would i pass as local in your country?","com":"I am not Bulgarian by the way, I am Turkish.","filename":"OT","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492142010502,"time":1492142010,"md5":"0ayMZvTS\/VC2Y6EPt+\/97A==","fsize":63343,"resto":0,"id":"hLKSxGBp","country":"BG","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"would-i-pass-as-local-in-your-country","country_name":"Bulgaria","replies":114,"images":14,"omitted_posts":109,"omitted_images":13,"tail_size":50},{"no":121023400,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:24:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121014153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121014153<\/a><br>In sewden or Germany you&#039;d look like a local","time":1492147462,"resto":121014153,"id":"s28fGCOC","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":121023810,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:29:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121014153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121014153<\/a><br>You look like a Greek to me, mate.

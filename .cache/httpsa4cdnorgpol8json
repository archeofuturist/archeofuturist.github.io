I agree China is a terrible country but I&#039;ve known some very cool American Chinese people. They are funny and salty. No bullshit either. One of the coolest and funniest guys I know is a Korean cop. <br><br>Also, SOME Hispanics are pretty great people--the educated, legal immigrant, Catholic ones. I&#039;ve had some terrific neighbors who were legal Mexicans. Hardworking, friendly, well-behaved kids, kept their houses\/apartments nice, and their food smelled amazing. Also known some very sophisticated, upper-crust people from Nicaragua. They were relatives of a former president of that country and all well-educated, hardworking, interesting people. They all spoke fluent English, of course.<br><br>My least favorite non-whites? Blacks, hands down. I will occasionally encounter a black woman who is funny, unpretentious and cool, but the men are almost all horrible, their kids are terrors, and most of them are just wretched niggers. <br><br>I&#039;ve also met some very together, nice poo-in-loos. The Hindu ones only though, or Christian--not the Muslim variety.<br><br>Speaking of Muslims. I was once friends with an Egyptian immigrant family. This was a very long time ago, though. 1970s. They were culturally white and had quite light skin and fine features. Incredibly smart people, legal immigrants, white collar jobs, well educated, only nominally Muslim. Rather like white people you may know who are nominally Christian, they were baptized once upon a time but never go to church or anything. <br><br>So toxic is the radicalization culture though, that when I got back in touch with one of that family recently, she told me that her 80 year old father is talking like a terrorist recently. Someone got to him, probably via Facebook, she said. Her mother is so upset and has no idea what to do. (She is completely westernized, always has been.)

One time he said teh man&#039;s mouth opened without his lips moving, and a disembodied voice came from the middle of the bedroom, and when the voice stopped, the man&#039;s mouth closed. The man also levitated off the chair. Said that was teh only time he saw that.<br><br>The other thing mentioned was this. He and a catholic priest were helping the bellingham (washington state) police department in an ongoing case of ritual murders\/mutilations. What little I could get out of him was that children were being trafficked from Vancouver BC. Some police were involved in bellingham pd and other police departments all the way down the west coast. a few police officers from the lummi native american tribe were involved. I guess my father was getting death threats by a police officer in the lummi tribe. Kids are being taken from reservations and are being trafficked. My dad mentioned that acid was being used in the disposal of the bodies.

The surplus males of China, it&#039;s said, will not accept involuntary celibacy and might even revolt. This is laughable. Anyone who understands the nature of East Asians knows their temperament precludes serious resistance or disorder. Chinese males, a race of matriarchal, status-obsessed, materialistic, insect-like cheats, who cannot resist even slight social pressure, would sooner live in a state of permanent celibacy, perhaps resorting to homosexual behaviour in some instances, than rock the boat.<br><br>The surplus males of China serve as a demographic weapon. They&#039;re exported to unruly regions of the Chinese interior for genetic and demographic conquest. They&#039;re also dispatched overseas to dominate Africans and South Americans, or create ethnic pockets within the Anglosphere.<br><br>Beijing has established a significant genetic presence throughout Africa by miscegenation -- this group of mongrels serves as an ethnic proxy and a fifth column. Tibet and Uyghurstan have been inundated by Han males, under the direction of Beijing, with the express aim of subjugating and extinguishing these groups and bringing order to otherwise unruly regions. The idea is to extinguish the indigenous stock through a combination of demographic displacement and miscegenation. Beijing has introduced marriage subsidies, reserved for Han males, to poach Uyghur females. Uygur males are losing their women to Chinese males with the financial backing of Beijing. These subsidies have produced an explosion of mongrels and have destabilized Uygurstan by producing a sex imbalance. The Chinese seek adsorb the Uygurs and Tibetans into the broader Chinese population, effectively breeding them out of existence, in order to gain total control over their territories. Subsidies are awarded for the production of children.<br><br>Surplus males are being leveraged to wage a demographic war.

They&#039;re predisposed to servitude, as are the Koreans. Aggression and noncompliance have been bred out of the Han Chinese over millennia. While this is true of East Asians in general, these temperamental features are especially pronounced in the Chinese and Koreans -- they&#039;re so passive and governable as to be susceptible to highly controlling and even authoritarian governments. Their nature prohibits any sort of serious resistance, even under wretched conditions. This adds to the absurdity of a sex imbalance producing domestic unrest.<br><br>Secondly, polygamy and concubinage were practiced in China for many hundreds of years. Males at the top horded hundreds of girls, typically ranging between 14 and 16 years of age. This resulted in a pronounced shortages of females but no unrest. The elite of China actually recruited surplus males to guard their harems -- they were first castrated as a precaution in order to eliminate sexual impulses. Chinese men are adapted to involuntary celibacy and are profoundly sexually passive. Today, ordinary Chinese are out-competed by the lowliest of white males -- their women actually shun their own males in favour of low-value white males. Instead of taking action, they seethe with anger but are unable to display aggression. They stew and make online posts attributing their celibacy to a Hollywood conspiracy to induce their girls to chase whites (this isn&#039;t a joke).","time":1490460699,"resto":118243303,"id":"AzvWBm\/E","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118243755,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:53:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118243561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118243561<\/a><br><br>There&#039;s a good reason the Chinese are considered the Jews of Asia.

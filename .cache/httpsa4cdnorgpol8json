Considering that the definition of reason under most epistemic systems is basically the exact opposite of reason, the idea that we will create an actual, thinking machine anytime soon is pretty fanciful.<br><br>This is what will happen instead. As technology advances, we will build higher and higher resolution data sets about the brain&#039;s functioning and then begin to build technological enhancements to basic brain functions.

I&#039;m a gay, white, Christian conservative man and I&#039;ve never been more vilified and belittled and patronized by any group or individual the way the leftists I&#039;ve encountered have done.

Then, those 3 cops were shot and then the flood happened, so it is kind of forgotten. But, they still haven released the verdict about if the cop is guilty or not for shooting a man who was selling stolen property (yes, that isn&#039;t a reason to shoot someone, even if they are a nigger), but he also resisted arrest so much so that the cop needed another cop just to &quot;attempt&quot; to hold him down. Even with 2 cops, nigga man 5000 kept putting up a fight and that&#039;s when the cop finally had enough of his nigga shit and shot him. (Ps, Alton also had multiple other charges against him before. I believe one was like explicit shit with a minor and I think a felony (not entirely sure. Fact check me on that if u need to)) But, back to what I was talking about, basically, the state has drug this on (even though most people know that they have the verdict) because they haven&#039;t released it yet. We think this is because the state doesn&#039;t want a huge uprising from the BLM and shit and people to die. (Even though I would be perfectly fine with a few BLM supporters dying). They are saying the verdict is coming out maybe this week or next and they are gonna shut down half the state and roads and shit just so they can try to &quot;control&quot; BLM. Even though that won&#039;t work because it&#039;s seen as &quot;racist&quot; to tell the fucking terrorists to go home or arrest them. I just honestly had to get this shit off my chest. Maybe you guys want to talk about it. I don&#039;t really fucking care. But if I have to embrace my inner stick man, I will.","filename":"IMG_4278","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":705,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":235,"tim":1493888942788,"time":1493888942,"md5":"ztTl\/EdVUvXSRHcXsYgubQ==","fsize":106408,"resto":0,"id":"vDNPV5QY","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"blm-in-louisiana-with-the-verdict-release-of-the","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":124041311,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)05:10:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Uh the verdict came out already homey","time":1493889017,"resto":124041219,"id":"GLMeiL6d","country":"PR","country_name":"Puerto Rico"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124018879,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:34:09","name":"Anonymous","sub":"&quot;This is a gathering of the secret world government&quot; - Findhorn Foundation","com":"Found from <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123995105#p123995105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123995105<\/a><br><br>That thread showed a minor connection between the SK scandal and an organization called Harbin Hot Springs.

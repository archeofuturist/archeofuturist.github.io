They are very easy to spot. They also tend to be anti \/r\/the_donald in order to cause a civil war among our fellow brothers and sisters who have managed to maintain a stronghold on Reddit. Most of \/r\/the_donald are \/pol\/ crossposters so any anti \/r\/the_donald post is an affront at \/pol\/, shills are capitalizing on 4chan&#039;s hatred of reddit to divide us.<br><br>2) Pro-Assad\/pro-Putin shills - any time you see a pro-Assad post there is a 80-85% chance you are speaking from a paid shill from the Kremlin. Studies show that most of the posters from \/sg\/ are from IPs that originate from Moscow, they have been part of \/pol\/ for a while now but lately the Russian government has increased their paychecks so you are seeing a lot more pro-Assad + pro-Putin propaganda posted on here. Be very wary. The remaining 15-20% are just misinformed posters who have fallen for Sputnik\/RT propaganda, so they can be redeemed.<br><br>Last point I want to make is that we are in very chaotic times, shills must understand that \/pol\/ will always stand by Donald J.Trump. No amount of concern trolling will EVER change this.","filename":"Screen-Shot-2016-05-26-at-1.21.42-PM","ext":".png","w":387,"h":469,"tn_w":206,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491625710351,"time":1491625710,"md5":"uGREGtKTlNWxY4P\/XiJnXA==","fsize":378414,"resto":0,"id":"HP5llGxn","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-to-spot-shills","country_name":"Australia","replies":61,"images":14,"omitted_posts":56,"omitted_images":13},{"no":120093084,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:33:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120092544\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120092544<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ywn live in such a secluded bubble you think your anime imageboard is anything more than a passing thought to any influential authority<\/span>","time":1491629605,"resto":120085936,"id":"FGq9KlMX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120094069,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:42:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120093084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120093084<\/a><br>Obviously you don&#039;t understand the depth of this place, shill.","time":1491630147,"resto":120085936,"id":"uEmMv52e","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120094363,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:45:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m only a Hitler shill","time":1491630320,"resto":120085936,"id":"RQZZRq2n","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120094374,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:45:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120094069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120094069<\/a><br><br>oh shit forgive me, pls don&#039;t dox me mr hacker 4chan","time":1491630325,"resto":120085936,"id":"FGq9KlMX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120094643,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:47:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120092340\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120092340<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;reddit-tier memes<\/span><br><br>Gas yourself desu.","time":1491630475,"resto":120085936,"id":"V25PVueU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120094604,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:47:33","name":"Anonymous","sub":"THE SHILL INVASION WAS A FACE OFF WITH RUSSIA","com":"Does anyone realize that the &quot;Shills&quot; that raided us were probably actual Russians?<br><br>Think about it:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump bombs Syria and repostures American-Russian relationship so that America is in control<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Immediately, 4Chan is flooded with shills trying to cause dissension.<\/span><br><br>this is where it gets even weirder:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After trump displays dominance towards Russia, THE MEDIA IMMEDIATELY STOPS HATING TRUMP<\/span><br><br>(Its almost as if something changed overnight.<br>As if Trump cut his ties with Putin or dropped some previous agreement with Russia.)<br><br>Why else would the media flip-flop so fast?<br>Also, keep in mind that this was the largest shill attack we&#039;ve experienced on \/pol\/ in recent times.<br><br>We were literally so close to becoming a Lefty board.<br><br>There has to be deep state workings behind it.","filename":"vityaz-01","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":697,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":170,"tim":1491630453496,"time":1491630453,"md5":"CS64t78oh8+xsJgOlLnIOQ==","fsize":223230,"resto":0,"id":"zxttxEgA","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-shill-invasion-was-a-face-off-with-russia","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":120094396,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:45:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"i voted for trump to end super america world police. what did trump do?

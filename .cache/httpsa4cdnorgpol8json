Of course they love to suggest that migrants are \u201ccosting a fortune\u201d, taking jobs, worsening the welfare burden, and bringing in crime and disease to boot.

It&#039;s getting hot over there but nothing will happen tomorrow or in the upcoming months. I say within a year we will take out North Korea, but not anytime in the near future. God damn if North Korea planned to nuke the USA or Japan or South Korea, they wouldn&#039;t even hint at it at all. It&#039;d just happen one day or night without anyone expecting it.

In 2013 the UK spent 8.5% of its GDP on healthcare, about $227.6 Billion. Their population was 64.1 million. If I were to re-adjust the spending to the population of the USA which is about 319 million. The cost would be about $1.133 trillion. In the USA we already spend $1.191 trillion on Medicare and Medicaid combined. So my question is could the USA switch to single payer without increasing taxes from where they are right now?","filename":"16299118_1637282323243278_4764201811001063810_n","ext":".png","w":480,"h":272,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":141,"tim":1490417124329,"time":1490417124,"md5":"WhwfF0Yz2ZSm7WWU\/\/d5Ww==","fsize":187933,"resto":0,"id":"uVpGGih5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"red-pill-me-on-single-payer-in-usa","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":118187062,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:46:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118186905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118186905<\/a><br>-By just turning Medicare + Medicaid into a single payer system.","time":1490417218,"resto":118186905,"id":"uVpGGih5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118186324,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:39:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"How do we bring world peace, pol?","filename":"ben meets putin","ext":".png","w":620,"h":430,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":173,"tim":1490416759638,"time":1490416759,"md5":"F6owlkKLo0qOO7G4DTsfDg==","fsize":446862,"resto":0,"id":"xwd1pn5i","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-we-bring-world-peace-pol","country_name":"Australia","replies":6,"images":0,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":118186530,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:41:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118186324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118186324<\/a><br>With national socialism.","time":1490416897,"resto":118186324,"id":"hOTgSn8b","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118186563,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:42:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118186397\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118186397<\/a><br>Try September 10, 2001<br><a href=\"#p118186324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118186324<\/a><br>you can&#039;t make an omelet without breaking a few eggs","time":1490416921,"resto":118186324,"id":"DrGcaWtk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118186630,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:42:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118186324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118186324<\/a><br>Gas the kikes and win the race war.<br><br>Duh.","time":1490416968,"resto":118186324,"id":"AQa1NiEb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118186655,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:42:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118186324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118186324<\/a><br>By sorting ourselves out.","time":1490416979,"resto":118186324,"id":"EDeoGRnp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118186822,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:44:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118186324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118186324<\/a><br>Gassing the kikes, shitskins, gooks(except the Japs &amp; Koreans), niggers, and spiks.","time":1490417071,"resto":118186324,"id":"9wCYyoMh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118186813,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:44:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Was wondering about the origins of shadilay and found the following at forebears.com: &quot;Surname (Shadilay) originates from India. Rigveda 7.103 is a hymn dedicated to frogs in Hindu scripture. It features references to the term Shadilay:<br>&#039;What time on these, as on a dry skin lying in the pool&#039;s bed, the floods of heaven descended, The music of the Frogs comes forth in the sounds of Shadilay like the cows lowing with their calves beside them.&#039;<br><br>&#039;Each of these twain receives the other kindly, while they are revelling in the flow of waters, When the Frog moistened by the rain springs forward, and Green and Spotty both combine their voices.&#039;<br><br>Shadilay appears in Korean culture and ancient proverbs too:<br><br>&#039;A few weeks later there was a heavy storm, with plenty of rainfall and the little frog was concerned that his mothers grave would be washed away. The stream could easily overflow and that would mean that his mothers grave was not safe. He could not sleep, and decided to go to the streams banks to keep watch and make sure her grave was unharmed.In the pouring rain he sat, crying over and over again,\u201cShadilay! Shadilay! Please don\u2019t wash my mother away!&quot;<br><br>Every single time it rained the little frog went and kept watch, and since then all green frogs have cried,\u201cShadilay! Shadilay!\u201d when it rains.&#039;<br><br>Shadilay appears to hold some significance to rain, fresh starts, floods. Some sort of higher being with the ability to wipe clean any slate. <br><br>However I looked into the (very reliable) Wikipedia and found: &quot;Hebrew word meaning peace, harmony, wholeness, completeness, prosperity, welfare and tranquility and can be used idiomatically to mean both hello and goodbye.&quot;<br><br>So, given the flimsiness of my sources I request help from the Kekistanis into finding out shadilay&#039;s true meaning.","filename":"80706","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":320,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490417067047,"time":1490417067,"md5":"VxA\/7zTB4Lmskp+BrkQ1tA==","fsize":21195,"resto":0,"id":"dGdBS9Dz","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"was-wondering-about-the-origins-of-shadilay-and","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]}]}

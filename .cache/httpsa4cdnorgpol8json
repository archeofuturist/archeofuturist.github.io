One of the dangers of radioactive fallout from a nuclear bomb is its strontium, which has chemical properties much like those of calcium. If a cow ingests strontium it becomes congested in the cow&#039;s milk. Some of the strontium ends up in the bones of whoever drinks the milk. The energetic electrons emitted in the beta decay of strontium damage the bone marrow and thus impair the production of red blood cells.<br>Basically, because of the half life of strontium, if you nuke anywhere in mainland Europe, children growing up in Britain could end up with bone marrow diseases that won&#039;t even manifest for generations. Creating nuclear weapons was a mistake.","time":1492719552,"resto":122033484,"id":"\/bAw6jxF","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":122038262,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:24:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122035924\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122035924<\/a><br>Just Nuke Germany and Belgium this time.<br><br>Even us Croats who are viewed as their lapdogs have had enough of their shit.<br>They tried to shut down our food industry because theirs couldn&#039;t compeete with our lower prices for the same quality.","time":1492719865,"resto":122033484,"id":"aM\/n9uCs","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":122039357,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:32:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122033484\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122033484<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;france <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;enemy<\/span><br><br>youre retarded","time":1492720323,"resto":122033484,"id":"9hDagOWY","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122039422,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:32:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122037513\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122037513<\/a><br>Of course, we wouldn&#039;t dare bomb Germany again...","filename":"Dresden Pepe","ext":".png","w":1240,"h":869,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":87,"tim":1492720350756,"time":1492720350,"md5":"xvXp9pLZ95apG26fbHgRSg==","fsize":1131312,"resto":122033484,"id":"cNE8RtML","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122039624,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:33:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122039422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122039422<\/a><br>DO IT AGAIN BOMBER HARRIS","time":1492720427,"resto":122033484,"id":"4IMG8+PS","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122039621,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:33:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"How do we bring it back? <br><br>Without it America is able to do whatever it wants with no repercussions.","filename":"12312524337","ext":".png","w":2000,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492720427730,"time":1492720427,"md5":"m4bSxFsRVWZKtz20S+dcKQ==","fsize":8726,"resto":0,"id":"F+OnpgOX","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-we-bring-it-back","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122039596,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:33:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"This gives Melenchon the win.","filename":"20170420_143045","ext":".jpg","w":3264,"h":2448,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492720419569,"time":1492720419,"md5":"NzD8PUu2B3U5FroBNFm0Dw==","fsize":2134362,"resto":0,"id":"67kl7a0W","country":"CR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-gives-melenchon-the-win","country_name":"Costa Rica","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122036868,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:14:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"That twitter account @clive_martin14 that posted the pedo symbol got suspended.

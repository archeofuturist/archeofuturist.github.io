If you actually read their analysis of the FAIR report, all they say is that it&#039;s hard to estimate and the real number may be as low as Heritage&#039;s $85B estimate but they provide no actual counterpoints to the report, and they certainly don&#039;t account for the vast majority of the $113B number.<br><br>The crux of their ruling is that &quot;Trump presented this figure as a hard fact to make his case, and not as the rough, high-end estimate that it is.&quot; So the only reason they rated it as &quot;Mostly False&quot; isn&#039;t because they debunked it, it&#039;s because they deliberately mischaracterized Trump&#039;s statement as being a declaration of 100% indisputable fact. Of course on that basis alone his statement is false, no estimate of such a nebulous cost could ever be 100% indisputable fact. That doesn&#039;t mean the estimate isn&#039;t in the ballpark though. They have no evidence at all that $113B deviates significantly from the real number.","time":1490161248,"resto":117714187,"id":"TuWJhAUF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117726719,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:44:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117726373\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117726373<\/a><br>Its ridiculous and the pinnacle of irony that liberals are unironically using the taxdollar argument to take Shinzo for a round at maralago when if they gave a damn about how their money was being spent they&#039;d want every illegal out tomorrow. <br><br>Of course that wouldn&#039;t be very progressive, so DUDE HE LIED ABOUT GOLF LMAO REKT<br><br>I suspect the later argument is something something we need to spend less on security details for the president ;^)","time":1490161480,"resto":117714187,"id":"tGcxZCIq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117727009,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:47:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117714441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117714441<\/a><br>This.

The period between day 315 and day 600 saw a breakdown in social structure and in normal social behavior. Among the aberrations in behavior were the following: expulsion of young before weaning was complete, wounding of young, increase in homosexual behavior, inability of dominant males to maintain the defense of their territory, aggressive behavior of females, and extreme passivity of non-dominant males.<br><br>After day 600, the social breakdown continued and the population declined toward extinction.

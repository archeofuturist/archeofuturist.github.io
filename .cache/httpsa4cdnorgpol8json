Humanities goal should be to as quickly as possible ensure people are secure in their survival, so they are free to chase their interests. Many will sit around doing nothing, they already are. Some wont. The goal is to give everyone the opportunity not to worry instead of just the wealthy. A rich person can try something and fail, and they are ok, they can recover and try again. A poor person has to decide between gambling their future security on an idea, or taking a deadend job. It is this inequality that should be removed. UBI does it by ensuring that you will never starve to death, never be homeless. It becomes a question of gambling your comfort on an idea, not your survival. If you believe that people should have to labor to justify their existence you are backwards and beyond help. It has always been an unfortunate necessity, not a virtue, and we are approaching it no longer being a requirement.

Plan ahead.<br>1) Formation is insanely important. You want to keep everyone on your side safe while maintaining a tactical edge and still being able to fight. A square is the most basic formation, but allows for enemy combatants to be pulled into your ranks and detained. You&#039;re fighting to defend and capture, not wound or kill. If you break from formation you&#039;ll be surrounded by the enemy, and it doesn&#039;t matter how good a fighter you are if you&#039;re surrounded by 20 enemies.<br><br>2) Don&#039;t start the fight. You&#039;re the good guys here, so act like it. Don&#039;t have the edges do all the fighting, instead make sure that you can pull enemies into a place they are all alone and have no choice to surrender or be forced to surrender. The more of you you can pile onto one of them the easier it will be.<br><br>3) At least in the USA it is legal to make a &quot;citizens arrest&quot;. This is when you see someone committing a crime and detain them until the police are able to take them into custody. You must do everything you can by the book. Tell them that you&#039;re arresting them for Assault and battery, and that you want them to comply until the police arrive to take them away. If they don&#039;t comply you may use force to restrain them, though you should use as little as is reasonable. Tie them up with rope or handcuffs, plastic ties are dangerous as they can cut skin.<br><br>4) Prisoner management is going to be exceptionally tricky. You should have at least a 4\/1 ratio of captors to captives, to keep them from slipping away and to keep their friends from getting any bright ideas. What they will hate more than anything is the possibility of this going on their permanent record. <br><br>5) Just try and be civil and well behaved (As well as possible for being in a street fight). Record everything and don&#039;t be a dumbass.","time":1493176820,"resto":122831542,"id":"wCZQbHyW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122836077,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:28:52","name":"Anonymous","filename":"LlS2NdSReh8vy-bkqc4sOc0M7SX6thTBhXwQnU9VqU8","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493177332497,"time":1493177332,"md5":"qhCqo\/K1spaY4DVU2BB4+Q==","fsize":140413,"resto":122831542,"id":"\/5o3mKeA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122836912,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:36:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122831542\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122831542<\/a><br><br><br>I noticed that Antifa tends to attack people by blindsiding them when they give interviews.

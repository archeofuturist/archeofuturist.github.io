Theres nothing wrong with racemixing, firstly because under this mode it would be completely volountary, and in fact, it would bring all other races closer to the white man. I would call this genetic redistribution, sharing and projecting the wealth that is the white gene-pool onto the rest of the world. The problem we face today is genetic inequality. I don&#039;t like inequality. :( Meanwhile we keep white countries white. :)","time":1493577426,"resto":123493681,"id":"2IRBdQ12","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123491563,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)12:01:53","name":"Anonymous","sub":"What happens next?","com":"Is there any way out of this? <br>Is there any going back after years of chasing the truth and finding out more and more?<br>Can I ever go back to having friends, be ignorant and happy?<br>Is there any way for me to start caring what people think of me instead of not giving a fuck while trying to redpill them?<br><br>Is there any cure?","filename":"poltruth","ext":".png","w":2813,"h":1521,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":135,"tim":1493568113157,"time":1493568113,"md5":"7fGJDxRiqpxqkau\/BpZIIg==","fsize":1945360,"resto":0,"id":"WOiY9nrZ","country":"NO","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-happens-next","country_name":"Norway","replies":73,"images":27,"omitted_posts":68,"omitted_images":26},{"no":123507709,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:34:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123493356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123493356<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have 12 kids<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;red pill them<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;each one has 12 more kids<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rinse and repeat<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;start the 4th reich<\/span>","time":1493577240,"resto":123491563,"id":"fZEo9KvY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123507912,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:35:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123506033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123506033<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;ll try to but I don&#039;t think I&#039;ll believe in myself<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but I don&#039;t enjoy doing anything anymore because of the current state of affairs in the world.<\/span><br><br>Something that had helped me a lot is meditating on death. It may seem counter intuitive, but once you have completely come to terms with death the absurdity of life seems more funny than sad.

Once you realize death isn&#039;t so bad, your attachment to the world is reduced and therefore your suffering derived from it.","time":1493577343,"resto":123491563,"id":"ZKUN3xLH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123507965,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:36:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123498672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123498672<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;somebody is doing this<\/span><br>wanna know more?","filename":"globalstandards","ext":".jpg","w":1301,"h":1597,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493577372424,"time":1493577372,"md5":"q+JCJ5+DwibNPTnCkQE9EQ==","fsize":907343,"resto":123491563,"id":"JWT9xHH0","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123508016,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:36:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123507965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123507965<\/a>","filename":"globalism","ext":".png","w":1328,"h":3374,"tn_w":49,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493577393886,"time":1493577393,"md5":"XbLFnCvTW1IiEdPkxmB7lg==","fsize":536189,"resto":123491563,"id":"JWT9xHH0","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123508054,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:36:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123491563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123491563<\/a><br>Jesus Christ is the way, anon.

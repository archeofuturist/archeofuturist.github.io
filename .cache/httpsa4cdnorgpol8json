Essentially we take the fact that the wsj employs fritz when he&#039;s a know white supremacist (or so they&#039;ll think). we could support this with the daily stormer article written about him and the tweets in which he&#039;s made. Then we could tie it back to the two writer that worked with him saying something like they knew that he&#039;s like this and their in support of him. Doing this we could build this idea of a group of white supremacist in the wsj. we vould have to find who ben fritz has collaborated with and who shown any support to him to add to this &quot;Group of white supremacist&quot;. something like that idk might be a small idea.","filename":"WSJ_Logo_BlackBackground_1200x630social","ext":".gif","w":977,"h":513,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":131,"tim":1491023178193,"time":1491023178,"md5":"bHVds+dKJj852qMXu+\/i8g==","fsize":12519,"resto":0,"id":"QH+oCyzA","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"anyone-up-for-knocking-these-guys-down-a-peg","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":119142504,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:13:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Marine Le Pen will become the French President!<\/span><br><br>pahahahahaha!<br><br>Shillary 2.0 incoming!","filename":"france JUST","ext":".png","w":761,"h":1293,"tn_w":147,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491020010370,"time":1491020010,"md5":"\/GrrkI7osXQ0aB5uTpPEPQ==","fsize":201455,"resto":0,"id":"YeauENur","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"marine-le-pen-will-become-the-french-president","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":13,"images":2,"omitted_posts":8,"omitted_images":1},{"no":119145553,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:44:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119142504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119142504<\/a><br>Of course Emmanuel Goldstein has the media saying he&#039;s winning","time":1491021881,"resto":119142504,"id":"zmYGHHRF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119145735,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:46:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119142504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119142504<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;roughly 40% of the French population thinks something needs to be done about the mudslime problem<\/span><br>If this fucking cuck does beat le pen, how long will it take before that 40% becomes 51%?","time":1491022004,"resto":119142504,"id":"+tHWQwhD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119146543,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:56:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119145735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119145735<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how long will it take before that 40% becomes 51%?<\/span><br>It will still be 40% because the amount of niggers imported during that time","time":1491022585,"resto":119142504,"id":"3ZWU3d70","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119146567,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:56:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119145735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119145735<\/a><br>We live in a world that is at its tipping point in regards to political leftism and rightism.

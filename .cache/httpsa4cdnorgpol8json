This writer took to many liberties without taking the original languages into consideration. Israel is not based on Isis and Ra and El. It is the Hebrew Semetic name pronounced Yees-ra-EHL. It Yeesra means Contend and El means God. It means Contended with God or Wrestled with God. It is taken from Ge 32:22-28 where Jacob challenged an angel to a wrestling for his blessing and would not stop challenging the angel until he had his blessing. The angel left and told him his new name is now Yeesrael for he Wrestled with God.<br><br>Another mistake is the name Lucifer. He admitted he used the KJV. That was a huge mistake. The KJV is not the final authority on translation. It is the original Hebrew, Koine Greek, Aramaic, and other ancient translations that precede the KJV by centuries. The original translation Isaiah 14:12 in Hebrew is &quot;morning star&quot; and in Greek &quot;bringer of dawn.&quot; This is not a proper name but a title given to a human. Specifically, the King of Babylon. We know this because Isaiah 14:15,16 says ...\u2018Is this the man that was agitating the earth, that was making kingdoms rock?

I offered this memorandum to him and had actually (so you will observe from the foot of the original , which is returned to you herewith) torn off your name -- and was about to tear off my title at the top, when (official) stated that he did not believe he wished to have any more from us at this time, on this subject. He expressed a profound distaste for the entire matter and said that he hoped we would never hear of it again -- it had been a hasty and difficult issue, principally because of the difficulty of explaining away the film and the statements of the American fliers. However, the vote had been favorable and he hoped that this was the end of the matter for him. He had no desire to raise the subject again himself, but said that he would probably call upon us for additional material if and when the matter should arise in the future.<br><br>My bump, is this of any use?

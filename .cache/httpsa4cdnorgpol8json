Why is all the media that they own and control completely anti Christian? Why do the Jews hate Jesus more then Hitler himself, If he was one of them or at least the ideology was? Why do the Jews wage a war against Christianity?","filename":"jewish-and-christian-relationship","ext":".jpg","w":1500,"h":1125,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492363303545,"time":1492363303,"md5":"TDdoBsYESRa3f5sFO3Qxpw==","fsize":442223,"resto":0,"id":"CurBJFzH","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"jews-and-christianty","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121364388,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)10:38:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"When did you realize moving out at 18 is an (((Anglo))) meme and considered not normal throughout the majority of the world?","filename":"IMG_6714","ext":".jpg","w":575,"h":250,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":108,"tim":1492353503229,"time":1492353503,"md5":"9Tk6mmBs4Oord2t4ZAnZRw==","fsize":57601,"resto":0,"id":"f1Oo\/snO","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"when-did-you-realize-moving-out-at-18-is-an-anglo","country_name":"United States","replies":52,"images":6,"omitted_posts":47,"omitted_images":5},{"no":121380704,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)12:55:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121378639\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121378639<\/a><br>Depends on the family and the house.

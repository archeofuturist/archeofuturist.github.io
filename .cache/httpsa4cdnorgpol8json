Because if you can&#039;t make anything of your own, individual life, then how can you think you&#039;ll be able to make a real difference for the race, for the lives of many?<br><br>Always remember: we live in first world countries and have opportunity that most people born on this planet don&#039;t. Take care of yourself. Work your ass off, every day, to build a good life for you, and for your family. Spend your time wisely, and keep your real life priorities in order. Nothing on the internet should ever take away from your real life.","filename":"1449133307616-1","ext":".jpg","w":1972,"h":1024,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":129,"tim":1492410107766,"time":1492410107,"md5":"YZ4HTumctTdF4H+WG51U3Q==","fsize":426514,"resto":0,"id":"UN0O8Pde","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-most-important-thing-you-can-do-for-the-white","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121474911,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)23:48:39","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Brit\/pol\/ - Turncoat May Edition","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Brexit will damage UK standards of living, say economists<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/dc62922a<wbr>-204b-11e7-a454-ab04428977f9<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Britain set to lose EU \u2018crown jewels\u2019 of banking and medicine agencies<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/politic<wbr>s\/2017\/apr\/15\/britain-set-to-lose-e<wbr>u-crown-jewels<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;British government realises Brexit is a mistake, official says<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.irishtimes.com\/news\/poli<wbr>tics\/british-government-realises-br<wbr>exit-is-a-mistake-official-says-1.3<wbr>048046<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Brexit opportunities are either elusive or not new <\/span><br>https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/950c2e7a<wbr>-15f3-11e7-b0c1-37e417ee6c76<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Theresa May suggests free movement extension<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politi<wbr>cs-39498647<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Brexit does not provide a single major opportunity to improve the UK economy in the long term<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/arti<wbr>cle-50-trigger-does-brexit-create-a<wbr>ny-opportunities-for-the-uk-2017-3?<wbr>IR=T&amp;r=UK<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Davis admits UK has not assessed Brexit without Brussels deal<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.ft.com\/content\/e87aebb0<wbr>-0963-11e7-ac5a-903b21361b43<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Until the referendum, Britons were unbothered by EU matters<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.economist.com\/news\/brita<wbr>in\/21720093-until-referendum-briton<wbr>s-were-unbothered-european-matters-<wbr>brexit-solution-search <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;US companies say Brexit puts 1.4 million UK jobs and $593 billion of investment at risk<\/span><br>http:\/\/uk.businessinsider.com\/study<wbr>-brexit-us-economic-impact-single-m<wbr>arket-american-chamber-of-commerce-<wbr>to-eu-report-2017-3<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;U.K. scientists prepare for impending break with European Union<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/news\/2017<wbr>\/03\/uk-scientists-prepare-impending<wbr>-break-european-union<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Japan Banks Seek New Home After Brexit<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/politics\/<wbr>articles\/2017-03-14\/konnichiwa-amst<wbr>erdam-japanese-banks-seek-new-home-<wbr>after-brexit<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cornwall asks for Government funding after Brexit, doesn\u2019t get it<\/span><br>https:\/\/inews.co.uk\/essentials\/news<wbr>\/uk\/councillor-tim-dwelly-cornwall-<wbr>will-go-off-cliff-due-lack-eu-gover<wbr>nment-funding\/","filename":"1465822478375665","ext":".jpg","w":618,"h":416,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":168,"tim":1492400919637,"time":1492400919,"md5":"d5LQxOWB9uOf1t606NtnOA==","fsize":108707,"resto":0,"id":"CDWZiPuf","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"britpol-turncoat-may-edition","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":125,"images":31,"omitted_posts":120,"omitted_images":30,"tail_size":50},{"no":121489381,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)02:12:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121489086\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121489086<\/a><br>I&#039;m just saying he&#039;s not the messiah.

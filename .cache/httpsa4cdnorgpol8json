I need to tell someone, I have no one<br><br>last weekend I got really drunk, REALLY drunk. I didn&#039;t really wanted to go out but I did it anyway. outside a bar I saw two women drinking. I was walking with my drink hidden obviously because its ilegal to drink on the streets, and sat on a bench to watch them. I&#039;m not joking but the two women came to where I was and started talking to me. They were cute but the taller one drived me crazy, she had the greatest tits I&#039;ve ever seen. They told me if I wanted to party in their apartment. I knew it was a dangerous area of the city so I told them why don&#039;t we drink where we were, but they insisted and told me they had more drinks on the place. So we went there<br><br>The taller one sat beside me and noticed I was constantly looking at her tits, and she told me if I wanted I could touch and grab them. I did, I licked, touched the tits of the tall girl while the other one was looking. I was cautious of not getting trapped or assaulted. Things started to get heated and she told me to pull down my pants, they brought down the light, and she told me to accommodate in a certain way to start fucking, she gave me her back and I started fucking, while the other grill came and inserted my dick inside the other girl, and I fucked the other one too.<br><br>After it, they both went to the bathroom for some minutes. They came back and told me to stay in the same position. When I was going to start, the big one grabbed me by the neck and told me to stay still. While she grabbed me, the other girl started to fuck me. They were males. I got raped by both. One grabbed me while the other one raped me. My anus is sore and hurt. The worst thing is they didn&#039;t used condom. I haven&#039;t spoken with anyone because I have no friends here, and my family is far way, in the south. I don&#039;t know what to do, the police will probably just laugh at me, and I haven&#039;t gone to class since","filename":"1491955180364","ext":".jpg","w":236,"h":299,"tn_w":197,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492839758855,"time":1492839758,"md5":"VcOZ3gjBFkLStY8gvJJYVw==","fsize":19676,"resto":0,"id":"JunFH7JN","country":"AR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-dont-post-much-here-im-a-lurker-but-i-want-to","country_name":"Argentina","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":122242881,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)01:49:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"So you didn&#039;t realize they were guys?

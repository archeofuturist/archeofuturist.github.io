As the law currently stands if you die at 64, all those social security taxes you pay go poof and no one inherits your benefits. Consider an alternative scenario, where a person was mandated to invest in the stock market (such as S&amp;P500). They would have $500,000 to their name. Now what happens if they die? Their progeny get that $500,000. This can be spent on anything, including further investments. Look at image attached, observe what happens if that $500,000 is put into a high dividend yield ETF. Simply living off the dividends by the age of 80 that $500,000 grows to $3,300,000. What happens when they die now? Their progeny inherits over 3 million dollars.<br><br>Social security is the most regressive policy in the history of America, yet liberals will never admit this nor will leftists.

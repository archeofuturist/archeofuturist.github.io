They stood out as they were acting weird, like they were worried someone was following them. BLS, aka Eric Clanton really caught my eye as he was wearing a new and very bright colored baja hoodie, with black skinny jeans and stylish black shoes. Also he had the same sunglasses and that hairdo that looks like you spent $20 worth of product and an hour in front of the mirror to try and look like you don&#039;t care how you look.<br><br>I had not seen the threads on BLS at this point and had only seem some basic coverage of the fights on youtube. But I remember thinking that these two looked like the stereotype of what you would expect some antifa to look like. I even expected that they were driving the beater volvo station wagon parked in the lot.<br><br>A few minutes later and Eric Clanton walks out and starts off like he is walking across the street all the while scanning the area like he is a dropout from CIA boot camp. He gets right to the street and stops. Turns around and I guess decides the coast is clear. He starts walking back to the DelTaco. When he walks past the car in the pic he bends over like he is going to tie his shoes but then slips into the car. A minute later his bud walks out with the food. He starts to do the same routine but Eric flags him and he scurries over and gets in the car. The pulled out and got on the highway headed towards LA. The car was a new or new&#039;ish silver Mercedes in the GL series and had California plates.<br><br>Honestly if they were not acting like such secret squirrels I would not have noticed them. Anyway, sorry for the long story. A friend sent me the link to the BLS stuff and it rocked me knowing that I had just seen this asshat. Anyway, I hope you guys can use this info to bring some karma to his life.","filename":"bls car","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1180,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":153,"tim":1492717659354,"time":1492717659,"md5":"L7zuveapWqEN850R+gkjhw==","fsize":667741,"resto":0,"id":"NfEx+Xs1","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bikelockscum-spotted","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":122033418,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)15:51:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"How do I know he&#039;s not \/ourguy\/?","time":1492717872,"resto":122032929,"id":"FsMJs1KM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122033321,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)15:50:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Dr. Kim, I&#039;m U.S.A","filename":"IMG_2018","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":1334,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492717832658,"time":1492717832,"md5":"x1YhY25s4fXtT7C7oRvjqg==","fsize":174905,"resto":0,"id":"dJBavbmU","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dr-kim-im-usa","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122033289,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)15:50:20","name":"Anonymous","sub":"The AscendencePilled ideology","com":"I come to you with the ultimate pill, the pill to pill all pills, The ultimate best ideology there is.<br><br>National socialist, or otherwise identity tied socialist, direct democracy ran communalism.<br><br>Communalism is the ultimate way of governing and living. Living in a small community is what people are made for. We are not yet psychologicly ready for a global enviroment. Small communities ensure feelings of inclusion and purpose, as scarcity of people means everyone has something to do to keep it running. In such small communities, capitalism is simply impossible and impractical. Hiring people, or private ownership of things makes no sense because there may be just 3 or four hammers for the entire commune, its easier to just share most property, maybe aside from homes, but this again - since its a small community its going to b close knit, most will know eachother like family there, so objections will pass. The national or otherwise unified part is simply to keep the community from dividing, from having trouble to cooperate. Its easier to work with people you feel a natural connection to, be it through your ethnic identity, culture, or maybe even just ideology (ideally all three or atleast two depending on your ideology). It also must almost neccesarily be a direct democracy, as the commune wouldnt be big enough to elect officials, and most likely unified enough (if all checkboxes on the unity are covered) to differ in opinon enough for officials to exist. Ofcourse, you could vary this by making a council of more elder members who &quot;have more experience&quot; or have a monarchy of sorts, but i think such a community would be too small for a monarchy or any authoritarian system.<br><br>Its not even a unrealistic ideology. Such a commune can be established RIGHT NOW. The commune would simply have to have a net produce of some type of good to pay the local tax, and provide resources it cannot produce by itself.","filename":"images (6)","ext":".jpg","w":253,"h":199,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":196,"tim":1492717820120,"time":1492717820,"md5":"F5iqgcib6HNIWy6XOnxDXw==","fsize":10057,"resto":0,"id":"s+54q0mO","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-ascendencepilled-ideology","country_name":"Poland","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122028729,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)15:15:15","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Reminder","com":"To report this lying skanks gofundme.

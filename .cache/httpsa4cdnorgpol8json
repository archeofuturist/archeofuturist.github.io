Even though there is some stigma on the word today, trough history we can see that that is what people want. There has never been a &quot;capitalist&quot; revolution. Unfortunately, the 20th century has shown that the true revolutionizing force is Capitalism even though it only serves itself and works for itself. Marxist ideas of any kind are too complicated to implement and usually fail to manage themselves and always have to be projected or planned in some manner.

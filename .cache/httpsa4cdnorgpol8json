He developed a new style of writing that modernized French literature. His most famous work is the 1932 novel, Journey to the End of the Night.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In 1935, British critic William Empson had written that C\u00e9line appeared to be &quot;a man ripe for fascism&quot;.[13] Two years later C\u00e9line began a series of pamphlets containing antisemitic themes: Bagatelles pour un massacre (Trifles for a Massacre) (1937), L&#039;\u00c9cole des cadavres (The School of Corpses) (1938) and Les Beaux draps (The Fine Mess) (1941). The Fine Mess was last published in France during the German occupation. These works were characterized by a virulent antisemitism, racism and bigotry.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Before the war, C\u00e9line campaigned for an alliance between France and Nazi Germany.[15] In L&#039;\u00c9cole des cadavres he contrasted Hitler with the French Communist party leader Maurice Thorez, writing:<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Who is the true friend of the people? Fascism is. Who has done the most for the working man? The USSR or Hitler? Hitler has... Who has done the most for the small businessman? Not Thorez but Hitler!&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;During the Occupation of France, he wrote letters to several collaborationist journals, denouncing the Jews.[17] Even some Nazis thought C\u00e9line&#039;s antisemitic pronouncements were so extreme as to be counter-productive. Bernhard Payr, the German superintendent of propaganda in France, considered that C\u00e9line &quot;started from correct racial notions&quot; but his &quot;savage, filthy slang&quot; and &quot;brutal obscenities&quot; spoiled his &quot;good intentions&quot; with &quot;hysterical wailing&quot;.[18][19]<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In February 1944, while C\u00e9line was having dinner in the German embassy in Paris with his friends Jacques Benoist-M\u00e9chin, Pierre Drieu La Rochelle and Gen Paul, he asserted to German ambassador Otto Abetz that Hitler was dead and had been replaced by a Jewish double.[22]<\/span>","filename":"IMG_0634","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":1088,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493121434031,"time":1493121434,"md5":"cLHdjQa6inVpsOVZ3JZTKQ==","fsize":211959,"resto":122722700,"id":"\/VfDinnT","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122726423,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:59:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122722700\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122722700<\/a>","filename":"mishima","ext":".jpg","w":497,"h":750,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493121578340,"time":1493121578,"md5":"XHg1Mm3X7mTqBl8m7EmLnQ==","fsize":59289,"resto":122722700,"id":"qKVnXiP2","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122726442,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:59:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122724442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122724442<\/a><br>I agree","time":1493121587,"resto":122722700,"id":"HR2XF7QO","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":122727193,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)08:10:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122724767\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122724767<\/a><br>Extremely entry-level and shallow list.

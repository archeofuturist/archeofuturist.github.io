That means if pilots are trying to single out a ground target, they need a first approach that&#039;s too close to use guided weapons, so they have to blow their cover, then circle back to a safe distance before launching an attack.<br><br>A pilot might revert to the cannon in such a circumstance, but at the moment, that doesn&#039;t work either.<br><br>To maintain its \u201cstealthy\u201d radar profile, the F-35A has a door to conceal the gun. Opening the door to fire the cannon pulls the aircraft off-target \u2013 something that needs a fix in the plane&#039;s software.<br><br>Yes, that software. The F-35&#039;s software also comes in for criticism, with Dr Gilmore writing that the December Block 3FR6 release isn&#039;t mature enough to \u201ccomplete the remaining test points\u201d. As well as the gun aiming issue, the \u201cAir-to-Air Range Infrastructure\u201d remains behind schedule.<br><br>Even if the cannon were usable, it&#039;s not much help in a ground support mission, because as Straus notes, the F-35s can only load up with a couple of hundred rounds (the A-10 Warthog carries more than 1,000 shells for its 30mm cannon).<br><br>Flight testing \u201ccontinues to be a source of significant discovery\u201d, the report drily notes: there are fatigue problems in the tail; the arresting gear on the F-35A variant is good for one landing only; the F-35A and F-35C show excessively high air flow temperatures around the engine; and the horizontal tail overheats in a Mach 1.5 run.<br><br>The F-35C is also problematic when launched from an aircraft carrier: \u201cVertical oscillations during F-35C catapult launches were reported by pilots as excessive, violent, and therefore a safety concern during this critical phase of flight.\u201d<br><br>2\/2","time":1491223532,"resto":119323930,"id":"nEFdEFCk","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119324351,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:48:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"like windows tried one OS to all devices, the f35 reinvented the fabled multi-role combat aircraft. Since military aircraft were made of string and paper, senior fools have fantasised about one combat aircraft being able to do more than one thing. I can&#039;t think of any that truly excelled all round - a few came close, but for all, the compromises always meant that there were far better dedicated airframes. Just think of the compromises needed on a multi-role aircraft between the attributes needed for low level versus high altitude, dogfight versus strike, stand-off versus close support, speed versus strength, endurance versus performance, carrier versus land ops, SVTOL versus runways, stealth versus aerodynamics and control....<br>That is why the F35 is a pile of junk, because of overreach in the specifications. They will iron out many of the shortcoming over time and at vast expense, but F35 will never excel in any of its roles. The Tornado shows the same thing - never as good at strike and low level as a Buccaneer, never a match for a proper interceptor fighter, never very good as a pure weapons platform.","time":1491223728,"resto":119323930,"id":"nEFdEFCk","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119323092,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:35:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Daily reminder that if your primary language is English, then you are a subhuman globalist faggot.","filename":"globalistcunt","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":800,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491222946732,"time":1491222946,"md5":"zWYMcmtEnkBlTo4F0vfoRg==","fsize":325736,"resto":0,"id":"pYSZLZFZ","country":"NO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"daily-reminder-that-if-your-primary-language-is","country_name":"Norway","replies":4,"images":0},{"no":119323189,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:36:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119323092\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119323092<\/a><br>I&#039;m REALLY happy you typed your message in English :)","time":1491223011,"resto":119323092,"id":"Opmt7NpX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119323590,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:40:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119323189\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119323189<\/a><br>xd","time":1491223254,"resto":119323092,"id":"Awml7+Jd","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119323810,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:43:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119323092\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119323092<\/a><br>Even if I&#039;m English?","time":1491223383,"resto":119323092,"id":"5XzkO9Oh","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119324166,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:47:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119323810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119323810<\/a><br><br>True English is old English.","time":1491223620,"resto":119323092,"id":"pYSZLZFZ","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119322489,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)08:29:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"What do you think of this \/pol\/? <br><br>I&#039;m not a regular on \/pol\/, but I despise the current left, because they keep trying to shit up my hobbies (\/k\/ \/tg\/ \/co\/ \/vidya\/).

We all know for a fact that Christianity has the same origin with Judaism (earliest) and Islam (latest), and the more stupid someone is, the more religious he will be (nigger\/sandnigger). There is absolutely nothing special about it. <br>But Rationalism is something, I personally think, so intrinsically and so uniquely, belong to Western civilization. You are famous for it, and you thrived because of it. Science, technology, even art, all emerge from it. It was a total cultural domination - all culture in the world nowadays, in a way, forever succumb to your philosophy. Every person in the world wants to talk &quot;rationally&quot;, to think &quot;rationally&quot;. Every word I read every method I learn, I see myself being imposed into a 4 centuries old frame of mind. Rarely ever you will find a school of thought in which its own name becomes a positive word.<br>Western civilization risks going down, not by refugee terrorist nor by nigger breeding, but because you have forgotten your root, of what have given you all the science to control the world.

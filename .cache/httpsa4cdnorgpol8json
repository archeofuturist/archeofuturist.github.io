The fully indoctrinated social justice warriors and die hard leftists are the ones running academia. So the brainwashed are brainwashing others, who will in turn brainwash again. We need to rip out the cancer within not only our colleges but our K-12 as well. Not only the marxist shit but also the scope of history classes need to be expanded. For example when the schools teach about slavery they only teach about it in America, not the rest of the world and who was doing the rest of the slaving (majority muslim and jew by far). So by this they create white guilt and the false perception that we were the ones responsible for it. And when they teach about WW2 they still teach the factually incorrect version with the death camps and ridiculously inflated death tolls. They don&#039;t teach about the jewish communist civil war that killed over 70,000,000 and they don&#039;t teach about the Weimar republic. They don&#039;t teach about the reasons behind the decisions leading up to the creation of Nazi Germany and the start of WW2. Our schools should value truth in their teachings, not narrow ass view three lessons long segments that skim over several decades at a time and barely covers anything.","time":1490336279,"resto":118028057,"id":"y81Gb8Se","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118051537,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)02:24:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

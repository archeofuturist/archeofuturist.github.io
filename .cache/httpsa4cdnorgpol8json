He was transported to UMass Memorial Hospital-Leominster, where he was pronounced dead at 4:07 a.m.[10][92][93][11] State Department of Correction spokesman Christopher Fallon first said no suicide note was found in Hernandez&#039;s single-occupant cell, but on April 20, 2017, investigators reported that three handwritten notes were next to a Bible opened to John 3:16 and &quot;John 3:16&quot; was written on his forehead in ink.[94] One note said he was entering the &quot;timeless realm&quot; and would see his family in heaven while another note said he loved his family and told them not to shed a tear; soap was found covering the floor and there were drawings in blood on the walls showing an unfinished pyramid and the all-seeing eye of God with the word &quot;Illuminati&quot; written in capital letters underneath.[95] Prison officials had not observed any signs that Hernandez was at risk for suicide, so he was not put on around-the-clock watch.[96] Upon completion of the autopsy by the medical examiner, the death has been officially ruled a suicide. Hernandez&#039;s brain was released to Boston University to be studied for signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive degenerative disease found in people who have had a severe blow or repeated blows to the head.[97] His lawyer-agent, Jose Baez, disputed any claim of suicide, initiating his own investigation of the death.[98]","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":667,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492996011008,"time":1492996011,"md5":"o7QH+rlsjEf0vDHYY\/vx3A==","fsize":76946,"resto":0,"id":"nIv4nKJw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"illuminati-blood-pyramid","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":4,"omitted_posts":9,"omitted_images":2},{"no":122524124,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)21:45:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122520320\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122520320<\/a>","filename":"1475207081603","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":111,"tim":1492998350820,"time":1492998350,"md5":"pfOLNq5TYdRC1aNutQI5nA==","fsize":14240,"resto":122519612,"id":"c28CJ9Wb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122524227,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)21:46:39","name":"Anonymous","filename":"CSETIbluewhitelogo","ext":".gif","w":115,"h":115,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":115,"tim":1492998399419,"time":1492998399,"md5":"GZ03xq0aIYb\/4lu6vVUNoQ==","fsize":1858,"resto":122519612,"id":"jVPSgcHa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122524303,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)21:47:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122524227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122524227<\/a><br>Why are you spamming this shit?","time":1492998441,"resto":122519612,"id":"c28CJ9Wb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122524873,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)21:52:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122520320\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122520320<\/a><br>Is this guy legit leaf?","time":1492998731,"resto":122519612,"id":"nBZLcjCL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122524987,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)21:53:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122523730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122523730<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m gonna need a QRD on this hernandez guy.<\/span><br>Star football player that had the world in his hands, but couldn&#039;t stop being a nigger. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2.

This apparently makes it harder for his victims to get access to his estate and will more than likely result in his daughter receiving all of his money. Take that for what you will, that&#039;s just what I&#039;ve been hearing about the whole thing.

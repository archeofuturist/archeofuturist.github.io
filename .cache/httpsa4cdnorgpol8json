However, these salaries are just laughable. For example, if I don&#039;t have a flat in Moscow I&#039;ll have to pay at least 30k roubles\/month to rent a pretty shitty flat, whereas the salary of an inexperienced worker (e.g. of students like me) is around 30k (Moscow). There is also a big censorship on mass media. They didn&#039;t show anything about the protests on major news channels that 90% of people watches because those news channels are influenced by the government.<br>The pensioners&#039; pensions are very small and they sometimes can&#039;t make a monthly payment for their own apartment. <br>Now about 26 March&#039;s events, the police arrested almost everyone with placards no matter what was written on them and tended to arrest people randomly, they just arrested people that didn&#039;t try to interfere the police&#039;s work.

However, despite the fact that Russian people had put up, are putting up and will continue to put up with lots of shit that the present government throws at them, the conditions are pretty unbearable atm. If tax rates will go up again and if Putin or Medvedev are to sit in the president&#039;s seat again, the people will riot. However, I can&#039;t say for sure if those riots will lead to something big or not because as I said, Russian people can&#039;t riot(the aftermath of communism?) like guys from Western countries, but the people&#039;s patience is ending because when you rise even 10k people in Russia to protest against the government it&#039;s a pretty big deal here lol","time":1490659421,"resto":118572272,"id":"OxiQSj1T","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":118583269,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:07:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118582477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118582477<\/a><br><br>Hy \u0445o\u0442\u044c \u043fo\u0447\u0438c\u0442\u0438\u0442 \u043aa\u043a ca\u043c\u0438\u0445 c\u0438\u043bo\u0432\u0438\u043ao\u0432 \u0438 \u0442a\u043c \u0447e\u0447e\u043do\u0432 a\u0432oc\u044c e\u0431\u043de\u0442, \u043fo \u043co\u0438\u043c \u0434a\u043d\u043d\u044b\u043c \u044d\u0442\u0438\u0445 \u043de\u043da\u0432\u0438\u0434\u044f\u0442 \u043aa\u043a \u0432 \u0424C\u0411, \u0442a\u043a \u0438 \u0432 ap\u043c\u0438\u0438.","time":1490659669,"resto":118572272,"id":"S50eKjvm","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118576652,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:09:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Australia is not real.

Why does it matter whether we agree on social policies with the Nu-Communist crowd? Why does it matter whether their economic system is inferior or superior? Right now, we have one thing in common: a hatred for the elites that run this world with banking, warmongering, zionism, and terror. Instead of letting them divide us based on preference to Hitler or Stalin, let&#039;s look at how we can bridge the gap between one another and, temporarily, fight side by side to defeat the ((Elite)). <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; note I&#039;m using Elite because it does not specify the &#039;enemy&#039; of either natsoc or communism (Jews and Bourgeoisie)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; If Stalin and Hitler combined forces, they would have been completely unstoppable. It took the Allies, including the massive USSR, many years to break the Axis. Nazi Germany possessed the most advanced technology in the world, and some of the most elite fighting forces, while the USSR commanded the largest army that walked the face of the Earth. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; While Hitler pulled Germany from a horrible depression and turned it into the utopia of Europe, the Man of Steel single-handedly forced Russia to evolve from a peasant wasteland into an Empire of Iron. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; For many years, both tyrants admired one another, and even formed the non-aggression pact, taking out Poland together in 29 days. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Stalin thought Lenin was not harsh enough, and Trotsky was too weak. After the war, he even planned to deport and enslave every Jew in the USSR to a murderous gulag, because he despised their treachery and their massive involvement in banking. Even Karl Marx, Jewish as he was, hated Jewry. His words are more anti-semitic than Hitler&#039;s.<\/span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; cont&#039;d<\/span>","filename":"3398436_orig","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493949819502,"time":1493949819,"md5":"UGuOEvz5rYpW32+UF3okaw==","fsize":11868,"resto":0,"id":"jg7Rd\/eW","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"alright-pol-hates-sectarianism-while","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":124148698,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:04:22","name":"Lebanese Christian","com":"<a href=\"#p124148615\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124148615<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; While Hitler despised Communism, both he and Stalin shared a mutual hatred of the Jewish Capitalist Banking System. Even though Communism was funded and promoted by Jews, likely due to its revolt of the orthodox Russia, Stalin was not a fan of their ways, and was completely unhinged and destructive, even towards them. In his final days, Stalin proclaimed that it was the Israelis that would poison him, but his inner circle destroyed any chance of an actual investigation of the Soviet leader\u2019s death. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Stalin was taken by complete surprise when Hitler first bombed the Soviet Union, and refused to believe it had happened. When he realized it was no mistake, he was tormented by confusion and cried out that they \u201cwould have been unstoppable\u201d together. <\/span><br><br><br>Yes, I know you guys are going to whip out some communism screenshots promoted by Dennis Wise. I never said Stalin was some innocent man. But is it coincidence that the two most hated men in history were both outsiders (Austrian, Georgian) and commanded a powerful empire (Germany, Russia) by transforming the countries from depressions into unstoppable fighting forces? Is it coincidence that the Elite keep trying to pin comm against natsoc, and that the two most hated men in history were vehemently anti-capitalist? We might have our differences, but for the moment, the New Communists and NatSocs should remedy the mistake their idols made and band together to crush the jewish banking system once and for all, instead of self-destructing.","filename":"hitler-stalin-2","ext":".jpg","w":623,"h":430,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1493949862667,"time":1493949862,"md5":"OmvGxQKKY46P02f7vuxnaw==","fsize":163331,"resto":124148615,"id":"jg7Rd\/eW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124148570,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)22:03:12","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Why you should start a fake antifa facebook organization","com":"1: it takes less than an hour to set up<br>2: it will ALLWAYS be at least somewhat effective<br>3: you have nothing better to do","filename":"fhb","ext":".gif","w":1230,"h":1229,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":249,"tim":1493949792934,"time":1493949792,"md5":"awTn0k29BOy41oivZy8f\/A==","fsize":171737,"resto":0,"id":"9pOloI24","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-you-should-start-a-fake-antifa-facebook","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":124148121,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:59:31","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/pol\/ Rally","com":"Face it lads, this place will NEVER be like it was during the US Elections, a.k.a the Golden Age of \/pol\/ and Kekistan. <br>What can we do to bring back those United and Enjoyable moments?

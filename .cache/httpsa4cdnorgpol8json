A man who is perfectly attractive to them will burst into her bedroom, or wherever she places the scene. He will take her by force, which is deeply arousing to the average woman, because it shows she is desired and that he is confident and strong. However, she won&#039;t need to\/want to resist, and said she won&#039;t really be hurt. Most play out the scene so that they may have a hand placed over their mouth, and end up tied and bound, but never actually imagine themselves being damaged. Then she gets fucked, exactly how she wants it and whatever happens afterwards is irrelevant because she doesn&#039;t need to think that far. It&#039;s just a fantasy. At its core this is hardly unusual, think about it in a simplistic way. All she imagined was that her perfect man just appeared and fucked her rotten, a perfect sexual being who didn&#039;t even need to ask and took what he desired, because in her fantasy she is desired. So, technically yes, she imagines she&#039;s being raped. <br><br>This is why it&#039;s very important to understand that normal, mature people can separate their fantasies from reality.

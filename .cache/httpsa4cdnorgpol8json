Therefore I will start another one. Not because I seek attention, but it&#039;s to help you fags get out of your moms basement and stop shoving memes into your anuses.<br><br>Was that funny enough to get your adhd attention? Good.<br><br>Anyways. I am William and I am the reincarnation of William The Conqueror.<br><br>My questions to you fuckheads is simple:<br><br>What is the reason behind life? Why even exist in the first place?<br><br>I have the answer. Listen closely.<br><br>Life is a learning lesson that we designed before birth. There is one creator that set everything into motion that pre-existed before the big bang. The creator is a massive ball of love and light. Upon his creation, he decided to separate us from him in order to experience destiny and free will. We are balls of love and light, masked in a world of hate.<br><br>We experience free will because it is the yang to his yin. His yin is a planned out, perfectly, in an orderly universe. We are the chaos that presents free will, therefore the ability to change at a moments notice. God needs us because we able to be ignorant &quot;souls&quot; in his own creation. The creator, although perfect and understands everything, gave us a playground for us to be ourselves and for us to be his test subjects in a big scientific experiment that lasts trillions of years (there are 7 big bang reincarnation. We are on number 2).<br><br>With that being said, you chose this life for a reason for the greater good of humanity. We exist only to be ourselves, nothing more nor less. You, along with a council of higher beings, carefully wrote this script. You are the star of your own show.<br><br>However - you can change that script at anytime. Believe in yourself and actually follow through with your goals and the universe will start giving you blow jobs and thanking you. <br><br>The meaning of life is this - be yourself.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1440,"h":1787,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490883960245,"time":1490883960,"md5":"Pc7b3VCk6q6aaizk35SWAw==","fsize":502379,"resto":0,"id":"TDpnTsil","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-is-the-meaning-of-life","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":2,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":118925311,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)10:28:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118925100\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118925100<\/a><br>Dank memes tongue my anus.","time":1490884101,"resto":118925100,"id":"9x0d5MSV","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118925414,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)10:29:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118925286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118925286<\/a><br>B.E. yourself*","time":1490884164,"resto":118925100,"id":"v10rWjBQ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118925951,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)10:35:36","name":"WillTheConqueror","com":"<a href=\"#p118925311\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118925311<\/a><br>Stop shovinig memes into your anus.

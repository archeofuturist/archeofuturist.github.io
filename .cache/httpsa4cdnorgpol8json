Typically one side has a superior technological advantage and the other is fighting an insurgency\/guerilla war. In these sorts of cases, when soldiers are fighting an unseen enemy for extended periods of time, there is a very high chance of war crimes being committed. This can be seen all the way back during the American Revolution when British soldiers went beserk after the Battle of Concord because the rebels weren&#039;t fighting like a normal army. More recently, incidents such as My Lai and Haditha also point this out. <br><br>My point is that when Soldiers are fighting against soldier in an equal capacity, there tends to be a lessening of war crimes.

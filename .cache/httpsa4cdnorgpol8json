The MSM&#039;s resulting control over the limbic system leaves the victim highly susceptible to its suggestions.<br><br>Organics undergoing indoctrination may complain of headaches and buzzing or ringing in their ears. As time passes, they have feelings of &quot;being watched&quot; and hallucinations of &quot;ghostly&quot; presences. Ultimately, the MSM gains the ability to use the victim&#039;s body to amplify its signals, manifesting as &quot;alien&quot; voices in the mind.<br><br>Indoctrination can create perfect deep cover agents. A Normie&#039;s &quot;suggestions&quot; can manipulate victims into betraying friends, trusting enemies, or viewing the MSM itself with superstitious awe. Should a Normie subvert a well-placed political or military leader, the resulting chaos can bring down nations.<br><br>Long-term physical effects of the manipulation are unsustainable. Higher mental functioning decays, ultimately leaving the victim a gibbering animal. Rapid indoctrination is possible, but causes this decay in days or weeks.

Virtually everyone that uses the jquery library for their site&#039;s JS links it from googleapis instead of hosting their own local copy. It also goes for webfonts, though not to the same degree. Both are used to track your activity without you realizing it, and because so much of the net is now dependent on jquery, blocking googleapis will break a lot of sites. There are some attempts being made at browser addons to interdict 3rd party jquery calls and replace them with a copy on your own device, but I don&#039;t know how functional those are yet.

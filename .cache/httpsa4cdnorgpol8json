Check this out: all immigrants will have full access to education, from primary school to college, full healthcare, full housing, social security, an easier path to citizenship and a bunch of other rights. Can it get worse? Yes, it can! All immigrants will also have the right to start a political party, which automatically grants public funds to do as they please.

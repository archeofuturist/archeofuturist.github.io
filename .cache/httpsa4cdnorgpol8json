Unfortunately the leftist &quot;New Deal Alliance&quot; and &quot;Libertarians&quot; (edgy centrists who are afraid to call themselves democrats) are gaining power quickly. These two opposition parties are made up of everything from literature-citing Marxists who cant argue worth a dime to full on Ancap.

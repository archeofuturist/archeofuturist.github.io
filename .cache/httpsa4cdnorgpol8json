It doesn&#039;t offer room for intellectualism or fact-based refutation. It operates entirely on clickbait, imagery and quick replies, especially on the faster boards like \/pol\/. On other websites such as NYT, reddit or more traditional forums, you are able to view and respond to a post hours after it has been made. This type of structure offers a much more intellectual-based dialog in which points can be refuted with facts and highlighted to be seen by many. In short, this disparity creates a very clear divide in political opinions and views - one based on facts and intellectual standards, and one based on imagery and propaganda.<br><br>What does \/pol\/

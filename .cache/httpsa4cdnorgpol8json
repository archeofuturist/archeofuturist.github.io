Britcucks thought Germany building its own navy was a hostile act because they&#039;re retarded so they allied with their historical enemy instead. Germany knew everyone irrationally hated them so they acted in their own defense. WW2 was started because Hitler wanted to unite the German people which was an unreasonable demand to Lesser Shitstain and Pooland who wanted to keep oppressing the Germans in Danzig. The retards in 1919 thought splitting germany into two was a good idea and Hitler thinking that should end was just too much to ask. Churchill could have made peace in 1940-41 but instead chose to throw away millions of lives and the empire for no reason whatsoever or maybe because he was a retarded pig. The chosenites would have been sent to their holy desert and everyone would live happily ever after. Instead, Churchill kills millions for no reason and then decides to just stop at Berlin because I guess Russians controlling Danzig and expelling the Germans who lived there is okay but Germany controlling Danzig is just terrible because reasons. Meanwhile in India, millions starve to death because of his retarded pointless war to stop Germany from controlling a city populated by Germans. Then Churchill is remembered as le hero even though he did nothing but cry for the thirteen colonies to come save his ass. Ironically, Churchill hated muslims and now his capital city is full of them because of his retarded decisions and is likely to become even worse in the future.","time":1491226242,"resto":119317841,"id":"x6z95671","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119328306,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)09:31:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119317896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119317896<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119317841\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119317841<\/a><br>Jews","time":1491226283,"resto":119317841,"id":"OMZtMZG3","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119316664,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)07:10:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"So now that ISPs can sell browsing history, how will we continue to post ironic and satirical NatSoc memes carefree?<br><br>Ameribros only obviously.

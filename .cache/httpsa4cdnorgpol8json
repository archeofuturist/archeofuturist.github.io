Ideally I would like a resurgence of Pagan traditions and Gods, but I believe in the current situation we are in, the chasm to achieve this is too large to cross in a single leap. Because of this, I feel Christianity is the only bulwark we have against the tide of degeneracy. Indeed, we must be welcoming to those other sects of Christianity, to bulk up our numbers.

I further believe there is fertile ground to do this and bring lost souls into the fray - even those who consider themselves atheists could be persuaded. This is not impossible in a religion.

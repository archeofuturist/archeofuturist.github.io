I know that all the winning Antifa has been doing out on the streets (burning down homes, stabbing frat fuccbois, throwing smoke grenades, pepper spraying white women that think it&#039;s ok to speak in public when there are people of colored around, etc.) can sap a lot of one&#039;s energy. Even the strongest warriors sometimes need a break to rejuvenate. I think that&#039;s where I can help. I&#039;m a pretty buff guy and I think I could easily fit at least 1-2 of our precious antifa femmes on myself. I can transformer into a resting bench while we are mobile and on the go any time it is necessary. I could also carry sacks of refreshments, toilet paper, and doggie doo-doo bags (sometimes you gotta go when you gotta, but it is important to stay responsible). I have some other ideas as well so feel free to contact me about them. Also contact me if you wish me to demonstrate my abilities on Quinn. I need to go grocery shopping with my mom right now.

The reporting requirements were enacted to detect serious criminal activity, such as drug dealing and terrorism. They \u201cwere not put in place just so that the Government could enforce the reporting requirements,\u201d as the IG&#039;s report puts it.<br><br>The IG took a random sample of 278 IRS forfeiture actions in cases where structuring was the primary basis for seizure.

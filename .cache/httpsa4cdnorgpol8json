I remember in the 70&#039;s they said affirmative action was to &quot;level the playing field&quot; for the &quot;traditionally oppressed&quot; minorities. Here we are 40 fucking years later and obviously inferior people get into college and get jobs simply because of their skin color.<br><br>People are asking, If we are all so fucking equal then why do blacks get special treatment and unfair advantages TWO GENERATIONS after affirmative action. It&#039;s becoming more and more obvious that affirmative action is simply taking from one group and giving to another group simply for political gain (by Democrats).","filename":"weak_should_fear_buckeye","ext":".png","w":704,"h":670,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1491800342590,"time":1491800342,"md5":"b5EjTUp9BODNa3ZtVshBzQ==","fsize":507555,"resto":120390106,"id":"xV9No8ah","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120392368,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)00:30:09","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Enoch Powell lives in Britain","com":"Surprisingly good article from the economist<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Europe and migration, the issues he put at the heart of his ideology, have come to define British politics<\/span><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/CynES","filename":"enoch2_xlarge1[1]","ext":".jpg","w":230,"h":290,"tn_w":198,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491798609902,"time":1491798609,"md5":"Kz6uLMAxUbMzHA5b4lOJFA==","fsize":13721,"resto":0,"id":"wy\/4kivH","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"enoch-powell-lives-in-britain","country_name":"Brazil","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":120395383,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)00:59:00","name":"\u56de","com":"<a href=\"#p120392368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120392368<\/a><br>Nice lad should post this in Brit\/pol\/<br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120394481#p120394481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120394481<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120394481#p120394481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120394481<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120394481#p120394481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120394481<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120394481#p120394481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120394481<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120394481#p120394481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120394481<\/a>","time":1491800340,"resto":120392368,"id":"ANQkv0gF","country":"GB","trip":"!!FJ60XUrqjrt","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120394634,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)00:51:46","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Brit\/pol\/ - Nostalgia Edition","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;

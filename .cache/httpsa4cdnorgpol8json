None of the less Trump started an airstrike against a russian base in Syria. This caused many now to forsake Trump (or maybe its just shills trying to make people do that). However, dont forsake Trump yet.<br>Wether Trump is a puppet or not, it is obvious that this issue gets blown out of proportion ridiculously. The military base was warned of the airstrike beforehand making it unlikely there were any victims. This also means this probabl wont escalate into a war.<br>They try to strip trump off the support of the public, so they then go against him personally (impeach him, assassinate him or whatever). The sudden increased shilling against Trump makes me think he actually isnt a puppet.<br>However dont trust him blindly either. Keep a close eye on him, watch his every step. Observe the future events closely. We cant let Trump now for such a dumb reason that probably will have no effect. He probably was just virtuesignaling that he isnt on russia sides or that he does condemn the gas attack so the people would shut up about him. He maybe did the &quot;attack&quot; to show he actually wants to go after those behind it, to than later find out those behind the attack are actually his political opponents and now he can go after them without people talking about how he just wants to silence opposition as he showed he is serious about the gas attack beforehand.<br><br>Dont forsake Trump, that plays right into (((their))) hand, stripping him off the only source of power he has, the people. (if he isnt a puppet)<br>Dont trust him blindly with everything he does, that would also play right into their hand (if he is a puppet).<br><br>Keep observing, and dont change your oppinion because of something that possibly will have absolute no effect on the future","filename":"based ronny","ext":".png","w":861,"h":1982,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491540554496,"time":1491540554,"md5":"MPzOHoEHjUMIadk7f1Eh7w==","fsize":851272,"resto":0,"id":"Mw0vjzsA","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-actually-is-going-on","country_name":"Germany","replies":16,"images":3,"omitted_posts":11,"omitted_images":1},{"no":119888056,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)01:11:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119887444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119887444<\/a><br>im not telling you to give him any benefit, im just telling you to wait until he at least actually fucks up.","time":1491541882,"resto":119884223,"id":"Mw0vjzsA","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119888191,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)01:12:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119887444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119887444<\/a><br>I voted Trump.

Idk where else to write about this.Guys the BLACKED meme finnaly caught up with me irl. I found out my gf has a super slutty past and has fucked tons of guys including multiple niggers. <br><br>So your thinking wait a min. Just break up and run away and never talk to her again. Well I&#039;m not. I&#039;m gonna knock her up. I&#039;m gonna make like 4 white baby&#039;s with her then I&#039;m gonna leave. Of course the whole time we are together I&#039;m gonna be fucking every girl on the sides and gonna force her to do threesomes. Once I pump enough white babies I&#039;m gonna get outta dodge.<br><br>Now your wondering why? Well besides her past we do get along perfectly and I think she will make a good single mom to my kids. Isn&#039;t it better her to have 4 white kids then end up a single mom with half nigger babies? Because If I break her heart now I know she&#039;ll go back to coal burning . <br><br>I&#039;m also not gonna marry her of course like I planned or even sign my name on the birth certificates. I have no money so good luck with child support lol. I&#039;m a NEET.<br><br>But yea I feel this a good idea. You guys out there who are broke neets like me, go knock up sluts and make them have white babies for you. It&#039;s alot better then them never having kids or having half black kids.<br>Do you agree?","filename":"download (3)","ext":".jpg","w":160,"h":228,"tn_w":160,"tn_h":228,"tim":1491392008912,"time":1491392008,"md5":"z4x0HqYmki4bUlhyKtoNYA==","fsize":7599,"resto":0,"id":"W35SGjXL","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-to-put-whores-to-use","country_name":"France","replies":6,"images":1,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":119597626,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)07:37:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119597386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119597386<\/a><br><br>dude don&#039;t fucking do it. you are goign to ruin your life, if you ever try to be more than neet and make you are destined to have everything you make taken from you for child support.

It is hot. It&#039;s not a happy fun balmy beach holiday heat. It is an angry and oppressive heat. Australia is not meant to support life. There is nothing good about a 45 degree day.

I think the heat damages their brains.<br><br>4. There is trash everywhere. There are some streets in Melbourne that are littered with more trash than places I&#039;ve seen in Mexico.<br><br>5. Australian accents are annoying. The first week you are there you&#039;re like okay that&#039;s kinda cool\/interesting\/whatever. It gets more and more draining to have to listen to these people as time goes on. After about a month you will want to rip the fucking throat out of any Australian that speaks to you.

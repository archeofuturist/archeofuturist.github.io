I think FDR might be the worst of all time due to literally seizing private businesses, internment camps, trying to rig the supreme court, and also did the exact opposite of what he campaigned for (said he would spend less, instead spent everything).<br><br>But for the modern presidents, and considering most people won&#039;t know who FDR even is, I think Trump will be the worst one. People hate Bush, people hate Obama, but now Trump is hated by the left AND by his own core constituents. Some in the media may be sucking up to him now, but the left still despises him. If he does put troops in Syria, it&#039;s all over. <br><br>Even ann coulter doesn&#039;t seem to think he&#039;s gonna build the wall anymore, and neither do I. One of the selling points of Trump was that he had to keep his promises, or he&#039;d just be trashed. He seems to have forgotten that. Left or right, both sides are tired of war, even if the politicians aren&#039;t. <br><br>I&#039;m really starting to hate America. I feel like everyone is just waiting for it to fail, on both sides.

His teaching also contained precepts that were in conformity with his promises, and he gave free rein to carnal pleasure. In all this, as is not unexpected; he was obeyed by carnal men. As for proofs of the truth of his doctrine, he brought forward only such as could be grasped by the natural ability of anyone with a very modest wisdom. Indeed, the truths that he taught he mingled with many fables and with doctrines of the greatest falsity.<br><br>He did not bring forth any signs produced in a supernatural way, which alone fittingly gives witness to divine inspiration; for a visible action that can be only divine reveals an invisibly inspired teacher of truth. On the Contrary, Mohammed said that he was sent in the power of his arms - which are signs not lacking even to robbers and tyrants. What is more, no wise men, men trained in things divine and human, believed in him from the beginning (1). Those who believed in him were brutal men and desert wanderers, utterly ignorant of all divine teaching, through whose numbers Mohammed forced others to become his follower&#039;s by the violence of his arms. Nor do divine pronouncements on part of preceding prophets offer him any witness. On the contrary, he perverts almost all the testimony of the Old and the New Testaments by making them into a fabrication of his own, as can be seen by anyone who examines his law. It was, therefore, a shrewd decision on his part to forbid his followers to read the Old and New Testaments, lest these books convict him of falsity. It is thus clear that those who place faith in his words believe foolishly.","filename":"Thomas-Aquinas-Black-large-216x300","ext":".jpg","w":216,"h":300,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491714620806,"time":1491714620,"md5":"dJ8XOfv5xz51+5chPIP9Iw==","fsize":22076,"resto":120241946,"id":"MwmWb2T8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120242173,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:10:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120242115\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120242115<\/a><br>fpbp?<br>fpbp","time":1491714640,"resto":120241946,"id":"rPK4pJDU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120242461,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:13:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"There is no GOD but KEK and Pepe is his prophet.","time":1491714791,"resto":120241946,"id":"XMsj1Kqe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120242792,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:16:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120241946\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120241946<\/a><br>How do we know muhammad is a true prophet?<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=flA<wbr>31Z1MAlg&amp;t","time":1491714971,"resto":120241946,"id":"R+Rjspax","country":"GT","country_name":"Guatemala"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120242098,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)01:10:05","name":"Anonymous","sub":"North Korean Nukes","com":"Are we really gonna get blown up overnight?

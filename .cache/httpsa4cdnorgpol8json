It allows you to navigate through the world, provide for your needs, create things, have power and avoid getting backstabbed. For this, you must see the world with a critical eye.<br><br>To start with, try doubting everything you see or hears. This is very important, because you don&#039;t know something unless you have a reason to believe it&#039;s true or you have proof that it&#039;s true. This doesn&#039;t mean that you should believe everything is true, but instead just accept that you don&#039;t know what you don&#039;t know.<br><br>Realise the implications and logical steps in a position. For example, the belief that all morals and ethics are relative. This can be used as a justification for multiculturalism or mass immigration because their values, morals etc. are just as meaningful as ours.<br><br>Another example is the belief that we have free will and that circumstances don&#039;t make who you are. You can use this belief to justify not giving welfare to people and defunding social programs because they chose that.<br><br>Notice that these &quot;higher beliefs&quot; (morality, religion, values) often idealy determine &quot;lower beliefs&quot; (gun rights, lgbt rights, capitalism etc).

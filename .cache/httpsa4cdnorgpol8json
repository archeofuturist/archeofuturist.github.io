She was likely more mathematically proficient than most people on \/pol\/, so the writing of the code was probably not beyond her ability. However, there is no evidence that she ever wrote the code she is supposed to have written. In fact, most evidence seems to suggest she was only offering her input on code\/instruction sets written by someone else. There is also no evidence that the code supposed to have been written by Lovelace was the first. In fact, most scholars consider it unlikely that Babbage didn&#039;t write the first code himself.

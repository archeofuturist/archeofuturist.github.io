Englishmen took away, or defrauded, from the Irish, their lands; but professed to leave the people free. The people, however, must have the use of land, or starve. The English charged them, in rent, so much, that their allowance, after deducting that rent, was not half that of Jamaica slaves. They were compelled to labor for their landlords, by the fear of hunger and death\u2014forces stronger than the overseer&#039;s lash. They worked more, and did not get half so much pay or allowance as the Jamaica negroes. All the reports to the French and British Parliaments show that the physical wants of the West India slaves were well supplied. The Irish became the subjects of capital\u2014slaves, with no masters obliged by law, self-interest or domestic affections, to provide for them. The freest people in the world, in the loose and common sense of words, their condition, moral, physical and religious, was far worse than that of civilized slaves ever has been or ever can be\u2014for at length, after centuries of slow starvation, three hundred thousand perished in a single season, for want of food. Englishmen took the lands of Jamaica also, but introduced negro slaves, whom they were compelled to support at all seasons, and at any cost. The negroes were comfortable, until philanthropy taxed the poor of England and Ireland[Pg 39] a hundred millions to free them. Now, they enjoy Irish liberty, whilst the English hold all the good lands. They are destitute and savage, and in all respects worse off than when in slavery<\/span>","filename":"George Fitzhugh","ext":".jpg","w":349,"h":400,"tn_w":218,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492494376863,"time":1492494376,"md5":"MUCt1ocG\/SO5t25ZICxL\/w==","fsize":91275,"resto":0,"id":"M\/wBU8hz","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"england-became-possessed-of-two-fine-islands","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121629840,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)23:19:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Can someone defend this? <br><br>I can&#039;t.","filename":"Screenshot_20170417-201754","ext":".jpg","w":1393,"h":835,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":149,"tim":1492485552074,"time":1492485552,"md5":"+G5xzwbUa3+AsR0FXUpeXQ==","fsize":285512,"resto":0,"id":"VEzSYSLu","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-someone-defend-this","country_name":"United States","replies":151,"images":18,"omitted_posts":146,"omitted_images":18,"tail_size":50},{"no":121641263,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:00:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121635847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121635847<\/a><br>Small donations from supporters don&#039;t matter.

The Soviet system failed, as did the Roman Empire, and every Chinese or Ottoman dynasty. Some of these examples of government lasted thousands of years, while some didn&#039;t last more than a generation. All forms of government inevitably fail. This has been true since ancient times.

This is the cycle of history.<br> <br>Fascism is not a failed system, it was a defeated system: A.) it was not an economic system, but a social one; B.) the so-called &quot;failed system&quot; had a control group: the US. Germany, Italy, and the US were operating under Keynesean policies; only one of them won the war, and experienced a massive period of growth once their industrial rivals were destroyed. So no, it wasn&#039;t a failed system, because both sides were using it, including the side that won.<br> <br>https:\/\/mises.org\/library\/three-new<wbr>-deals-why-nazis-and-fascists-loved<wbr>-fdr","filename":"1569","ext":".png","w":1319,"h":1592,"tn_w":103,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492869435833,"time":1492869435,"md5":"KsT2JmjiSyjK98XgbJmeQg==","fsize":2493649,"resto":122278456,"id":"\/ekSui5f","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122279396,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:01:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bampen","filename":"SS Wojack","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":250,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492869670271,"time":1492869670,"md5":"e9GXdvFQq9nADHWj7N8e\/g==","fsize":8180,"resto":122278456,"id":"fgZDzvBV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122280046,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:07:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Thoughts on The Greatest Story Never Told?","time":1492870069,"resto":122278456,"id":"GElSbzfW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122281346,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:21:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122278456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122278456<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;HAIL VICTORY<\/span><br>Hope you all had a good 420","filename":"IMG_2701","ext":".jpg","w":1058,"h":1704,"tn_w":77,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492870877974,"time":1492870877,"md5":"RZrYwMF0HlmT8Kbh58eQtw==","fsize":283864,"resto":122278456,"id":"SZQfFHTb","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122279188,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)09:59:02","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Le Pen for Le Win","com":"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/201<wbr>7\/04\/22\/dispatch-marine-le-pen-ride<wbr>s-high-frances-bellwether-town-alwa<wbr>ys\/","filename":"Screenshot_2017-04-22-14-57-13","ext":".png","w":1080,"h":1920,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492869542857,"time":1492869542,"md5":"0Esfzbs5UfOthbH97gMnVw==","fsize":1008366,"resto":0,"id":"8CE3DCSd","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"le-pen-for-le-win","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":122281316,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:20:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122279188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122279188<\/a><br>I really hope she wins","time":1492870857,"resto":122279188,"id":"DXv5sMIi","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122281312,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:20:56","name":"Anonymous","sub":"ITT We&#039;re going to war with Best Korea","com":"The best way to fuck up logistics is to eliminate the enemy fuel supply which China is restricting to the North as well as (ellegedly) massing troops at the border.

If not, I&#039;ll declare my victory and move on. <br><br>1. Why are the same people who cheered on the FBI when they investigated Hillary (and found nothing, btw) now condemning them for investigating connections between Trump and Russia?<br>2. Why were you so critical of President Obama with his spending when Trump spends way more than his predecessor on travelling?<br>3. What&#039;s a good, honest reason why Trump has not released his tax returns? In fact he is the only President in modern US history to not release them. <br>4.

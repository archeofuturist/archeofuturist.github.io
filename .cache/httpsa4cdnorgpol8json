They are all totalitarians, and they will ditch democracy and human rights once it does its job of handing them the reins of power.

Erdogan is not authoritarian, the MB is and he&#039;s just its member.<br><br>I assert that most &quot;Islamic&quot; political and social organizations in the west, or worldwide, are MB entities, the same organizations that Erdogan is probably addressing here, and that most &quot;Islamic&quot; activists are MBians.

I understood that I was influenced by Christian culture but only when I was around 25 I started to realize how it&#039;s more than just some subtle influence on my intuition. The entire way modern people look at the world is framed by the worldview laid out by the early Christians and they weren&#039;t talking about any fairy skydaddies. They were people smart enough for their influence and will to still live on today. God really exists and Christ really is His only son. Being honest with myself I found the biggest motivation I had for wanting to dismiss Christianity was so I could avoid the responsibility that true meaning brings.<br><br>I started using 4chins as a sounding board for these ideas around that time ~2005-06 on \/b\/.

girl.<br>Off to work, because everyone has a job and the salary is better since the demand is higher.<br>You pass by the mailbox, and there is no vandalism, your neighbor waves at you.<br>You leave your car in the driveway and take the bus and it&#039;s not packed, you have plenty of space.<br>You didn&#039;t have to pay a fare because public transportation is free.<br>The roads are in perfect condition because nobody is eating your taxes with welfare checks.<br>Out the window, you don&#039;t see any homeless, because they were able to find a job and house since rents are significantly cheaper.<br>Therapy centers are going bankrupt because there are almost no drug dealers left, and jails are practically empty.<br>You get to work and don&#039;t have to worry about some idiot shooting up the place.<br>That&#039;s because the quality of life has increased and people are generally happy, also there are no terrorists.<br>You finish your 6 hour shift, because laws have been passed to

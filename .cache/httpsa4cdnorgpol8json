Started out on high frequency intraday trading. The yields were meh at best, did not lose much money but did not made much either. But the psychological part, the stress and the levels of risk were over the top. Even with the iron self-control, you would slip from time to time, either closing or entering too early, sometimes dragging SL a bit further and so on. Anyone, who tells you to start doing this is a con artist. It&#039;s the surest and fastest way to lose money. <br><br>Over the time slowly moved to Low-Frequency High-Yield trading. I trade patterns in a larger time frames, we are talking about 7-20+ days. Using smaller lots means better money management and since you are already in for the long term prospect, you will not get fucked up by short term volatility spikes.<br><br>Results So Far:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sanity<\/span><br>I can&#039;t stress enough how much better it is for your mental health<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Time Consumption<\/span><br>Intraday trading is a full time 8-10 hour job. And it&#039;s very taxing. Low-Fq trading is 1-2 hours a day at best just to scan the development and manage your positions or limit orders.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Profits<\/span><br>Skyrocketed<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Loses, minimized <\/span><br>Also, opposite trades are better than stops. I noticed that I had a really good knack for identifying patterns it&#039;s just that 80% of a time it was always ahead of a time. Basically, I knew there was a trade emerging or reversing, I went in, got kicked out on stop loss only for it to move in &quot;predicted&quot; direction eventually. I decided to strengthen my trading around that, rather than trying to &quot;predict better&quot; since it&#039;s impossible to do anyway.","time":1491213220,"resto":119293309,"id":"IhO7onn\/","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119300220,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)02:33:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Incest is illegal because...?","filename":"tara","ext":".jpg","w":1873,"h":1073,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":143,"tim":1491201202788,"time":1491201202,"md5":"DNJodYRUtqFdm6o24UjFRw==","fsize":204419,"resto":0,"id":"LRkrI0oA","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"incest-is-illegal-because","country_name":"United States","replies":78,"images":21,"omitted_posts":73,"omitted_images":20},{"no":119309858,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)05:12:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119308852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119308852<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But what if your family line has no potential for crippling defects?<\/span><br>Have fun trying to raise a family of mutants in the mean time.","filename":"10235781.0","ext":".jpg","w":1198,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491210761149,"time":1491210761,"md5":"WPm7wKtj3Wk8HVO0TxH7Nw==","fsize":258089,"resto":119300220,"id":"Av6Y+jgL","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119310217,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)05:18:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119300220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119300220<\/a><br>If it only affected themselves it would just be a tragedy, but it harms and burdens the community.","time":1491211129,"resto":119300220,"id":"FIIMDGlb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119310464,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)05:22:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119300220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119300220<\/a><br><br>Stop fucking your kids either kys or get mental help","filename":"GRRRRR","ext":".png","w":604,"h":388,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1491211365868,"time":1491211365,"md5":"6sOzQ1qlUl5jB8yKZNX\/mg==","fsize":258353,"resto":119300220,"id":"oVYgpUSx","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119310711,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)05:26:50","name":"Breeki_bro","com":"<a href=\"#p119309507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119309507<\/a><br>It will be very unhappy, and it will in turn make you very unhappy. <br><br>German shepherds are about as intelligent as a 12 year old child and about the same size. <br><br>Expect destroyed furniture, holes in walls, torn up carpet etc etc. <br><br>You gotta have a good sized yard and even then be able to dedicate a couple hours a day to walking, playing, giving attention etc etc. <br><br>When big dogs are like teenagers, if they dont get proper care they become agressive and violent and begin vandalizing your property.","time":1491211610,"resto":119300220,"id":"eIY7HgGl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119311168,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)05:34:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119310711\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119310711<\/a><br>fuck this shit.<br>thanks.","time":1491212089,"resto":119300220,"id":"+9Jper+U","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119295959,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:35:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"To prove \/pol\/ will blame Jews for everything, here&#039;s a picture of the Titanic hitting the iceberg, an event that involves Jews in no particular way.","filename":"Giant ship","ext":".jpg","w":622,"h":499,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1491197750926,"time":1491197750,"md5":"VGLaAiSd8hkWBTo2zAAzQg==","fsize":50159,"resto":0,"id":"tHalth81","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"to-prove-pol-will-blame-jews-for-everything-heres","country_name":"United States","replies":104,"images":32,"omitted_posts":99,"omitted_images":31,"tail_size":50},{"no":119306771,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)04:20:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119304714\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119304714<\/a><br>Interesting.

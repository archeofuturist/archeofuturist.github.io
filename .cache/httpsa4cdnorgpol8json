Brain washing and propaganda has always existed but until recently a counter intelligence to state sanctioned propaganda hasn&#039;t been fully implemented. There is a culture industry, and it&#039;s called by it&#039;s inventors the culture industry. The Soviet Union had a department called the culture industry. Their own actors and directors were called the culture leaders. Because people are like computers, all you have to do is keep giving them new updates every so often and you can change an entire country or a nation or a block of nations. They&#039;re all getting the same uploads or upgrades at the same time along certain paths. Today we call it political correctness. Most people want to belong to their peer group, they want to be the same as everyone else when it comes to opinions. In fact they judge their own personal sanity by bouncing ideas off their neighbors and friends who&#039;ll answer back and agree on these same topics in kind. It doesn&#039;t matter if the topics or what you&#039;re given are facts or utter nonsense as long as everyone agrees at the same time you&#039;ll say &quot;well I&#039;m sane&quot; and your friends will all agree because they&#039;ve had the same information given to them. If it&#039;s on TV and a famous face says something, then it must be true. He doesn&#039;t have to show you facts or anything else. You&#039;ve been brought up with these faces, that&#039;s why they keep these people on TV into their 70&#039;s-80&#039;s. You&#039;ve grown up with these parental figures who&#039;re on TV every night in your house, in your room, staring right at you &amp; they&#039;re a parental figure, would they tell you a lie? That&#039;s so you naturally never suspect them and this person will introduce new topics, introduce experts on the topics, they&#039;ll have the little summary at the end of the talk and you are now left with the conclusion that&#039;s presented to you.

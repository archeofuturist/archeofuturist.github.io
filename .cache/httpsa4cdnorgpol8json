Is there still any credible turf on which they could still developp even if we defeat them in Syria and Iraq? <br><br>Last time I really focused on the question was three years ago. <br>Back then, ISIS relied mostly on controlling big cities and strategic roads and checkpoints, but they didn&#039;t have the men to completely secure their territory. They were also still reliant on hit and run tactics with many bomb attacks and heavy casualties with last-ditch suicide attacks in defense of cities like Palmyra. <br>However, they had growing support, both financial and in terms of troops, from Western Europe and the Arab Peninsula. How are their numbers and how are they evolving? <br><br>Back then, I had predicted that they wouldn&#039;t last for more than a decade, probably 5 or 7 years.

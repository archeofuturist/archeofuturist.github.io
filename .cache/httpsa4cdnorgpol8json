Turkey may hold referendum whether to continue the accession process.<br><br>In his speech, Erdo\u011fan once again condemned the terror attack near the Houses of Parliament in London killing four people and injuring some 40 others. &quot;This attack is the latest example of terror having no boundaries, no principles, no morals. It is very noteworthy that the parliament was targeted and it has similarites with the July 15 coup attempt, in which our parliament was bombed.&quot; bizim 15 Temmuz darbe giri\u015fimiyle de benzer yan\u0131 vard\u0131r.

Most religious texts can be debunked in a number of ways. However, thus far, all we&#039;ve done is offer an &quot;origin story&quot; that&#039;s closer to reality.<br><br>But origin stories aren&#039;t the sole purpose of the Church, or really, even the main one.<br><br>The Church, in any form its taken in human society, has served to regulate culture and behavior in ways that Government can&#039;t. Take something like the views on premarital sex in Abrahamic religions. <br><br>Objectively, &quot;No sex until marriage&quot; is the most optimal way for a society to treat sexuality. Previous partner count is predictive of likelihood to cheat and divorce. Those things undermine the family unit, tank birthrates and lead to increases in single motherhood. All of those consequences are extraordinarily dangerous for ANY society.<br><br>The reason I left the church, aside from it not making much sense, was the fact that it couldn&#039;t enforce its own doctrines any more; however, I&#039;m beginning to come to the realization that most people aren&#039;t perfectly rational capable of looking at data and adjusting their behavior.<br><br>Is there any way for Atheism to have a cultural &amp; behavioral regulatory agency outside of the State itself? How do you propose to go about it? Are we just doomed to deal with the poor choices of people who wanted to tear down morality and replace it with nothing but nihilistic hedonism?<br><br>Additionally, with the dismal state of Atheism (Atheism+ etc.) are we better off just going back into the closet and trying to join hardline churches?","filename":"FedoraSymbol","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":1000,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490472309079,"time":1490472309,"md5":"t5hsstNyt4sgdrIhhTWXQA==","fsize":209833,"resto":0,"id":"okj50nq+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-to-the-other-atheists-on-this-board-i-have-a","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118260483,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:24:12","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/ptg\/ PRESIDENT TRUMP GENERAL - TO THE VICTOR GO THE SPOILS EDITION","com":"PRESIDENT DONALD J TRUMP<br>https:\/\/www.whitehouse.gov<br>https:\/\/www.donaldjtrump.com\/<br>DAILY SCHEDULE (WH Press Corps)<br>https:\/\/publicpool.kinja.com\/<br>Trump Playlist<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/X9qQJVKJ<br> <br>APPEARANCES<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump Weekly Address #9 3\/24\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZGt6lkLApuo<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump meets Medal of Honor Recipients 3\/24\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/LWhzEfdjeHg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump statement on Healthcare Law 3\/24\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/7F2pGAhaiSI<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump hosts Greek Independence Day party 3\/24\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/nHC0lNmTfrM<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump meets Charter CEO w\/Gov Abbott 3\/24\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/RNSbOnqAXrw<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump meets Natl Econ council 3\/24\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/ildvB672GDA<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump meets with Truckers 3\/23\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/o9pT5vs6sGY<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pres Trump roundtable w\/truckers 3\/23\/17<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/4VSpfqjxvW0<br>PREV APPEARANCES<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/ynXV6CHT<br>NEWTRUMP NIGHTLY NEWS<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/yArfUKdC<br>WH PRESS BRIEFINGS<br>http:\/\/pastebin.com\/QidpHWKJ<br> <br>FUN STUFF<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TrumpWave S P A C E<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/s1qhafzPkAM<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Story behind MAGA hats<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/Aoro6PA9S6g<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;God Emperor Trump Was Born To Rule<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/pf4RSgb_Pqg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Donald Trump Emperor of America<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/xQCaWLF2gfs<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TrumpBot vs Mexico<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/jNmTBESoJ1A<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shadilay<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZNriNoWOtXA<br> <br>INSPIRATION<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/Nyuv_bPSHBA<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hold Back The Night<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/ldnH5ms50Jc<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Inauguration of Fire<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/XKf8jSiaghU<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;#TrumpTheEstablishement<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/kIsctZlgMqg<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;American Hero<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/d-X3BVxySLo<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TRUMP - MAGA<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/PagVeZgHbhk<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump Triumphant<\/span><br>www.dailymotion.com\/video\/x4ulway<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We Are The Silent Majority<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/3lrrPG5iPAk<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;American Comeback Story<\/span><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/pm8n9qVIK_8<br> <br>OP pastebin: http:\/\/pastebin.com\/nygxu29R<br>prev <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118254447#p118254447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118254447<\/a>","filename":"1490413668069","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":1123,"tn_w":170,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490469852936,"time":1490469852,"md5":"vuSzANnXEjt04+5eu9UVtQ==","fsize":374400,"resto":0,"id":"uxjDsBUu","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ptg-president-trump-general-to-the-victor-go-the","country_name":"United States","replies":315,"images":107,"omitted_posts":310,"omitted_images":104,"tail_size":50},{"no":118265770,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)16:10:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118264289\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118264289<\/a><br>Maybe so -- how many major policy defeats will he suffer before he gets there?

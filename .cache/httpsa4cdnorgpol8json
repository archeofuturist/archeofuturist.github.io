They are recognized as a third gender: Muxe nguiiu tend to be masculine in their appearance and behavior, while muxe gunaa are feminine. In Western cultures, they would be considered gay men and transgender women, respectively.<br><br>The current study included 141 heterosexual women, 135 heterosexual men, and 178 muxes (61 muxe nguiiu and 117 muxe gunaa). Study participants were interviewed using a questionnaire that asked about separation anxiety; more specifically, distress and worry they experienced as a child in relation to being separated from a parental figure. Participants rated how true each question was for them when they were between the ages of 6 to 12 years old.<br><br>Muxes showed elevated rates of childhood separation anxiety when compared with heterosexual men, similar to what has been seen in gay men in Canada and fa\u2019afafine in Samoa. There were also no differences in anxiety scores between women and muxe nguiiu or muxe gunaa, or between the two types of muxes.<br><br>When we consider possible explanations for these results, social mechanisms are unlikely, as previous research has shown that anxiety is heritable and parenting tends to be in response to children\u2019s traits and behaviors, as opposed to the other way around. Biological mechanisms, however, offer a more compelling account. For instance, exposure to female-typical levels of sex steroid hormones in the prenatal environment are thought to \u201cfeminize\u201d regions of the male brain that are related to sexual orientation, thereby influencing attachment and anxiety.","filename":"BixaMuda","ext":".jpg","w":570,"h":330,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":144,"tim":1493515684168,"time":1493515684,"md5":"yrDkcwHWeZ8bs+xKyvygWw==","fsize":34472,"resto":0,"id":"tww1JgE0","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"being-gay-is-genetic","country_name":"United States","replies":20,"images":5,"omitted_posts":15,"omitted_images":4},{"no":123421752,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)22:19:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123420915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123420915<\/a><br>\/thread","time":1493518791,"resto":123415992,"id":"Y5UXYd4V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123423273,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)22:33:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123415992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123415992<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Biologically male<\/span><br>Bill Nye would like to have a word with you.","filename":"bill-nye-science-and-abortion","ext":".jpg","w":920,"h":537,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":72,"tim":1493519628037,"time":1493519628,"md5":"RD9Hepx5N5Z2kgpa3lLSKw==","fsize":30995,"resto":123415992,"id":"OuFEGqO9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123424453,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)22:44:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123415992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123415992<\/a><br><br>If being gay is genetic then they should be bred out of existence.

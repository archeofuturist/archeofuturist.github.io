This is what I took out of it.<br><br>1) Don&#039;t give a fuck what people think of you unless their opinion of you has a direct correlation on your success. <br>*This isn&#039;t how Roark operated, he wouldn&#039;t care how it affected success. But I look at it more as using those people to advance myself further to a point where I don&#039;t need their support anymore*<br><br>2) Think for yourself and don&#039;t join &quot;a side&quot; just to pick a side. You can have your own opinions and don&#039;t have to match up with a conservative or liberal platform completely.<br><br>3) Don&#039;t read and accept, read and think. This applies to these books as well. I&#039;m not dumb enough to believe that objectivism and a lassez-faire capitalistic state would work. But too often people will read something and just regurgitate it as their own beliefs before they even stop to think about it for a second.<br><br>4) Non-conformists are just as bad, if not worst than conformists. Because they are just as equally affected by society and also happen to be annoying little pity seeking fucks.<br><br>5) Being selfish isn&#039;t a bad thing. Everyone just makes it seem like a bad thing and guilt trips you. Once you get past the idea that being selfish is bad then you&#039;ll be a lot happier and probably more successful. <br><br>6) Fuck communism, socialism, normies, and fuckers who dye their hair rainbow colors. <br><br>I would encourage anyone to read Anthem for a quick read or The Fountainhead if you have the time. I&#039;ve heard Atlas Shrugged is a bit ranty, so I&#039;d avoid that one unless you really enjoy The Fountainhead.","filename":"roark","ext":".jpg","w":380,"h":499,"tn_w":95,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493393467801,"time":1493393467,"md5":"gQbmRWDqd+8RfRCKCtfBHQ==","fsize":69287,"resto":123198643,"id":"UyP6fm0d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123206323,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)11:32:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;reading female &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;Philosophers&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;<\/span>","filename":"1493022643462","ext":".jpg","w":1462,"h":1462,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493393567082,"time":1493393567,"md5":"NVjf5tmhzw5\/kuyTC3On\/Q==","fsize":193616,"resto":123198643,"id":"Df0vao3e","country":"EC","m_img":1,"country_name":"Ecuador"},{"no":123206439,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)11:34:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123206149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123206149<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The person part is easy to explain, she didn&#039;t go about her life as she often preached.<\/span><br><br>Who does?

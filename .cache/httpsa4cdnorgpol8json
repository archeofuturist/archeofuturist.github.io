When it comes to talking with him about things, there are still some things I&#039;m not comfortable or used to talking about (but I can pinpoint those to being either a topic that I don&#039;t like thinking about in general or something where past experiences before I met him made me used to not wanting to talk about it with anyone (eg tv shows that previous friends didn&#039;t like, so I just naturally don&#039;t talk about things I watch anymore))<br>Back like 4-5 years ago I had a (different) close friend who I was too clingy with, but we had bad communication and I never realized it at the time. He got a gf and school ended, at which point he essentially cut contact with me (and everyone else from school). For at least the year after that it was kind of a withdrawal period, I was still thinking about him a lot and didn&#039;t care about making any new friends at uni. I&#039;ve got a close friend again now and I&#039;m consciously aware of not being too clingy (ie not trying to message him every day or be a part of everything in his life) Not entirely sure how relevant that is but I feel like that ordeal defined me a bit regarding how much value I put on requiring other people.

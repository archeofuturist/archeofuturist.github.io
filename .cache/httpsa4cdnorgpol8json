Jones said Trump\u2019s sons are \u2018total patriots\u2019 and have been leaking information to Mike Cernovich and others.<br><br>\u201cTrump is for real, but he is being pulled by every side. There is an attempt to have a soft coup against the President,\u2019 said Jones.<br><br>Pieczenik weighed in, \u2018I\u2019ve repeatedly said that Jared has to leave. There\u2019s no question he\u2019s involved in corruption with the Chinese, [\u2026] the Israeli family, the Steinmetz, who were already indicted for diamond smuggling,\u2019 further illuminating the point that AG Sessions was \u2018fully aware\u2019 that the Kushner\u2019s were corrupt.<br><br>Dr. Pie fired a shot across the President\u2019s bow, saying \u2018we have the neocons coming back. I am warning the administration, again and again, I did not take the time and the effort and the liberty and the risk that others weren\u2019t willing to do to bring back pathetic neocons like Elliot Abrams or John Bolton or anyone of those morons that you put in there. If Mcmaster doesn\u2019t understand how he came to power, he came to power because Tom Clancy and I gave him money. He came to power because he sat on the boards of other companies.\u2019<br><br>He warned against any preemptive strike against N. Korea as being both \u2018idiotic and inept.\u2019 He described intervention in Syria as being foolhardy, saying \u2018putting in artillery and howitzers into Syria when you have no idea who the Al-Waleed\u2019s are. You have no idea how many Christians the Bashar family are protecting, millions of them. And you\u2019re gonna do a regime change because you have some moron named Pompeo, who\u2019s head of the CIA because he was #1 at West Point, but had never been in intelligence?

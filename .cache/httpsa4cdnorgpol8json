It all started back in 2011, freshman year. I found a jailbreak repo that allowed me to get anything and everything from Amazon for free. Once I received my items, I went back to amazon and sold them as a third party vendor. This lasted for about 8 months until a patch was developed. At that time, I had about $25,000. I had to do more. This is when I learned about the deep web and Silk Road. I found an Amazon employee on the deep web with verified credentials whom allowed me access to his 50% off discount for a small fee. I used this to kick-start my earnings for a while later. Scamming amazon eventually got me into the market of selling hacked Paypal accounts via bitcoins as well as skimmed credit cards and very, very, small amounts of counterfeit currencies. By Q2, 2014, I met you. I stopped everything and devoted everything I could to you while staying under the radar besides selling a few fake IDs. I decided to change every aspect of my life to better myself and just sit on investments, cashing out small percentages at high points in the market and then reinvesting. I recently got back into the market and found a guy on the deep web who has doubled my earnings. By August 9, 2016, FDA regulations on vaping devices are going to and all manufacturers to sell their products on the deep web, which, in return, will triple my bitcoin exchange. You sending me this text has allowed me to clone your SIM. If you tell anyone, I will know. I have extracted your IP and MAC address from the friend request you have sent me on Facebook. I have also documented your MAC address and IP from a Skype conversation you had with a certain somebody not to long ago.","time":1493210845,"resto":122867167,"id":"nyxQ\/\/Wq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122862654,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)04:41:27","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Serpent church","com":"How is this not painfully fuckin obvious?

This general is for the discussion of Marxism-Leninism, the ideology of revolutionary socialism and communism.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493204503199,"time":1493204503,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"NtyPHsEu","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":17,"images":9,"omitted_posts":12,"omitted_images":6},{"no":122877954,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)08:20:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6j_<wbr>pTlFK1QA","time":1493209216,"resto":122871732,"id":"NtyPHsEu","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122878558,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)08:28:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ubf<wbr>T-aq6gMM","filename":"079e73f431a8424e782175df9f57d2eee450b22802a93111b92a51af589b85fe","ext":".jpg","w":653,"h":1200,"tn_w":68,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493209680209,"time":1493209680,"md5":"vj82qQJGpuShxJLm+U6Cng==","fsize":101210,"resto":122871732,"id":"NtyPHsEu","country":"ES","m_img":1,"country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122878795,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)08:30:49","name":"Anonymous","filename":"39a59c037250780acfba8085213f489b50a43564[1]","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493209849201,"time":1493209849,"md5":"TjdoQ8Hd035xgqFnETj2dg==","fsize":66292,"resto":122871732,"id":"RJ+Xxpcj","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122878929,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)08:32:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122878795\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122878795<\/a>","filename":"208eac21b1dc65465b11746c4501b739b245953591e134fb0dc99513d5749916","ext":".png","w":1024,"h":601,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":73,"tim":1493209967570,"time":1493209967,"md5":"f85RFDXQ3jNIyTbBalBqWQ==","fsize":592534,"resto":122871732,"id":"NtyPHsEu","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122879996,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)08:46:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"fuck communism!","time":1493210785,"resto":122871732,"id":"a\/HdtsKi","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122868195,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)06:14:30","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Prejudice","com":"Top 3 people you hate and love the most.

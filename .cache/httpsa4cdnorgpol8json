First, pain is not a feeling like grief, it is a physical reaction not an emotional one. Second, depending on the severity of the pain, the benefits can far outweigh the side effects, some of which like addiction, are unlikely to occur if used as directed for less than 6 months. Personally, the few times I&#039;ve been prescribed narcotics, the only drawback I had was a bit of wooziness and mild constipation. Thirdly, unlike leeches and lobotomies, narcotics work as intended. But you are right in doctors moving away from narcotics, not wholesale, but scaling back on their prescribing, but this is a result of a small but growing segment of drug abusers misusing and abusing them, not because they don&#039;t work.","time":1490856200,"resto":118854977,"id":"HGl4xOQn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

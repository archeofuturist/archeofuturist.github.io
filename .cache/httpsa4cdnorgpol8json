But isn&#039;t the second round a bit different? In the first round, because there&#039;s so many candidates, everyone will pretty much have the option to find a candidate that is exactly as they desire. But the second round is reduced to two politicians, one of whom is seen as the epitome of establishment (Macron) which is problematic in this situation, and the other of which (Le Pen) is seen as &#039;taboo&#039; to support. As I understand it, unlike the first round, a large portion of France is still &#039;undecided.&#039; So even if the polls right now show Macron winning by 20, I think it&#039;s not unrealistic to contemplate the possibility that Macron will not in fact win by that much on election day. Maybe Macron will still win, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s outside the realm of possibility for Le Pen to get in the lower to mid 40&#039;s. Even if she loses, getting that much of the vote would be significant because she would no longer be seen as a &quot;fringe&quot; candidate by the time the next elections roll around.","time":1493805655,"resto":123893870,"id":"OKJpT+Yt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123896838,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:02:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"When&#039;s the big debate?<br><br>I want him to keep his promise and pull out like a coward after half an hour.","time":1493805777,"resto":123893870,"id":"fs3nxykr","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123897327,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:11:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123894210\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123894210<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Whatever you say you fucking normie.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;normie<\/span><br><br>enormous fag detected","time":1493806265,"resto":123893870,"id":"0gXfj3Wl","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":123899198,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:39:29","name":"Anonymous","filename":"macron_puppet01","ext":".jpg","w":1320,"h":1864,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493807969669,"time":1493807969,"md5":"s\/eT8Lg2p+HIuNa4KaGbPQ==","fsize":392380,"resto":123893870,"id":"t1qfAA\/f","country":"SE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123899489,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:43:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123896838\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123896838<\/a><br>This evening<br>This debate decides the entire election","time":1493808222,"resto":123893870,"id":"LPMDkxub","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123878048,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:41:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nigger hate thread for the normies.","filename":"1484718427068m","ext":".jpg","w":230,"h":1024,"tn_w":56,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493790111491,"time":1493790111,"md5":"KLQ3bN0aH+y6nQxz+WeWUQ==","fsize":71893,"resto":0,"id":"0DFTuwDT","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nigger-hate-thread-for-the-normies","country_name":"United States","replies":70,"images":42,"omitted_posts":65,"omitted_images":38},{"no":123897482,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:13:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123879651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123879651<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123880741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123880741<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123880780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123880780<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123880809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123880809<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123880830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123880830<\/a><br>Hue always drops the best redpills","time":1493806423,"resto":123878048,"id":"91LjKSxk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123897515,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:14:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123884541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123884541<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123885872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123885872<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123886409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123886409<\/a><br>degenerate homosex off my board now","time":1493806458,"resto":123878048,"id":"G1yQ76OH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123897817,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:19:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123878701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123878701<\/a><br>go ahead and try to sue","filename":"1493739472967","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493806752872,"time":1493806752,"md5":"Ox5Ld4NuDYC2t4OPV59uSQ==","fsize":30929,"resto":123878048,"id":"H03ivUYu","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":123899212,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:39:41","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1493697882477","ext":".png","w":663,"h":995,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493807981741,"time":1493807981,"md5":"XEtD2J1uwmsgKs3IyYu0cg==","fsize":327366,"resto":123878048,"id":"mI4tAWbF","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123899488,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:43:41","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1490924288391","ext":".png","w":500,"h":522,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493808221787,"time":1493808221,"md5":"nl+SQ8shBzAjBFKG\/7rO7g==","fsize":97916,"resto":123878048,"id":"mI4tAWbF","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}]}

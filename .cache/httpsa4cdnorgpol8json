The entertainment apparatus is integral to maintaining order in the US.<br><br>When people are distracted they don&#039;t ask questions. They inadvertently become completely subservient to their higher forces. With the onset of the internet and mass media the political theater of today has been allowed shifted towards a more entertainment geared approach. This is easily seen in the Trump vs. Hillary campaign, in which both candidates were more focused upon creating entertainment for their voters than establishing any concrete political identity. In twenty years presidential candidates will all be celebrities: actors, musicians, models, etc. The general public will welcome this change because of the entertainment value they&#039;re campaigns will hold. <br><br>Politicians are able to control people through these distractions - the unconscious goal of which is a subservient populace which is willing to elect easily manipulated figureheads in roles of power. This is the end state of any democracy, and is quickly followed by its inevitable collapse when its intelligentsia is eventually snuffed out altogether and the decadence which supports the political machine consumes itself. A lot of us will witness that in our lifetimes.","filename":"42490d319731b2d993cf414b30e426bc4ab5fcb150a7bec86cf4118d84df3cec","ext":".jpg","w":5344,"h":3776,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1493006811545,"time":1493006811,"md5":"nWv3yEbJZ+j7SCP5n6zZUw==","fsize":3070148,"resto":122538095,"id":"k+kYNGd1","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122519612,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)21:06:51","name":"Anonymous","sub":"ILLUMINATI BLOOD PYRAMID","com":"On April 19, 2017, at 3:05 a.m. EDT, five days after he was found not guilty of the 2012 Boston double homicide, correction officers found Hernandez hanging by his bedsheets from his window in his cell at the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Lancaster, Massachusetts. He was transported to UMass Memorial Hospital-Leominster, where he was pronounced dead at 4:07 a.m.[10][92][93][11] State Department of Correction spokesman Christopher Fallon first said no suicide note was found in Hernandez&#039;s single-occupant cell, but on April 20, 2017, investigators reported that three handwritten notes were next to a Bible opened to John 3:16 and &quot;John 3:16&quot; was written on his forehead in ink.[94] One note said he was entering the &quot;timeless realm&quot; and would see his family in heaven while another note said he loved his family and told them not to shed a tear; soap was found covering the floor and there were drawings in blood on the walls showing an unfinished pyramid and the all-seeing eye of God with the word &quot;Illuminati&quot; written in capital letters underneath.[95] Prison officials had not observed any signs that Hernandez was at risk for suicide, so he was not put on around-the-clock watch.[96] Upon completion of the autopsy by the medical examiner, the death has been officially ruled a suicide. Hernandez&#039;s brain was released to Boston University to be studied for signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive degenerative disease found in people who have had a severe blow or repeated blows to the head.[97] His lawyer-agent, Jose Baez, disputed any claim of suicide, initiating his own investigation of the death.[98]","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":667,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492996011008,"time":1492996011,"md5":"o7QH+rlsjEf0vDHYY\/vx3A==","fsize":76946,"resto":0,"id":"nIv4nKJw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"illuminati-blood-pyramid","country_name":"United States","replies":39,"images":10,"omitted_posts":34,"omitted_images":8},{"no":122537072,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)23:38:40","name":"Shiro Poster","com":"<a href=\"#p122520320\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122520320<\/a>","filename":"1492289571798","ext":".png","w":808,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1493005120403,"time":1493005120,"md5":"impaI+tFOgF6MHLVzxZSUA==","fsize":367818,"resto":122519612,"id":"xf+gubO9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122538268,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)23:49:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Blumpkin&#039;","time":1493005764,"resto":122519612,"id":"RZoccp8T","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122538885,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)23:54:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/isgp-studies.com\/belgian-x-<wbr>dossiers-of-the-dutroux-affair<br><a href=\"#p122519612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122519612<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;April 19<\/span><br>traditional day for a spring blood sacrifice<br>-waco<br>-oklahoma city","filename":"finderz","ext":".jpg","w":1276,"h":3412,"tn_w":46,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493006091286,"time":1493006091,"md5":"E1T9RXkgS5CjeGbfl\/GJ8A==","fsize":2021946,"resto":122519612,"id":"VgdUF4Yt","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122539161,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)23:57:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122520320\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122520320<\/a><br><br>The last time someone posted this video the thread got pruned","time":1493006251,"resto":122519612,"id":"LM36VrXQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122540114,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:06:27","name":"Shiro Poster","com":"<a href=\"#p122539161\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122539161<\/a><br>I&#039;ll keep this thread up as long as possible","filename":"1490485598797","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":805,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1493006787088,"time":1493006787,"md5":"6Ae8ig9j4VZbQw9lTOdGqA==","fsize":86614,"resto":122519612,"id":"T8LRPjiZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122539071,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)23:56:38","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Promises made, Promises Kept","com":"Doing such a fantastic job so far.

This general is for the discussion of Marxism-Leninism, the ideology of revolutionary socialism and communism.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493299080216,"time":1493299080,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"plthfK3M","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":2,"images":2},{"no":123035935,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)09:27:05","name":"Anonymous","filename":"b21cceafc03340642b3526b92b1bd0314c3d2262fe6f120771198c249ac83b35","ext":".jpg","w":1440,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1493299625853,"time":1493299625,"md5":"D\/p7nrOXaSR06UoXx97\/OQ==","fsize":233997,"resto":123035157,"id":"plthfK3M","country":"ES","m_img":1,"country_name":"Spain"},{"no":123036103,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)09:28:40","name":"Anonymous","filename":"info","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1152,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493299720857,"time":1493299720,"md5":"cqMP\/ahCrmZJG7XNSY8hQA==","fsize":576670,"resto":123035157,"id":"plthfK3M","country":"ES","m_img":1,"country_name":"Spain"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123032461,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)08:46:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"if you are against pedophiles you are Age-ist","filename":"file","ext":".png","w":586,"h":630,"tn_w":232,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493297194157,"time":1493297194,"md5":"sDmeDaZnWyDacAgtxrryGg==","fsize":239058,"resto":0,"id":"nugDHu2V","country":"RO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"if-you-are-against-pedophiles-you-are-ageist","country_name":"Romania","replies":4,"images":0},{"no":123032950,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)08:51:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"That&#039;s why he needs to go back in time to when he was a child so he can fuck his mom","time":1493297517,"resto":123032461,"id":"tZD7aUJI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123034593,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)09:11:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123032461\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123032461<\/a><br>&quot;Do as I say, or my SJW cult will label you!&quot;<br><br>Nobody of consequence believes SJW&#039;s anymore.","time":1493298712,"resto":123032461,"id":"EfxHFEBe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123035153,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)09:17:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Wtf is age ist?

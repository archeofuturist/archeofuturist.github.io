You never switch between types. The 4 letters represent your dominant attitude, CONSCIOUS cognitive functions and what you extrovert. Function categories are Perception (iNtuition and Sensation) and Judging (Thinking and Feeling). Each of these is either extroverted or introverted, but work in pairs. For each extraverted trait you have an introverted one. Using my keklord Rh- ENTP self as an example:<br>NT - iNtuition and Thinking dominate my personality<br>E - my dominant trait is whichever one (N or T) is extroverted<br>P - I extrovert my Perception function N. <br>N is my DOMINANT trait, noted as Ne. I must introvert my AUXILIARY trait, noted as Ti. So the bulk of my personality is described by my Ne - Ti pairing. <br><br>For introverts, don&#039;t be tripped up by P and J - they say what you extrovert, but whichever main trait you introvert is your dominant one. <br><br>When you plebs think you&#039;re changing types you&#039;re exercising your TERTIARY trait - the polar opposite of your auxiliary trait, Ne - Fe for me in my case. Properly using your tertiary trait takes discipline, like working a muscle, since it&#039;s the same attitude as your dominant trait. Your last conscious trait is your INFERIOR one. It&#039;s the polar opposite of your dominant trait, Si for me. Unless you&#039;re retarded, you can&#039;t exert your dominant and inferior traits at the same time. You have little control over your inferior trait, it&#039;s like having a 3 year old take over your body. It comes out when you&#039;re VERY stressed. So next time you&#039;re panicking hard, think of it. Si - Ti usually shows when I panic. When any type reverts to their Inferior trait they are &#039;in the grip&#039; - different symptoms per type, anxiety for ENTP. Getting stuck using your tertiary more than your auxiliary is called being in a dom-tert loop - looks like mania for ENTP since we&#039;ll be 100% extroverted too long.","filename":"PTypesExplainedForPlebs","ext":".png","w":602,"h":418,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":173,"tim":1493162133453,"time":1493162133,"md5":"2cH0urlAtzZOyKMdTXmDHA==","fsize":153710,"resto":0,"id":"vsfyN0Z9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"personality-redpill","country_name":"United States","replies":50,"images":1,"omitted_posts":45,"omitted_images":1},{"no":122824992,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:57:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122824191\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122824191<\/a><br>Not in high school.

Sounds like you went through something pretty traumatic at a younger age that you tried to cope with. You haven&#039;t fully rebounded, else you wouldn&#039;t do any of the things you said as an INTJ or INTP. However, an INTJ &#039;in the grip&#039; would. When you slip into the grip, you are going from Ni dominant to Se dominant. You&#039;re letting a 3 year old take hold of the wheel and steer you. You are trying to see the eyes through an Se dominant person, who understands the world through actions and the concreteness of things. However, your brain is meant to find meaning so it&#039;s terrible at Se things. I&#039;m rambling about it. <br><br>tldr - you seem INTJ but getting stuck in the grip.

Islam has evolved too rapidly in the last two centuries. that is why we are having terrorism. <br><br>basically after the triumph of the consecutive arab caliphates, the shia expansion in Persian lands and more importantly the otoman empire, the muslim world fell into a stupor caused by its own success. the otomans controled trade which has been the major value of the muslim economies for centuries. islam adapted very rapidly in the economic sense and entered the international political arena with great success. then oil happened. <br>one of the major rivals of the otomans is saudi arabia. they started pushing the otomans out of the south territories. Egypt, jordan, palestine etc. on the other hand they started new battle for the minds of the muslim people. the saudis started implementing the interpretations of a scholar called Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab who claims that the only way for islam to triumph is to go back to it&#039;s roots. to distance itself from the Europeanized form of islam proposed by the turks, which materializes in the secular republic founded by mustafa kemal ataturk. <br><br>so, the Saudis basically have been pushing back the rapid change in islamic countries. they are desperate to keep things under control internally and the best way for them to do it is to show that islam is a viable successful model of civilization. in order to do so they spend huge amounts of oil money in lobby, proselytism and jihad. <br><br>the more terrorism we have the weaker islam is. <br><br>if islam were strong and dominant we wouldn&#039;t have terrorism. we would have sharia. but the globalization (or the american civilization project) is rapidly seducing muslims. islam does&#039;t have a counter offer. <br><br>morgan freidman once said: people vote with their feet. refugees go to europe. not to saudi. to put it in other words: the west is winning and islam is changing so fast that the people in charge of islam are freaking out and need to try violence as a desperate mesure.","time":1493171996,"resto":122818167,"id":"bRhywvkf","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122825688,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:02:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122822368\"

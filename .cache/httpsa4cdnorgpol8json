For what I&#039;ve been teached, &quot;gender&quot; is the word, used specifically for society, to define what a man or a woman should be, right? <br>For example: Men should be strong and look out for the woman while she has his children and stays at home. I think that is bullshit.<br>I have a penis, but not because of that I deserve to be called a sexist piece of shit; Neither should I be expected to be a jock and give some random chick my bus seat.<br>I believe that nobody has to live by a certain type of &quot;Stereotype&quot; (which having a gender automatically gives you) by any means.<br>I have a friend that defines herself as &quot;Pansexual&quot;,which I also say is bullshit, and she says she loves &quot;humanity&quot; (Being all of male, female, transexuals, etc.) THEN WHY CALL HERSELF &quot;Pansexual&quot; AND NOT &quot;Bisexual&quot;?<br><br>I believe that if a woman wants to act like a man, she can! She has the right to, but not because of that, it MAKES HER ONE. I can see my penis and I can see my girlfriend\u00b4s vagina and that makes us man and woman right? So, sexuals preferences DO exist (Heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual and asexual) so if you have a peepee and like vagina, that makes you heterosexual, if you have a penis or a vagina and you like both, that makes you bisexual. So why put yourself in a fucking stereotype by putting yourself in a gender instead of not giving a shit and live in peace?<br>Homosexuality is the sexual preference, and by that, you only get the information about &quot;Him or her liking the same sex&quot; but defining yourself as &quot;Gay or lesbian&quot; tells the people that you, either act extremely girlish and flirtatious (as a man) or being really masculine and aggressive (being a chick). So if you just said &quot;oh, I\u00b4m homosexual&quot; then nobody would give you a stereotype. <br><br>Again, if my friend loves &quot;humanity&quot; (according to my philosophy) that would make her bisexual.","filename":"ITTS","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":168,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491602063940,"time":1491602063,"md5":"Na0TI08lpIopsSnuIEwD+Q==","fsize":10387,"resto":0,"id":"0NjN3vlM","country":"MX","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gender-philosophy","country_name":"Mexico","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":120031399,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)17:55:17","name":"Anon","com":"I don\u00b4t know if I make myself clear, and I am curious to know what you guys think.

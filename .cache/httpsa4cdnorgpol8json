Cheese. Bread with spread (usually butter). This entire board consist of &quot;melts&quot;. Almost every &quot;grilled cheese&quot; sandwich i see on here has other items added to it. The fact that this is called &quot;grilledcheese&quot; is nothing short of utter blasphemy. Let me start out by saying I have nothing against melts, I just hate their association with sandwiches that are not grilled cheeses. Adding cheese to your tuna sandwich? It&#039;s called a Tuna melt. Totally different. Want to add bacon and some pretentious bread crumbs with spinach? I don&#039;t know what the hell you&#039;d call that but it&#039;s not a grilled cheese. I would be more than willing to wager I&#039;ve eaten more grilled cheeses in my 21 years than any of you had in your entire lives. I have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one sandwich. Want to personalize your grilled cheese? Use a mix of different cheeses or use sourdough or french bread. But if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it, make your own subreddit entitled &quot;melts&quot; because that is not a fucking grilled cheese. I&#039;m not a religious man nor am I anything close to a culinary expert. But as a bland white mid-western male I am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac &amp; cheese. All of you foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating your sandwich melts with them. Yet again, it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being. Shit, I stopped lurking after 3 years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this. I&#039;ve seen post after post of peoples &quot;grilled cheeses&quot; all over reddit and it&#039;s been driving me insane. The moment i saw this subreddit this morning I finally snapped. Hell, I may even start my own board just because I know this one exists now.<br>You god damn heretics. Respect the grilled cheese and stop changing it into whatever you like and love it for it what it is.","time":1491250233,"resto":119368888,"id":"+tM5BABl","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119376288,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)16:31:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119373737\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119373737<\/a><br><br>Wow thank you.<br><br><br>Thank you so much.<br><br><br>I hadn&#039;t realized how much of a journey We have ahead of us","filename":"IMG_1476","ext":".gif","w":305,"h":185,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1491251497631,"time":1491251497,"md5":"WL\/aU9Y+sq3NvEQqIKluRg==","fsize":403819,"resto":119368888,"id":"LlHeQG\/e","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119376884,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)16:36:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119376288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119376288<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119368888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119368888<\/a><br>Do I sense the coming of a blessed thread?

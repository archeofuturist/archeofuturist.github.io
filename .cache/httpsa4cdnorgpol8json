This would have all sorts of advantages.<br><br>Men are usually highly motivated by sex\/women. That&#039;s great, but the problem is that they use that motivation on rather useless things, like improving their appearance, hanging around in bars, or spending huge amounts of money on useless luxury stuff to impress girls. Instead they could be spending all that motivation on being more productive and paying more &quot;taxes&quot;. Also a lot of men are really motivated and hard working and focused on improving themselves when they are young. But then they get married and lose all that motivation and just start watching TV all day long or something. The reason obviously being that then you no longer need to work hard to get laid. Some people do this consciously, many more subconsciously. But in this society men would stay motivated to work hard their whole life.<br><br>The long term eugenic implications would also be very useful. The most useful and productive members of the society could afford to have a lot of sex or even hire huge harems and thus their superior genes would spread more. Also the people with greater sex drive would spend more of their money on women. This means men would become more horny over the generations. Which effectively causes them to willingly pay more &quot;taxes&quot;. If you want to push the eugenics further you could implement some sort of medical and psychological tests and people who have useful traits get discounts. This way the state could also control the traits of the next generation based on what kind of people it thinks it&#039;s gonna need next. Wanna focus on science and tech? Smart people get a discount.

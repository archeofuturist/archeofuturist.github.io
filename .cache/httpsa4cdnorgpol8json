Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490142549767","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492248828555,"time":1492248828,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"7f2bPNrr","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":121193316,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:39:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"meanwhile islam is the fastest growing religion on earth, sorry christcucks, your days are numbered","time":1492249190,"resto":121192872,"id":"WlvhMKLS","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121184558,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)03:26:17","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Eyes on NK","com":"What should we looking at for early signs of a happening?<br><br>I am tracking:<br>https:\/\/www.flightradar24.com\/38.28<wbr>,128.61\/7<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Would expect air traffic to be stopped over Japan and South Korea.<\/span><br><br>Live Tv North Korea:<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=q90<wbr>1s3wcNSU <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Maybe some warning on the national TV.<\/span><br><br>Earth quake:<br>https:\/\/earthquake.usgs.gov\/earthqu<wbr>akes\/map\/#%7B%22autoUpdate%22%3A%5B<wbr>%22autoUpdate%22%5D%2C%22basemap%22<wbr>%3A%22grayscale%22%2C%22feed%22%3A%<wbr>221day_m25%22%2C%22listFormat%22%3A<wbr>%22default%22%2C%22mapposition%22%3<wbr>A%5B%5B17.476432197195518%2C-263.01<wbr>26953125%5D%2C%5B49.61070993807422%<wbr>2C-192.7001953125%5D%5D%2C%22overla<wbr>ys%22%3A%5B%22plates%22%5D%2C%22res<wbr>trictListToMap%22%3A%5B%22restrictL<wbr>istToMap%22%5D%2C%22search%22%3Anul<wbr>l%2C%22sort%22%3A%22newest%22%2C%22<wbr>timezone%22%3A%22utc%22%2C%22viewMo<wbr>des%22%3A%5B%22list%22%2C%22map%22%<wbr>5D%2C%22event%22%3Anull%7D<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Incase the test is underground, would probably produce a quake.<\/span><br><br>Can anyone think what else we can track?","filename":"North-Korea-Russias-Putin-sent-Kim-Jong-Un-congratulatory-message","ext":".jpg","w":734,"h":489,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492241177191,"time":1492241177,"md5":"bBjnJg00C1oNTUVryXVVlg==","fsize":39684,"resto":0,"id":"LdVmniPZ","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"eyes-on-nk","country_name":"Australia","replies":14,"images":3,"omitted_posts":9,"omitted_images":2},{"no":121192966,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)05:34:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"The nuclear test will almost certainly happen soon, if not tomorrow since everyone predicted today.

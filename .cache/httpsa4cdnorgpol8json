Whether here in Canada or around the world, racism devalues individuals, divides communities, and breeds fear and animosity throughout society.<br><br>\u201cIn Canada, diversity is a source of strength and a fundamental pillar of our country\u2019s success.

Far too many people around the world continue to be denied their most basic human rights simply because of the colour of their skin or their ethnic background.<br><br>\u201cThe Government of Canada strongly condemns any form of discrimination at home and in our global community. We will continue to promote inclusiveness, acceptance, and equality in Canada and around the globe, and will never stop working for a safer, more equal, and more respectful world. <br><br>\u201cOn this important day, we reaffirm our ongoing responsibility to speak out against racism, hate, xenophobia, and bigotry in all its forms.

You both need a good education and be 100% sure that you both will get a job if you want to move. Be prepared to pay high taxes. Cost of living is high but quality of life is also high. Most people keep to themself so unless you two have hobbies that will allow you to meet new people then you won&#039;t be able to join any social circles (most people dont even talk to their neighbours except saying hello). South part of Sweden is full of refugees so make sure you move far up to the north, just be prepared for the cold. Sweden is cold but not nearly as cold as some of the northern parts of the US because of the gulf stream. Almost everyone knows english so language barriers will never be a problem. Sweden is one of the best countries in the world to start up your own company, as long as you&#039;re not afraid of a lot of paper work. That&#039;s pretty much all you need to know. Also getting a gun is very easy as long as you don&#039;t have any criminal records. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Estim<wbr>ated_number_of_guns_per_capita_by_c<wbr>ountry","time":1490617665,"resto":118497852,"id":"LTOrKh2H","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118507794,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)08:27:32","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Ich liebe das Swastika","filename":"download","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":241,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":241,"tim":1490617652011,"time":1490617652,"md5":"OoWqF8i4rVA6Gag4clxoLA==","fsize":24429,"resto":0,"id":"JOMyq5A5","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ich-liebe-das-swastika","country_name":"Australia","replies":2,"images":1},{"no":118507878,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)08:29:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118507794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118507794<\/a><br>Great fucking thread mate...sage","time":1490617743,"resto":118507794,"id":"YzEbGaxo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118507923,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)08:29:38","name":"Original","filename":"1490616921060s","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":241,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1490617778485,"time":1490617778,"md5":"TY76SOYN5PQU+feQbbcyzw==","fsize":9408,"resto":118507794,"id":"JOMyq5A5","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118507298,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)08:20:51","name":"Anonymous","sub":"POLitical compass","com":"whats dis mean","filename":"politicalcompass","ext":".png","w":480,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":208,"tim":1490617251193,"time":1490617251,"md5":"zvLtkyfmtqnF0Q\/w+GL76g==","fsize":17573,"resto":0,"id":"K\/uQfw84","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"political-compass","country_name":"Australia","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":118507772,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)08:27:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118507298\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118507298<\/a><br><br>It means you&#039;re Australian.

This was the first election in 50-100 years that actually seemed to represent us and not the Jews. Our hopes and dreams were all set up with the wall, the entry bans, the ICE raids, and other good things. We even get great spicings and proof that Israel false flagged mass-antisemitism. Then we got the Ryancare debacle. It seemed like 4D chess. The msm and Russian narrative were being btfo and the old corrupt politicians seemed like they were on their last ropes. Things seemed good for Americans online as well. We were uncucked and had a bright future.<br>Then in one single day, pretty much all of this was ripped to fucking threads in a betrayal by the one man that most of us thought would never betray us. In one day all of what we worked for, suffered for, voted for, and held dear was butchered in front of us by Donald Trump. He made it clear that America First was a fucking lie and that Israel First and the rest of the Neocon agenda is all that matters. The last remaining ray of hope is that Bannon is still on the team, and that is looking like more and more worrisome by the day.

was a glorified fireworks show. Holy fuck when he starts a war these people will be onto something. The redditors seem overly loyal and childish, but I&#039;d rather have them than a bunch of nellies who turn tail at the first sign of trouble, which is apparently what \/pol\/ is. Nothing wrong with questioning what trump did but you people have been totally mind fucked with this assad hitler stuff and the Jew conspiracies, which may be true to some degree but not to the degree people here actually believe. I sympathize with Assad but so far this has been good for Trump and the US, and minimal for Assad and Syria. Borderline symbolic. <br><br>To my knowledge Assad has never done a goddam thing for me or the USA... what kind of sorry bastard would trust him over Trump I don&#039;t know. IF it&#039;s true that he did use those chemical weapons, then he deserved much much worse than a few tomahawks on a runway for betraying trump&#039;s confidence and jeopardizing his government&#039;s cause. <br><br>This incarnation of \/pol\/ was nice while it lasted, but you know things must end at some point I guess.

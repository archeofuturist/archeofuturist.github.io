Low product costs with low wages is basically the reason why people left Mexico in such big numbers causing our agricultural sector to plummet. Having low wages is ALWAYS a bad thing, you want people to earn more, that way they can afford more things even if they are more expensive, you want hard working people on the fields to earn more so your agriculture doesn&#039;t implode. I fucking hate people who thinks that unrestrained free trade works and are against the renegotiations of NAFTA, it feels like they just think that every work that isnt an office desk job is garbage.

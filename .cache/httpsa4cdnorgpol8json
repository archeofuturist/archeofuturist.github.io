The only interviews he has given since that day were in front of a blacked out and\/or animated backgrounds. This leaves space for a couple of options:<br>1. He is still in the embassy, but doesn&#039;t want to make one of his Balcony appearances, out of fear he could get assassinated, since he is easily the most wanted man (alive).<br>2. He is alive, but not any longer in the Ecuadorian embassy. There is a theory that he was smuggled out on a plane with John Kerry.<br>3. He was murdered and the interviews conducted are fake.

The bottom line is that irreligious people don&#039;t have kids, no matter what colour they are. This is true in every country on Earth, whether or not it has a white majority. <br><br>I have been openly atheist since 14 (I&#039;m now 25), but I am taking Catechism this year because atheism\/agnosticism\/&quot;spiritual but not religious&quot; is almost as effective as getting a vasectomy because religious women will not marry you if you are an atheist and secular women squeeze out one downie at 35 after spending a lifetime &quot;finding themselves&quot; on the cock carousel. <br><br>Do not join a cucked church, even if your family comes from one. If you&#039;re from a Protestant family, become Mormon or Evangelical. If you&#039;re from a Catholic family, rejoin the Church and attend Latin mass with the traditionalists. If you&#039;re Orthodox, keep doing what you&#039;re doing. <br><br>This is the most practical advice for ending white genocide today, and it doesn&#039;t involve any wacky politics, activism, or other bullshit. It involves you getting your ass out of bed on Sunday and going to church. <br><br>I still don&#039;t believe in God, but I don&#039;t care, because reversing white genocide is more important.

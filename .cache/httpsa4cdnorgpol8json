They feel validation when watching it because they want reassurance that their meaningless life is both A. Their own choice and not due to personal failures or forces beyond their control and B. Not just a valid choice but the correct one. <br><br>The whole show borrows heavily from absurdist thought, which is funny because the same people who eat it up and claim everything is a social construct are the first to rush to the defense of their OWN social constructions, i.e. white privelege is a thing, LGBTWTFBBQ+! rights, more than two genders, etc. They&#039;re essentially absurdist posers. They are cool with it as long as they can reject the things they don&#039;t like as meaningless but hooo boy do they retreat back into meaning when it concerns something they&#039;ve been brainwashed to find meaningful.<br><br>Any true absurdist would give zero shits about anyone and just do what they&#039;d want. There&#039;s no point in defending minority rights, the universe is entirely uncaring and your struggle means nothing. In the end, it doesn&#039;t matter if a fag gets his head bashed in or he lives a full life. It doesn&#039;t matter if someone get called by their proper pronoun. It doesn&#039;t matter if racism is ended. It doesn&#039;t fucking matter. The universe cares not. You are so inconsequential that even suicide is a pointless act that assumes your life is even worth the effort to end. An absurdist hero embraces it and does what he wants. An existentialist creates meaning. A pussy is spoonfed meaning.","time":1493218628,"resto":122834304,"id":"xdrlmMYf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122893125,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:07:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122839165\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122839165<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;D-do you *burp* know why I make everything in my- in my garage Morty?

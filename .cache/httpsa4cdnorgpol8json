First of all, it is about extorting money and other material assets from the servicemen of the unit, including even the officers.<br>The criminal group included several servicemen of the urgent and contractual service, as well as those who were discharged to the reserve.<br><br>These servicemen carried firearms with them and lived not in barracks, but in apartments outside the military unit.<br>The police and the command received a signal about non-statutory relations related to crimes and economic nature. Dozens of smartphones, tablets and other electronic devices selected under the threat of using weapons from their own colleagues were found on the apartments of the Caucasian military.<br>To capture the members of the criminal group was the decision to use special forces. When the special forces conducted the operation, the criminals opened fire on him, not wanting to surrender peacefully. The special forces were forced to fire back, as a result of which one of the representatives of the criminal group was wounded. Several of his accomplices surrendered.<br>Three soldiers who had armed resistance to members of the special detachment were taken into custody. The involvement of the rest in blatant criminal activity in the territory of the coastal military unit is being clarified.","filename":"IMG_20170426_163318","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":695,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":135,"tim":1493213676613,"time":1493213676,"md5":"1NhtzXE4izEFrvLYjWRvJg==","fsize":162839,"resto":0,"id":"OD4G0VeG","country":"RU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"muslims-fucking-the-military-unit","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122883819,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)09:34:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why is it always a Jew \/pol\/?<br><br>http:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2017\/04\/25\/jane<wbr>t-yellens-successor-at-the-fed-just<wbr>-might-be-gary-cohn.html","filename":"cohn","ext":".png","w":559,"h":351,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1493213669833,"time":1493213669,"md5":"xCN7GWDGo2BM6b62vxHjfA==","fsize":39422,"resto":0,"id":"ToVPuR6k","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-is-it-always-a-jew-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122877226,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)08:11:31","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/brg\/ Boston Rally General","com":"\/brg\/ - Boston Rally General<br><br>On May 13th, a free speech rally will be held in the Boston Common on 139 Tremont St from 12pm-5pm. <br><br>Libertarians, conservatives, traditionalists, classical liberals, or anyone else who supports Trump or just hates leftists are encouraged to attend.<br><br>Bring Stickman basics at LEAST.

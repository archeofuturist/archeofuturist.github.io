Even a guy like Sanders or Booker will absolutely wreck him. Before you jump on me for being a shill, just look at it by the numbers. Texas and Georgia for the last several election cycles have been reliably red (Florida is a swing state now, but it wasn&#039;t before) Trump narrowly won those states compared to his predecessors and it&#039;s clear these two states are going the way that Florida did. All the swing states that he won, were by virtue of him NOT being Hillary and perceived as NOT being establishment. Once we&#039;re 4 years in and manufacturing jobs still haven&#039;t returned, we&#039;re going to see some serious turn-arounds in the rust belt and swing states like MI, WI, PA.<br><br>Trump only won by 2 states. Trump is not dumb and knows this, that&#039;s why he spends so much time down in Florida at Mar-a-Lago and is still campaigning in those key swing states.

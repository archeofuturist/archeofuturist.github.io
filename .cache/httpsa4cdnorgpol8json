That&#039;s why it&#039;s still called &quot;The Walk of Shame&quot; after all, because deep down people know they aren&#039;t supposed to act the way feminism\/media tells them to. <br><br>After that, the same type of shame sticks around and then they lose their sense of self esteem and are even MORE susceptible to the jew media telling them how to behave. They keep doing this until they are older and worn out and finally gain enough sense of self to stop doing degenerate shit.... and then they have about 10 years of happiness before all of that media consumption vs. not partaking in what the media displays as American life hits them and then it&#039;s midlife crisis, back to partying, divorce, look for young guys on Tinder, etc. Then some time around 50 they use a dating website to find some random douche to settle down with so they aren&#039;t alone as they wither and die.<br><br>TL;DR Women are much more susceptible to media influence because they don&#039;t have the same sense of self and the media constantly tells them to go against their own nature as human females.","time":1492585020,"resto":121815003,"id":"kXO\/3Nwg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121816558,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)03:06:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"With women especially all bets are off until they hit after the age of 25 or so when their frontal lobes are finished myelinating.

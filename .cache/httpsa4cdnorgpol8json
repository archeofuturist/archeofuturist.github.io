Holding onto her belly as it contorts with each contraction. Grabbing her jiggling and milk squirting breasts. Feeling as the baby slowly empties from her womb. Thrusting in and out of her as her screaming intensifies. Feeling the head with my testicles and the bottom of my dick as it crowns. Busting my load as she makes the final push, coating her ass and the baby in my semen. Filling the air with the aromatic scent of blood and other bodily fluids. Holding her and the baby in my arms as she sleeps, exhausted from the agony of birth and the pleasure of the creampie I left inside of her. While she enjoys her well-earned rest, I silently watch the lonely hills for signs of Nazi patrols.","filename":"rutka_by_guddipoland","ext":".jpg","w":340,"h":340,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492999671984,"time":1492999671,"md5":"NRO7jVIYzTnD6PlyGs8s3g==","fsize":118734,"resto":0,"id":"s6qIRETV","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"since-i-first-read-her-diary-in-2006-i-have","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":6,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":2},{"no":122527258,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:13:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122527218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122527218<\/a>","filename":"1453891416216","ext":".jpg","w":275,"h":471,"tn_w":72,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493000026782,"time":1493000026,"md5":"3AJ+DHSq8OFsXxEPF3uOPg==","fsize":46636,"resto":122526637,"id":"PRLlcwJt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122527290,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:14:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122527059\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122527059<\/a><br><br>What do you think Ivan?","filename":"Anne Frank-lifdrs_001","ext":".jpg","w":511,"h":850,"tn_w":75,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493000047751,"time":1493000047,"md5":"K1+wKyRiZz3PxJ1dTKkkVA==","fsize":519724,"resto":122526637,"id":"0WYUis\/b","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122527499,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:15:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122527258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122527258<\/a>","filename":"1456356662336","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":480,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493000153106,"time":1493000153,"md5":"e3vhWvmoOGi8Mx9CbfHo1A==","fsize":40871,"resto":122526637,"id":"PRLlcwJt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122528374,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:23:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122527218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122527218<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mandatory reading in the US<\/span><br><br>Says who?

Per the 10th Amendments, States have authority over everything not explicitly granted to the federal government. This is a logical way for power to be granted, since our federal government was created by the States, not the other way around.<br><br>The &quot;Bill of Rights&quot; was further written to give our federal government even more explicit directions in things it absolutely must not do in the process of carrying out the powers they were granted. For example, in Article I Section 8, Congress is given the power &quot;to regulate Commerce... among the several States&quot;. This power was granted in response to disputes between States over use of navigable waters between States, protectionism against neighboring States, and so on causing problems before the Constitution was written. However, &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...&quot; per the First Amendment. So, while Congress has the legitimate authority to regulate Commerce among the several States, they cannot use this authority to punish a particular religious group transferring religious texts from one State to another. This example isn&#039;t particularly relevant to the problems of the day, but should help you understand federal authority in the Constitution.<br><br>The problem arises with the Commerce Clause mentioned above and the 14th Amendment. For example, the Left interprets the power &quot;to regulate Commerce... among the several States&quot; as giving Congress virtual plenary power over all economic activities, both those a person chooses to participate in and chooses NOT to participate in, whether or not their Commerce leaves the State. Perhaps the two most significant cases relevant to expanding Congressional authority under the Commerce Clause were Wickard v. Filburn (1942) and National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius (2012), which I had mentioned previously.","time":1490692536,"resto":118612248,"id":"DdQfDPc2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118631177,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)05:16:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Who \/greathealthcare\/ here","time":1490692592,"resto":118612248,"id":"uB7ES2HY","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118631223,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)05:17:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118613797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118613797<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Would you live in a community that didn&#039;t have them?<\/span><br><br>I have.

They simply couldn&#039;t carry out their agenda within those confines.<br><br>Progressive Republicans of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were the first to make an effective push against these checks on their legitimate authority, but it was FDR who really pushed things into becoming the total mess they are today. From 1933 to 1936, the Supreme Court ruled a lot of the legislation he was convincing Congress to pass unconstitutional because Congress didn&#039;t have the authority to do a lot of it per the Constitution. In 1937, shortly after winning re-election, he announced a court-packing plan to expand the Supreme Court so that he could load it up with people who would declare his legislation constitutional, regardless of what the Constitution actually says. The Supreme Court caved and started declaring everything he wanted constitutional, no matter how flagrant an abuse of power.<br><br>Perhaps the only decision more outrageous than Wickard v. Filburn handed down during the rest of FDR&#039;s time as President was Korematsu v. United States (1944). FDR wanted to round up American citizens of Japanese descent and deny them due process. The Supreme Court blatantly ignored the Article 1 Section 9 part 2 and 5th Amendment to allow it.<br><br>FDR specifically spoke about this breakdown of the Constitution as being his desire or goal in a 1926 speech called Whither Bound. He wanted virtually unchecked power for the federal government to control the people. After 1937, he succeeded.","time":1490693359,"resto":118612248,"id":"DdQfDPc2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118621919,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)02:42:52","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Stolen coin","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Berlin police say thieves broke into the German capital&#039;s Bode Museum and made off with a massive 100-kilogram gold coin issued by the Royal Canadian Mint that&#039;s worth millions.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dubbed the &quot;Big Maple Leaf&quot; and measuring three-centimetres thick with a diameter of 53 centimetres, the coin has a portrait of the Queen on one side and maple leaves on the other.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It has a face value of $1 million, but by weight alone it would be worth approximately $4 million US at market prices.<\/span><br><br>Can you get your shit together Germany?

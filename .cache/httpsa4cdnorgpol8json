It would solve so many problems. Reduce prison costs and populations, reduce repeat offenders, increase the fear in crimals from doing crime. Anything above grand theft and you are executed. You are allowed two years for one appeal then you&#039;re gassed like an animal. Then we transfer the saved funds to our military and start carpet bombing the Middle East into submission. Once we&#039;ve wiped that scourge off the earth we use the monies from the confiscated oil wells to fund our military even further. Blast through then European nations all the way to the coast of Alaska. New America and New Great Britain run the planet. Thin the heards even further by bringing in euthanasia for anyone who is not a contributing member of society. Free education from liberalism by making liberalism a crime punishable by death. Bring back common sense to the planet. Remove any signs of religion. Morality becomes a human institution and not a religious one. The reduced population means we can use less resources. Organic farming techniques become standard. Hunting for your own meat is no long seen as barbaric. Better food and education means we can develop better fuel alternatives. Cleaner air, cleaner water, cleaner soil. Since there is no more war due to there only being two governments then the money we save by shutting down the military can go to space exploration. Develop worm hole capabilities. Become dominant species in the galaxy. <br>So in short if we embrace the new world order and focus on a world that has only New Great Britain and New America then we can have peace, a clean planet to live on and technology beyond our wildest dreams.","filename":"IMG_0143","ext":".jpg","w":736,"h":1309,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492503350333,"time":1492503350,"md5":"\/DCYnvljPcsi2Fu3bkU+Jg==","fsize":125672,"resto":0,"id":"lQ\/hc87k","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bring-back-the-death-penalty","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121645867,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:45:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"When will you realize that China is the big bad guy behind North Korea&#039;s aggression behaviors?","filename":"NO9lwkl","ext":".jpg","w":341,"h":334,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":244,"tim":1492494313704,"time":1492494313,"md5":"oydtFvE+6STzSrUB4bYmHQ==","fsize":14610,"resto":0,"id":"tW3dIRbL","country":"VN","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"when-will-you-realize-that-china-is-the-big-bad","country_name":"Vietnam","replies":50,"images":10,"omitted_posts":45,"omitted_images":10},{"no":121654678,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)03:35:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121654225\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121654225<\/a><br>at least we are too proud to shit ourselves","filename":"1490521009248","ext":".jpg","w":1028,"h":1302,"tn_w":98,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492500910118,"time":1492500910,"md5":"KZ7AIk6Yr3kf0qslXI+DFQ==","fsize":433886,"resto":121645867,"id":"hgba1ojc","country":"CN","m_img":1,"country_name":"China"},{"no":121654840,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)03:37:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"Interesting...

Feminine to the point where they &quot;trap&quot; the viewer by getting them aroused by something they thought to be male. Now, this has been a point of contention among people before. Technically they are in fact male, but many argue that it isn&#039;t gay, regardless of that fact. I&#039;m going to explain the reasoning behind the &quot;not gay&quot; camp.<br>The first thing to explain is probably what I see as the appeal of traps. I can&#039;t speak for anyone because I don&#039;t get hard the same way as anyone else, but I think I can guess it with fair accuracy<br>The appeal of traps is the fact that they are so feminine, without actually being female. The feeling of the Bait-N-Switch it presents is a good one, the idea that a male is cuter than any girl is both extremely erotic and very, very adorable. It&#039;s not the fact that they&#039;re male and feminine, it&#039;s the fact that they aren&#039;t what they seem. It&#039;s the same reason many people like tomboys<br>A slightly deeper meaning is that traps serve as this ideal that you aren&#039;t bound by gender roles or what people might think one should act like. Traps show that people can come in any attitude or personality and still give people a raging erection and drop panties<br>The main point is that people who like traps, as far as I can tell, aren&#039;t attracted to the fact they are male, but the fact they are a literal trap. Because it&#039;s not the &quot;maleness&quot; that attracts them, it isn&#039;t gay. I think the best example of this &quot;genderless&quot; attribute would be the iconic Hideyoshi, who is even referred to in-universe as some mystical third gender. This same idea carries over to many other traps, including the infamous reverse-trap, AKA the You thought I was a guy acting like a girl, but really I was a girl acting like a guy acting like a girl<br><br>I understand the people who think it&#039;s gay. It&#039;s a reasonable stand-point. However, as someone who likes traps but firmly hates non-trap dicks, I have to disagree.","filename":"7ef","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492287131795,"time":1492287131,"md5":"MBHMUP1XZ\/lghKzvSHgZAg==","fsize":29619,"resto":121247170,"id":"UY\/zzmB7","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":121255717,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)16:23:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121247170\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121247170<\/a><br>My nephew thinks that he is Superman.

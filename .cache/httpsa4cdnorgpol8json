Really what happened was as local portions of Europe became civilized, they wrested control of their own land from the distant and ineffectual Roman government, and took responsibility for developing it themselves.

Between now and than stood the &quot;Wirtschaftswunder&quot;, a &quot;good time&quot; for western Germany. Eastern Germany was in the Hard times then again but thanks to &quot;strong men&quot; they broke free and the eastern Germany (DDR) was dissolved.

It all follows this cyclical law. You may now make the time frames bigger and count longer times and bigger landmasses, eg the EU. AFTER the world wars the European continent was devastated, then became a union and good times came back. Now Britain leaves, Greece doesn&#039;t do so well and the EU seems to have passed its peak of glory.<br><br>Sooner or later the non-black society falls apart to renew itself. Now you may just pic up a certain even and call it a proof but it&#039;s not because after good times always followed bad times and after that good times and so forth. There newer was a good times forever u silly willy. <br><br>Also black states will not &quot;recover&quot; we happen to be in Nigeria, trying to help a village build a infrastructure (yup like Good Samaritan while people complex) when my professor returned last year, they SOLD the irrigation pipes and sewer pipes, replaced the electrical well pump for a cord bucket system(the motor was sold and the bucket system broke and no more water) and they bought shit for the big families which made them have a nice 5 month and then they were filth again. Helping black states or believing you can teach them anything is a myth and pretty arrogant imo.

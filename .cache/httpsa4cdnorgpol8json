Outside of Europe, they are very popular in some South American countries, notably in Argentina and Uruguay. Electronic bidet-integrated toilets, along with functions like toilet seat warmers, are commonly found in Japan.<br>In northern Europe, bidets are rare, although in Finland bidet showers are common.[7] Bidet showers are also common in South-East Asia, South Asia and parts of the Middle East.<br>In 1980, the first &quot;paperless toilet&quot; was launched in Japan by manufacturer Toto,[8] a combination of toilet and bidet which also dries the user after washing. These combination toilet-bidets (washlet) with seat warmers, or attachable bidets are particularly popular in Japan and South Korea, found in approximately 60% of households.[citation needed] They are commonly found in hotels and even some public facilities. These bidet-toilets, along with toilet seat and bidet units (to convert an existing toilet) are sold in many countries, including the United States.<br><br>MUCH LIKE INDIANS CANNOT POO IN LOO, AMERICANS SMEAR SHIT AROUND THEIR ASS WITH TOILET PAPER LIKE SUB HUMANS.<br><br>BIDETS ACTUALLY CLEAN THE ASSHOLE AND ARE VERY HYGIENIC.<br><br>https:\/\/21stcentury-living.com\/luxe<wbr>-bidet-neo-120\/","filename":"1491127552649","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":420,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1491160981754,"time":1491160981,"md5":"JEdueS2xVYKKjJxvKCHYKA==","fsize":26520,"resto":0,"id":"0vno7BBI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"united-states-should-mandate-bidets-like-italy","country_name":"United States","replies":104,"images":21,"omitted_posts":99,"omitted_images":20,"tail_size":50},{"no":119252847,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:09:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119237142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119237142<\/a>","filename":"anbN7po_700b","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":730,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491170965358,"time":1491170965,"md5":"oq5SVSjJwPsdHPBD8Y3OZA==","fsize":83251,"resto":119234513,"id":"x7UcQOgl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119253951,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:19:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119234667\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119234667<\/a><br>Does it have to be her shit?","filename":"CS1p1FYWEAMdCYC","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":338,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491171576895,"time":1491171576,"md5":"zmHArz+htK+V5UDL8nGflg==","fsize":19439,"resto":119234513,"id":"\/56KOOW0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119254037,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:20:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bidets will sweep North America by storm once an overpriced brand with a catchy name advertises them on TV","time":1491171627,"resto":119234513,"id":"T0jjwGj+","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119254756,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:26:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119234513\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119234513<\/a><br>Is this simply a reputation thing?

I felt mentally isolated from people and I thought no one saw the world the way I did. As all young teens do I thought I was a special snowflake.<br><br> I was indoctrinated in to leftist thinking very quickly mostly due to my atheistic beliefs or lack thereof. I thought that religion was the source of the world&#039;s problems and that liberty, democracy, individualism, and working for the common good of all mankind were goals to aspire to.<br><br> My naivety become apparent to myself as I grew older and I was exposed to identity politics. I had believed in a dream of a world where all people were equal, but the very people I had thought wanted that also, suddenly began to turn on my very identity. I saw people attack masculinity and whiteness, and I felt utterly alienated. Like I was a criminal but my only crime was having been born, and these accusations of my own inadequacy weren&#039;t dismissed by the general liberal community, BUT EMBRACED! I was told it was wrong of me to question them, after all, I was not a woman nor was I a person of color. They told me I was pampered by a privileged life and I could never understand those who were different from so I must submit to them as my masters.<br><br>This was when I observed my first case of hypocrisy on the left, when I realized that they didn&#039;t want me unless I would bow to them and that if I followed them I could never truly be a man but only a weak pawn working for the destruction of my own race.<br><br>Once again I was lost and lacked all sense of belonging; that is until I stumbled upon \/pol\/ after following a youtube comment left on one of Sargon of Akkad&#039;s videos mentioning this place. When I arrived I was overwhelmed and dismissed much of the information presented here, however when I realized how equally isolated the people here felt and how they hated things like modern feminism,","filename":"NSDAP","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":697,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":174,"tim":1492800999929,"time":1492800999,"md5":"kr1\/YpvARBVrFJSbu5vppw==","fsize":198140,"resto":0,"id":"0uHp+OfO","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-made-me-a-national-socialist","country_name":"United States","replies":20,"images":9,"omitted_posts":15,"omitted_images":9},{"no":122176804,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)15:55:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122175806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122175806<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t.

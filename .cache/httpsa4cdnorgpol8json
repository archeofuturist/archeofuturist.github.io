Sorry m8&#039;s. Finished the work day early and we kicked ass this week so tomorrow is going to be a breeze. Probably only 6 or 7 hour day, and all the easiest jobs we have prewtty much. Nothing pushed back this week. So I have been pounding beers for like 3 hours, and I just got kind of pissed at people getting free money for being pussies about life. <br><br>Sorry for blog post. Fuck it Ima crack more beers and enjoy my life.. I love it. Sucks for NEETbux people, that they &quot;can&#039;t cope with having a job blah blah fucking blah&quot;<br><br>Newsflash, probably like 70% of people fucking HATE their jobs. Probably like 20% of people are OK with their jobs. 8% of people Like their jobs, (BTW I talking about all\/most of the time, not just like, &quot;liking the job&quot; because its easy and\/or with friends, but the pay is shit... &quot;liking&quot; a job, eans you love the environment, the pay, the bad things about it like damage to your body if its labor etc.. the amount of hours having to work. So on) and about 2% of people actually LOVE their jobs... <br><br>So should those 70% of people who fucking HATE their jobs day in, day out. Maybe have some good days at work because they man up and are use to it. But overall its horseshit, bullshit work, for shitty pay, and unfair bosses? Should they all just get NEETbux? I fucking think so. I can&#039;t cope with all my jobs... That is why you man the fuck up, get some experienc,e and work your way up to better jobs. THAT YOU CAN COPE WITH.<br><br>Jesus fuck.

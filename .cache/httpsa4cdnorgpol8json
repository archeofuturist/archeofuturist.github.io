You can&#039;t redpill people with the crime rate\/welfare rate\/unemployment rate because people will call white privilege and &quot;muh programs&quot;. You can&#039;t say &quot;Look at Africa&quot; because muh whitey took da land<br><br>But you can&#039;t really argue with IQ right? It&#039;s widely accepted that some races have higher or lower IQ than others even by lefty cucks, so the question is why this is. <br><br>I find it funny that you could get a liberal to agree that blacks have low IQ and crime rate, and then state that for the reason why you wouldn&#039;t want them in your community but then they would just say &quot;dats racist&quot; and &quot;dey need help&quot; or something. <br><br>So wheres those redpills?

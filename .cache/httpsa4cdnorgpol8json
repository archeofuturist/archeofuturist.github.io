Because it has gotten to a point where I am not sure what seperates them anymore, apart from the place on the political spectrum. They use the same tactics, have similiar dogmas and are highly defensive of their believes no matter the counterarguments. Over the years I have spoken to lots of people from right, left and center. The common similiarties between the behaviour alt-right and SJWs, as well as their religious behavior are striking. They both act highly condescending, regarding the person almost automatically inferior just by them having a differing opinion. SJWs say &quot;racist, sexist&quot; etc. Alt-righters say &quot;Low IQ, cuck&quot; etc. It creates an iningroup\/outgroup mentality just like in a cult. By labelling the opposing person something their personal credibility in front of the ingroup is attacked, making their arguments false automatically. It can also be used to shut down conversations. Further they are both heavily based on identity politics. SJWs act on the narrative of a system of opression. Alt-righters on concepts like white genocide. One will show me the history of the black race and point to oppression. One will show me the history of the white race and point to oppression. And just as SJWs will be supportive of non-whites, alt-righters will push against this by establishing a &quot;white identity&quot;, even if this concept in itself has flaws. Like: What is &quot;white identity&quot; defined as? Most of the people I&#039;ve talked to simply point to whites being the more civilized race. However, if a black person holds these white believes and can be expected to keep them, is he white to? Or can actions against him still be legitimized in a culture protective of white values? This is just one of the examples that make this dogma so hard. It, like in a cult, should not be questioned of course since it can lead to cognitive dissonance. This makes both groups also a collective.","filename":"altright","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":180,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491399420779,"time":1491399420,"md5":"GTtXCGUUIiUd+jgd3494gg==","fsize":15480,"resto":0,"id":"ExptTlPo","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-someone-explain-to-me-the-difference-between","country_name":"Germany","replies":18,"images":1,"omitted_posts":13,"omitted_images":1},{"no":119607686,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)09:47:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119606810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119606810<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119606861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119606861<\/a><br>Very insightful posts","time":1491400058,"resto":119606810,"id":"huhXhuDm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119607813,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)09:49:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119607430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119607430<\/a><br>This is also true","time":1491400156,"resto":119606810,"id":"huhXhuDm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119608025,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)09:51:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119606810\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119606810<\/a><br><br>Your&#039;re tactics have no power here, cuck boi","filename":"1491093718668","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491400303068,"time":1491400303,"md5":"gQHAa+liS0ovTBQJtVFdtQ==","fsize":46805,"resto":119606810,"id":"t6TCd5vQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119608834,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)10:01:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119607682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119607682<\/a><br>Not all altrighters are white nationalists<br><br>Just all the pple they vote for... hurr durr and the confedate flag is just a symbol of heritage hurr durr...","time":1491400877,"resto":119606810,"id":"+tlxMAUE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119609035,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)10:03:46","name":"sage goes in all fields","com":"Op is a faggit<br><br>You know what goes in all fields","time":1491401026,"resto":119606810,"id":"+0W7Q6Tr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119607612,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)09:46:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"So what makes white people just so goddamn superior?","filename":"10031224-Cartoon-strong-man-isolated-on-white-back-ground-Stock-Vector","ext":".jpg","w":1234,"h":1300,"tn_w":237,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491400005650,"time":1491400005,"md5":"Yxy7wiqyoD0Ze+cOLKahdQ==","fsize":106287,"resto":0,"id":"J9IhTSRW","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-what-makes-white-people-just-so-goddamn","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":6,"images":1,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":1},{"no":119607850,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)09:49:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"the fact they&#039;re going extinct","time":1491400183,"resto":119607612,"id":"kl2o\/rhb","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119608049,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)09:52:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"God.","time":1491400320,"resto":119607612,"id":"ZwOUaOYR","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":119608554,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)09:57:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119607612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119607612<\/a><br>We&#039;re smart and strong.

On that day I was asked a question by Rupert Ryan, brother-in-law of Lord Casey, on the deportation of Malayan seamen, Chinese and other people who had contravened our immigration laws. I said, amongst other things, that an error may have been made in the case of two men named Wong. The Department had served a deportation notice on one of them, but it was the wrong Wong. I then said, and I quote from Hansard: &quot;there are many Wongs in the Chinese community, but I have to say \u2014 and I am sure that the honorable Member for Balaclava will not mind doing so \u2014 that &#039;two Wongs do not make a White&#039;<br><br>It was a jocose remark, made partly at the expense of the member for Balaclava, who was at the time the Hon T W (later Sir Thomas) White. I expected that I would have been correctly reported, as I was in Hansard and that the initial letter &quot;W&quot; on both the names &quot;Wong&quot; and &quot;White&quot; would have been written in capitals. But when the message got to Singapore, either because of some anti-Australian Asian journalist or perhaps because some Australian pressman with a chip on his shoulder, a Labor Party hater, the name of White was deliberately altered into a definition of colour, so as to read &quot;two Wongs don&#039;t make a white.&quot; The story has lasted to this day. I have often answered questions about it from young Chinese students at universities in Melbourne and Sydney. I notice whenever reference is made to it in newspapers or periodicals, or whenever the quotation is used anywhere, the Singapore abomination is generally repeated. Latterly the true version is being printed.<br><br>There was never any intention in my mind to raise any question of colour. I have repudiated the whole story so often that I suppose there is nothing more I can do about it.

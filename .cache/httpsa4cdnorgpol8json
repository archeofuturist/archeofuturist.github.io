This \u201cegalitarianism\u201d was manifested in cultural domains with concepts such as <br>\u201cAnything can be defined as being art and all such works must be considered to have <br>equal validity.\u201d Thus, some random splashes on a canvas were considered an equal <br>achievement to the Sistine Chapel; a mud hut was held up as being equivalent to <br>Versailles. A janitor was dubbed the equivalent to a physicist; a novelist was now the <br>peer of one who scrawled graffiti on a bathroom wall. This principle of <br>\u201cindiscrimination\u201d was applied to all other fields of achievement. Those who opposed <br>this leveling were accused of being \u201cfascists\u201d or \u201cNazis,\u201d without regard for what these <br>terms might have meant in their actual historical origins and practice.

Christianity is absolutely toothless, and leaves current generations with a spiritual void, such that they leave the church and study eastern religions.

The FN in its current state does not really have much of a precise goal (like UKIP did which was their strength but is also what is currently killing them since they have exhausted all their usefulness) or any precise position. The party just throws a strange blend of far-left mesures (like a hard cap of the retirement age at 60) but presents them in a manner closer to the former far-right direction it had by dropping the class rethorics and replacing it in the context of the EU and globalisation instead.

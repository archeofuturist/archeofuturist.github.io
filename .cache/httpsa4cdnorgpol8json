The case was said to reach &quot;the highest levels of the Republican party&quot;. A documentary about the scandal, Conspiracy of Silence, was listed in the TV guide to air on the Discovery Channel in May of 1993 but was mysteriously pulled without notice at the last minute.<br><br>While the courts ruled that the entire case was a &quot;carefully crafted hoax,&quot; there&#039;s plenty evidence to suggest otherwise. Two of the plaintiffs (Alisha Owen and Paul Bonacci) served time in prison because they refused to recant their testimonies while two other plaintiffs (Troy Boner and Danny King) recanted, supposedly under FBI pressure. Another victim, Eulice Washington, refused to recant but served no time. Paul Bonacci was later awarded $1 million dollars in civil court by a judge who believed his allegations of abuse.<br><br>The victims were able to describe rooms of the White House in great detail and matched alleged travel dates with airline receipts. There were several mysterious deaths of key players, such as the explosion of a plane carrying Gary Caradori, private investigator for the plaintiffs. All of his records were promptly impounded by the FBI.<br>http:\/\/spotlightonabuse.wordpress.c<wbr>om\/2013\/05\/02\/tim-tate-on-the-makin<wbr>g-of-the-franklin-scandal-documenta<wbr>ry-conspiracy-of-silence\/","filename":"IMG_4293","ext":".jpg","w":1011,"h":1005,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":248,"tim":1493315747227,"time":1493315747,"md5":"+SdeQQI8hkIAN21B369cTg==","fsize":233320,"resto":0,"id":"IaNihOGU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cia-government-pedophila-franklin-scandal-general","country_name":"United States","replies":72,"images":25,"omitted_posts":67,"omitted_images":25},{"no":123091389,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)17:29:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"Interesting thread<br><br>I wonder if the Nazis knew about something similar in the Wiemer republic, but it&#039;s all been covered up.","time":1493328591,"resto":123063838,"id":"NYtpyb\/E","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123091515,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)17:30:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123091389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123091389<\/a><br>Thanks I will have to look into that","time":1493328638,"resto":123063838,"id":"IaNihOGU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123092148,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)17:34:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123090456\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123090456<\/a><br>It seems like everytime its bought to the publics attention; its quickly buried - or theres actually not &quot;much outrage&quot; <br><br>Consider, that people felt more sympathy; for those staged pics of the Syrian Children &quot;after airstrikes&quot;, more felt sorrow for that dead kid on the beech, more outrage when Family Guy killed Brian - yet adults later claiming they were sexual abuse victims of VIPs or stories regarding it - no ones got time for it. <br><br>Then, theres getting an agency to act accordingly - but if the FBI were refusing to investigate because the Franklin Cover up not to mention &quot;rogue agents&quot; could &quot;suppress&quot; informants; how would anyone ever even get arrested?<br><br>You see, Hitler did it the right way - gained public affection, power, money, respect; then he rounded up those filthy commie fucks","time":1493328892,"resto":123063838,"id":"tjsFsZG3","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123092733,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)17:38:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"More people gave a shit about this little cunt; than the 800,000+ missing children per year in America. <br><br>Digest that a moment.","filename":"ad_216378309-e1471591939690","ext":".jpg","w":2200,"h":1568,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1493329111705,"time":1493329111,"md5":"P0BaBaRidBQYmaBL5TxLeg==","fsize":479251,"resto":123063838,"id":"tjsFsZG3","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123092735,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)17:38:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Guys its just too much redpill for me right now..

In fact, most of our countries have Pan-Slavic colors on our flag in one way or another (White, Red and Blue), so check that box. <br><br>There are many things that all Slavs have in common: our languages are ridiculously similar (it might not seem that way but I know for a fact that about 6 months of intensive learning of another Slavic language can get you fluent if you are diligent enough), we&#039;re all Christians and yes, we do like to drink, as sad as it is. But more importantly we all value our cultures and get quite defensive about them.

We could have a European Union without its failures such as multiculturalism (because our cultures are similar and we do not accept immigration), promotion of useless rights (SJWs, homosexuals and so on) and so on.

They were mostly Jew merchants in the coastal cities, so no communism there. During the mandate more moved in, but the migration didn&#039;t really start until 1945. One big problem was that none of the kikes knew how to farm so they all piled into the coastal cities and tried to become merchants. Kibbutzim were formed because the cities were full of kike merchants and they had to get the newly arrived helpless fucks out of the cities and take control of the countryside from the goatfucking Arab savages. The kibbutzim were never self-sustaining and in the 1970s, after the initial need for them was over, the Israeli government stopped subsidizing them and they all succumbed to bankruptcy.

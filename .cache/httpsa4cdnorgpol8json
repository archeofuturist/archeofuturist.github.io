culture industry fulfils the function of diverting minds which it boasts about so loudly. If most of the radio stations and movie theatres were closed down, the consumers would probably not lose so very much. To walk from the street into the movie theatre is no longer to enter a world of dream; as soon as the very existence of these institutions no longer made it obligatory to use them, there would be no great urge to do so. Such closures would not be reactionary machine wrecking. The disappointment would be felt not so much by the enthusiasts as by the slow-witted, who are the ones who suffer for everything anyhow. In spite of the films which are intended to complete her integration, the housewife finds in the darkness of the movie theatre a place of refuge where she can sit for a few hours with nobody watching, just as she used to look out of the window when there were still homes and rest in the evening. The unemployed in the great cities find coolness in summer and warmth in winter in these temperature-controlled locations. Otherwise, despite its size, this bloated pleasure apparatus adds no dignity to man\u2019s lives. The idea of \u201cfully exploiting\u201d available technical resources and the facilities for aesthetic mass consumption is part of the economic system which refuses to exploit resources to abolish hunger.&quot;","filename":"Cultural Marxism2","ext":".jpg","w":614,"h":541,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":220,"tim":1493053445092,"time":1493053445,"md5":"dr3wTnsObV0xREYtihkrDg==","fsize":317559,"resto":0,"id":"JMC9v+9f","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-did-he-mean-by-this","country_name":"Australia","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":122608392,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:05:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"you think i came to this board to read a book? i came here because im drunk, i dont want to read","time":1493053530,"resto":122608223,"id":"5NhDdu8w","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122608319,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:04:55","name":"Anonymous","sub":"JIHADI CAPTURED BY RUSSIAN SECURITY FORCES","com":"muslim jihadi btfo.<br><br>http:\/\/clapsnews.com\/2017\/04\/22\/mus<wbr>t-see-russian-security-forces-captu<wbr>re-jihadi-with-grenade-video\/","filename":"Screen-Shot-2017-04-22-at-1.24.54-PM","ext":".png","w":2048,"h":1148,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493053495345,"time":1493053495,"md5":"1gtYUVLZRcRgvje\/hQd6Ew==","fsize":819349,"resto":0,"id":"98DQiaXX","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"jihadi-captured-by-russian-security-forces","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":122605447,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)12:39:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Come down to Earth and recognise that Jesus Lived","filename":"1437562584950","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":1754,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":219,"tim":1493051972198,"time":1493051972,"md5":"kTAhRkR1\/3sl4EfKo2oLVQ==","fsize":3162748,"resto":0,"id":"sww7dyWe","country":"PL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"come-down-to-earth-and-recognise-that-jesus-lived","country_name":"Poland","replies":7,"images":4,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":1},{"no":122607232,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)12:54:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122606325\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122606325<\/a><br><br>I dunno lad, the Son of God pissed the Jews off and they had him flayed and crucified.

They are trying to do two things: first, implement communism, and second, see that all businessmen of German ancestry and non-Jewish antecedents are thrown out of their jobs. They have utterly lost the Anglo-Saxon conception of justice and feel that a man can be kicked out because somebody else says he is a Nazi. They were evidently quite shocked when I told them I would kick nobody out without the successful proof of guilt before a court of law . . . Another point which the press harped on was the fact that we were doing too much for the Germans to the detriment of the DP\u2019s, most of whom are Jews. I could not give the answer to that one, because the answer is that, in my opinion and that of most nonpolitical officers, it is vitally necessary for us to build Germany up now as a buffer state against Russia.

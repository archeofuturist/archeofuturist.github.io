Bill Nye addressed chromosomes, hormones, genitalia and secondary sex characteristics when talking about how some of us don\u2019t fit into the male\/female sex dichotomy, and brought up psychology and neuroscience when talking about gender and its difference from sex, and also sexuality. The actual science of sex, gender and sexuality across the animal kingdom and across human behaviour is far more interesting than \u201clol nope science says there are only two genders.\u201d <br><br>It honestly makes me angry when people say \u201clol I thought this was about science\u201d whenever a scientist says something about topics like gender, sexuality, climate change or evolution that annoys someone. You can\u2019t just pretend science is on your side when your understanding of science is based on a grade school textbook.","filename":"Bill_Nye_Saves_world_poster-1492470090","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":645,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":157,"tim":1493188736971,"time":1493188736,"md5":"mltW2sHke+vX9DzAHnTDLg==","fsize":110208,"resto":0,"id":"D5NGfWQQ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"it-bothers-me-to-see-how-many-people-are-saying","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":2,"omitted_posts":7,"omitted_images":1},{"no":122855961,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:54:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"how many do you need in order to procreate?<br>one male and one female, if there was a third gender that is needed to breed then that gender should be acknowledge but it isn&#039;t because all you need is a penis and a vagina in order to make a baby","time":1493189692,"resto":122854622,"id":"Kg8HRCEJ","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122856361,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:59:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122854622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122854622<\/a><br><br>FLUORIDE IS TURNING MEN INTO WOMEN AND WOMEN INTO CUNTS!","time":1493189987,"resto":122854622,"id":"zyLUGZfL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122856602,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)03:02:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122855385\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122855385<\/a><br>Anything but straight is degenerate and should not be tolerated","time":1493190160,"resto":122854622,"id":"hHgr+8Rf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122856813,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)03:05:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122854622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122854622<\/a><br>Thank you non-binary comrade<br><br>You all need to learn your lesson, Science is the all knowing being of knowledge and truth, and his prophet Bill Nye (Changed Climates be Upon Xim) is infallible and will guide you to be enlightened and forward thinking . <br><br>Fall in line, and may your genders be as numerous as the stars in the sky.","filename":"Untitled2","ext":".png","w":722,"h":516,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1493190319054,"time":1493190319,"md5":"WHOx3upYyzwgGs+zPzNU7w==","fsize":254222,"resto":122854622,"id":"y9AJ4O1F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122857032,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)03:09:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122855276\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122855276<\/a><br><br>Thanks for the lesson there antifa...<br><br>Don&#039;t let the door hit you on the way out...<br><br>Faggot","time":1493190563,"resto":122854622,"id":"SV9L96MY","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122855174,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)02:45:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"As part of a class project, i need to explain the republican stance on the topic of poverty in america.<br><br>So far this is what i gleaned: Republicans want to reduce the citizens on welfare and at the same time encourage these citizens to find work, generally by making the requirements to receive welfare assistance more strict and offering rewarding incentives for poor citizens to find jobs. The republicans seek to cut government spending on poverty by promoting assistance available through the private sector (charities,churches,non-profits), such as by reducing taxation of these organizations, as well as reducing taxation of the poor in general. The Republican party would also want to turn federal programs over to the state, which invariably results in less government funds spent towards assisting the poor.<br><br>You guys pay attention to politics right?

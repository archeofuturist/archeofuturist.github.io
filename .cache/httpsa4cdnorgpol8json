First of all, watch this cringy video if you want (optional)<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Wll<wbr>c5gSc-N8<br>Someone in the comments pointed out something on the lines of &quot;I don&#039;t understand why liberals think the solution is just raising the volume up on this crap&quot;...<br>Well, I think I found out a solution, or something close. Our solution is letting them raise the volume Let&#039;s just stop caring and let the liberals fill the media or crap.<br>Think about it! The big users of Internet are a small segment of the population and 4chan, although extremely influential, is a small portion of this segment. But if we start rigging this and &quot;go with them&quot; for a little bit, it will catch enough momentum for more and more normies to notice that this feminism movement is cringy and stupid. People won&#039;t go back to us UNLESS everything gets fucked up badly. The closer they are to them, the way closer they will get later on when they realize they had been decieved.<br><br>Is this feasible? Or do you think this would hurt us instead of helping? My point is that the reason most of the world started becoming less authoritarian is because it represented something different from the ideologies of the Axis, just to fight against those morals.<br><br>If the world gets fucked up, EVERYONE will come back to us to set equilibrum again.

But Nietzsche himself remarks that having &quot;killed God,wasn&#039;t that perhaps rather too grand of us? Shouldn&#039;t we become gods in order to be worthy of it?&quot; After recognizing that &quot;nothing exists, all is permitted,&quot; and the &quot;freedom of the spirit,&quot; the inevitable consequence is the challenge: &quot;Now prove the nobility of your nature.&quot; \u0391 famous passage of Zarathustra gives the most pregnant formulation to the essence of the crisis. &#039;\u038e\u03bf\u03c5 call yourself free? Let me hear your ruling thoughts, and not that you have escaped bondage. Are you one who deserved to escape from it? There are many who threw away their only worth when they threw away their servitude. Free from what? Why should Zarathustra care? Your eyes should answer plainly: free for what?&quot; And Zarathustra warns that it will be terrible to be alone, without any laws from above oneself, alone with one&#039;s own freedom in a desert place and an icy air, judge and avenger of one&#039;s own law.For him who only acquires any worth by serving, for him who had in his bonds not a cause of paralysis but a support, solitude appears as a curse; he loses courage and his initial pride deflates. These are the sentiments, continues Zarathustra, that then assail the free man, and that Active Nihilism will not fail to kill him if he does not kill them first. \u0399n precise terms, and from a higher point of view, this is the essential ground of modern man&#039;s unhappiness.<br><br>Dostoyevsky points out the same thing \u03af\u03b7 analogous fashion: it is Kirilov&#039;s doctrine. The framework is identical: &quot;Man only invented God so that he could live without killing himself. And this is the history \u03bff mankind from its origins up to the present day,&quot; says Kirilov.","time":1490340567,"resto":118049929,"id":"C2HopMQT","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":118056769,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)03:34:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118056408\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118056408<\/a><br>Dostoyevsky was a cuck he was disloyal shit towards the Tsar .And the Tsar had purple blood","time":1490340868,"resto":118049929,"id":"4jzN4AB2","country":"MK","country_name":"Macedonia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118052642,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)02:37:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"What was Trump&#039;s best debate performance?","filename":"Trumpdebate","ext":".jpg","w":1260,"h":560,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":111,"tim":1490337471904,"time":1490337471,"md5":"bxjZ8h4+iopJR5XQlEu00A==","fsize":93856,"resto":0,"id":"1X5h+F3R","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-was-trumps-best-debate-performance","country_name":"United States","replies":15,"images":2,"omitted_posts":10,"omitted_images":2},{"no":118055197,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)03:10:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw youd be in jail<\/span>","filename":"1478174970914","ext":".jpg","w":576,"h":768,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490339447695,"time":1490339447,"md5":"8iFdajSizuj+0O6Nb9uUqA==","fsize":106627,"resto":118052642,"id":"wDuOgash","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118055201,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)03:11:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118055132\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118055132<\/a><br>I wonder if he would do a mock debate just for old time sake.","time":1490339461,"resto":118052642,"id":"1\/wndNCz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118055221,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)03:11:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118054762\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118054762<\/a>","filename":"tumblr_mvx8u9kSkT1sdydefo1_400","ext":".gif","w":380,"h":255,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490339474622,"time":1490339474,"md5":"VmejayImvEZjeB6Bb0OpEQ==","fsize":1730467,"resto":118052642,"id":"nFR+pjZY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118055231,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)03:11:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118052642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118052642<\/a><br>none, nice rick question","time":1490339486,"resto":118052642,"id":"mSGN4CV9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118056754,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)03:34:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118055132\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118055132<\/a><br>This, the first debate, and the cnn one with the pink backdrop with the final 4","time":1490340859,"resto":118052642,"id":"wlNqfgfY","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}]}

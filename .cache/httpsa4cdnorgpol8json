That&#039;s a fancy way to say they&#039;re opposite ideologies designed to clash, like Yin and Yang.<br><br>NatSoc was fundamentally an ideology built around race, while Marxist socialism was entirely different: built around class. Hitler aimed to unite the right and left, including workers and their bosses, into a new German nation based on racial identity. Socialism, in contrast, was a class war between workers, bosses, and owners (Capitalists), aiming to build a workers state in which race and gender were insignificant. Socialists, especially Marxist socialists, were anti-religious atheists, whereas NatSoc went so far as to make Christianity the religion of the state.<br><br>The differences go on and on: Marxist socialism was internationalist, NatSoc was nationalist. Marxist socialism was egalitarian, whereas NatSoc believed that nature was unequal and required competition. Marxist socialism wanted to nationalize all private industry, while NatSoc privatized every major industry except the railroads (it considered these a military asset. In fact, Hitler once joked &quot;they didn&#039;t need to nationalize property because they nationalized people&quot;. NatSoc drew on a range of pan-German theories, which wanted to blend Aryan workers and Aryan magnates into a super Aryan state, which would involve the eradication of class-focused socialism as a non-German ideology.","time":1491767562,"resto":120312972,"id":"NANnoAvz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120326683,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)15:53:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120326538\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120326538<\/a><br><br>NatSoc redefined socialism as &quot;Germanism\/Volkism&quot;, which they saw as &quot;producer-oriented capitalism&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Jewish capitalism&quot;, aka, international finance, globalism, wall street, etc. In theory, NatSoc economics was a version of Keynesianism, tailored to the V\u00f6lkisch nature of whichever people adopted it. Its not one dogmatic economic system,and Hitler often joked that the lack of a specific ideology was their strength. NatSoc could be more &quot;free market&quot; as Americans know it, or less.

Whatever the intention of Trump, and how he planned to make Israel and the US strong again, or whatever, he is turning out to be just another useless Zionist puppet. <br><br>The good news is that he will fail tremendously - likely worse than Bush II who squandered the sole superpower status of the US AND led the world to a G-20 world from a G7 world while making Iran a regional power and Iraq independent as well. <br><br>Trump sees that and will do much better for everyone other than the right wing in the US and Israel. I do have faith in him there. Cheaters and warmongers are losers and this is what he has shown himself to be.","time":1491767971,"resto":120326813,"id":"roIymJu1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120306396,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)13:17:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Name one reason not to nuke us<br><br>Also based Dailymail always naming the rapefugee","filename":"2017-04-09--19_11_41","ext":".jpg","w":1187,"h":1420,"tn_w":208,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491758233328,"time":1491758233,"md5":"GEiZ1EoOr\/fS6Srn\/3UYzQ==","fsize":760896,"resto":0,"id":"0lghm18i","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"name-one-reason-not-to-nuke-us","country_name":"Germany","replies":74,"images":21,"omitted_posts":69,"omitted_images":20},{"no":120326361,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)15:51:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120325565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120325565<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It depressing as fuck seeing you like this<\/span>","filename":"#MAGA","ext":".webm","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491767485133,"time":1491767485,"md5":"CeGhQtIeqLZVh8k4cZCi6A==","fsize":1533198,"resto":120306396,"id":"NZPzEloD","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120326390,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)15:51:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120325989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120325989<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you dont know anything about me chum, other than that Im American<\/span><br>That&#039;s all he needs to know, faggot.

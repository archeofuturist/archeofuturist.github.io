Overall mortality rates from strokes have significantly decreased over the past 50 years due to multiple factors, including better treatment for hypertension and increased use of aspirin, even as incidence of acute ischemic stroke among young adults has been on the rise.<br>The study also looked at stroke risk factors and whether there were any changes in their prevalence from 2003 to 2012. The likelihood of having three or more of five common risk factors \u2014 diabetes, hypertension, lipid disorders, obesity and tobacco use \u2014 doubled in men and women hospitalized for acute ischemic strokes.","filename":"stroke","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":594,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":247,"tim":1492260142892,"time":1492260142,"md5":"MEixDSsP1KGAhRRWDWK+iQ==","fsize":126995,"resto":0,"id":"EAr8ikoU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"stroke-rates-appear-to-be-rising-steadily-in","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":121206589,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:44:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Maybe stop eating so much then you wouldn&#039;t have more strokes amerifat","time":1492260294,"resto":121206384,"id":"bMZ8I7vN","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":121206722,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:46:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121206589\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121206589<\/a><br>Carbs are addicting, it is not my fault. <br><br>Also, not all who get them are fat:<br><br>https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/nati<wbr>onal\/health-science\/this-fit-young-<wbr>woman-was-having-strokes-and-doctor<wbr>s-didnt-know-why\/2017\/01\/09\/54797c8<wbr>4-c47a-11e6-8422-eac61c0ef74d_story<wbr>.html","time":1492260396,"resto":121206384,"id":"EAr8ikoU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121203002,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:57:57","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Is it wrong to think the EU is a net positive overall?","com":"Just from a utilitarian standpoint, I understand that a lot of the stuff it does or is is garbage, like its sprawling and often inefficient bureacracy, or the red tape and regulations I&#039;ve heard it overuses and pointlessly throws around and slaps onto everything.<br><br>At the same time however, I believe a single trade union and relatively open borders between most of the countries of Europe, which for now at least are mostly filled with good non-terrorist non-idiot populations.

I admire the French when they are proud of France, I admire the Germans when they are proud to be German etc etc. We can celebrate our national identities and different cultures without wanting to conquer other people&#039;s countries. We are a tribal species, we will never get settle in one big blob and live in peace and harmony, even if all races mix up and end up in one ugly mongrel, those mongrels will separate themselves on believes or whatever and start fighting again, what we need is good leaders that work together not one global &quot;nation&quot;. Nationalism is death to Globalism (a Globalist slave camp created for the interests of High Finance), it&#039;s why I&#039;m a Nationalist. To understand requires critical thinking, not conformism.<br><br>Nationalism is the enemy of the establishment. In this rotten system heading towards a one world government and total obliteration of sovereign nations, cultures, identities, differences and traditions; pride in one&#039;s own country and heritage is demonised and slandered. It&#039;s essentially just an attempt to create neo-feudalism at this point. Nationalism&#039;s core ideals and values are against the interests of the greedy hypercapitalist financial \u00e9lite that is enslaving us and wants America and Europe as a mixed, multiracial, multicultural, rootless and homogeneous HUMAN FARM of easily controllable consumers. Politicians are irrelevant, they are puppets of the banks and corporations, and thus act their part accordingly. Merkel is a prime example of sellout politician taking orders from the banks and corporations and actively and subtly destroying Europe and the Europeans.","time":1490682435,"resto":118618522,"id":"2U5n60\/z","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118620744,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)02:27:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"*blocks your affordable hydro bill*<br><br>What do?","filename":"kathleen-wynne","ext":".jpg","w":280,"h":255,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":227,"tim":1490682424581,"time":1490682424,"md5":"R7KchZUNdHohFoqlEAg6Yw==","fsize":15541,"resto":0,"id":"EU0mai7T","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"blocks-your-affordable-hydro-bill","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118618518,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:57:56","name":"Anonymous","sub":"why the fuck are you raiding \/ic\/?","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;the most reddit tier board is legitmately trashing one of the most docile boards<\/span><br>for what fucking purpose? <br>what the fuck did \/ic\/ do to you?","filename":"1477712092549","ext":".png","w":640,"h":423,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1490680676766,"time":1490680676,"md5":"LK5BFcxlVZCk8DV\/VTcg0A==","fsize":342910,"resto":0,"id":"PYvAzvVb","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-the-fuck-are-you-raiding-ic","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":4,"omitted_posts":13,"omitted_images":4},{"no":118620119,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)02:18:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118619987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118619987<\/a><br>post link?","time":1490681914,"resto":118618518,"id":"V+VUBicv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118620129,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)02:18:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118620054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118620054<\/a><br><br>Like I said, what faggoty shit is this","filename":"ayylmao","ext":".jpg","w":758,"h":752,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490681926025,"time":1490681926,"md5":"hp1pdPSTe3HQyinhKNPgAg==","fsize":101868,"resto":118618518,"id":"JXbiL0CN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118620252,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)02:20:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118618518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118618518<\/a><br>Fuck outta here with your reverse psychology","time":1490682020,"resto":118618518,"id":"xZHCwJWl","country":"BO","country_name":"Bolivia"},{"no":118620291,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)02:20:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw spent all my free time since my teens in this website and until now I discover there&#039;s a board for artwork and critique.<\/span><br><br>My attention capabilities are fucking shit.","filename":"images","ext":".jpg","w":196,"h":184,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1490682046930,"time":1490682046,"md5":"DTaqLwJwhYyDdpOtv907Og==","fsize":4712,"resto":118618518,"id":"CCYBRlGo","country":"CO","country_name":"Colombia"},{"no":118620735,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)02:26:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118620291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118620291<\/a><br><br>I have been here since 2003 and I have never once clicked on \/c\/ or \/y\/","time":1490682418,"resto":118618518,"id":"555v7ywI","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118618073,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:52:50","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Reading the Bibble","com":"I&#039;m 18, agnostic, but Jesus seems like a cool dude from what I&#039;ve heard, so I&#039;m deciding to give the bible a read.

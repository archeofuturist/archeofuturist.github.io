That said. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn\u2019t do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. An IQ test has shown me to be in the 99.9th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches; anything further and they\u2019d consider it to be within the margin of error for that test. My mother\u2019s boyfriend of 8 years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of 15, I understand physics better than him, and I owe very little of it to him, as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything, just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. He\u2019s not particularly successful as an engineer, but I\u2019ve met lots of other engineers who aren\u2019t as good as me at physics, so I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s not just a result of him being bad at it. I\u2019m also pretty good at engineering. I don\u2019t have a degree, and other than physics I don\u2019t have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer, but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example, I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were, and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions (my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy; admittedly not the best plan). I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy I\u2019ve come across. Every question of existentialism which I\u2019ve seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven\u2019t been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I\u2019ve considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.","time":1493279103,"resto":123010712,"id":"Dip38GJJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123010964,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)03:46:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123010712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123010712<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fucking mentioning &quot;white privilige&quot;<\/span><br><br>Holy shit Adam, I knew you were a fucking idiot from the start.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;captcha: calle calle<\/span>","time":1493279178,"resto":123010712,"id":"iyG7XgIf","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":123011025,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)03:47:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123010874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123010874<\/a>","filename":"1489213359708","ext":".png","w":361,"h":691,"tn_w":65,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493279223666,"time":1493279223,"md5":"yEIQEqIeA8KniYpC7PHb+g==","fsize":212690,"resto":123010712,"id":"GCJOaech","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123011467,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)03:53:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123011025\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123011025<\/a><br>Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there\u2019s no aspect of psychology which I don\u2019t have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud\u2019s theories. I\u2019m a good enough writer that I\u2019m writing a book and so far everybody who\u2019s read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And that\u2019s not just, like, me and family members, that counts strangers on the Internet. I\u2019ve heard zero negative appraisal of it so far; people have critiqued it, but not insulted it. I don\u2019t know if that will suffice as evidence that I\u2019m intelligent. I\u2019m done with it, though, because I\u2019d rather defend my maturity, since it\u2019s what you\u2019ve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code. I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII, I would be against executing him. In fact, if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasn\u2019t just faking it, I\u2019d even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future, and while your present self should take responsibility for your past self\u2019s actions, it shouldn\u2019t be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment, especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them. I don\u2019t believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices aren\u2019t harming others. I don\u2019t have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever (short of physically acting out necrophilia, pedophilia, or other acts which have a harmful affect on others - but I don\u2019t care what a person\u2019s fantasies consist of, as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them).

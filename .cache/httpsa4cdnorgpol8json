The advent of total war and the total mass mobilization of society had broken down the distinction between civilians and combatants. A &quot;military citizenship&quot; arose in which all citizens were involved with the military in some manner during the war.[5][6] The war had resulted in the rise of a powerful state capable of mobilizing millions of people to serve on the front lines and providing economic production and logistics to support them, as well as having unprecedented authority to intervene in the lives of citizens.[5][6]<br><br>Fascists believe that liberal democracy is obsolete, and they regard the complete mobilization of society under a totalitarian one-party state as necessary to prepare a nation for armed conflict and to respond effectively to economic difficulties.[7] Such a state is led by a strong leader\u2014such as a dictator and a martial government composed of the members of the governing fascist party\u2014to forge national unity and maintain a stable and orderly society.[7] Fascism rejects assertions that violence is automatically negative in nature, and views political violence, war, and imperialism as means that can achieve national rejuvenation.[8][9][10][11] Fascists advocate a mixed economy, with the principal goal of achieving autarky through protectionist and interventionist economic policies.[12]<br><br>Since the end of World War II in 1945, few parties have openly described themselves as fascist, and the term is instead now usually used pejoratively by political opponents. The descriptions neo-fascist or post-fascist are sometimes applied more formally to describe parties of the far right with ideologies similar to, or rooted in, 20th century fascist movements.[13]","time":1492991643,"resto":122445654,"id":"wsEkH\/gn","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122510876,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:54:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122453030\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122453030<\/a><br>Comments aren&#039;t the only thing that&#039;s disabled in that video.","filename":"1481094508608","ext":".png","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492991643604,"time":1492991643,"md5":"efTE9i0IpcRv56XorFFj4Q==","fsize":56213,"resto":122445654,"id":"l7y5BWMo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122506291,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:19:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"what is white culture?","filename":"1369585258","ext":".jpg","w":375,"h":500,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492989557363,"time":1492989557,"md5":"rfOzPN6lQLyLZE42Ubpo1A==","fsize":34887,"resto":0,"id":"llgULldL","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-is-white-culture","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":28,"images":7,"omitted_posts":23,"omitted_images":6},{"no":122510169,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:49:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122509693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122509693<\/a><br><br>Yes, they started the iron age.","time":1492991344,"resto":122506291,"id":"fu8\/7BOA","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122510312,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:50:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122506291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122506291<\/a><br>lynching niggers","time":1492991408,"resto":122506291,"id":"mMqjHm4C","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122510316,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:50:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122507408\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122507408<\/a><br><br>Well you could always go someplace away from white people and white culture and see what`s different.

The core difference between most modern Christianity and Islam is that modern Christianity acknowledges that the bible was written by the hands of men, and the general consensus is it was written around 250 years after Christ. The implication of this is that the bible is fallible - It leaves the onus to decide Right from Wrong on the adherent rather than the script. If you act in good faith, believing you are following the righteous path, you are not an apostate even if you contradict what the Bible says.<br>In Islam by contrast, the Quran is the direct word of God transcribed by Mohammed, therefore implying it&#039;s anything but completely infallible makes you an apostate, and the penalty for apostasy, according to the infallible Quran, is death.<br><br>Any doctrine of Christianity claiming the Bible is infallible should be ignored for the simple reason that the Bible has been translated through multiple different languages before English and therefore DOES contain errors on the behalf of Translators at the very least.","time":1491207546,"resto":119273888,"id":"foWIruVw","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119306485,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)04:15:18","name":"Anonymous","sub":"EUROPE vs

It has predicted all the mistakes of our society, and god sent this to wake us up. Stop being a slave, people.<br>Christianity isn&#039;t what the current church wants to you think it is; read the bible and God even explains that sometimes people who run the church will be corrupt.<br>These words hurt, but it&#039;s true. God doesn&#039;t want you to be a slave in any kind of way. In fact, god punishes the slave masters; but, knowing you&#039;re a slave and not doing anything about it is what Satan wants you to do because that creates more slave masters, and therefore will send you to hell. Satan wins again.<br>Freedom is waiting at the door, but the hallway floor is covered in rusty, shit covered spikes. Between those spikes, there are venomous, hungry snakes. Thea air is swarming with mosquitoes, and wasps. But I know you can see that door, anon.

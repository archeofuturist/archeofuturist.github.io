I&#039;ve been a Christian for many years, surrounded by pro Jew &amp; pro Israel doctrine. The NT delineates between 1) Descendents of 12 Tribes 2) Members of the Jewish religion (which post-gospel portion of NT defines as &quot;anti-Christ&quot; 3) Israel 4) Jerusalem<br><br>NT explains there is a physical Israel &amp; a heavenly one. The heavenly one is what matters &amp; is made up of Christians. It explains that heavenly Jerusalem is the kingdom of God that came to earth &amp; is now made up of believers - it&#039;s the church, made up of Christians globally. NT says a true Jew is one that&#039;s has had &quot;circumcision of the heart,&quot; which is described as conversion to Christianity. Physical circumcision is described as irrelevant from NT perspective.<br><br>So... It seems pretty clear to me that Jews are promoting an anti Christ religion and everywhere I look, they seem to be trying to destabilize the West. What&#039;s the end goal?<br><br>I&#039;ve started to look at their involvement in historical events and am wondering why the 100 million people killed by Communism in the 20th century are not as important as the Holocaust. It seems many more Christians died at the hands of Communists (and still do - North Korea, Middle East, Africa, etc.) than Jews in the Holocaust, yet no one is allowed to move forward from the Holocaust. Yet we, a supposed Christian nation, ignore the mass murderer of Christians.<br><br>Anyway, I&#039;d like the big picture. If you guys can give resources, info, etc. I want to engage on this journey from a analytical perspective, because that&#039;s how I work.","filename":"PicsArt_04-12-01.44.43","ext":".jpg","w":772,"h":1023,"tn_w":188,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492030062400,"time":1492030062,"md5":"Df0jWHY\/Zgvl+ncOFpOBBA==","fsize":130600,"resto":0,"id":"VF8QBEKG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"black-pill-me-on-jews","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0},{"no":120806447,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:49:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120806200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120806200<\/a><br>Read The Culture of Critique by Kevin MacDonald<br>Everything you need to know about them with sources and studies to prove it, 100% fact-based - it&#039;ll ruin your life","time":1492030164,"resto":120806200,"id":"hDTfiyPg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120806574,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:50:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120806200\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120806200<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Black Pill Me on Jews<\/span><br>History teaches us that Jews always win in the end","time":1492030217,"resto":120806200,"id":"rM3rxnO7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120807414,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:56:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"I forgot to say, I stopped going to church because they keep pushing Zionism.

I remember when some of these shits where visiting this prestigious school for hotel management, they learn how to cook there too, keep in mind this is a very good school and graduating form it basically guarantees a nice job and these fucks were complaining that they had to touch and cook with pork, let me give you a compromised version of Austrian cuisine, pork, pork sausages, lot&#039;s of beer, vine and all the liquore imaginable and some more pork + lot&#039;s of desserts who probably also contain pork in some form. Our cuck journalists were slurping their koolaid eagerly of course, thankfully the headmaster of the school told them to fuck off.<br><br>All they have for us is contempt, that&#039;s what gets me the most, they live here, get generous welfare, society fucking bends backwards to cater to their every fucked up need and are the even a bit thankful, no of course not, we are basically dirt to them, if even that. If you ever wonder why some here hate them almost irrationally, remember that this reputation is more than deserved and if anything, their reputation is still to good in the public eye, but don&#039;t you worry, this holy cow of Islam dicksucking will soon end, your brethren here are working hard on their own destruction every day.","time":1491477537,"resto":119722856,"id":"seCu7Qz6","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":119732488,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)07:20:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119722856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119722856<\/a><br>shill thread with image straight from google search<br>sage and hide you scumsucking animals","filename":"1491182710201","ext":".png","w":232,"h":192,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":103,"tim":1491477639526,"time":1491477639,"md5":"DoE+phQTEoEXi55Rlld5Rw==","fsize":105189,"resto":119722856,"id":"eJ6+T74P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119728945,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)06:29:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"if trump is for capitalism and less regulation, why is he against outsourcing ?","filename":"1486187120771","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491474580632,"time":1491474580,"md5":"o4NwH680zGvDHk2+tECnOg==","fsize":753891,"resto":0,"id":"g8K+WFNL","country":"ID","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"if-trump-is-for-capitalism-and-less-regulation","country_name":"Indonesia","replies":12,"images":0,"omitted_posts":7,"omitted_images":0},{"no":119731857,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)07:12:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119730451\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119730451<\/a><br>how are other countries doing that ?<br><br><a href=\"#p119730966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119730966<\/a><br>no, it&#039;s not about profit but justice and fairness. also, it&#039;s the people&#039;s private profit anyway.<br><br><a href=\"#p119731247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119731247<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the economy must serve the nation<\/span><br>no, everything should be fair and just. private companies means private decision making. they don&#039;t work for the country they work for themselves. they don&#039;t carry collective responsibilities. why, america should be the most individualistic country ever, collectivism is very thirdworldly.","time":1491477148,"resto":119728945,"id":"g8K+WFNL","country":"ID","country_name":"Indonesia"},{"no":119732067,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)07:15:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119728945\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119728945<\/a><br>Trump isn&#039;t for unrestrained capitalism, although sometimes he pays lip service to it for the sake of retarded\/bought mainstream republicans.

Somehow we decided 30 years was a good period for study. And it would just so happen that the most current technology we use for this was put into operation some 30 years ago. Using that data, we could note that it is true, global temperatures *have* risen by some .3 degrees in the last 30 years, *on average*.<br><br>The fatal flaw in this method stems from how recently it was introduced. When one looks at the data recorded with our previous most accurate temperature measurement devices (weather balloons), you can notice that in the last 30 years there is a very strong correlation with the weather balloon data and the satellite data we use now. With the knowledge that weather balloons haven&#039;t improved in accuracy to a noticeable degree since its inception, it is safe to say that the modern satellite data would match the data gathered with weather balloons quite similarly.<br><br>Now, with this in mind, looking at past climate data recorded with weather balloons, you&#039;ll notice that from somewhere around the late 50s? the climate has remained somewhat stagnant, apart from this recent incline in temperature over the last 30 years. However, pre-50s you&#039;ll notice that the global temperature was far, far higher than it is today by a degree or some such amount-<br><br>cont.","time":1492360477,"resto":121375351,"id":"Nb33ktfX","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121376294,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)12:22:33","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Yes or nah","com":"So this referendum, what&#039;s good in \/Pol\/ opinion?

I have been posting this in many online boards related to politics, and \/pol\/ is one of them.<br><br>First of all, who am I? I am a businessman from Brazil, and my ancestors were Americans from Dixieland who immigrated to Brazil after the end of the Civil War. Due to my interest for my ancestor\u2019s homeland, every ten years since 1977 I have done a country-wide trip around the United States. I\u2019m about to finish my fifth trip. This might be the last of them, since I\u2019m now 76 years old. Because of this, I would like to ask you a bit of your time so you can hear a few things I learned from my trips, and some advice I have. The United States is too important for me and for the world, and I cannot keep what I have to say for myself.<br><br>To summarize my view: it is clear for me that the cultural and social conditions in the United States have been in decline since 1977, and it seems like you are becoming more and more like Brazil by the day. Of course technology and accessibility have greatly improved and today it is much easier today for me to rent a car or find a flight to a certain city I want to visit.

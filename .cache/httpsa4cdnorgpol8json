The talk was interesting enough, he&#039;s actually optimistic because Trump has inspired a tidal wave of activism and consciousness about the government&#039;s actions, plus apparently print sales are up, but unsurprisingly he insisted that his organization was non-partisan. However, the next day my professor for News Writing 101 said that in a private meeting with the department heads Baquet gave a different story. Evidently, while editorial staff of the paper is making a sincere effort towards objective reporting, the writers, particularly the younger ones who got into the business with justice on the brain, need to be kept on a short leash because they aren&#039;t living up to what he considers proper journalistic standards.<br><br>Thoughts?","filename":"5751ea9d8bc46.image","ext":".jpg","w":723,"h":990,"tn_w":182,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490496435819,"time":1490496435,"md5":"XOAVKChHnURJ+oGjsB283A==","fsize":76326,"resto":0,"id":"tdtWkmHy","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-i-feel-kind-of-bad-sharing-this-with-pol-bc","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118308926,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:36:43","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Flynn statement CNN fake news BTFO LIBS","com":"Just gonna leave this here for the libtards that love riding our dicks.

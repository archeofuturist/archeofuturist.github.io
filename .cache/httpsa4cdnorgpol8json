He wanted England to join with him, as he thought the people of the nation were good. Originally he hoped to win them over to his side and felt he could get the population to join him if he could simply remove the military bureaucracy which he felt was controlling the state. It broke down into the bombing of brittain only after the british bombed non-military targets because they couldn&#039;t distinguish them properly during the nightime assault (and thus Hitler stopped attacking the british military and focused on bombing london and other heavily populated areas in retaliation, costing him the war really as his assault on the military was working and had through attrition almost wiped out the majority of the air forces, but by changing targets to the cities, he let the air force repair\/rebuild and train the massive amount of new recruits which joined due to the attacks).<br><br>This by no means is a way that I endorse him and what he did. Hitler was a very flawed man with some of the worst ideas, and using the most dangerous tactics to get his way and keep his power. In some ways, very similar to the message Trump uses, placing blame for all the country&#039;s problems on foreigners (illegals crossing the borders, bad trade deals, bad military protection treaties, they are taking our jobs, etc.,) which is exactly the same tactics that Hitler used (just replace foreigners\/illegals with Jews\/Gypsies\/Slavs).","time":1493875666,"resto":124022017,"id":"tzeC\/Ui2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124025087,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:33:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124022017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124022017<\/a><br>He was also right about jews","time":1493876009,"resto":124022017,"id":"vwY7H\/OQ","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124024796,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:30:51","name":"Anonymous","sub":"We need a new ideology, a mix of Nationalism and Libertarianism.","filename":"NAM-P1","ext":".jpg","w":525,"h":1111,"tn_w":118,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493875851562,"time":1493875851,"md5":"C14S1OCuSdumT70Ja6vo4A==","fsize":114333,"resto":0,"id":"A9gPXh4t","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-need-a-new-ideology-a-mix-of-nationalism-and","country_name":"Australia","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":124025075,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:33:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124024796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124024796<\/a><br>Why not just call yourself a national libertarian?

In addition to Aristophanes&#039; political and social satire, Assemblywomen derives its comedy through sexual and scatological humor. It is important to note that the play&#039;s central concepts of women in government and communism were not legitimate suggestions from Aristophanes, but rather an outlandish premise that aimed to criticize the Athenian government at the time.<\/span>","time":1492621969,"resto":121865206,"id":"vyFTaHX5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121867453,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)13:16:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121867033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121867033<\/a><br>Dunno why I said Romans, it overlaps with the Roman empire but I meant to say Greeks.","time":1492622206,"resto":121865206,"id":"vyFTaHX5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121867828,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)13:20:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121867453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121867453<\/a><br>The Romans were smart enough also not to allow women to vote","time":1492622427,"resto":121865206,"id":"zm6nAAxh","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121861321,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:22:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;obama out-manspreads trump<\/span><br><br>What does this mean?","filename":"IMG_0936","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":531,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":209,"tim":1492618920295,"time":1492618920,"md5":"TfTSLZVcHooh7ZfdG4ZB3Q==","fsize":110738,"resto":0,"id":"bbk9c0vd","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"obama-outmanspreads-trump","country_name":"United States","replies":42,"images":9,"omitted_posts":37,"omitted_images":8},{"no":121866419,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)13:06:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121864837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121864837<\/a><br>NEW FAG","time":1492621610,"resto":121861321,"id":"W6fmyG9T","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121866493,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)13:07:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121865007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121865007<\/a><br>absolutely horrible","filename":"1458256241583","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":960,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492621658347,"time":1492621658,"md5":"syBP\/dWLXRny0yz8ghzQow==","fsize":158525,"resto":121861321,"id":"uwE7ZMnj","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121866750,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)13:10:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121861946\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121861946<\/a><br>Only True Answer","time":1492621818,"resto":121861321,"id":"g4++o5ZJ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121867499,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)13:17:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121861576\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121861576<\/a><br>finally, a truthful leafpost<br>it&#039;s heels off the ground, feet pointing inwards, head looking down and with a hunched back.<br>remember, you will never get a six-pack if you use your legs instead of your back to squat","time":1492622236,"resto":121861321,"id":"C5V7YW5Z","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121867805,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)13:20:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121861321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121861321<\/a><br>Obama is a stupid faggot, Trump has a girthy 9 inch erect cock","filename":"cia","ext":".png","w":1073,"h":268,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":31,"tim":1492622414819,"time":1492622414,"md5":"q+P+Z806QjXgrrphoMx\/0w==","fsize":304381,"resto":121861321,"id":"nzKOXm6D","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121866211,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)13:04:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Would a Technocracy be a good governing system?","filename":"Faction-Technocracy","ext":".png","w":500,"h":464,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":232,"tim":1492621489649,"time":1492621489,"md5":"Y+Mx3hHIKhO+q1gCreBzAQ==","fsize":31147,"resto":0,"id":"9JjNbwgI","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"would-a-technocracy-be-a-good-governing-system","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":4,"images":1},{"no":121867272,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)13:14:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"Unless the governing system is primitivist or just anti-tech advancement, every other system will end up being a technocracy.

The Orbital Ring goes to low earth orbit, so it does not need advanced materials.<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0qe<wbr>zLhypA0Y<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Orbit<wbr>al_ring<br>http:\/\/www.orionsarm.com\/fm_store\/O<wbr>rbitalRings-I.pdf<br><br>Why build the Orbital Ring? It would cut our costs of going to orbit from about $2000\/kg to about $1\/kg. There are individual asteroids that have tens of trillions of dollars in materials on them that could be mined. One mission could easily pay for the cost of building the Orbital Ring.<br><br>We could then deploy solar power satellites in orbit above cloud cover and return the power back to the surface with near zero loss by running power transmission cables down the elevator, and sell the power at a profit.<br><br>With increased luminosity in space, enhanced exposure time, and the ability to deliver base loads, solar panels pay for themselves in only 1-2 years while having a 20 year life time.<br><br>In other words, if you put $5 trillion of solar panels into space, you get your $5 trillion back by the end of year two and a $5 trillion income stream each year thereafter.<br><br>In other words, the US could cut everyone&#039;s taxes, both personal and business, income, capital, death, or otherwise, all to 0%, not even cut any benefits or current spending, and pay off the national debt within a decade.","filename":"2","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1024,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":160,"tim":1492610895179,"time":1492610895,"md5":"TVeL4IRFi0+3f2x6pKxmlA==","fsize":262121,"resto":0,"id":"S2NM2THK","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-need-you-to-join-the-space-elevator-party","country_name":"United States","replies":59,"images":18,"omitted_posts":54,"omitted_images":16},{"no":121865308,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:56:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"where would we build it?","time":1492621013,"resto":121847417,"id":"mV2JM1kj","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121867099,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)13:13:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121865308\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121865308<\/a><br>You can pretty much build it everywhere.

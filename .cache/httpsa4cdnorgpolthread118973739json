All amateur balloon, rocket, plane and drone footage show a completely flat horizon over 20+ miles high. Only NASA and other government \u201cspace agencies\u201d show curvature in their fake CGI photos\/videos.<br> 2) The horizon always rises to the eye level of the observer as altitude is gained, so you never have to look down to see it. If Earth were in fact a globe, no matter how large, as you ascended the horizon would stay fixed and the observer \/ camera would have to tilt looking down further and further to see it.<br> 3) The natural physics of water is to find and maintain its level. If Earth were a giant sphere tilted, wobbling and hurdling through infinite space then truly flat, consistently level surfaces would not exist here. But since Earth is in fact an extended flat plane, this fundamental physical property of fluids finding and remaining level is consistent with experience and common sense.<br>4) Rivers run down to sea-level finding the easiest course, North, South, East, West and all other intermediary directions over the Earth at the same time. If Earth were truly a spinning ball then many of these rivers would be impossibly flowing uphill, for example the Mississippi in its 3000 miles would have to ascend 11 miles before reaching the Gulf of Mexico.<br><br>5) One portion of the Nile River flows for a thousand miles with a fall of only one foot. Parts of the West African Congo, according to the supposed inclination and movement of the ball-Earth, would be sometimes running uphill and sometimes down. This would also be the case for the Parana, Paraguay and other long rivers.","time":1490913282,"resto":118973739,"id":"OhGpp7Mg","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":118979414,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)18:34:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"REEEEE CLEAN THE CAMERA","time":1490913283,"resto":118973739,"id":"7tqQW0AD","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118979424,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)18:34:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118979243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118979243<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;I still love you&quot; twice<\/span><br>word. we love twice here.","filename":"1489486254813","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":477,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1490913287304,"time":1490913287,"md5":"wua+JY8DBkB+cNqtqmkhHw==","fsize":209336,"resto":118973739,"id":"3yMxHz04","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118979443,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)18:34:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"QUESTION<br><br>Would you or would you not agree to live in a space colony on the moon for a minimum of 10 years? <br><br>Follow up QUESTION<br><br>Would you or would you not agree to live in a communist space colony on the moon for a minimum of 10 years?","filename":"dwight_question","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1490913296235,"time":1490913296,"md5":"Z3+f3lF8fP+NXOdBs+D2oA==","fsize":106872,"resto":118973739,"id":"Pi8x0Jry","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118979469,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)18:35:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118979424\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118979424<\/a><br>3 times now.

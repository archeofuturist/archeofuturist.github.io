Whatever the reasons may be, I honestly don\u2019t see why it matters. Here\u2019s why. Let\u2019s take whites and blacks as an example. Whites are on average more intelligent by a very significant margin. But there are smart blacks, and there are stupid whites. We should have a society where we accept the smart, of all kinds, and reject the stupid, of all kinds. And before you give me shit for this, keep in mind that probably one of the major reasons for white intelligence is that we didn\u2019t coddle the weak, if someone couldn\u2019t cut it they were cast off, societal benefit on the basis of race is dysgenic.","filename":"iq_by_country","ext":".png","w":1357,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":147,"tim":1491788635745,"time":1491788635,"md5":"0MZfbPQ+gTq\/cMYa1vP2CA==","fsize":28415,"resto":0,"id":"0yazLgEG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"heres-what-i-dont-get-about-ethnonationalism","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120373184,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:49:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120372512\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120372512<\/a><br><br>I dont get it either, but if you look at it most people (even the supposedly intelligent ones) arent very intelligent to begin with, so yeah, your idea sounds very rational but being rational is not a very common trait, most people are fighting due to the teachings of schizophrenics and emo kids from the neolithic, think about it.","time":1491788973,"resto":120372512,"id":"h3cu\/fQn","country":"CO","country_name":"Colombia"}]}

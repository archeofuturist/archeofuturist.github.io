We have translated everything from German.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;I was twelve in 1945.&quot; said Elsa Schneider, 84. &quot;We knew the Russians were coming from the East. I don&#039;t really know when precisely people realized we were going to lose, but all of that air of power and purpose just disappeared. I remember people openly talking about how we should surrender.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;I had two male friends, both eleven. Hans and Lucas. Hans listened to his grandfather and was terrified of the Russians. One day, my bicycle was gone. I later learned that he&#039;d stolen it and went west to surrender to the Americans. Lucas thought that the Russians couldn&#039;t be as monstrous as Hitler said, and didn&#039;t run. He was shot in the streets along with his mother.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;When the Russians arrived, they were merciless. Evil and cruel. They raped and pillaged everything, and murdered any man who looked at them wrong.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;There was a field just outside of Berlin. I played there as a little girl, but after 1945 we called it the Rape Field. The Russians would take any woman or girl they wanted, dragged her there, and did whatever they wanted. I saw little girls and old ladies get raped. Mrs. Weber, she was as old then as I am now, was literally raped to death. Then when they were done, the Russians would release you back into the city, sometimes.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;One day, some Americans heard about the field. I don&#039;t know how. They arrived in a truck and started screaming at the Russians. I don&#039;t speak English, but I could tell they wanted us released. I thought &#039;at last! We&#039;re saved! Thank God for America! They aren&#039;t savage like these Russians!&#039; Then the Russians screamed back in their dog tongue and fired into the air, and the Americans got scared and drove away. The rapes were extra bad that day after that.&quot;<\/span>","filename":"Elsa","ext":".jpg","w":625,"h":564,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":225,"tim":1490574201652,"time":1490574201,"md5":"cR8Nngr6+vMYwpmQIKDfAw==","fsize":252693,"resto":0,"id":"6Nz9DHc+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-are-russians-so-bad","country_name":"United States","replies":15,"images":2,"unique_ips":14},{"no":118445303,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)20:37:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118443489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118443489<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the Russians screamed back in their dog tongue<\/span><br>They got off easy.

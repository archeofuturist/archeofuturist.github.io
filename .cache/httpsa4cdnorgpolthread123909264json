Basically this is blackmail and totally undemocratic, but as always Macedonians are willing to accommodate their Albanian minority. The second largest party, SDSM (49 seats) announced that they accept the platform and having formed a coalition of 67 seats together with the Albanian Parties they went to the President to get the Mandate to form a Government. However the President refused it on the basis that the Platform is illegal, it breaks international law and that its damaging to the sovereignty of the country, something he swore on inaugural day to protect. So he advised for holding another elections to sort this whole thing out. SDSM has the option to take this to a Constitutional court to overrule the President&#039;s decision, however since they themselves know that it will not pass in the court because it simply goes against the constitution and the sovereignty of the country, they are refusing to have another election. So SDSM along with the Albanian parties are creating the crisis, they have a legal way of getting out of this situation by either holding another election cycle or simply taking the President to Constitutional court, but simply refuse to do it, claiming they have a majority for Government Mandate, refusing to acknowledge the fact that their voters didnt vote for Tirana platform.","time":1493819417,"resto":123909264,"id":"rVDsNXN0","country":"MK","country_name":"Macedonia"},{"no":123913744,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)09:50:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123913645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123913645<\/a><br>if Texas tried to secede from the US unilaterally then the US would invade Texas","time":1493819435,"resto":123909264,"id":"exhIJn+T","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":123913765,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)09:50:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123913659\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123913659<\/a><br>They fucked you in Kosovo for decades.

That is a clear signal that half their voters dont accept the Tirana platform.<br>Another problem is that in the last 2 years there were alot of financial scandals surrounding some high members of VMRO. Corruption is undeniably high in Macedonia, somewhat less so than in Bulgaria, Albania or Kosovo for instance, but still on a high level. When SDSM had the rule, they had equal if not higher number of scandals, so thats not something only VMRO is guilty of. I&#039;d argue corruption is high even in developed democracies (just look at Germany prior to Merkel and now France, Italy, Spain etc), but that&#039;s besides the point.<br>SDSM&#039;s narrative now is that the President along with the 250k people protesting on the streets are protecting VMRO from going to court over these scandals and that VMRO is creating the crisis. Which couldn&#039;t be further from the truth, since the ex prime minister and leader of VMRO, accepted to let SDSM take the Government Mandate, that VMRO with its 51 seats will support SDSM for any legislation they want to pass in the Parliement in the next 4 years, he even agreed to be held responsible for all the scandals, that he will accept to be taken to court and prosecuted as long as SDSM rejects the Tirana Platform.","time":1493819474,"resto":123909264,"id":"rVDsNXN0","country":"MK","country_name":"Macedonia"},{"no":123913809,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)09:51:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123913596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123913596<\/a><br>Fair call.

We have also discovered a great many verbal forms that are now obsolete or have been lost through restructuring \u2014 until now, these forms have barely even been recognized or, at best, have been classified incorrectly.&quot; These verbal forms are crucial to explaining the linguistic history of Albanian and its internal usage. However, they can also shed light on the reciprocal relationship between Albanian and its neighbouring languages. The researchers are following various leads which suggest that Albanian played a key role in the Balkan Sprachbund. For example, it is likely that Albanian is the source of the suffixed definite article in Romanian, Bulgarian and Macedonian, as this has been a feature of Albanian since ancient times&quot;","time":1493819989,"resto":123909264,"id":"Zqw3Amrs","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":123914602,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)10:00:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123914342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123914342<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bulgaria is more muslim than France.<\/span><br><br>Stopped reading right there.

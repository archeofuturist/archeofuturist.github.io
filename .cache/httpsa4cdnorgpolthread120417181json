The Law of Return in Isael says every Jew has the right to come to Israel. I get stopped at Ben Gurion airport passport control and this guy interviews me. He asks why I want to come to Israel, tells me he is wearing a mask in our interview and that he&#039;s been coming to the US to have sex with me disguised as a woman named Darlene. He asks me to show him that I&#039;m circumsized and then when I show him he exclaims that it&#039;s not my dick and I get denied entry. The Law of Return is literally Israel&#039;s only thing even comes close to an legitimate justification for its existence. Anyway, they guy I&#039;m talking about looked almost exactly like pic related. Pic related is the Egypt bomber supposedly.","filename":"CaptureAndInterrogate","ext":".png","w":341,"h":328,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":240,"tim":1491815674522,"time":1491815674,"md5":"L\/3p84CVDHHj1WlWq4mm4Q==","fsize":216028,"resto":0,"id":"TDuNIQLD","country":"PA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-went-to-israel-recently-to-exercise-my-right-of","country_name":"Panama","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

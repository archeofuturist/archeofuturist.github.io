Your browsing history, your location, data usage, all identifying information, etc, is going to be sold by your ISP to whoever has the cash. Guess who has the cash? Shills are going to have more ammunition than ever, and groups like SPLC, ADL, etc, are going to have accurate information on each and every one of you. <br><br>And what happens when they deregulate it even further and allow for the collection and sale of all data sent over American ISP networks? But, no, that could never happen because we value the incorruptible spirit of the law and the jurisprudence and subsequent proper interpretation of the law that follows. Just like the 2nd amendment would never be overtly twisted, or the 4th, or, surely, the 14th would never be twisted in such a way to allow foreign invaders&#039; children the right of citizenship despite historical jurisprudence blatantly telling us what the original intent of the amendment was. Right?<br><br>Trust is for cucks. Do something. Write to Trump, tweet to him, email his office.

According to the Arab chronicler Ibn al-Athir, David sent a small detachment of his men in order to simulate negotiation. Other accounts speak of a hundred supposed deserters requesting an audience with the Seljuq commander. Meanwhile, the Georgians successfully managed to deploy a large portion of their force where they would almost encircle the enemy in a pincer movement. Their opponents remained unaware of such activities. Upon approaching the Seljuq leaders, the deserters or diplomatic group unveiled their real intentions by suddenly attacking and killing every Seljuq commander in sight and others who were attending the meeting. While this was going on David ordered a frontal attack on the enemy vanguard with his crusader cavalry which not only devastated the enemy&#039;s forward lines but also entangled the Seljuq archers in close combat, effectively taking out a crucial component of Ilghazi&#039;s force.","filename":"800px-Didgori_Monument_(Swords)","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":1200,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491656786235,"time":1491656786,"md5":"1IK87GHeAI08bhhBVnUwbQ==","fsize":275819,"resto":120126627,"id":"zvN8FgGl","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120129975,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:15:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120126627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120126627<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw no qt Turkish wife<\/span>","filename":"IMG_0155","ext":".jpg","w":515,"h":600,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491657316550,"time":1491657316,"md5":"Ku\/WEjkfI5DSRzpRItW72g==","fsize":34305,"resto":120126627,"id":"z37TDdXQ","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120130483,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:20:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120126627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120126627<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;turkish supremacy<\/span><br>fucking kek","filename":"roaches","ext":".jpg","w":1300,"h":1191,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1491657646466,"time":1491657646,"md5":"SwST3od2EM7Sb7LZTOFxDQ==","fsize":161754,"resto":120126627,"id":"MmoeEBJL","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120130964,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)09:26:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120130483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120130483<\/a><br>Ottoman Empire = Roman Empire","time":1491657960,"resto":120126627,"id":"AR5jD1P2","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"}]}

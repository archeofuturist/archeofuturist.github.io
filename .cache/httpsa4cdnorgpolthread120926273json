It\u2019s my observation that those who believe the Bible or any religious text is 100% the \u201cWord of God\u201d are reasoning from programmed and unquestioned root assumptions and flawed logic.

Instead of inventing a totally non-existent character of Jesus Christ and selling that product to the masses, it makes more sense that the authorities would consolidate already existing paradigms into a single system. The purpose of such a system would be to portray these authorities as divinely sanctioned.<br><br>Assimilated paradigms included Mithraism, Greek Neo-Platonism, and Judaism. For instance, the solar\/zodiacal elements in Christianity came from Mithraism and related pagan systems. But these are just auxiliary additions, not the core nucleus of Christianity. The nucleus is the original Christian system, which existed alongside the other elements prior to their combined assimilation into an organized religion.<br>All of these elements were then glued together by the authors of the New Testament, who added various rationalizations, logical sleights of hand, fabricated backstory, and gaudy superstitious elements to create a belief system that would appeal to the widest audience. The Gospels of Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John were variations of the same story further customized for Greek, Jewish, and Roman audiences.<br>Thus the New Testament is a patchwork of truth and lies.<br><br>The original pre-assimilation Christianity is buried in there somewhere. How can it be found?

For instance, Jesus healing a blind man by mixing spit with mud and putting it on his eyes. Such an act possesses an internal logic that escaped the authors, but is logical to anyone who understands etheric energy and its role in healing. There are elements in both the Old and New Testament that are too obtuse, mysterious, or inexplicable to the audience to serve a persuasive function. Fabricators write to ensnare the widest audience, meaning everything they write is done with design, purpose, and intent, so as to be loud and clear for the intended target.

That can only be because they were attempting to hijack an already existing burgeoning movement whose contents they could not suppress and instead had to absorb.<br><br>And as it turns out, the only elements in the New Testament that subvert or fail to validate the Church\/State are the aforementioned sayings and parables of Jesus, the Sermon on the Mount, and the healing\/exorcism examples, which scholars have determined are the oldest and thus most original parts of the New Testament. Everything else, including Jesus being born of a virgin, dying for our sins, being the only begotten son of God, the Twelve Apostles and betrayal by Judas, perhaps even the story of crucifixion and resurrection, etc\u2026 serve the negative agenda in some way, or else are derivations of Mithraic\/Pagan\/Occult symbolism added on after the fact.<br>It\u2019s unfortunate that what defines the modern fundamentalist Christian mindset is belief in precisely these artificial, deviatory, ultimately un-Christian elements, often to the ignorance of the true portions.

Whether Jesus Christ or Santa Claus, something with a historical basis passed over into oral tradition and folklore.<br><br>What can be said from all the above, is that there once existed a mystic, a sage, a spiritual rebel, who performed healings, taught a certain system of spirituality, and gave prophetic knowledge about the origins and fate of the world. He left behind a legacy that propagated through folklore and secret oral transmission. A cult grew up around this figure and his legacy began to snowball. Within a half century it was co-opted into serving as the nucleus of an engineered religion, and the rest is history.","time":1492104962,"resto":120926273,"id":"itGcgeD2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120935993,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)13:36:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120930666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120930666<\/a><br>It is true, read any historical text about Jesus the man.

Scholars have given these a name: the \u201cQ\u201d source (Q for Quelle, \u201csource\u201d, thus a generic title) which is a hypothesized document containing the original sayings of Jesus. Of course it\u2019s ridiculous to think it had to be a document since it could just as well have been a secret oral tradition. In any case, the closest thing we have to the \u201cQ\u201d source is the Gospel of Thomas, which is a collection of the purported sayings of Jesus. There is some dispute over when it was written. Even if written later, the content indicates it is a setting down of an older oral tradition.<br><br>Over 80% of the Gospel of Thomas can be found distributed throughout the New Testament, but padded and deviated with the aforementioned artifices. The GOT contains all the meat and none of the dressing found in the New Testament. It is fundamentally subversive to the religious power structure, and it is of Gnostic disposition, including the 80% that are in the Bible. Thus the New Testament contains a Gnostic nucleus. The rest contains a mix of genuine wisdom from other sources and corruption with malicious intent.<br><br>The historical context and timing of these teachings, as well as their spiritual content and direction, says something about the role of the original Jesus Christ. It\u2019s very similar to the role of other avatars such as Buddha. My proposition is Jesus was an advanced soul who incarnated as a human in order to become a living vessel for a higher divine intelligence. There is a difference between Jesus the man and Christ the higher consciousness that became active in him, and can become active in us. The end goal of his legacy was for each of us to do likewise, and that is the basis of Gnostic belief. It was his intent that we follow in his example and succeed him, whereas the corrupted version of Christianity demands we remain in his shadow on our knees.","time":1492105037,"resto":120926273,"id":"itGcgeD2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120936137,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)13:37:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120935714\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120935714<\/a><br><br>There&#039;s power in the Word of God.<br>There&#039;s power in the name of Jesus.<br>There&#039;s power in the Holy Spirit to change lives.<br><br>There is only one hope of redemption for any man, and that is to bend the knee to the King of Kings, confess he is Lord, and believe in your heart God raised him from the dead.

In contrast, the dogma of the Church was set in stone and provided utter dependability for the uncertain of faith, thus making it the word of God on the grounds that God speaks consistently. But this defense of Church dogma over its immutability is a logical fallacy. A fixed Lie is worse than an evolving view of Truth.

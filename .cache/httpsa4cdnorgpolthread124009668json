Anyway, here&#039;s some Proclus (~400 AD):<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Indeed, Socrates in the (First) Alcibiades rightly observes, that the soul entering into herself will behold all other things, and deity itself. For verging to her own union, and to the centre of all life, laying aside multitude, and the variety of the all manifold powers which she contains, she ascends to the highest watch-tower offerings. And as in the most holy of the mysteries, they say, that the mystics at first meet with the multi form, and many-shaped genera, which are hurled forth before the gods, but on entering the temple, unmoved, and guarded by the mystic rites, they genuinely receive in their bosom divine illumination, and divested of their garments, as they would say, participate of a divine nature; the same mode, as it appears to me, takes place in the speculation of wholes. For the soul when looking at things posterior to herself, beholds the shadows and images of beings, but when she converts herself to herself she evolves her own essence, and the reasons which she contains. And at first indeed, she only as it were beholds herself; but, when she penetrates more profoundly into the knowledge of herself, she finds in herself both intellect, and the orders of beings. When however, she proceeds into her interior recesses, and into the adytum as it were of the soul, she perceives with her eye closed, the genus of the gods, and the unities of beings. For all things are in us psychically, and through this we are naturally capable of knowing all things, by exciting the powers and the images of wholes which we contain.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tl;dr Introspection gives us the ability to understand the symbolism of divine matters<\/span>","time":1493876741,"resto":124009668,"id":"AKyz3NkV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124026231,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:46:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124026024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124026024<\/a><br><br>So, wait, you want to lose Christianity, the one real moral driver of the west, and return to paganism because of degeneracy?<br><br>Paganism such as <br><br>Greco\/roman paganism: summary execution, enslavement, rampant homosexuality, rape of slaves by animals for amusement<br><br>Viking: sold whites to arabs as slaves, women could have multiple husbands (literally cucks), execution of slaves when masters died, killing for amusement<br><br>Druids: human sacrifice, slavery, constantly at war with neighbouring tribes<br><br>Are you literally retarded?

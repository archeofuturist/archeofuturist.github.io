Anyway, here&#039;s some Proclus (~400 AD):<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Indeed, Socrates in the (First) Alcibiades rightly observes, that the soul entering into herself will behold all other things, and deity itself. For verging to her own union, and to the centre of all life, laying aside multitude, and the variety of the all manifold powers which she contains, she ascends to the highest watch-tower offerings. And as in the most holy of the mysteries, they say, that the mystics at first meet with the multi form, and many-shaped genera, which are hurled forth before the gods, but on entering the temple, unmoved, and guarded by the mystic rites, they genuinely receive in their bosom divine illumination, and divested of their garments, as they would say, participate of a divine nature; the same mode, as it appears to me, takes place in the speculation of wholes. For the soul when looking at things posterior to herself, beholds the shadows and images of beings, but when she converts herself to herself she evolves her own essence, and the reasons which she contains. And at first indeed, she only as it were beholds herself; but, when she penetrates more profoundly into the knowledge of herself, she finds in herself both intellect, and the orders of beings. When however, she proceeds into her interior recesses, and into the adytum as it were of the soul, she perceives with her eye closed, the genus of the gods, and the unities of beings. For all things are in us psychically, and through this we are naturally capable of knowing all things, by exciting the powers and the images of wholes which we contain.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tl;dr Introspection gives us the ability to understand the symbolism of divine matters<\/span>","time":1493876741,"resto":124009668,"id":"AKyz3NkV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124026231,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:46:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124026024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124026024<\/a><br><br>So, wait, you want to lose Christianity, the one real moral driver of the west, and return to paganism because of degeneracy?<br><br>Paganism such as <br><br>Greco\/roman paganism: summary execution, enslavement, rampant homosexuality, rape of slaves by animals for amusement<br><br>Viking: sold whites to arabs as slaves, women could have multiple husbands (literally cucks), execution of slaves when masters died, killing for amusement<br><br>Druids: human sacrifice, slavery, constantly at war with neighbouring tribes<br><br>Are you literally retarded?

Under pagan Rome, Jews enjoyed full citizen rights, as in most of the pagan world, including Greece, Syria, etc. However, once Christianity became a political power, around the 4-5th centuries, Rome made it illegal for Christian citizens to practice Jewish customs, and even turned many pagan practices into Christian traditions.<br><br>By the turn of the 11th century, most European nations were already Christian and totally different from rabbinic or Talmudic Judaism. In fact, no christian nation has ever historically adapted anything from Judaism. (Which is why I use the term Christian values, not Judeo-Christian, as that never existed). There was no commonality in the practice of these two religions. Even the interpretation of biblical laws were different. In fact, even Jesus himself condemned the Jews of his day and all their unbiblical or extrabiblical laws. Jesus was one of the biggest opponents of &quot;Jews&quot;, which is why they passionately hated him.<br><br>By the 16th century, many European countries already had a history of expelling Jews or making them pay extra fines\/taxes to live there. Most Jews didn&#039;t enjoy full citizenship rights either.<br><br>The only reason why &quot;Jews&quot; have been able to get such power, wealth, etc, in these recent past centuries is because they hate Christians. Their whole purpose of gaining global power and influence is to destroy Christianity and Christendom (the Western world), or White people, who are the ones who spread Christianity to other peoples.<br><br>Jews were able to live with pagans because they mutually did not pose a threat to each other. They stayed separate for the most part, e.g. kept to themselves (in designated communities, e.g. Greece, Syria, etc). When Christianity came to the forefront, the world was turned upside down, and Christianity gained the most influence in every aspect of life. This turned certain &quot;Jews&quot; in power to become anti-christ, just as when Jesus himself came.","time":1493879403,"resto":124009668,"id":"JKih+xi4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124030138,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:30:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124009668\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124009668<\/a><br>Shall I hail Jupiter now?","time":1493879410,"resto":124009668,"id":"Yo6I5Mfy","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":124030146,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:30:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124028577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124028577<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sweden <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;didn&#039;t raid anyone <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;just traded their women for gold and made up stories about being killers<\/span>","time":1493879418,"resto":124009668,"id":"og3J4Kmp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124030196,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:30:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124010802\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124010802<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;WE IZ MASTUR RACE<\/span><br><br>Can&#039;t argue with that, tusken raider","time":1493879453,"resto":124009668,"id":"cFG9kr0w","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":124030287,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:32:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124028128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124028128<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;LARPagan surprised that a gay kike is writing about a gay religion. <\/span><br><br>Kek","filename":"IMG_3049","ext":".png","w":500,"h":565,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493879523546,"time":1493879523,"md5":"p50WfErrHUcn7WIpKVWbqA==","fsize":124489,"resto":124009668,"id":"JKih+xi4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124030327,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:32:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124029008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124029008<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jew strategy is centered on co-opting movements <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this is the for everything except Christianity which is a purely Jewish plot<\/span><br>You know Christ was killed by Jews .","time":1493879554,"resto":124009668,"id":"og3J4Kmp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124030451,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:34:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124009668\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124009668<\/a><br>I already am, Maybe not practicing, but definietly cultural.<br><a href=\"#p124010091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124010091<\/a><br>Agreed, I don&#039;t like Christianity too.","time":1493879640,"resto":124009668,"id":"PsKtv6GD","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":124030633,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:36:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124030125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124030125<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;By the turn of the 11th century, most European nations were already Christian and totally different from rabbinic or Talmudic Judaism.

There was no commonality in the practice of these two religions. Even the interpretation of biblical laws were different. In fact, even Jesus himself condemned the Jews of his day and all their unbiblical or extrabiblical laws.

The taxes they paid before was to prevent them from becoming upper class, but at the turn of the industrial revolution that changes.","filename":"51mCsTdYL2L._SX331_BO1,204,203,200_","ext":".jpg","w":333,"h":499,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493879785027,"time":1493879785,"md5":"bwZu8i5ptTjHGiTtUNasEw==","fsize":42690,"resto":124009668,"id":"RoJeHzFr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124030721,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:37:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;christians think they are so authentic<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;swearing, masturbating, eating forbidden foods, wearing forbidden fabrics, picking out their favourite parts of their books <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;following a paganized christianity <\/span><br>Stop LARPING christcucks","time":1493879839,"resto":124009668,"id":"apXx602+","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124030751,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:37:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124030287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124030287<\/a><br>You realize that the ancient pagans are infamous for throwing gays, murderous, and deviant people in bogs, right?","filename":"bog","ext":".jpg","w":275,"h":183,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493879864595,"time":1493879864,"md5":"zadZ5s43o4RJtp3vpixkkQ==","fsize":9867,"resto":124009668,"id":"RoJeHzFr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124030847,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:38:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124029358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124029358<\/a><br>admittedly perhaps not the best example. but it&#039;s not like real white people actually believe in christianity unless they are double digit IQ","time":1493879938,"resto":124009668,"id":"apXx602+","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124030914,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:39:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124030751\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124030751<\/a><br>They are too dense to realize that Paganism is not one religion. but an all-encompassing term.","time":1493879987,"resto":124009668,"id":"PsKtv6GD","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":124030945,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:40:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124009668\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124009668<\/a><br>Varg is a meme","time":1493880007,"resto":124009668,"id":"ze+5CFl\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124030977,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:40:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124030721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124030721<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;eating forbidden foods, wearing forbidden fabrics<\/span><br><br>Beyond the Ten Commandments, Christians are not bound to the Mosaic Laws of Deuteronomy and Leviticus because of the New Covenant.

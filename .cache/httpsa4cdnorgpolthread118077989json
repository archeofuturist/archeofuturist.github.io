Texas a&amp;m is one of the most conservative public schools in the US. When I was a freshman the lgbtbbqwtf group had a &quot;wear jeans if you&#039;re gay&quot; day during &quot;coming out week.&quot; The idea was that everyone would wear jeans and the point would be made that gays are just like everyone else. That day came and all you saw on campus were khakis. Literally only the faggots wore jeans and people who forgot. We made fun of those people hard. This was back in &#039;99, but it&#039;s still conservative.

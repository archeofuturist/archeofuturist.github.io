In 2005 I received a CAREER award from the National Science Foundation to support this work, which includes developing, implementing, and assessing curricular and pedagogical innovations based on liberative pedagogies and student input at Smith, and understanding how students at Smith conceptualize their identities as engineers. I seek as an engineering educator to be part of a paradigm shift that these pedagogies demand, repositioning concerns about diversity in science and engineering from superficial measures of equity as headcounts, to addressing justice and the genuine engagement of all students as core educational challenges. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I seek to revise engineering curricula to be relevant to a fuller range of student experiences and career destinations, integrating concerns related to public policy, professional ethics and social responsibility; (((de-centering Western civilization))); and (((uncovering contributions of women and other underrepresented groups.)))<\/span><br><br>*continued*","filename":"angry-pepe","ext":".jpg","w":236,"h":236,"tn_w":236,"tn_h":236,"tim":1492444503082,"time":1492444503,"md5":"gsubxGLR+SHdpV3lgXOmHQ==","fsize":7611,"resto":0,"id":"odZXNWxf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"and-thus-the-era-of-stem-begins-to-close","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":2,"unique_ips":8},{"no":121541188,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:56:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121540984\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121540984<\/a><br>wew compsci classes just went from bad, to really really bad.<br><br>I was with kids who couldnt pass a test on strings and integers, lets not lower the bar even further.<br><br>All that is going to do is hurt pay for those who are skilled.","time":1492444608,"resto":121540984,"id":"mjUSadp6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121541215,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:57:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;In EGR 330 (Engineering and Global Development), we critically evaluate past and current trends in appropriate and sustainable technology.

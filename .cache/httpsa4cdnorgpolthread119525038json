Most importantly, the Su-22\u2019s bombs are unique and cannot be filled with any chemical substances, which is different than bombs dropped from attack helicopters. Yuseef was then told that the Syrian Air Force did not know there were any chemical substances inside the missile factory in Khan Sheikhoun. It remains to be known whether there actually were chemicals in the missile factory targeted by the airstrikes, or whether the terrorist forces used gas on the kidnapped civilians from the pro-government towns and brought them in the lorry trucks to the site of the airstrikes. Whether they were gassed by the militant forces, or the airstrikes caused a chemical weapon factory to explode, the gruesome deaths of children, seen foaming in the mouth because of the gas, lays in the hands of the terrorists.<\/span>","time":1491348805,"resto":119525038,"country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119534496,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:34:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119533854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119533854<\/a><br>they said they didnt used chemical weapons.<br><br>try again loST1","time":1491348884,"resto":119525038,"country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":119534583,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)19:35:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119534036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119534036<\/a><br>Uh no it really is pretty fucking crazy.

I&#039;m currently on Suboxone that I use to not be sick when I&#039;m not using and I went to my father(who is an MD) for help and he&#039;s helping me tapper off my Suboxone and once that is over paying 1500 dollars to inject me with the vivitrol shot(if you dont know what that is, basically its a depo naltrexone shot that blocks the receptors of opiate addicts for up to a month, thus making using drugs pointless as you wont feel anything). However, will all this preparation I still have this huge urge to still want to shoot fucking heroin. I beg you, \/pol\/ don&#039;t be a fucking retard and use drugs(specifically opiates). IVing heroin is easily the best feeling ever and it&#039;s so good itll ruin your fucking life.<br><br>I personally belief that it was a government ploy to get everyone hooked on these pain pills. I&#039;ve known so many stories of people getting hooked simply because of an injury they got and now since the pills are a lot harder to get everyone moved onto fucking heroin and I personally belief the CIA is bringing it in much like the cocaine that was smuggled in the 80s.

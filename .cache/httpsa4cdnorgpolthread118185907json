This basically means that anyone with enough money can buy your browsing history and use it against you. This applies to EVERYONE in the United States. Since we memed Trump into office, we can meme this resolution to crash in flames. Email your local representatives (they can be found via this link: http:\/\/www.house.gov\/htbin\/findrep ) and let your congressmen\/women know that this bill affects them just as much as it affects the rest of us, and if this decision is passed and our protections removed, this WILL be used to destroy them. Lets get some meme magic to work!<br>If you don&#039;t know exactly how to format an email to a representative, follow this template:<br><br>Dear (House rep here),<br><br>As a Citizen of the United states, I want you to vote against the bill S.J.Res.34, which repeals, &quot;Protecting the Privacy of Customers of Broadband and Other Telecommunications Services&quot;. As you might or might not know, this law allows the highest bidder to buy an internet users&#039; browsing history. If this bill passes, it can be used for blackmail or illegal surveillance against anyone (even your friends and family). So if you vote against this bill, you&#039;ll make the internet and country a safer place, and voting against this bill might also boost your approval rating.<br><br>Sincerely, <br> (Your Name Here)","filename":"Seal_of_the_United_States_Congress.svg","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":1197,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490416504986,"time":1490416504,"md5":"LisCgk06yhPTGm2iKQlk3w==","fsize":604669,"resto":0,"id":"MBZiLQ+5","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"stop-sjres34","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118187746,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:54:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118185907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118185907<\/a><br>Like you, I was not pleased when I saw this - went to Congress,gov and here&#039;s my understanding - It is reversing some questionable regulations voted on by the FCC. Prior to 2015, ISPs were regulated by the Federal Trade Commission, so privacy regulations were &quot;consumer expectation&quot; focused. In 2015, the FCC voted to reclassify broadband providers as &quot;common carriers.&quot; The FCC privacy regulations have a &quot;carrier-centered&quot; approach. This created two opposing sets of regulations for ISPs - the FTC &quot;consumer expectations of privacy&quot; policy and the FCC&#039;s &quot;carrier determines data usage&quot; policy. To remedy that, the FCC voted to regulate ISP privacy solely through FCC carrier-driven regulations. Meanwhile, NADA went into effect, and, since the FCC regulations are carrier-based, the carriers had the right to determine how they applied the NADA rules to data. In other words, the carriers had the power to censure. Yesterday&#039;s S.J. 34 ruling disapproved the FCCs regulation of ISPs. My understanding is that jurisdiction of broadband carriers will be moved back to the FTC where they will, again, be based on &quot;consumer expectations.&quot; The good news is we&#039;ll have a choice in if\/how our data is used, as well as legal recourse if it&#039;s used without our permission. The bad news is, there will probably be a fee for opting out. How much is your privacy worth?","time":1490417667,"resto":118185907,"id":"geyUSEZw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

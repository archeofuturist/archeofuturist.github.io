Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as anarcho-primitivism or anarcho-primitivists. Fredy Perlman, a major voice in this current, once said, &quot;The only -ist name I respond to is &quot;cellist&quot;.&#039; Individuals associated with this current do not wish to be adherents of an ideology, merely people who seek to become free individuals in free communities in harmony with one another and with the biosphere, and may therefore refuse to be limited by the term &#039;anarcho-primitivist&#039; or any other ideological tagging. At best, then, anarcho-primitivism is a convenient label used to characterise diverse individuals with a common project: the abolition of all power relations - e.g., structures of control, coercion, domination, and exploitation - and the creation of a form of community that excludes all such relations.","time":1493466839,"resto":123325844,"id":"Rl\/Zj8yI","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123325956,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)07:54:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;How does anarcho-primitivism differ from anarchism, or other radical ideologies?<\/span><br><br>From the perspective of anarcho-primitivism, all other forms of radicalism appear as reformist, whether or not they regard themselves as revolutionary. Marxism and classical anarchism, for example, want to take over civilization, rework its structures to some degree, and remove its worst abuses and oppressions. However, 99% of life in civilization remains unchanged in their future scenarios, precisely because the aspects of civilization they question are minimal. Although both want to abolish capitalism, and classical anarchism would abolish the State too, overall life patterns wouldn&#039;t change too much. Although there might be some changes in socioeconomic relations, such as worker control of industry and neighbourhood councils in place of the State, and even an ecological focus, basic patterns would remain unchanged. The Western model of progress would merely be amended and would still act as an ideal. Mass society would essentially continue, with most people working, living in artificial, technologised environments, and subject to forms of coercion and control.<br>Radical ideologies on the Left seek to capture power, not abolish it. Hence, they develop various kinds of exclusive groups - cadres, political parties, consciousness-raising groups - in order to win converts and plan strategies for gaining control. Organizations, for anarcho-primitivists, are just rackets, gangs for putting a particular ideology in power. Politics, &#039;the art and science of government,&#039; is not part of the primitivist project; only a politics of desire, pleasure, mutuality and radical freedom.","time":1493466874,"resto":123325844,"id":"Rl\/Zj8yI","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123326001,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)07:55:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Where, according to anarcho-primitivism, does power originate?<\/span><br><br>Again, a source of some debate among anarcho-primitivists. Perlman sees the creation of impersonal institutions or abstract power relations as the defining moment at which primitive anarchy begins to be dismantled by civilized social relations. In contrast, John Zerzan locates the development of symbolic mediation - in its various forms of number, language, time, art and later, agriculture - as the means of transition from human freedom to a state of domestication. The focus on origin is important in anarcho-primitivism because primitivism seeks, in exponential fashion, to expose, challenge and abolish all the multiple forms of power that structure the individual, social relations, and interrelations with the natural world. Locating origins is a way of identifying what can be safely salvaged from the wreck of civilization, and what it is essential to eradicate if power relations are not to recommence after civilization&#039;s collapse.","time":1493466909,"resto":123325844,"id":"Rl\/Zj8yI","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123326056,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)07:55:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;12332584<\/span><br>varg, we know its you","time":1493466957,"resto":123325844,"id":"SlEj+exR","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123326113,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)07:56:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;ve been pretty interest in anarcho primitivism recently it triggers leftists pretty hard","filename":"53b771060a8a76e1d3239552321575e2376a2bc02972690d15be5385c8b37c25","ext":".png","w":600,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493467008413,"time":1493467008,"md5":"vBQVSi1i6L70qKJfZEQxig==","fsize":24086,"resto":123325844,"id":"AGTUkrnM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123326237,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)07:58:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123325844\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123325844<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the ways we can archive it<\/span><br>Third, nuclear, WW3 - enjoy stoneage v2","time":1493467110,"resto":123325844,"id":"ZQVGTZk6","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123326243,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)07:58:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;posts on pol<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anarcho primitivist<\/span><br>cognitive dissonance is strong in this one","filename":"1492970845269","ext":".jpg","w":205,"h":206,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493467115085,"time":1493467115,"md5":"I8bCK489qjhbWuW15RpL8Q==","fsize":28481,"resto":123325844,"id":"\/SNyseus","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":123326303,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)07:59:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123326113\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123326113<\/a><br>You can also see how miserable these leftists are.

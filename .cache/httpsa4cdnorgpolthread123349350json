Why not just build an entire subway system that can be used by large numbers of the population at one. Why build a giant network of crisscrossing tunnels just for individual cars, how will this be profitable? They just announced the project earlier this week, and now today in LA they already have a boring machine starting to dig tunnels under the city. This is happening so fast, especially for a shitty idea like this one. Im starting to think something is up. With the growing threat of nuclear war, musk is probably secretly trying to dig bomb shelters under the city that he will be able to charge the elite of hollywood large sums to get access too.","filename":"Elon-Musk-wants-to-build-a-traffic-skipping-tunnel-utopia","ext":".jpg","w":1888,"h":927,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":122,"tim":1493483176392,"time":1493483176,"md5":"6S8FQRbylT6COKg5YNau3Q==","fsize":99479,"resto":0,"id":"xGkptjtO","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"elon-musks-new-idea-is-seriously-retarded-the","country_name":"United States","replies":23,"images":4,"unique_ips":18},{"no":123349948,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)12:31:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123349350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123349350<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why not just build an entire subway system that can be used by large numbers of the population at one<\/span><br>He is not a socialist.

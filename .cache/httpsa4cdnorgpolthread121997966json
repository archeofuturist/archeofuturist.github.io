Why would a scientist find out what goods a society needs to buy?<br>5. refer to 1<br>6. refer to 2 and 3<br>You don&#039;t know what you are talking about and fall over every hurdle but you espouse that your argument still stands. What argument was that exactly? Green energy rules the world and all climate researchers are talking unfounded nonsense because they are just &quot;goys&quot; being paid to make shit up? Why don&#039;t you address why you put climate scientist in inverted commas?","time":1492705292,"resto":121997966,"id":"izm5AQrz","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":122010431,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:24:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121997966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121997966<\/a><br>Attacking chemical fertilizers does not help their wealth redistribution plans.","time":1492705450,"resto":121997966,"id":"w+YmRzeo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122010638,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:26:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122010123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122010123<\/a><br>Have you never been on a plane?","time":1492705565,"resto":121997966,"id":"Lk\/FPLnZ","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122010943,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:28:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122008555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122008555<\/a><br>so anyone against birth ctrl, abortion, etc. is a climate change scepticist?<br><br>so much money has been wasted on food, so little used for family planning in poor countries.","time":1492705731,"resto":121997966,"id":"Vi7ZehWr","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":122010999,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:29:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121997966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121997966<\/a><br>Iron seeding deep ocean, near where algae eating fish migrate through would do so much good.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CO2 taken out of atmosphere<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fish stocks go up<\/span><br><br>It&#039;s a win-win","time":1492705763,"resto":121997966,"id":"D4Q5uenr","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122011013,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:29:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121997966\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121997966<\/a><br>This is driven by the European farmer. Acre per acre, they can&#039;t compete with American farmers using modern farming. However, European farmers, like American farmers, have more political power than their mere numbers, which is understandable, food is important and no country wants to end up having to import enough food to survive. Their solution is to attack every agricultural advantage Americans have, with the goal of leveling the market. GMO, fertilizer, organic, livestock antibiotics, indoor farming, grass fed, free range, etc... are all issues pushed by the European farmers who are hurt by globalization at the hands of American farmers. They hunt down every minuscule side effect and blow it out of proportion in an effort to regulate their and our markets.","filename":"IMG_0263","ext":".jpg","w":4081,"h":2721,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492705770653,"time":1492705770,"md5":"c76ZHK8AakttAdz6Gffijg==","fsize":1874605,"resto":121997966,"id":"opfG79q5","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

I do want to remark that communism doesn&#039;t require a strong state or an authoritarian ruler per se. Communism is mutually exclusive with capitalism; not with democracy.<br><br>If you&#039;re right, but I don&#039;t think you are, then it&#039;s ironic, because communism will never work precisely because people are selfish. Communism requires individuals to make efforts and sacrifices for the common good, which is something people don&#039;t reliably do unless policed. The incentives for the individual are not intrinsically aligned with the needs of the system. Capitalism does this better, obviously, because capitalism really only says that you need to take care of yourself and not care about others if you don&#039;t want to. It&#039;s like the prisoner&#039;s dilemma: the communist utopia is when everyone cooperates and is theoretically the best, but it will never happen.<br><br>I think the goodness in communism is a kernel of faith that, somehow, people can change and that, somehow, a state could be established in which everyone solves this prisoner&#039;s dilemma for the benefit of all without the need for a police state.<br>It is a very naive goodness.","time":1491431523,"resto":119662797,"id":"BdnDgEvU","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119666698,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)18:33:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119662797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119662797<\/a><br>Hello friend. <br>Have you taken the milkpill?","time":1491431593,"resto":119662797,"id":"rivVF2tu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119668267,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)18:46:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119662797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119662797<\/a><br>Remember to drink your whole milk 4 times a day to maintain your superiority.","time":1491432414,"resto":119662797,"id":"hkXS1z5X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119669180,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)18:54:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119666554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119666554<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;communism doesn&#039;t require a strong state or an authoritarian ruler per se<\/span><br>the caveat being that the dictatorship if the proletariat succeeds in creating the utopia, and then willingly decides to step down.

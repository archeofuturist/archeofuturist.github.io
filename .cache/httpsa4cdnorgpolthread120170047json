As much as we dislike the fact that Trump attacked syria, we have to accept that it isn&#039;t as bad as we think. I don&#039;t like it, but the truth is that Putin is only there to further his interests in the region. If we were to pull out, he would be able to move uninterrupted. Yes, he would take on ISIS, but he would also actively work against american interests.<br>Trump&#039;s attack, while it is exactly what he said he would not do, also supports other promises he made. He said he would support american interests all over the world. This does that. It forces Putin on his toes and puts us in a position to take out Assad without raising ire across the world. (Assad is a Putin puppet at this point.) It also sends a message to Chine, NK, and all other nations that we are not to be fucked with.","filename":"get the cross","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":758,"tn_w":164,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491679279729,"time":1491679279,"md5":"HxfybGPDAZzCV74Ll5cLMg==","fsize":84794,"resto":0,"id":"0aRi9Pji","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"polacks","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120170171,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:22:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump for wall of text","time":1491679336,"resto":120170047,"id":"lG0OHjsv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120170456,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:24:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"its china you dumb fuck","time":1491679470,"resto":120170047,"id":"0aRi9Pji","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120170808,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:27:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Also, how are putins interests any worse than isis?

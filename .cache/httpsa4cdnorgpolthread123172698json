I admit, I got completely swept up on the \/pol\/ memes, and I let the jokes fuck with me. I disconnected from reality, and in like a drug stupor. I pulled the lever for Trump because the &quot;memes&quot; told me so. I pretty much gradually realized how autistic I was as the weeks went on.<br><br>It fucks with me every day, that I contributed to Trump. I voted in Pennsylvania, and as you know, PA was won by only a couple fucking votes. I&#039;m part of the problem, and I got cucked by the alt right into destroying what I want in America. I&#039;m a fucking progressive and I voted for Trump. I want Nordic style government, and I still got fucking cunted up the cunt to vote for basically Hitler. Is this what people felt like when they were so defeated at WW1, that they voted for Hitler, even though they hated the man? Because he sounded good?<br><br>Fuck, I supported BERNIE from even before the primaries, and I was one of the early guys on his ship. I was talking about a Bernie run in fucking 2014 ffs, when my friends called me crazy.<br><br>The hate against Clinton, that blew off, and cheated Bernie added to it. If the DNC candidate was even HALF decent, I wouldn&#039;t have been corrupted. <br><br>Just fuck my life famalam. I expect you to either sage, ignore or mock me, but if anyone did what I did, let me know your thoughts, please. I know I&#039;m not alone. <br><br>And yes, I&#039;m a fucking white male.","filename":"1485885922435","ext":".jpg","w":1620,"h":599,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":92,"tim":1493370389298,"time":1493370389,"md5":"\/HDTdTq3f4dML4a75cQagQ==","fsize":229569,"resto":0,"id":"id7lJYYy","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nyone-regret-voting-for-donald-trump-i-admit-i","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":123172871,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)05:08:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fuck off chills","time":1493370515,"resto":123172698,"id":"ZOmj11bk","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":123172874,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)05:08:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123172698\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123172698<\/a><br>kys now. you are weak.","time":1493370515,"resto":123172698,"id":"ctwr3y+Z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123172919,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)05:09:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"this is basically how I feel","filename":"1493137149093","ext":".png","w":720,"h":541,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493370552833,"time":1493370552,"md5":"1mJMCuM33Ek9i3AfUJ7PcQ==","fsize":526493,"resto":123172698,"id":"id7lJYYy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123173198,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)05:12:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nobody here regrets voting for Trump, because Hillary was a non-option.

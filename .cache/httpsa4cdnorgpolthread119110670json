I didn&#039;t have many friends and got bullied frequently for being shy so I used them as a form of escapism, my brightest memories from childhood involved me in my pajamas playing videogames all day and watching cartoons. I&#039;m an adult now but my brain is all messed up; I spend hours upon hours playing these and never use my free time for important things. I tried stopping for a week once but the anxiety was too much.

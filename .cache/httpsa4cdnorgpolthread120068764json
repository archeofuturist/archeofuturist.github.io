Why the fuck is everyone surprised; pointing to tweets he made in 2013? Look at shit he&#039;s said on the campaign trail. None of this is surprising. He said he doesn&#039;t know who his enemies are in Syria, he&#039;s said he&#039;s not pulling out of Syria, and he&#039;s said he supports no-fly zones there. Did you retards think he wanted to put up no-fly zones for a humanitarian effort?<br><br>Nothing he&#039;s said since announcing his bid for the White House is in direct contradiction to bombing a basically empty airfield. The only thing you can point to is that he said he &quot;doesn&#039;t want to get bogged down&quot; in the Middle East. But he isn&#039;t yet either.","time":1491617597,"resto":120068764,"id":"W47Yu+BU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120069594,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)22:14:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120068764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120068764<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120068991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120068991<\/a><br>\/pol\/ doesn&#039;t need you faggots telling them what to think.

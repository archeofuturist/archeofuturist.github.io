Since the equipment was not accessed at the Secret Service office in Chicago after March 27, 1990,why wasn&#039;t the equipment released on March 28th?... Did you or anyone else do any investigation after March 1st into the nature of Mr. Jackson and his business?... You had the owner standing right in front of you on March 2nd. Is it your testimony that the first time you realized that he was a publisher and had business records on the machine was when this suit was filed?&quot;<br><br>And so it went for fifteen minutes straight. The government lawyers were visibly shaken by this interrogation\u2014so much so that they decided not to call any of the other witnesses who had waited for two days to tell their stories. In the closing arguments, the judge repeatedly asked the lawyers what his award of damages should be, since it was apparent he believed that Steve Jackson Games had, in fact, been damaged.<br><br>The judge&#039;s decision was announced on March 12, 1993. Judge Sparks awarded more than $50,000 in damages to Steve Jackson Games, citing lost profits and violations of the Privacy Protection Act of 1980. In addition, the judge awarded each plaintiff $1,000 under the Electronic Communications Privacy Act for the Secret Service seizure of their stored electronic mail.<br><br>The judge also stated that plaintiffs would be reimbursed for their attorneys&#039; fees.<br><br>The results of this precedent-setting litigation will clearly have important consequences for users of computer bulletin board systems. And, hopefully, the public reprimand of the United States Secret Service will cause them to step back and think before seizing their next BBS.","filename":"O-SD1990","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491459140183,"time":1491459140,"md5":"+HoQAaGvhvC40P\/Z0zelBQ==","fsize":692169,"resto":0,"id":"ioPCaBz1","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-911-file-was-not-what-you-think","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":8,"unique_ips":1},{"no":119713674,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)02:13:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"&quot;The next day, accompanied by an attorney, Steve Jackson visited the Austin offices of the Secret Service.

You&#039;d want them on a front where make fast progress and shock-and-awe gains are likely once they break the frontlines. Problem is identifying which suits them best without taking too heavier losses or overcommitting and seeing it all go Afghanistan-tier. I&#039;d consider several fronts that need shutting down in -pic related-. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Red<\/span><br>Most logical one both because of the strain on ISIS resources and supply lines as they relocate eastwards and have had the main road to the Euphrates towns via Tabqa cut. Two pronged offensive with SAA and militias on one front and Russians on the other should be enough to take the lot without excessive losses. Also prevents SDF from trying to snatch any territory to the west if the SAA control the main roads away from Tabqa.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yellow<\/span><br>Makes sense to close the front down and free up manpower, but then do you really risk the high casualties from throwing large numbers and your best (or better) troops into such a heavily urbanised pocket?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pale blue<\/span><br>Would free up manpower to move north and east and open useful supply routes (potentially could even use it to reopen the rail link between Damascus and the coast, Homs and Hama for supplies). But is it really necessary given the relative inactivity of the North Homs pocket and Al-Waer neighbourhood already being dealt with by deportations and would it waste time?","filename":"164848845","ext":".jpg","w":658,"h":569,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1493808932177,"time":1493808932,"md5":"77c7RXSgLw9oIoSmkAHSMQ==","fsize":313156,"resto":123900205,"id":"Y\/LHXW65","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123900381,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:55:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123900205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123900205<\/a><br>f\u00f6rst f\u00f6r d\u00f6d f\u00f6r de f\u00f6renta staterna","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":432,"h":324,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493808933360,"time":1493808933,"md5":"pc60ANeJkHWDNo4ECv1q3Q==","fsize":28431,"resto":123900205,"id":"mvpgTCLd","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123900419,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:56:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Blue<\/span><br>Difficult. Unless a more coherent ceasefire is sorted it&#039;s always going to end up sucking up huge amounts of manpower ever time an offensive starts in the east and the rebels try their luck again. But then sending Russian forces in the to shut it down is likely to take more than 5k and would probably be costly. Also the problem of policing the population once there&#039;s no-where to deport them to, that&#039;s going to use up manpower and be vulnerable to tit-for-tat insurgency. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Green<\/span><br>Useful to secure supply lines to the east and crush any prospects for a major rebel offensive towards Damascus or to try and open the Ghouta pocket if their backers funded or provided resources and manpower for it. Doubtful if they have the supplies to do it but deploying Russian troops and shock-and-awe&#039;ing the FSA, NSyA and ISIS in that front would be strategically useful. Although it could end up wasteful and time-consuming committing any number of non-shit-tier quality forces to fighting them in the deserts. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Purple<\/span><br>Would make sense to free up manpower and prevent any possible advances from FSA. But then at the moment it seems well enough defended to not justify sending heavy reinforcements in. Also would you seriously risk Russian or Iranian forces in that region knowing full well Israel and Jordan could pull some funny shit and quickly turn it into a mess if they start giving better equipment and supplies to the rebels there.","time":1493808963,"resto":123900205,"id":"Y\/LHXW65","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

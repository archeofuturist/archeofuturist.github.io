You&#039;d want them on a front where make fast progress and shock-and-awe gains are likely once they break the frontlines. Problem is identifying which suits them best without taking too heavier losses or overcommitting and seeing it all go Afghanistan-tier. I&#039;d consider several fronts that need shutting down in -pic related-. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Red<\/span><br>Most logical one both because of the strain on ISIS resources and supply lines as they relocate eastwards and have had the main road to the Euphrates towns via Tabqa cut. Two pronged offensive with SAA and militias on one front and Russians on the other should be enough to take the lot without excessive losses. Also prevents SDF from trying to snatch any territory to the west if the SAA control the main roads away from Tabqa.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yellow<\/span><br>Makes sense to close the front down and free up manpower, but then do you really risk the high casualties from throwing large numbers and your best (or better) troops into such a heavily urbanised pocket?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pale blue<\/span><br>Would free up manpower to move north and east and open useful supply routes (potentially could even use it to reopen the rail link between Damascus and the coast, Homs and Hama for supplies).

Unless a more coherent ceasefire is sorted it&#039;s always going to end up sucking up huge amounts of manpower ever time an offensive starts in the east and the rebels try their luck again. But then sending Russian forces in the to shut it down is likely to take more than 5k and would probably be costly.

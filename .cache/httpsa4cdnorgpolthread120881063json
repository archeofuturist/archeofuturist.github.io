That would mark another shift from his campaign position that he would likely replace Yellen when her term as chair ends in February next year.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the interview, Trump said, &quot;I do like a low-interest rate policy, I must be honest with you.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The decision not to label China a currency manipulator represents one of the sharpest reversals of Trump&#039;s brief presidency. Trump began to bash China in the 2015 speech that began his campaign, saying Beijing kept its currency artificially low to give its manufacturers an unfair advantage in global trade.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.cbc.ca\/news\/business\/tru<wbr>mp-china-currency-1.4068347?cmp=rss<wbr>","filename":"usa-tax-trump","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":349,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492066813956,"time":1492066813,"md5":"aT+Zs\/UW8ZPYbl9BsOQGUQ==","fsize":72069,"resto":0,"id":"w9a4U8RB","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-says-china-wont-be-labelled-a-currency","country_name":"Canada","replies":7,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":120881492,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)03:05:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120881063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120881063<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he does think the U.S. dollar &quot;is getting too strong.&quot;<\/span>","filename":"1475350021634","ext":".jpg","w":205,"h":246,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492067118567,"time":1492067118,"md5":"zMXSpWgbCxaQUdOg5v5ZoQ==","fsize":5269,"resto":120881063,"id":"MB7pFYYZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120881557,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)03:06:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120881063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120881063<\/a><br>Ultimate deal maker!<br>So glad I voted for him!","time":1492067171,"resto":120881063,"id":"aWHZmJJP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120881642,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)03:07:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120881063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120881063<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;won&#039;t name them<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;in a report due this week<\/span><br><br>what about next week<br><br>or the week after","time":1492067229,"resto":120881063,"id":"EkB3Rblz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120881937,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)03:10:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"&quot;I do like a low-interest rate policy, I must be honest with you.&quot;<br><br>It&#039;s n-not all bad, a least.","filename":"1487563803383","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":800,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492067410194,"time":1492067410,"md5":"BF1QvEaNdB\/ZLqkg21YmfA==","fsize":47161,"resto":120881063,"id":"MB7pFYYZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120882023,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)03:11:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120881937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120881937<\/a><br>How can one make money without interest?","time":1492067490,"resto":120881063,"id":"aWHZmJJP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120882148,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)03:12:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120881063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120881063<\/a><br>Jesus fuck this guy gets better btfoing of his supporters every minute.","time":1492067579,"resto":120881063,"id":"j9GPMqvk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120882278,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)03:14:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Good trade off to make China a very close friend.

The San Francisco Bay Area... a very racially diverse area, but not necessarily the highest concentration of blacks in a greater area like houston or atlanta or the new orleans ghettos which are basically mini-africas seeting with crime. The history of civil rights causes and supporting racial diversity in this area has made it the unofficial headquarters of liberal marxist anti-racist group think. Babyboomers like my parents in the 60&#039;s have basically led this area to what sweden\/germany is turning in to now. <br><br>One of the most annoying things that gets to me about living in this kind of environment is that whatever the situation, if it is created by a rude negro, it can no way be blamed on the individual because we hold them to such a low standard.<br><br>I have seen belligerent negroes instigate violence over nothing and im sick of it. I&#039;ve ridden public transportation for years for work in northern california and for business in Southern California. And maybe 1% of the time aggressive altercations were started by people that were non blacks. Every other time it was a black that was overly agressive in situations that did not call for it. <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zUX<wbr>ow3d3-b0","filename":"Picture_11","ext":".png","w":391,"h":392,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493195868232,"time":1493195868,"md5":"CTnBG+CWuMXJtlp9Juq9xw==","fsize":196148,"resto":0,"id":"WKRl9rme","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"negro-rudeness-stories","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":2,"unique_ips":12},{"no":122863187,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)04:50:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122862450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122862450<\/a><br>better tell us about your &quot;uber alles&quot; pride parades where CIA lemon party gestapo pervertariat transcends all those &quot;untermenschen&quot; skin colors with their crooked rainbows.","time":1493196622,"resto":122862450,"id":"pUtkdBR5","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":122863555,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)04:56:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122862450\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122862450<\/a><br>Watched a white family sit at my local lake and stare in shock as two teenage niggers threw rocks at a Canada goose until the thing could barley flay away.<br><br>I did not want to intervene and stop the niggers because I know for a fact that this white family of a mom, dad, and two kids will never forget those niggers hurting the goose.<br><br>Niggers are the best at making everyone hate them.","time":1493196982,"resto":122862450,"id":"jRtDa95O","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122863585,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)04:57:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122863555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122863555<\/a><br>You did the right thing.<br><br>Hearts and minds, anon.","time":1493197027,"resto":122862450,"id":"WI9JmywE","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122864058,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:05:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122863555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122863555<\/a><br><br>Great story.

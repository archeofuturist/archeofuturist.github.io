What happened was he reversed a quarter percentage point cut to mortgage insurance rates that was yet to go into effect. There&#039;s two things to note here:<br>1. It hadn&#039;t even gone into effect yet. So there&#039;s no net increase on first time home buyer costs. They keep paying what they&#039;re paying now.<br><br>2. This isn&#039;t affecting mortgage premiums. It&#039;s about mortgage insurance premiums. Mortgage issuers require mortgage insurance for risky loans: people with low income, people with low credit scores, people asking for loans that represent more than they can reasonably afford. Keeping the cost of mortgage insurance premiums high is a good thing. Hell, if anything they should be increased even more. Maybe then people will think twice before going for the unaffordable mortgage. This reduces the default rate on mortgages.<br><br>So in effect, it&#039;s a commitment not to reduce the idiot insurance. It will remain costly to be an idiot. That&#039;s a good thing.","time":1493787744,"resto":123872237,"id":"ik2E+zMd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123874692,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:06:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123872299\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123872299<\/a><br>Back to t_d you mindless drone.

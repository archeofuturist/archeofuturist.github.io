What happened was he reversed a quarter percentage point cut to mortgage insurance rates that was yet to go into effect. There&#039;s two things to note here:<br>1. It hadn&#039;t even gone into effect yet. So there&#039;s no net increase on first time home buyer costs. They keep paying what they&#039;re paying now.<br><br>2. This isn&#039;t affecting mortgage premiums. It&#039;s about mortgage insurance premiums. Mortgage issuers require mortgage insurance for risky loans: people with low income, people with low credit scores, people asking for loans that represent more than they can reasonably afford. Keeping the cost of mortgage insurance premiums high is a good thing. Hell, if anything they should be increased even more. Maybe then people will think twice before going for the unaffordable mortgage. This reduces the default rate on mortgages.<br><br>So in effect, it&#039;s a commitment not to reduce the idiot insurance. It will remain costly to be an idiot.

Both shills and kool aid drinkers alike seem to be getting into politics for the first time with this election and believe that if trump didn&#039;t complete certain campaign promises within 100 days or certain bills were failed to be passed then that means that they are done 100% forever and Trump can&#039;t write or pass new bills for the next 3 and a half years.<br><br>Trump has symbolically communicated less emphasis on some important issues to his voters, and certain promises are coming slower than we would like, but he has yet to indicate a betrayal on the wall, renegotiating trade deals and tax reform.

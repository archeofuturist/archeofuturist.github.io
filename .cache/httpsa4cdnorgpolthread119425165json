Trump runs for real after multiple attempts previously. But he totally was selected this time, practically coronated before primary season even started. The media was on his side the whole time, as well as the Republican, neoconservative\/globalist establishment. Hell, Democrats even helped him by staying quiet during the primaries about him specifically. After Hillary and he were nominated, they both made sure to avoid any serious haymakers, knowing it would be counterproductive to do any serious damage to the reputation to the other. <br><br>Look dude, I know you and a lot of people here like to think coincidence is enough for both the indightment and conviction, but it&#039;s not. The fact two of the more influential American families know each other is not surprising. I&#039;m sure Bill and Melinda Gates know a lot of people too. Doesn&#039;t mean they conspire with everyone who&#039;s an acquaintance or better","time":1491277562,"resto":119425165,"id":"R95PNJwH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119426467,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)23:46:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119425780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119425780<\/a><br>You do have a point here.<br>Not gonna lie, former drumpfer...","filename":"1489174056021","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491277589956,"time":1491277589,"md5":"T6MVhkKshspA2XnjcbPTGw==","fsize":9881,"resto":119425165,"id":"6WI1SQe4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

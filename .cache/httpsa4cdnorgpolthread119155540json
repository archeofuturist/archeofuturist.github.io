I tried to talk to my parents about cultural marxism tonight and my dad dismissed the whole thing as a conspiracy theory and told me that i spend too much time on the internet. He is a blue collar guy but he genuinely believes in things like &quot;world peace&quot; and &quot;there is only one race.&quot; However, he also stated that America is supposed to be a white, Christian nation. And then he said more hispanics is a good thing because they are Catholics and white people aren&#039;t making children. His contradictions were unsettling. I ended by saying there are videos of former KGB members (Yuri) explaining how to brainwash entire countries, and he used that as ammo to say &quot;well if you believe that then you have to believe that Russia colluded in our election.&quot; He seems so certain about the things he says and i know they are wrong and it sucks that i can&#039;t convince him otherwise. I also find it hard to believe that people that are 55 years old have never heard of Saul Alinsky. <br><br>Have any of you guys had any success in talking to your family about these issues?","filename":"SOY[1]","ext":".jpg","w":488,"h":356,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":182,"tim":1491029153978,"time":1491029153,"md5":"ZTwPm7kXD3n9yAvrybjCqQ==","fsize":37377,"resto":0,"id":"U6ZtBAHV","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpilling-your-family","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":0,"unique_ips":11},{"no":119156833,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)03:03:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119155540\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119155540<\/a><br>For me there was little to no reason to redpill them because they are already redpilled as fuck, the only one who isn&#039;t is my sister but she&#039;s like 40% redpilled since she lives in a redpilled household<br><br>hell they are that redpilled that I&#039;ve heard my mom say things like &quot;Niggers are useless and savages&quot; and my dad things like &quot;Fucking kikes no one in history has ever liked those usurer sons of bitches, Hitler should&#039;ve killed them bastards&quot; also we are a catholic household who has strong family bond which we see as the cornerstone of our lives (Family always comes first) and uphold Family traditions on high regard ranging from bullshit like going every sunday to my gramps house or going together to Christmas\/Easter solemn mass together every year no exceptions","time":1491030232,"resto":119155540,"id":"MFusE7TF","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":119157100,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)03:07:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"My mom always told me the media was controlled by elites (just never said anything about jewz) and believes in the NWO endgame plan they have.

He&#039;s a liberal arts graduate and has shelves full of WE WUZ KANGS-tier old college textbooks. He will not be converted. But he is a pre-authoritarian liberal, loves George Carlin, hates PC censorship, etc. so I can find common ground with him on that and maybe sway him into realizing how much of the left is like that.

MSNBC. CNN. Fox. I&#039;m getting redpilled by the behavior of BLM, how these buildings created in Islam continue to get firebombed, and found out later by people that share their religion. How a man immigrating to the US from Israel turned out to be the person that threatened to bomb.. what, thirty churches or something?<br><br>Like, I&#039;m continuously being told that people&#039;s religious views and where they come from don&#039;t matter, but obviously it DOES matter if those very people are committing heinous acts against what they believe in, only to attempt to blame white people.<br><br>This shit&#039;s fucking with me, man.","filename":"Putin","ext":".jpg","w":460,"h":637,"tn_w":180,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491373459496,"time":1491373459,"md5":"59pYSQ87k+wwJ9jHXTZcoQ==","fsize":38673,"resto":0,"id":"IF27Xe6r","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"first-time-poster-in-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119577038,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)02:28:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Multiculturalism is a joke and in group\/out group dynamics dominate all modern politics as a result.

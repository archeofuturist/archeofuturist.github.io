Oh, that&#039;s right. The fighting isn&#039;t even over yet. In fact, we&#039;re only 1 day into the offensive. Does not having the lead 1 day in, in Hama count as a loss? Is that what you&#039;re saying? Because if you&#039;re saying that I can assure you that you&#039;re wrong. Why would you make this post when the fighting is still on? SAA is still gaining support right now and they have been the best force in the country for how many years now? They&#039;re up against one of the worst factions in Syria who just happen to have a lead because they&#039;re feeding off the energy of being jihadists. But you know what? They still fucking suck. SAA is one of the best factions in Syria, they&#039;ve come out ahead in all the fights this year and would be winning right now if the Saudis didn&#039;t supply the rebels. Maybe you should shut the fuck up before you make retarded posts like this. You know why? Because you&#039;re going to be embarrassed when SAA wins and someone makes a screenshot of your post. Oh look at that, SAA just bombed civilian areas, just like FSA. Are you a fucking drunk? Are you retarded? Are you autistic? You are a fucking idiot and you should never make a post on this board again and I&#039;m fucking serious. I almost have a feeling you&#039;re the only guy making all these anti-Assad posts because you&#039;re a faggot hater who doesn&#039;t like the SAA because they&#039;re good. Fuck you, be good at something in YOUR life and then maybe try to troll some other faction on the board, like I give a fuck. It&#039;s so easy to spot out your posts now, you&#039;re a retard. Always doing stupid shit like this. Why don&#039;t you try to be a good poster? Just for once? For once in your fucking life try not to make a topic like this.

Wars of aggression, even in the name of liberation, will never be supported by the party. Alliances will not be taken lightly thus, meaning some current agreements may require reconsideration in regards to the risk and reward factor that it poses the state. The state will also resist the attempts of any foreign power, ally or not, to influence the internal politics or society of the nation. Continued attempts at the influence of the nation from a foreign power will eventually lead to economic sanctions or potentially the severing of diplomatic ties until operations cease and an official apology is issued. Due to the isolationist stance, an overwhelming military like that of the current United States will not be necessary, though the nation will never disarm or leave itself weak in contrast to neighbors or other powerful spheres of influence. With the modest military format, the draft will always be opposed by the national libertarian party on the basis of individual liberty unless there are enemy forces amassing on our sovereign soil.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anti-Immigration<\/span><br>The national libertarian party will support closing the borders of the state to immigration save for those explicitly skilled in positions deemed empty and unfillable by nations. When immigration is opened up, cultural brethren will be given priority. If there is a decrease in population due to low birthrates in the nation, this will not be treated with hordes of foreign migrants but rather state incentives to national-born citizenry to reproduce and bear more children. All illegal immigrants, or foreign invaders, will be routed out and removed. Refuge status will only be granted temporarily to those fleeing personal political persecution under the party&#039;s protection of whistleblowers whether at home or abroad.","filename":"Oxen","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":814,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":226,"tim":1493856198233,"time":1493856198,"md5":"\/l26rwhSj\/QxL\/aIYQECcQ==","fsize":128389,"resto":0,"id":"MNSZxIy8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"national-libertarianism-a-balance-between-the","country_name":"United States","replies":17,"images":0,"unique_ips":10},{"no":123987677,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)20:04:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Free Speech<\/span><br>The national libertarian party will never support any form of limitations on speech in their nation, whether political, religious or otherwise. Thus, &#039;hate speech&#039; will be tolerated under law given that the speech does not escalate to violent action towards nationals or citizenry upon foreign soil. Hate speech resulting in violent action will be treated the same as any other form of terrorism, with detainment or death if necessary. Terrorists will find no quarter under national libertarian rule.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gun Rights<\/span><br>The national libertarian party will never support any form of limitations on the right of its citizenry to bear arms unless previously convicted of a violent gun-related crime.

The maximum time from the point of impregnation to undergo an abortion will be a firm twelve weeks with no flexibility. Before an abortion may be undergone, the expecting mother must undergo a three day waiting period and be given literature discussing alternatives such as state-sponsored and fund-incentivized adoption.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Basic Human Respect<\/span><br>The national libertarian party will fight to ensure that all are equal under the eyes of the law, regardless of faith, race, creed, sex or personal identification. Any and all attempts to violate the rights of one group that another still has will be opposed by the party. In regards to homosexual and transsexual marriage, the national libertarian party will simply support civil unions for all personal relationships recognized by the state as opposed to the government having any hand in holy matrimony.","time":1493856243,"resto":123987586,"id":"MNSZxIy8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123987734,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)20:04:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Flat Taxation<\/span><br>The national libertarian party will never support a progressive tax and in its stead endorse a flat tax rate that will be the same across all economic classes.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Free Trade<\/span><br>The national libertarian party will oppose most government regulation in business affairs and trade that does not pertain to maintaining the environmental health of the nation or the medical health of nationals.

Basic workers privileges such as a minimum wage, regulated hours as well as paid overtime will be the few regulation placed on the relationship between the employer and the employee.

It serves no long term goal other then to make Trump and the USA look unstable and a threat. As a result of the strike which killed Syrian military personal and civilians. Russia revoked the anti aggression pact in place, meaning any USA military that looked as if they where going to attack would be treated as an enemy combatant. Not long after it was revoked, our aircraft and drones where shot at. If it was aimed at North Korea, what was it supposed to show? That if they&#039;re going to be upset about our aggression, they should know we will actually act on it? The Norks are no threat to the USA, they want us to piss off. Every time we launch military exercises on their borders, or move hardware into S.

The vast majority of our &quot;combat vets&quot; experience is serving on a comfy foreword operating base. Our mixed units (genders, races), our lack of discipline, and massive obesity even among military do not make an effective military.

The NK are not the threat here. Trump promised good trade deals, and the best way to do that with an economy in decline is a show of force. It would be bad to think that China and Russia could just walk over us in negotiations. Besides currently our hegomony (which DOES make us money due to foreign markets) needs to be maintained. I would argue in the long run we should not have involved ourselves in that but the fact is we can&#039;t just cut and isolate ourselves from allies like SK yet so we have to show we will protect them.

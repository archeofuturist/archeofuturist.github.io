WSJ and forbes both ran stories on this from their Chinese military sources and long-time China insider\/deflector revealed so on ABC&#039;s syndicated radio show &quot;The John Batchelor show&quot; <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Here is the likely WW3 deal, US does the dirty and deadly military work, China gets North Korea for land and to act as a buffer to the US and it&#039;s ally South Korea. In return China does not attack the US or seize any more clay in the South China Sea.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;China frees itself of an increasingly annoying and dangerous liability, gets a shit load of farmland for their people, and without a nuclear threat in the region there will be no need for US military expansion with it&#039;s allies who surround China on 3 sides. An offer they simply can&#039;t refuse.<\/span>","filename":"dealmein","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":138,"tim":1491872485779,"time":1491872485,"md5":"sGLjmqOe2W+23sSEXQgAWA==","fsize":106148,"resto":0,"id":"2WizM+Rr","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-art-of-the-deal-n-koreaww3-absolutely","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":120524171,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:03:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"So China gets all the goodies, and the US is left holding an empty bag.<br><br>No.","time":1491872625,"resto":120523785,"id":"jm2E2O+6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120524995,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:08:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120523785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120523785<\/a><br>China is also getting a new coal supplier...the US.NK has been China&#039;s main supplier of coal and being that China&#039;s little lap dog has been more trouble than they are worth, the US and China are going to cooperatively work together in Jong-Un&#039;s removal.","time":1491872923,"resto":120523785,"id":"BWz1vvx9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120525243,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:10:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120524171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120524171<\/a><br>We do owe them some money...","time":1491873019,"resto":120523785,"id":"xDPkjD51","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120525730,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:13:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"NK Farmland is no good, it&#039;s been stripped of minerals and fertilizer for 60+ years.<br><br>Lord only knows what kind of pollutants as well.","time":1491873207,"resto":120523785,"id":"Fl28a5BJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120525836,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)21:14:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"from NPR:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cThere are no branches of trees on the ground,\u201d Van der Kamp says. \u201cEverything is collected for food or fuel or animal food, almost nothing is left for the soil.

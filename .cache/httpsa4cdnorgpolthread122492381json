You need to analyze the way interests, economics and geoplolitics interlace with one another. <br><br>The USD is currently the reserve currency of the world. It replaced the GBP sometime shortly after the Suez crisis. <br><br>Oil is only sold in USD, therefore when Europe or any country buys oil from the saudis, they are buying it in USD. Meaning they first need to buy USD In order to buy oil. Hence the dollr is kept strong and afloat, because theres always a demand for it.<br><br>Thats just me trying ti explain it to you shortly and simply. <br><br>That should explain you the US-Saudi relations. And why they&#039;re quite tied to one another.<br><br>However having your currency as the reserve currency also comes with a cost, that its difficult to control it, in this case, to control the dollar you need to control the oil supply and demand. This however leads the US to constantly wage wars in the middle east.<br><br>This has also bee. The case in syria. Where a pipeline coming from qatar needs to pass through syria in order to supply europe. That oil will be sold on USD as well but more importantly it will destroy the russian monopol on oil\/gas, therefore collapsing russia.<br><br>Assad simply said no to the pipelines construction and hence the americans are trying so hard to remove him.<br><br>If you do not trust me I can back this up with leaked documented information regarding CIA plans to overthrow assad leading back to the mid 1980s.","time":1492986164,"resto":122492381,"id":"JeaezWUx","country":"AL","country_name":"Albania"},{"no":122500724,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)18:37:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122498705\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122498705<\/a><br>I know and understand all this... but non of it explains Saudi&#039;s position and the media total lack of criticism for it and what the do on global stage.","time":1492987053,"resto":122492381,"id":"6cp8eY7+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122502258,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)18:49:38","name":"Weaponized autism","com":"<a href=\"#p122500724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122500724<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122500724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122500724<\/a><br><br>Do not expect the mainstream media to tell you about it as they will only show what they want you to hear.<br><br>Taje a look through wikileaks, try finding actual unbiased sources towards neither side.

Thats just one crude example, but dont expect the media to tell you much about it.<br><br>I see \/pol\/ and the world here freaking out about trump and the NorKs and people on pages saying &quot;with obama we nwver risked a war with another nation&quot; which is incredibly stupid because they simply werent looking deep enough. Presidents like obama and so on, they smile on TV make great speeches but on the backscene theyre all in bed with the same shit that controls the POTUS. <br><br>The kike PACs, oil and big corps. You can easily see that with trump as well. You people remember what he was like during his campaign? And look at him now, tamed by the shitty backstage organizations.","time":1492987778,"resto":122492381,"id":"JeaezWUx","country":"AL","country_name":"Albania"},{"no":122503449,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)18:58:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122502258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122502258<\/a><br>Are they a legit government or a CIA puppet organization? <br><br>http:\/\/www.presstv.ir\/Detail\/2015\/0<wbr>3\/26\/403503\/Saudi-Arabia-puppet-of-<wbr>US-Israel<br><br>also the comments are interesting...","time":1492988294,"resto":122492381,"id":"6cp8eY7+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122504249,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:03:58","name":"Weaponized autism","com":"<a href=\"#p122503449\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122503449<\/a><br><br>Yes they are an actual state\/government themselves and they have a symbiotic relation with the US.

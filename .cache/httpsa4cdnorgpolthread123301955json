Specifically even if the theory of evolution, which states all life gradually complexified over millions of years from a bacteria to a living man, is wrong the process of genetic deviation described by evolution is not wrong. Instead it is an inevitability. <br><br>It&#039;s given offspring&#039;s genetics are largely dependent on their parents genetics. Hence in order for genetics to stagnate--or for the process of genetic deviation over generations to be false--the genetics of a species must be in equilibrium. Otherwise it&#039;s inevitable the genetics of a species&#039; will move towards this supposed state of equilibrium (equilibrium meaning if the state of the system is perturbed it has the tendency to reverse the perturbation). Given that this supposed state is highly unlikely to happen--and that even if it does environmental changes will likely make it cease to be stable--it becomes an inevitability that genetics deviate over generations. After sufficiently long periods its inevitable this would produce significant changes in the genetics of a given species. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tl;dr even if evolution is wrong and filled with wholes the process of genetic deviation is inevitable.<\/span>","filename":"1852A09A00000578-0-image-a-40_1458562641010","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":231,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":91,"tim":1493444912195,"time":1493444912,"md5":"NurJcLZFlrDyljB21AIYVA==","fsize":22583,"resto":0,"id":"SULltuN\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-truth-about-evolution","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":123302583,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:56:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"OP won&#039;t be around to answer questions.

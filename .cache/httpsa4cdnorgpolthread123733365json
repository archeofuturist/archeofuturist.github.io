Anyways Jared brings up a couple points that I hadn&#039;t known about before. The first being that the institutions of Churches across the United States are mostly self segregated, saying that with out government interference forcing diversity that tribalism will kick in. He is right about the Churches<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Multiracial Congregations Project, led by Michael Emerson, a Rice University sociologist, defines a multiracial congregation as one where no one racial group is more than 80% of the congregation. Using that standard, Emerson has found that only 8% of all Christian congregations in the U.S. are racially mixed to a significant degree: 2-3% of mainline Protestant congregations, 8% of other Protestant congregations, and 20% of Catholic parishes. <\/span><br>https:\/\/archive.is\/10jdu <br><br>1\/2","filename":"Smug Taylor","ext":".png","w":1299,"h":647,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493703641140,"time":1493703641,"md5":"UsXvVEd4uSU9BNUA9vFEZA==","fsize":1226423,"resto":0,"id":"65GMw93D","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"diversity-and-immigration","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":123733432,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:41:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Another point that the kike brought up was that hispanic immigrants were more likely to attain education than native born whites. The source below doesn&#039;t compare attainability among the two groups but it does show how hard it is for Hispanics to get (or even be) educated<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Despite high educational expectations, Hispanics are among the least educated group in the United States: 11 percent of those over age 25 have earned a bachelor&#039;s degree or higher compared with 17 percent of blacks, 30 percent of whites, and 49 percent of Asian Americans in the same age group (U.S. Census Bureau, 2003).1 Even more troubling, more than one-fourth of Hispanic adults have less than a ninth-grade education (U.S. Census Bureau, 2002b). These numbers represent all Hispanic groups and include recent immigrants. When examined by country of origin, educational attainment for Hispanics varies. As shown in Figure 6-1, Mexican Americans, who are the largest and fastest growing Hispanic subgroup in the United States, have the lowest rates of educational attainment compared with other groups. Cuban Americans report the highest levels of high school completion, and \u201cother Hispanics\u201d report the highest levels of bachelor&#039;s degree attainment. Most data sets do not distinguish among Hispanic subgroups, disregarding important cultural and economic differences among them. <\/span><br>https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/books\/<wbr>NBK19909\/<br>Does any anon have other examples or add-ons contrary\/on par with this info?

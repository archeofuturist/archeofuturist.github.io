Anyways Jared brings up a couple points that I hadn&#039;t known about before. The first being that the institutions of Churches across the United States are mostly self segregated, saying that with out government interference forcing diversity that tribalism will kick in.

Using that standard, Emerson has found that only 8% of all Christian congregations in the U.S. are racially mixed to a significant degree: 2-3% of mainline Protestant congregations, 8% of other Protestant congregations, and 20% of Catholic parishes. <\/span><br>https:\/\/archive.is\/10jdu <br><br>1\/2","filename":"Smug Taylor","ext":".png","w":1299,"h":647,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493703641140,"time":1493703641,"md5":"UsXvVEd4uSU9BNUA9vFEZA==","fsize":1226423,"resto":0,"id":"65GMw93D","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"diversity-and-immigration","country_name":"United States","replies":75,"images":12,"unique_ips":21},{"no":123733432,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:41:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Another point that the kike brought up was that hispanic immigrants were more likely to attain education than native born whites.

These numbers represent all Hispanic groups and include recent immigrants. When examined by country of origin, educational attainment for Hispanics varies. As shown in Figure 6-1, Mexican Americans, who are the largest and fastest growing Hispanic subgroup in the United States, have the lowest rates of educational attainment compared with other groups. Cuban Americans report the highest levels of high school completion, and \u201cother Hispanics\u201d report the highest levels of bachelor&#039;s degree attainment.

The problem is that he only ever gets invited to interviews with afrocentrists who chimp out and start screeching whenever someone presents an opposing view.

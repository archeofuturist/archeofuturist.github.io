If you read about the Klan, you&#039;ll learn about the Klan. The short synopsis is as follows: The KKK was started in the South in response to the deprivation of civil rights of ex-Confederate soldiers. Governments were being run by Northerners seeking to exploit the South, and\/or ex-slaves who were in almost all cases uneducated, and in many vindictive. As rights began to be restored to Southerners and they took back their governments, the need for the Klan disappeared - as did the Klan. The Klan that exists today, is a different entity, started in Ohio (I seem to recall) based on white pride, along with an Anglo and Protestant heritage. The original Klan had a purpose; the new Klan mostly goes on TV to hate other races.","filename":"SpinningForefatherDynamo","ext":".jpg","w":483,"h":350,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1491225937809,"time":1491225937,"md5":"gGidECWtl6uugfOBDroLCQ==","fsize":28273,"resto":119326086,"id":"80y5AF8p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119327798,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)09:26:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119327691\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119327691<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a northern republican<\/span><br><br>Not a single percent.","time":1491225961,"resto":119326086,"id":"EIE0kfFe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119329289,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)09:42:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119326086\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119326086<\/a><br><br>Did you ever watch the great American Epic &#039;Gone with the Wind&#039;?

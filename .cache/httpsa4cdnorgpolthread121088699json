Meaning is synonymous with purpose in this case. For instance the heart inherently works (by its nature, not to say it is at all conscious) towards the pumping of blood. The uterus primarily for the birthing of children, etc. The desires for making us aware of these needs and our capacity for reason so we may regulate such desires rather than be regulated by them.<br><br>Fulfillment (what is also referred to as &quot;inner peace&quot; or &quot;joy&quot; by other systems from around the world) is to come about by adhering to our purpose. Early existentialists held that all people were distinctly different in what would fulfill them and so they must be free to fulfill their desires so to reach it. Western thought before it - which is staunchly Catholic - holds that despite quirks unique to each person humanity as a whole has something that fulfills them that is their purpose and that is living a life of love. By which, I mean the willing the good of others without self-interest.<br><br><br>Most people who speak of lacking purpose and meaning are simply confused about what to do with themselves and are in need of direction, they tend towards not actually rejecting the examples of natural purpose I mentioned at the top. Or at least maintain it and want to rename &quot;purpose&quot; to &quot;function&quot; because it sounds too theistic to them.","filename":"1343976650953","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492193597339,"time":1492193597,"md5":"NdSDl4OInK5\/8RPJLX3hdA==","fsize":20131,"resto":121088699,"id":"eMIkTRGI","country":"US","trip":"!!tuOwy1ct2dy","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121092078,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)14:14:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121088699\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121088699<\/a><br>anime then go to sleep.

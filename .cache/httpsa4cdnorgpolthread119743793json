This brings the unrelated postings to the top of the forum list, and the critical posting &#039;slides&#039; down the front page, and quickly out of public view. Although it is difficult or impossible to censor the posting it is now lost in a sea of unrelated and unuseful postings.

Statistically of the million or so police officers in America there is always one or two being caught abusing there powers and the taping of the activity can be then used for intelligence gathering purposes - without the requirement to &#039;stage&#039; a fake abuse video.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; This method is extremely effective, and the more so the more abusive the video can be made to look. Sometimes it is useful to &#039;lead&#039; the forum by replying to your own posting with your own statement of violent intent, and that you &#039;do not care what the authorities think!!&#039; inflammation.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; By doing this and showing no fear it may be more effective in getting the more silent and self-disciplined violent intent members of the forum to slip and post their real intentions.

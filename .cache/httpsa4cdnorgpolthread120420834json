This is unacceptable for many countries and can&#039;t happen, since it would be a point of no return.<br><br>- If NK gets invaded to disable the nuclear program chances are high Seoul, one of the biggest cities in the world, would be laid to ashes either by a nuke or artillery. Same goes for other cities and bases in Japan. This is also unacceptable.<br><br>- A regime change can&#039;t be done for the same reasons: As soon as the leaders of NK would realize their end is coming they would go batshit crazy.<br><br>- Same goes for trade pressure from China e.g. since again, when the NK government would realize their reign is coming to an end they would probably kamikaze the whole country.<br><br><br>I don&#039;t really see an option to get out of this without loosing Seoul and without a long, bloody conflict BUT nuking NK straight ahead. Preemptive nuclear strike disabling any chances to react. But this again is impossible, since it would draw the attention of the whole world, anger many countries, make China go batshit crazy and has overall horrible implications since millions of civilians would die.<br><br>What do?","filename":"lead_960","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491818619651,"time":1491818619,"md5":"1kelpnBw8N383FTJVVSpoQ==","fsize":51461,"resto":0,"id":"kr\/ozFNv","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-to-get-rid-of-north-korea","country_name":"Germany","replies":12,"images":2,"unique_ips":7},{"no":120421117,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)06:07:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"would probably need a team of 100 ninjas to kill all leading personell and kim simultaneously before anyone can react...<br><br>so yeah, I think seoul is pretty much done, just a question of time","time":1491818835,"resto":120420834,"id":"FH+6xGOB","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120421342,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)06:10:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why do you give a fuck?

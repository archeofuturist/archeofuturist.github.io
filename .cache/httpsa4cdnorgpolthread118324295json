Same pictures, same bio, same everything. The only difference is significantly more matches after a week of abstaining versus after a week of jacking off to porn every day. I have been deliberately taking notes on this for a couple years and I know it is true for a fact. <br><br>What the fuck is this? We all know that sexual energy is incredibly potent but how can it possibly be that my storing it results in more matches? I&#039;m setting you up, reader, with these questions because I already know the answer. Your energy permeates the ether and the internet is just a proto trainingwheels electronic version of connected consciousness. Or more accurately it&#039;s a conduit for it. We can all feel and sense the spirit of one another and that is becoming more obvious.<br><br>I know others feel this truth and it has gigantic, paradigm shifting implications. We see the concept manifesting everywhere. One corollary is in the obvious feuds of political disagreement between progressives and those against them, where all kinds of semantic arguments are trotted out when everybody knows the score on a base level. I want to preserve my culture and you want to destroy it, et cetera, et cetera.<br><br>What will discourse look like when people can&#039;t hide anymore? When flimsy arguments and speech that recognized as plainly false once you scan a persons soul, instantaneously, immediately, and without effort?","filename":"Tinder-e1443451532189-1024x512","ext":".png","w":1024,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490505852691,"time":1490505852,"md5":"+iEkfyJZmn8OCegFFiIo4Q==","fsize":52676,"resto":0,"id":"A2Jrtsc6","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ive-noticed-something-strange","country_name":"Poland","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":118325253,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:35:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Respond to my thread \/pol\/","filename":"vg","ext":".jpg","w":206,"h":204,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":123,"tim":1490506507042,"time":1490506507,"md5":"H7DJ8EL9FnHWPls\/m9OZOQ==","fsize":15159,"resto":118324295,"id":"A2Jrtsc6","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":118325721,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:40:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118324295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118324295<\/a><br>you&#039;re getting thirsty and sliding yes to more girls and\/or lower class girls probably","time":1490506855,"resto":118324295,"id":"YKCOVFY8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118325840,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:42:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118324295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118324295<\/a><br>Youre being stupid.<br>I mean this factually, not malevolently.<br>You need to understand that correlation is not causation.","time":1490506946,"resto":118324295,"id":"WOA6WE2V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118325889,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:43:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118325721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118325721<\/a><br>This<br>\/thread","time":1490506981,"resto":118324295,"id":"yf\/4GiYj","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118325910,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:43:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118324295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118324295<\/a><br>its ahh, the universe, like, responding, to like, ah your,,, desires ,, and stuff,, my man, like...,., if you want more sex,, and uh,, u havnt masturbated,, then,, like you,,, put uh out like a uhm, ah a different vibe maannn","time":1490506992,"resto":118324295,"id":"cVv5c65T","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118326029,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:44:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118325721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118325721<\/a><br>this<br><br>you&#039;re probably drinking more too, the dick is strong","time":1490507071,"resto":118324295,"id":"SSUh6+yy","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118326067,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:44:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118325721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118325721<\/a><br>I thought of that.<br><br>I always swipe approve on these apps and I use them everyday.

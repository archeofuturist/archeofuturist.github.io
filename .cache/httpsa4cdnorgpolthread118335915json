There will be influences yes, but it would never amount to cultures being completely eradicated. One reason for this is because of tourism. Why the fuck would I dish out cash to leave my culture to go to another culture exactly like mine? This would do some economic damage to cultures. On the other hand, I&#039;m probably more like to visit other cultures if mass communication influences them enough to be tourist\/traveler friendly (side-by-side translations at tourist sides, accommodations, AirBnB, etc.).","time":1490514914,"resto":118335915,"id":"OBZexGml","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118336441,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:56:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118335915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118335915<\/a><br>I do believe that globalism is inevitable for what you just said.

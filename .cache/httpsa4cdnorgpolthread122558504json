Sometimes simplicity is exactly what you need.<br><br>As for your first post&#039;s examples, when you call someone &quot;wrong&quot; flat out, they will become so defensive that they will shut down, and you cannot regain any control or sway over them. Respect that they THINK they are right, and instead lead them to believe you both agree on what is the truth, then tell them what the right answer is.<br><br>If they THINK they just &quot;got away&quot; with fooling you, and they just learned they were wrong before, and they just learned the right answer from you, but they BELIEVE that you think they knew the right answer all along, not only will they agree with you, they will remain open now to anything further you have to say, while you continue to feed them their &quot;new&quot; opinions, and that will make them are more easily persuaded by you in the future. If they believe you respect them, and believe that you think they are smart, they will do anything to protect that status quo, even to the point of being as unreasonable about is as they would have been if you called them wrong (closing their minds and getting angry).<br><br>If you think this is a dumb book, then clearly you went in thinking you are too smart than you actually are, and you have your own problem with pride that you should confront, because it&#039;s making you weaker if you can&#039;t set it aside long enough to absorb generally great information.","filename":"IMG_2272","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":443,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493022367100,"time":1493022367,"md5":"DElS3pOboz0hF+W9Ul5eHg==","fsize":27563,"resto":122558504,"id":"qjj3V9tY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122565157,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:58:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Believe in me cuz I believe in you, tonight...","filename":"is that you styx","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":499,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493024283631,"time":1493024283,"md5":"5fCb6JalkKboOVcDOMuyUg==","fsize":68529,"resto":122558504,"id":"54xlZa8p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122565324,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:00:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122558504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122558504<\/a><br>most people are UTTER FOOOKIN MORONS ans so it follows that most advice is UOOOTTTER FOOKING SHIIITE","time":1493024434,"resto":122558504,"id":"sclmhQLx","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122565454,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:02:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122558504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122558504<\/a><br><br>&#039;How to try being a Sociopath&#039; -The book.","time":1493024553,"resto":122558504,"id":"ujOSDbvD","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":122565619,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:05:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122562976\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122562976<\/a><br>this you don&#039;t just go up to some black dude and call him a nigger, you slowly teach him he is a nigger","time":1493024704,"resto":122558504,"id":"OpNLmu1r","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122565651,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:05:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122559441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122559441<\/a><br>breh you need to brainstorm wtf you wanna do. <br><br>If you&#039;re not a trust fund kiddie, find a way to make money (by getting a degree in a good paying field or learning a trade or learning about starting your own business)<br><br>Bitches come and go afterwards.","time":1493024729,"resto":122558504,"id":"c5bkuosP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122565715,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:06:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s a great book, it&#039;s your fault you don;t understand it.","time":1493024791,"resto":122558504,"id":"bsCSvSLt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122565755,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:07:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122558504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122558504<\/a><br>This book is fucking gold.

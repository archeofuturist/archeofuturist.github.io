He was very frank, and happy to answer my questions. I told him why I was interested(knowledge\/math\/geometry\/<wbr>God\/history\/America) and he seemed to understand. He dispelled some myths about the level of control they have, and have had. He dispelled the stories about Freemasons recruiting, and rushing people through the steps for dwindling dues. He told me that Freemasons NEVER recruit, it&#039;s against their laws. He told me to keep an eye out for bumper stickers that read &quot;I can&#039;t tell you, but you can ask.&quot; He confirmed that Freemasonry requires a belief in a creator(he reluctantly admitted they call Him the &quot;Grand Architect.&quot; He also told me that Freemasonry requires a belief in the in the &quot;immortality of the soul.&quot; I really dug that.<br>We talked about the role of Freemasons. I told him I wasn&#039;t too interested in good deeds, to help mankind. I told him that, if the gist of Freemasonry is feeding the poor, I&#039;m not a good fit. He responded cryptically, implying that they don&#039;t help the helpless, so to speak.<br>We spoke of what the &quot;ancient secrets&quot; really are. Pretty much just language, and math. Many of us already know the &quot;ancient secrets&quot;(STEM!). Most of us seem to not recognize their value.<br><br>Anyway, I&#039;m going to the din-din with the illuminated. Gunna be interesting, and at worst, I&#039;ll get a free meal. And you&#039;d have to break my arm before I pay a due, for knowledge I can Google, or buy in the Goodwill book bin.","filename":"da_vinci_thumb[1]","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":432,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490906651349,"time":1490906651,"md5":"snqdbvKyjIEXMjcZ0LhTvw==","fsize":294931,"resto":0,"id":"Q9uG+hra","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-having-dinner-at-the-scotish-rite-of","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118966450,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:48:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m expecting something like this, for dinner, as there are Prince Hall Freemasons:<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9Pn<wbr>OG67flRA","time":1490906922,"resto":118965839,"id":"Q9uG+hra","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118966530,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)16:49:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nice blog post.

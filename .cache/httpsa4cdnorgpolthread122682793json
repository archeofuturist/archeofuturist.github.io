It&#039;s literally a blank slate of a person, and its personal wants and desires will be created from its surrounding environment. And the reason political elites are choosing careers for people, is because of the division of labor at work. They understand the economy better than everyone else because they&#039;re specialized in it. If you let everyone choose whatever they wanted to do with their lives, it may not be in the best interests of the economy as a whole, while a person in charge with actual technical knowledge of the economy could assign jobs not based on that persons wants and desires, but for the health of the economy as a whole. <br><br><a href=\"#p122683963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122683963<\/a><br>You&#039;ve just stated an observation, not your reasoning behind making that observation.

At the start of high school children are given three paths: University, blue collar and white collar (not too sure about the last one).

A society that allows many freedoms for their people to enjoy all the luxuries they want, and also not to work so hard, would allow a very happy population. But another competing society, which invested its resources away from creating luxuries and making individual people happy, but instead diverted it into more practical things like agriculture, science, and warfare, while making its people work more, would have a much less happy population for sure, but a stronger economy overall. This competing society could probably dominate the other more decadent society in warfare, and conquer it. The people in this luxurious society wouldn&#039;t be happy then, they would be dead. That&#039;s when I decided the merit of a society would be based on how it can remain stable and resist being conquered.

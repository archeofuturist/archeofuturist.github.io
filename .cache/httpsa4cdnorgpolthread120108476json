If you&#039;ve ever been on \/v\/ you will be familiar with Gamergate and how Reddit is often used as a scapegoat to demonize one side of an argument (namely the less preferable or profitable one.) Anyone who is pro-Trump will be accused of browsing Reddit and\/or labelled one of the same four general terms. In fact this very thread will likely be accused of Reddit somehow, most likely by a bot who didn&#039;t actually read it.<br><br>Of course much of it is natural shitposting because at least 50% of \/pol\/ is comprised of idiots who don&#039;t actually care about politics. But be aware that even a mediocre astroturf group can inject themselves into a narrative and convince stupid people the board is overwhelmingly biased toward one position.","filename":"1226533825207","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":400,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491640621800,"time":1491640621,"md5":"vtX+F\/02caqKk7GFZb0oRQ==","fsize":35042,"resto":0,"id":"TcjWtEk5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-youre-witnessing-presently-is-maximum","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120108555,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)04:38:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"keke cums","filename":"1491529280063","ext":".jpg","w":844,"h":844,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491640705540,"time":1491640705,"md5":"9WMee42vUfUEIa7q1bffAg==","fsize":1024514,"resto":120108476,"id":"+zOT\/AyV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120108654,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)04:40:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120108555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120108555<\/a><br><br>Observed","time":1491640801,"resto":120108476,"id":"TcjWtEk5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

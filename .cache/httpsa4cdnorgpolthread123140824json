Especially if both parents are people who are incapable of having children. I also think with modern families that tend to be small; people who are able to procreate should only adopt if it will not deprive them of having another offspring with their DNA.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do you feel about less fortunate children?<\/span><br><br>Why would their parents income be listed on a adoption website? Or do you mean crack babies? If you look on our government&#039;s official adoption website, almost all the kids have a fucked up disability and they are almost always black. It made me rage that drugged up niggers were plopping turds on the ground and leaving them for the government to pick up.<br><br>I want to adopt, but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s evil I don&#039;t want to adopt a fucking life time of medical bills too. I want a healthy white baby. I might have to adopt from a European country to do that.

I like the idea of smarter races adopting dumber races and improving them.

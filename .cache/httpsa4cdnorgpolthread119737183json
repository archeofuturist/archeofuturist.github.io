The Second World War didn\u2019t preserve America\u2019s freedom. America\u2019s freedom was never threatened by Germany. Hitler could not even have imagined taking away America\u2019s freedom. His war against America was entirely defensive. America the aggressor. The U.S. Army invaded Germany and took away Germany\u2019s freedom, not the other way around. There was never the slightest danger that Hitler would invade America.","filename":"1463312426159","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":523,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":186,"tim":1491481362491,"time":1491481362,"md5":"Wjq14SZtQdbZPoTnXTRmTg==","fsize":58890,"resto":0,"id":"0BZ6jf9t","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"that-the-second-world-war-was-necessary-and-good","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

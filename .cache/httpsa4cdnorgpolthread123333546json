Humans are BILLIONS of years old and are NOT NATIVE to Earth. The notion of billions of years old humans is utterly possible as long as you consider humans as being colonisers of Earth. There&#039;s a book by Ellis Silver called &#039;Humans Are Not From Earth: A Scientific Evaluation Of The Evidence&#039;. He says (among other things) that sunburn, our relatively high chance of experiencing back pain and pain during labour are types of evidence that Earth is not an optimal environment for human beings and that we come from elsewhere.<br><br>My theory regarding the origin of humanity is that the human species comes from elsewhere in the Milky Way galaxy and, at some point in the distant past, our earliest ancestors colonised vast swathes of the Milky Way galaxy (and are possibly still doing so) and both Mars and Earth were colonised by them along the way. There are pyramidal structures and a Sphinx-like object in various NASA photos of Mars. I also think that a fiercely destructive interplanetary war caused the destruction of a planet that used to exist between Mars and Jupiter, leaving only the asteroid belt that we know today. This war also sterilised Mars, turning what was once a lush, verdant, Earth-like planet into a cold, lifeless desert.","filename":"pleiadians","ext":".png","w":500,"h":687,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493474053168,"time":1493474053,"md5":"QuzGbJKfKVH3LFA8Af9FMQ==","fsize":830607,"resto":123333546,"id":"gQF4ix77","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123335166,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)09:54:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;you wanna know what REALLY holds atoms together? <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;JESUS! <\/span><br><br>oh wow","time":1493474054,"resto":123333546,"id":"UvP05KQL","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123335275,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)09:55:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123333823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123333823<\/a><br>The 212MYr skull in question is 1.8MYr and not a &quot;normal&quot; human skull by any means.

In Idaho, for example, a 2-million-year-old clay figurine was unearthed in 1912. But even this discovery does not mark an outer limit. Bones, vertebrae and even complete skeletons have been found in Italy, Argentina and Kenya. Their minimum datings range from 3 million to 4 million years.

The chances against this are ASTRONOMICAL.<br>The first flowering plants also appear in the fossil record fully formed. Although we have an abundance of fossils of the earlier, non-flowering species, not a single one of these can be described as an intermediate form on the evolutionary path to flowers. At one point, there were no flowering plants. At another, flowering plants were all over the place.<br>You find exactly the same bizarre pattern in the animal kingdom.<br>The earliest fish with spines and brains appeared some 450 million years ago. In all the many curious lifeforms discovered in the sea, they had no apparent evolutionary ancestors. According to orthodox doctrine, the cartilaginous skeleton found in the certain fish - like the ray - gradually evolved into a bony skeleton. The fossil record shows cartilaginous fish appeared (without apparent ancestors) 75 million years AFTER bony fish.<br>Orthodox doctrine also insists fish with jaws gradually evolved from jawless varieties. The fossil record shows nothing of that sort. Fish with jaws suddenly appeared, with no discernible ancestry. Furthermore, these jawed fish somehow evolved into one jawless species - the lamprey - despite the fact that jawlessness is supposed to be a characteristic destined to be selected out of the life stream.

The orthodox theory suggests that they evolved from a single, tree-dwelling, shrew-like creature that expanded into the niche left when the dinosaurs perished. There was indeed such a creature, but the fossil record gives no indication whatsoever that it evolved into anything. Instead, 10 million years after the dinosaurs disappeared, a dozen or so separate and distinct mammalian species turn up without warning in the fossil record... in areas as distinct as South America, Africa and Asia.

Italian scientist Pier Luigi Ighina energetically transformed a living apricot tree into an apple tree, actually causing the fruits on the branches to metamorphose from apricots into apples in only sixteen days. Ighina also zapped a rat with DNA-wave information from a cat, and this caused the rat to grow a cat-like tail in four days.","time":1493474858,"resto":123333546,"id":"gQF4ix77","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123336290,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)10:07:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123333546\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123333546<\/a><br>Lol this shit makes me laugh","time":1493474866,"resto":123333546,"id":"JRbyfxvh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123336308,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)10:08:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123333546\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123333546<\/a><br>Young Earth Creationism is a cult, along with KJV-Onlyism.<br>It isn&#039;t Christianity.","time":1493474882,"resto":123333546,"id":"eS6Nt7Ia","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123336393,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)10:09:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123336159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123336159<\/a><br>There is no &quot;micro-evolution&quot; and &quot;macro-evolution&quot;.

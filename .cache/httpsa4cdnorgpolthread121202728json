So I&#039;m asking \/pol\/ not from a state of ignorance but genuine curiosity as to the nature of my personal observations.<br><br>In my experience they are more tolerable than shitskins of all variety but absolutely unequal mentally to white people. We all know the meme that Asians have high IQ. We observe that they have somewhat of a drive toward measurable personal achievement, and that they strictly abide by a general moral code albeit an overly collectivist one. These are undeniably positive cultural traits and in the end they are the redeeming aspects of gooks. <br><br>However any mildly intelligent white person is unable to avoid the concurrent observation that even highly Americanized Asians are nearly invariably boring\/intellectually empty\/humorless\/conformist\/milqueto<wbr>ast retards. In my adult life I&#039;ve distanced myself from nearly all of my friendly relationships with Asian-Americans in most cases it became unmistakably obvious that I had literally grown beyond their level of discourse. My Asian friends who were formerly comparatively bright and studious still seemingly posses the intellectual independence and critical-thinking ability of highschool students despite their often high qualifications. Also, as far as I can tell Asian-Americans don&#039;t tend to have much interest in English literature which would certainly put a severe limit on their intellectual growth.<br><br>So what the fuck is wrong with Asians? Your thoughts are appreciated \/pol\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 leafchang babbyrage<\/span>","filename":"chang","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":187,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492257227822,"time":1492257227,"md5":"+3RX1sOinDDzUKSE0vkqcQ==","fsize":9659,"resto":0,"id":"e7LdWtcq","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"help-me-pinpoint-exactly-what-is-wrong-with","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121205438,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:30:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"You are what you eat, you dog.","time":1492259435,"resto":121202728,"id":"0RRSJGiE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

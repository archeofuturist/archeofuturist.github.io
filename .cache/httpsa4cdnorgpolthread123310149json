Only recently have we really started to hear of how deeply his power had reached in his peak; he had moles in every damn office in the police, the DAS (local FBI, so to say), the army, the Ministries, etc. It&#039;s still amazing that he didn&#039;t manage to take over the country because he really could have. Watergate is nothing compared to what he had set up here. <br>As for the hippos, well, he liked exotic things. Escobar brought five or six of them along with other animals; since his farm was basically a colder Africa without lions, the hippos had amazing success. Last year, local authorities had to kill some of them because there are 30 hippos already, and they&#039;re killing the cows that get near.","time":1493454054,"resto":123310149,"id":"rY4ZTSfk","country":"CO","country_name":"Colombia"},{"no":123313370,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)04:29:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123312932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123312932<\/a><br>The money is also famous, I guess.

Strangers have taken me to task in angry letters for focusing \u2018only\u2019 on Jewish deaths and ignoring the five million others. When I explain that this number is simply inaccurate, in fact made up, they become even more convinced of my ethnocentrism and inability to feel the pain of anyone but my own people.\u201d<\/span>","time":1493002348,"resto":122531342,"id":"fCObRH8s","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122531911,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:53:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122531342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122531342<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;prove a negative for me \/pol\/ !<\/span><br>you&#039;re probably the 10th dimwitted kike who&#039;s made the same thread this week","filename":"1482985895333","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":719,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493002427943,"time":1493002427,"md5":"\/lHFbw226mDgmMUdr4ziUg==","fsize":110841,"resto":122531342,"id":"ofLQ1UN1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122532174,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:56:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hmm maybe this could explain why so many &quot;survivors&quot; were lying","filename":"Holocaust Survivor Debunked 1","ext":".png","w":557,"h":437,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":98,"tim":1493002567465,"time":1493002567,"md5":"DE791w6i22aHC71+Gi3ZGA==","fsize":169115,"resto":122531342,"id":"fCObRH8s","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122532256,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:56:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122531911\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122531911<\/a><br>look im not here to start a shit storm you are the exact reason i made this thread cause when ever this question is asked people like you react with violent angry outbursts<br><br>im never given facts just yelling","time":1493002608,"resto":122531342,"id":"HUcL7rq5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122532443,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:58:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122531342\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122531342<\/a>","filename":"jewishpopulation","ext":".png","w":1300,"h":868,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493002702689,"time":1493002702,"md5":"FlU2Xf6RlMFewZuvfsS3\/g==","fsize":2182372,"resto":122531342,"id":"rj22ACGF","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122532627,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)22:59:53","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Jewish population before and after the holocaust","ext":".png","w":698,"h":1600,"tn_w":54,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493002793855,"time":1493002793,"md5":"N5C467tkPkBH9DYx7zbQuw==","fsize":1217870,"resto":122531342,"id":"fCObRH8s","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

campaign. The republican congress voted to stop new regulations from going into effect in 2018. nothing has become legal. things that are legal will remain legal. Largely, your information is still protected by the Cable Act, although those protections are not adequate, obviously<br>Do we need a lot of the Section III regulations? Yeah, maybe, but not really and I can explain why but first... Whether or not you think Section III is the best way to go about solving our privacy crisis, are you really comfortable with Section II and Section IV? The FCC wants to seize broad and open-ended power over regulation of the internet and establish what could only be described as a Internet Police Force. Yeah, thank you republican congress for stopping the expansion of more government... Why I don&#039;t think we need the Section III regulations... We have the means and methods to actually protect our data. So, the idea of an agency to enforce these privacy rights, that can be made truly secure.. It&#039;s like, rather than locking my door, we&#039;re going to finance a global paratrooper agency to stop people from walking in houses?<br><br> The most feasible final solution to privacy is to remove the FCC&#039;s ruling that ISPs can&#039;t charge a fee for privacy.

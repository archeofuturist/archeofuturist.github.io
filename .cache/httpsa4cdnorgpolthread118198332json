Post WW2, old vertical monopolies were crushed by decree, and instead, horizontal groupings were formed. The economy was liberalized a bit, but real power still resides in the bureaucracy. However, they knew what to do. Low value of yen and free access to western markets allowed massive arbitrage and growth. This undervaluation was finally ended in the 80&#039;s, at US demand (plaza accord), and the yen was allowed to appreciate against the dollar, ending the export boom. The credit boom ended soon as well.<br>The party is over, 90&#039;s and 00&#039;s were the hangover. Insanely high public debt remains, though. At least their debt is nominated in yen and mostly held by institutional investors, who can be politically controlled.","time":1490427204,"resto":118198332,"id":"IaGFfnXA","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118200667,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)03:34:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118199444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118199444<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Provide cheap labor<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;never get rid of them<\/span>","time":1490427245,"resto":118198332,"id":"kyPBBK\/a","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118200774,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)03:35:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118198573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118198573<\/a><br>Quaddafi had a hard life. <br><br>Seriously, what did obama have against secular government in the middle east? <br><br>You&#039;d think he&#039;d want even more islamist shitholes. <br><br>Really weird from him.","time":1490427346,"resto":118198332,"id":"6Ol19gNz","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118201107,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)03:41:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118198332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118198332<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Poland<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;first world power<\/span><br><br>Oh Pajeet, not so early please","filename":"Kek","ext":".png","w":600,"h":528,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1490427662968,"time":1490427662,"md5":"11pXq\/56OEKm632w9+hiyQ==","fsize":212856,"resto":118198332,"id":"znxp8sXM","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118201165,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)03:41:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"South Korea too","time":1490427719,"resto":118198332,"id":"L7RSaXWI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118201531,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)03:48:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118198768\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118198768<\/a>","filename":"1413342751474","ext":".jpg","w":280,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1490428091251,"time":1490428091,"md5":"fHJ2goZ4yZxypxfXGeRc4Q==","fsize":15274,"resto":118198332,"id":"u3yTrgmT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118202001,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)03:56:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118198332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118198332<\/a><br>Poland isn&#039;t first world dipshit.","filename":"1484558928347","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490428563333,"time":1490428563,"md5":"z79NEDzj4UZwwMnbDcK9DQ==","fsize":87821,"resto":118198332,"id":"bbfXh2Ek","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118202158,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)03:58:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118198332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118198332<\/a><br>Poland, first world power?<br>hooooo","time":1490428724,"resto":118198332,"id":"RqKBaWUs","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118202389,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:02:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118198332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118198332<\/a><br>Just hold on there, chap. <br><br>I think you went too far with this kind of bollocks.

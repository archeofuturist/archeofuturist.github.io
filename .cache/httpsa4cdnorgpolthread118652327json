Honestly it&#039;s almost like a placebo but at the same time it isn&#039;t. When you aren&#039;t addicted to nicotine and you take a deep breath, you calm yourself. Slightly. Right?<br><br>When that deep breath involves a chemical that your body gets and registers the situation as &#039;alright&#039;, the calming effect is amplified. Just something to keep your emotions from punching your kidneys. If you have good internal discipline you dont need it or really see the usefulness behind it, but if you haven&#039;t mastered those parts of yourself it&#039;s a good way to regulate.<br><br>It&#039;s like a hobby you use to trick your own body chemistry to chill the fuck out, and just like any hobby it costs money.","time":1490711964,"resto":118652327,"id":"Es\/Sl9CF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118654616,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)10:41:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118652327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118652327<\/a><br>you can do whatever the fuck you want<br>also how is this politics even slightly","time":1490712081,"resto":118652327,"id":"\/HtGAuVh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118654869,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)10:43:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fucking Mike Mnemonic, what do you smoke that gives so much vapor?","time":1490712227,"resto":118652327,"id":"6sKrfoPJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

What makes you think that even if these people were elected they would be able to change anything that happens in their countries? From what I&#039;ve read none of these people are suggesting repatriation of arabs back to the middle east, or deporting already imprisoned terrorists because &quot;muh freedumbs&quot; always stops them.<br><br>It seems they are just as committed to expanding the secret state and making silent arrests on potential terrorists. But what happens once arab population (which is already generating enough terrorist cells to warrant 500 investigations in my own country) reaches 20%, or 30% or even 50%! Stop believing these politicians will save us, or your families. Europe in the 21st century will be based on trying not to drown in our own blood.","filename":"BhdIrmXCUAUf9JF","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":900,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490608628078,"time":1490608628,"md5":"qRnV9HggaOHj0iUI2qGEaA==","fsize":72950,"resto":0,"id":"qB0lYx62","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"question-for-pol","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

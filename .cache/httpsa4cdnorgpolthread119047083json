If you get like an artsy sleeve or chest piece of some kind because it looked cool and means nothing to you, you&#039;re still degenerate. Examples being Asian dragons, tribal, gang shit. However, military are exempt from these because the tattoos have actual meaning and there is a huge tattoo culture in the military. That said tattoos that have deep personal meaning or relevance to you are acceptable. Religious or cultural are pretty common.

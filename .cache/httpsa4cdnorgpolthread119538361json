If you believe animals are simply red-blooded automatons then what&#039;s the difference between fucking a dog and fucking a couch cushion?<br><br>2. IF you believe animals have agency, then that means that they do have the ability to consent to sex...you just assume you can&#039;t know it. but animals give signals to mates through body language and actually understanding animal behavior you can tell whether a female is a consenting or not...the dog not growling at you would be a sign. <br><br>3. Currently, zoosexuals have little in way of protection in their sexual encounters. Some animals that people are attracted to could harm them during sex... taking away the stigma would enable companies to invent a way for people to have safe sex with their horse to prevent deaths. <br><br>4. It used to not only be legal but socially acceptable in ancient times.<br><br>5. sexual diseases between humans and animals are actually rare. <br><br>6. Zoosexuals don&#039;t control what they are attracted too.<br><br>7. Animals don&#039;t hold the same stigma against us<br><br>8. IT&#039;s a personal choice, <br><br>9. Many countries have legalized it and it didn&#039;t destroy society. <br><br>10. It&#039;ll remove the stigma to create chimeras. experimenting","filename":"340d53f4b5ba42cc82b2f4c1d586e8ab","ext":".png","w":300,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491350815443,"time":1491350815,"md5":"cRJqgSxZw0\/ZyRoKdtHfeA==","fsize":73728,"resto":0,"id":"Ikx2cOZq","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bestiality-should-be-legal","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":8},{"no":119538554,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)20:08:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119538361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119538361<\/a><br><br>OUT OUT OUT <br><br>BAN THE SHILLS SAGE WAR NOW","time":1491350921,"resto":119538361,"id":"D49xleN8","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119538577,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)20:08:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump cause I just want to see \/pol discuss this.<br><br>For me, bestiality is sick af but idc if other people do it","time":1491350935,"resto":119538361,"id":"hPOArrsn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119538639,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)20:09:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"So long as the animal is consenting (yes, animals can consent) then I don&#039;t care.

He&#039;s not a God-Emperor, he&#039;s not the savior of the white race, he&#039;s a successful businessman who ran for President under a popular campaign message.<br><br>I see these people claiming, essentially, if you&#039;re not dickriding Trump 100% and hold him accountable for his misdoings, that you&#039;re a shill, you&#039;re sowing dissent among the ranks, ect. Don&#039;t get having a genuine problem with this Syria fiasco confused with being suddenly wtf I hate Trump now, as the le roddit faggots (who should die of some horrible flesh-eating disease) would have you believe. They have a hard-on for this place and will say anything to try and make people on here eat each other. <br><br>These people haven&#039;t a leg to stand on. They just spout &quot;shill&quot; when Trump clearly went back on his word on this matter. It&#039;s not underwater backgammon or hyperdimensional hungry hungry hippos or w\/e the fuck until he proves otherwise. It would be wise to act as if it isn&#039;t on this matter, don&#039;t support neo-con actions no matter who it is doing it. If it&#039;s 64D multiversal parcheesi then good, all is forgiven, but I ain&#039;t about to supporting someone who could be towing the kike line full force.<br><br>A large part of what he ran on was non-intervention foreign policy. Hold his feet to the fire. Doesn&#039;t mean you gotta fucking hate the guy, just don&#039;t cuck for a neo-con agenda just because you can&#039;t break out of a cult of personality mindset.","filename":"0466 - hQTpp46","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":237,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":237,"tim":1492073098637,"time":1492073098,"md5":"poZKQ7V4xBfkBlk7Iy4hZA==","fsize":42009,"resto":0,"id":"Cr33MQWs","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-is-getting-out-of-hand","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

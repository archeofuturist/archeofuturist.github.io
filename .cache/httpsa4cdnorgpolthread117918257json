I don&#039;t know how it is in Austria, but the general populace to too fucking retarded to have a say in things. I used to have very high minded ideals and believe whole-heartedly in democracy. Then I got a job in retail and customer service to work my way through college. The majority of people are disgusting, self-centered, lazy, and just plain dumb. The basic foundational presumption of liberalism is false. People are not rational. The aberage bubba bill or blue-haired cunt should not be allowed to dictate policy on anything. However, I reside in the quasi-democratic republic camp only because it does only the 15% of people who care about issues to have a say in politics and there has yet to be a better &quot;freer&quot; system.","time":1490266827,"resto":117918257,"id":"H5RxdsB\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117922442,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)07:52:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117918872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117918872<\/a><br>This.","time":1490269976,"resto":117918257,"id":"s6Zby0PQ","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"}]}

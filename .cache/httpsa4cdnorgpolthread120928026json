just an outsider from \/int\/ and I&#039;m not aware of or following any of the small details of the war but I&#039;ve always leaned towards assad in preference. Disappointed with trump obviously. <br><br>But the thing is any middle easterner I&#039;ve talked to doesn&#039;t have much good to say about assad. I mean I&#039;ve talked to leftist &quot;westernizer&quot; types who hate him of course, but even people who are pan-arabist, or christian, or whatever else seem to dislike him and don&#039;t even see the &quot;he&#039;s the best option&quot; argument as legitimate. <br><br>It&#039;s very easy for me here in my chair far removed from things to get fired up about how assad is the rightful president and the west has no place forcing any ideology on another country etc, but at the same time I just can&#039;t believe that every single horror story about assad is fabricated. So many people hate him and if that wasn&#039;t the case his country wouldn&#039;t be in total chaos. <br><br>I have confirmation bias already and know the answer I want since I&#039;m asking in this thread of all places, but still, how can you justify supporting him when there&#039;s obviously SOMETHING quite immoral he&#039;s doing (if barrel bombs and chemical attacks are exaggerations, I still have no doubt he&#039;s not afraid to get rid of certain people even if they&#039;re a so far innocent civilian), when the opinion of middle easterners on him is negative, and when the capacity for human cruelty in a general sense in large and he as a human is not exempt from it? Is he sincere and with true ideology behind his rule or is he just blind directionless authoritarianism, is he just a dictator or is he a well meaning dictator?","time":1492102520,"resto":120928026,"id":"YsDYJuup","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120931087,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:55:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120930903\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120930903<\/a><br>gif please","time":1492102545,"resto":120928026,"id":"igO862Ee","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120931098,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:55:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120930723\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120930723<\/a><br>SOON","filename":"liberacion de alepo 1","ext":".png","w":893,"h":652,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1492102550745,"time":1492102550,"md5":"dovmp2MN98KgbvQbVlQG5Q==","fsize":935632,"resto":120928026,"id":"anhPQEtW","country":"PE","country_name":"Peru"},{"no":120931190,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:56:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120930333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120930333<\/a><br>Trips make it even truer!","filename":"1491316302659-pol","ext":".jpg","w":1268,"h":1695,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492102592539,"time":1492102592,"md5":"FlmERmmXRPq\/uy+ssGjMag==","fsize":217024,"resto":120928026,"id":"WYGCXwPh","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120931208,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:56:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120930723\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120930723<\/a><br>Also can you imagine the butthurt and outcry if they actually drop a FOAB in Syria now too? kek this is going to be epic.","time":1492102602,"resto":120928026,"id":"EYNSt1p\/","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":120931236,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:56:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120930414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120930414<\/a><br>Testing new weapons my friend","time":1492102619,"resto":120928026,"id":"rZScNc8l","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":120931268,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:57:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120931048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120931048<\/a><br>Our Syrianbros say mostly it&#039;s either him, or goat-loving, head-chopping backward jihadis, and I believe them.<br>For me he&#039;s the best choice because that&#039;s the only way for Christians to survive in the Levant.","time":1492102636,"resto":120928026,"id":"sZ9yc5W3","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120931281,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:57:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120930634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120930634<\/a><br>Thought you all had freedom of speech?

He was less of a secularist too. Shit maybe he posts in this thread, name tn\/algg with french flag. And obviously that&#039;s not syrian but I&#039;d value his opinion far more than any outsider to the culture. Like others are saying, it&#039;s a bad idea to lump everyone there together, but you can&#039;t look at it as something entirely self contained in the arbitrary borders of &quot;syria&quot; either. Any middle easterner especially arab,connected with the culture, will have something better to say. <br><br>And look yeah if he&#039;s sunni he won&#039;t like him but doesn&#039;t that say something about the nature of assad and his government. That even if he&#039;s entirely secular, that conflict still leaks through, and nothing can be done about it. <br><br><a href=\"#p120932129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120932129<\/a><br>That&#039;s assuming the goal is a multicultural syria. This is going to sound edgy and retarded but one person I was talking to about the small religious and cultural conflicts within syria suggested syria do what &quot;you did with the indians&quot;. Which was good rhetorically, because it forced me to consider the benefit of genocide for the greater good of a perhaps mostly sunni, all arab state as an actual viable option that he was legitimately unironically suggesting, but then he said &quot;but realistically we&#039;ll just assimilate the minorities&quot; which honestly seems like a good idea","time":1492104198,"resto":120928026,"id":"YsDYJuup","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120934438,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)13:23:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120934088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120934088<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;responding to copypasta<\/span><br>Aussie pls","filename":"1484692175019","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":960,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492104215729,"time":1492104215,"md5":"49cUqgjButSP0bDSiee9GA==","fsize":53753,"resto":120928026,"id":"TKKW1GFi","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":120934440,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)13:23:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120933996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120933996<\/a><br>they&#039;ll dump cp in your pc and off you go","filename":"14514984525","ext":".jpg","w":550,"h":535,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1492104219772,"time":1492104219,"md5":"pTTzSY7dD5u4BTuwOrnLAg==","fsize":33474,"resto":120928026,"id":"qd6uwfqH","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120934642,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)13:25:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m just an outsider from \/fit\/ and I&#039;m not aware of or following any of the small details of the cook-off but I&#039;ve always leaned towards trans fat in preference.

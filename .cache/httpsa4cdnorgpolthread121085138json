Without effective guaranteed nuclear payload deliverance, MAD is thrown out the window. MAD was almost solely responsible for the decrease in hot, head on wars since WWII, with nuclear powers realizing that war would not be worth the potential risk of mutual annihilation. However, if ICBMs and nuclear missiles become mostly ineffective, then it opens up the possibility once again for conventional warfare between large-scale countries.<br><br>Since numerous anti-missile defense systems are being developed at the moment, shouldn&#039;t this concern us? We should think about how it will affect the world and its politics and if these systems are actually a good thing, or at least if their total effects will be net positive.","filename":"MissileDefenseSystem","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":585,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":243,"tim":1492190106244,"time":1492190106,"md5":"32Ze9oAdTGVD4YPZX8ZTjQ==","fsize":41071,"resto":0,"id":"MxrtIF1Q","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"antinuclear-defense-systems-and-mad","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":2,"unique_ips":11},{"no":121085334,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:16:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"Really made me think.","filename":"Star","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":585,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1492190215067,"time":1492190215,"md5":"cTWSvE15GXwqffsegsmWMQ==","fsize":100343,"resto":121085138,"id":"sdIVnQxG","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121085348,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:17:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Are you implying nuclear bombs are a permanent solution to war in the first place?

But the main thing to think about it this: will the pursuit of war be of any benefit? We live in a globalized world with a very interconnected economy, where money is king. Wars for their part are really, really expensive and history abounds with examples of states driving themselves to financial ruination from pursuing it. Also, there is the issue of mobilizing populations for war in a world where information is becoming harder and harder to control.<br>So what I think you might get is a increase of war in peripheral areas.

It doesn&#039;t offer room for intellectualism or fact-based refutation. It operates entirely on clickbait, imagery and quick replies, especially on the faster boards like \/pol\/.

This type of structure offers a much more intellectual-based dialog in which points can be refuted with facts and highlighted to be seen by many.

Trump was doomed from the moment he was sworn in as president. He&#039;s definitely trying to do what he set out to do, but absolutely NO ONE in the house or senate are working with him at all. Everything he&#039;s proposed is getting shot down, which brings to attention the main reason he will get nothing done and subsequently not win the next election: HE HAS NO FUCKING POLITICAL EXPERIENCE<br><br>I don&#039;t care what you say about him being &quot;the most successful modern tycoon&quot; knowing how to run a company YOU OWN is not the same as working with hundreds of people trying to agree on one thing. Making laws and passing bills isn&#039;t as simple as saying &quot;do it&quot; and having it be done, there are so many nuances you have to take into account even with just the language a bill is written in. If you don&#039;t have an idea of how to do that, you will not be successful as president.<br><br>Now that I&#039;m done with that little tangent, here&#039;s my opinion on the propaganda situation...<br><br>Never before has it been all the more obvious of how synthetic and lifeless comedy central has become as a business. They see all this hate for Trump and instantly shift all of their rhetoric to bash Trump because most of their viewers are FUCKING MILLENNIALS WHO ALREADY HATE TRUMP. Their a damn business so I don&#039;t blame them for doing this, but jesus christ they used to be a beacon of light when channels like TBS and MTV were beginning their descent into mediocrity. Now they&#039;ve adopted the idea that focus groups and viewer polls are like the magic conch because they&#039;re so afraid now of stepping outside of popular millennial opinion and stirring the pot. They&#039;ve dropped themselves into a rut of liberal opinion and nowhere has it been more obvious than the stupid commercials where Seth Notfunny and Amy Whaleface talk about the &quot;wage gap&quot;.<br><br>Face it, comedy central is a shell of its former self.","time":1493047674,"resto":122595216,"id":"G1DW8GB\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122598575,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)11:37:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122597322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122597322<\/a><br>Ran out of space so I&#039;ll talk a little bit now about the amount of disrespect that everyone is showing the president.<br><br>Yes, I wholeheartedly believe that the amount of flack Trump has gotten is not deserved. Would ANYONE have gotten in front of a camera, dressed as Obama, and made fun of simply the way he looks and talks? Fuck no. But that&#039;s also because Obama and pretty much every other president was known only as a politician or general before being elected. Trump was already a pop culture icon fading out of popularity, he&#039;s been the butt of god knows how many jokes long before he even announced running for president, so it&#039;s understandable that people aren&#039;t going to stop treating him like a pop culture icon after he gained a higher status.<br><br>Yes I understand free speech is important and being able to question and make fun of the system\/people in the system is even more important, but holy fuck guys can we just give the man a break already? He&#039;s already figured out at this point how big of a mistake it was to run for president so all he&#039;s gonna do now is try to make his voters happy and keep his head above water for the 4 years he&#039;ll be in office. <br><br>What I think is funny about all this though is how all these liberals think that they&#039;re stirring the pot and going against the system by burning the flag and making fun of Trump, but here&#039;s the goddamn thing...

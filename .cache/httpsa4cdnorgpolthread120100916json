The day I listen to a Swede about how my country should be ran is the day I go and bash my head in. <br><br>Russia and China are extremely aggressive countries. They are dictatorships, and ultimately they will do what is best for their own nations. I do not fault them for this or have any sort of hatred towards Russia\/China. I expect them to act in their best national interest, and that&#039;s exactly what they would do if America showed weakness. Russia under Putin invaded Ukraine because Obama showed weakness. These are dogs that will bite at any chance they get. <br><br>You may not know what it&#039;s like to have a government that actually works for your own best interests since you are Swedish, but in a normal country the government generally works to further the country&#039;s national interests at any cost. The United States keeps countries such as these in check. If you do not believe that the first thing China would do if the United States military was depleted would be to seize de facto control over the Pacific and to invade countries such as Taiwan, Japan, etc, then you are retarded.

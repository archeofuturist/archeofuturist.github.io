This is because when you become convinced that the entire cultural foundation of society is against you, but yet you were one of the very few to resist, it makes you feel greater than you actually are.<br><br>And so, we have a situation where the far left is being blamed for what is generally described as &quot;political correctness,&quot; despite its main proponents being centrists. The primary confusion stems from a rejection of any notion that perhaps capitalism itself is responsible for &quot;PC culture.&quot; This is because, in the long term, it is in the interests of capitalism to make everyone as equal as possible--to an extent. The caveat exists because it is indeed the case that capitalism feeds and promotes prejudice in general ranging from racism, sexism, etc. however, generally speaking, it is in the interests of the capitalist to have as much available labor as possible, which means that being inclusive in the workplace is an imperative.<br><br>This inclusiveness is only surface level at best. Workers are reduced to mere cogs in the machine and stripped of their individuality and identity. Hence, an effort is made to make workers feel comfortable and to not alienate minorities. However, this effort is, again, only surface level and only extends to things such as what words we use. In other words, political correctness is the natural result of capitalism.<br><br>To us, however, political correctness is merely the act of, well, not bring an ass.","filename":"karlmarx-head-side","ext":".jpg","w":683,"h":1024,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493006029727,"time":1493006029,"md5":"m91KCjJQjXx+ZEEe7+UK6A==","fsize":343603,"resto":0,"id":"D9H\/vPKw","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"with-the-phrase-cultural-marxism-being-slowly","country_name":"Australia","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122539466,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:00:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"You gotta admit - it&#039;s a pretty sweet picture right thar.","time":1493006415,"resto":122538764,"id":"D9H\/vPKw","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122540785,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)00:13:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122538764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122538764<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;With the phrase &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; being slowly replaced by &quot;regressive leftism,&quot;<\/span><br>you have that backwards. then after &quot;cultural marxism&quot;, the next red pill will be the concept of &quot;cultural bolshevism&quot;","time":1493007193,"resto":122538764,"id":"PHW7JqUV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

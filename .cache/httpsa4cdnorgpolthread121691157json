From what I understand his main point is that Russia wants to elevate itself into superpower status once again, and that Syria is a vehicle for propping itself up. It is unlikely that Russia is supporting the Syrian government for any moral reason, or because they truly believe that &quot;it&#039;s the only way to get rid of ISIS&quot;. At least, that is the assumption that CaspianReport makes, his recurring theme is that nations do not act except in self-interest, so what other self-interest would Russia have in supporting Syria, other than the theory that CaspianReport has proposed?<br><br>Well, I&#039;ve heard of theories of some sort of oil-gas pipeline through the mid-east, however I am not well-read enough on it to make a judgement.","time":1492527962,"resto":121691157,"id":"e0kA29K0","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

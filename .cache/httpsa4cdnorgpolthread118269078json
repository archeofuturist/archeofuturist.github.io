The best you can do is avoid bluedpilled activities such as spending your entire life in an office building for some marginally larger slave wage rather than finding a truer and honest purpose with ones daily existence. Get in touch with nature, chose a career that lets you breathe fresh air, get a wife and some kids and enjoy the good things in life such as travelling, eating at restaurants, enjoying the occasions that are in and between the good moments. If the redpill, however cringey it is, gets you down then you already passed on the opportunity to be happy. Being strong is powering trough the money mindset and free yourself from the mental prison that is warped around your mind. I recommend a tradtional family life with safe employment that lets you breathe fresh air everyday. <br><br>The first redpill is detattching yourself from consumerism and superficial needs. Take charge of what to value here in life.","time":1490477837,"resto":118269078,"id":"N9uKJAMp","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":118275663,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)17:37:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118269078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118269078<\/a><br>I&#039;m a jew and I say this board is made of awesome.","filename":"ixSdAMb","ext":".gif","w":696,"h":1034,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490477843495,"time":1490477843,"md5":"fJn9FM47PZBHlNhTvf8oFw==","fsize":64249,"resto":118269078,"id":"Uk81m7vO","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":118277343,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)17:52:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118273358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118273358<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I started lifting 2 months ago.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I got engaged last night.<\/span><br>so do you love him?","filename":"SIR_before_and_after_fit","ext":".jpg","w":1118,"h":708,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":79,"tim":1490478755684,"time":1490478755,"md5":"kMsrlghsP9lTgiXT6RcQUQ==","fsize":347586,"resto":118269078,"id":"XRuiJVAO","country":"AT","m_img":1,"country_name":"Austria"},{"no":118278605,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:03:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;118273717<\/span><br>wew lad, post this on voat","time":1490479413,"resto":118269078,"id":"21rhZrky","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

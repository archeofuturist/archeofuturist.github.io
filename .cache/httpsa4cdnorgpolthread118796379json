If both societies have chemical weapons, neither wants to suffer the effects of them, and so they agree to not use them unless either one breaks the agreement. That is why rules of war exist, they are useful to both parties in that scenario. If, however, one party loses the ability to even enforce their end of the bargain, if they for example lost their chemical weapons production or deployment capabilities, then the rules become worthless and the intelligent thing to do would be to gas them while they lack the ability to gas you back, which is usually what happens unless your military leaders are worthless idiots.<br><br>Rules of war should not exist when you are fighting some raghead retards with no means of causing massive damage upon your people or forces or even a willingness to agree to rules in the first place. There is zero reason to follow any rules of engagement when the enemy doesn&#039;t do the same, and furthermore even if they did follow rules of engagement there would still be no reason to follow them yourself if the enemy didn&#039;t have any means of keeping those rules in place such as in a mutually-assured destruction scenario.<br><br>The west cripples its own combat ability by actually following rules of engagement when dealing with these people, it&#039;s pretty infuriating. There should be zero mercy shown to an enemy incapable of actually preventing you from steamrolling them, it makes no sense.

Also, I think they were aware of certain groups (the Finders for instance) that run human smuggling operations, and wrote the show in accordance with what they know.<br><br>And that&#039;s the thing that made season one so good. It&#039;s not only plausible, but based on real-life. Season two is just a re-imagining of the atmosphere they built during season one. But it lacked the real-world depth and intrigue because it was just a weird mob story where tons of bad guys are competing for real estate contracts and shit.","time":1492435730,"resto":121519385,"id":"WvLZ4E09","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121525485,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)09:28:55","name":"CRANK","com":"<a href=\"#p121521551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121521551<\/a><br>What the fuck am I reading.","time":1492435735,"resto":121519385,"id":"ded37\/zY","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121525511,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)09:29:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;guys who&#039;s gonna tell him that&#039;s the joke?&quot; The thread<\/span><br><br>You guys do realize the niliism is constantly twisted in this show right?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lol god isn&#039;t real<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lol check out this thing that basically made me god and killed my humanity <\/span><br><br>Hmmm almonds","time":1492435750,"resto":121519385,"id":"B64998Jm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121525553,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)09:29:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"It is definitely a more liberal-leaning show.

What is it about the white race that condemns and demonizes our culture and roots? Is it feminism? Is that the real enemy? We come from deep and rich traditions. Laid on solid foundations over thousands of years. And yet. We marginalize and accept our fates pushed on us by industrialists and our banking overlords. And for what? The want of the all mighty dollar?<br><br>All around the globe our traditions are under siege. And we allow it. We pull back. And are still attacked. We pull back some more. And are invaded.<br><br>At what point does the love of who you are out weigh the love of money?<br><br>What do they want? All in the now? Even if it means niggers rule our future? Where is the sense of nation? The pride in race?<br><br>Do others get to take pride in their race. But not the whites? <br><br>These are thoughts I have. I&#039;m tired of the hate on our race. It is not warranted on those that live in the now. And I will not accept it.<br><br>If there was ever a time to come together.

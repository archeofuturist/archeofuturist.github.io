Charge missile infantry.<br>The Antifa make use of an old Roman and early-modern tactic of screening their lines with shitty troops (small women and nu-males) while people behind them throw rocks, explosives, and bottles. You can&#039;t see them or get to them, because the screen is in the way. This is also how Eric Clanton moved in to attack the dude with his bike lock, hiding behind for the right moment to strike. The right-wing needs to shut that shit down immediately. Get a group of guys together (at least 10) and charge en masse at the antifa lines. The antifa women will scatter, allowing you access to the fuckers in the back. Use shields and sticks to rain hell on these fuckers.<br><br>2. Organization<br>The above will be much easier with greater organization. In the early moments of the event (or preferably before), you should agree on a Commander and various Captains. Each captain leads a detachment of men (5-10). If the commander calls a charge, everyone pushes forward with shields and scatters the Antifa. Captains govern their men in the melee and can call mini-charges and move them tactically to respond to specific threats. This will help with pitched battles and will also help avoid antifa&#039;s #1 tactic: picking off individual guys and tripping them so eight other communists can stab and kick him on the ground.<br><br>3. Study Pre-Modern Fighting<br>Nobody&#039;s brought guns yet, so you&#039;re basically in pre-modern fight-mode, again. Look at the Roman legionary. Heavy shock infantry. When the legionaries charge, they throw javelins to soften up and disrupt the enemy formation. You should do the same. Every Defender should be armed with a can of bearspray, eyeprotection and a mask. As you move into charge, raise your bear spray and fire into the eyes of the Antifa. Empty the fucker if you want, or shoot for a few seconds then holster. This will disorientate and disrupt the antifa lines. Follow up the spray with your charge, with your shields and rubber batons\/flagpoles ready.","time":1492896732,"resto":122330359,"id":"3f4slLD9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122330582,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)17:33:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yes, the antifa are the enemy, not {[(those)]} behind the brainwashing, funding and proseliting.<br><br>No.","time":1492896812,"resto":122330359,"id":"FlFDX8Kk","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":122330736,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)17:34:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Helmets for fucks sake!!! can you guys wear helmets??","time":1492896882,"resto":122330359,"id":"pePXI5qg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122330816,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)17:35:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"The reason I keeps saying BEARSPRAY and not pepper spray is that BEARSPRAY fires in a straight line and has distance.

Use stars and stripes and eschew Nazi iconography. But the history of the Nazis and their rise to power is a useful historical instructor (especially because they were elected, unlike many right wing groups who take power).<br><br>From (((wikipedia))) on the Brownshirts:<br><br>&quot;The DAP (Deutsche Arbeiterpartei or German Workers&#039; Party) was formed in Munich in January 1919 and Adolf Hitler joined it in September of that year. His talents for speaking, publicity and propaganda were quickly recognized,[3] and by early 1920 he had gained authority in the party, which changed its name to the NSDAP (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei or National Socialist German Workers&#039; Party) in February 1920.[4]<br>The precursor to the SA had acted informally and on an ad hoc basis for some time before this. Hitler, with an eye always to helping the party to grow through propaganda, convinced the leadership committee to invest in an advertisement in the M\u00fcnchener Beobachter (later renamed the V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter) for a mass meeting in the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus, to be held on 16 October 1919. Some 70 people attended, and a second such meeting was advertised for 13 November in the Eberlbrau beer hall. Some 130 people attended; there were hecklers, but Hitler&#039;s military friends promptly ejected them by force, and the agitators &quot;flew down the stairs with gashed heads.&quot; The next year, on 24 February, he announced the party&#039;s Twenty-Five Point program at a mass meeting of some 2000 people at the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus. Protesters tried to shout Hitler down, but his former army companions, armed with rubber truncheons, ejected the dissenters. The basis for the SA had been formed.&quot;<br><br>Con. later.","filename":"Put the SA in USA","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":426,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492897063040,"time":1492897063,"md5":"7OWCEMnKQWFCdr7aGgVboA==","fsize":101317,"resto":122330359,"id":"3f4slLD9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122331242,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)17:38:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122331121\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122331121<\/a><br>A permanent group of party members who would serve as the ruffian Saalschutzabteilung (meeting hall protection detachment) for the DAP gathered around Emil Maurice after the February 1920 incident at the Hofbr\u00e4uhaus. There was little organization or structure to this group. The group was also called the Ordnertruppen around this time.[6] More than a year later, on 3 August 1921, Hitler redefined the group as the &quot;Gymnastic and Sports Division&quot; of the party (Turn- und Sportabteilung), perhaps to avoid trouble with the government.[7] It was by now well recognized as an appropriate, even necessary, function or organ of the party. The future SA developed by organizing and formalizing the groups of ex-soldiers and beer hall brawlers who were to protect gatherings of the Nazi Party from disruptions from Social Democrats (SPD) and Communists (KPD) and to disrupt meetings of the other political parties. By September 1921 the name Sturmabteilung was being used informally for the group.[8] Hitler was the official head of the Nazi Party by this time.[9]<br><br>On 4 November 1921 the Nazi Party held a large public meeting in the Munich Hofbr\u00e4uhaus, which also attracted many Reds and other enemies of the Nazis. After Hitler had spoken for some time, the meeting erupted into a melee in which a small company of SA thrashed the opposition. The Nazis called this event the Saalschlacht (&quot;meeting hall battle&quot;), and it assumed legendary proportions in SA lore with the passage of time. Thereafter, the group was officially known as the Sturmabteilung.[8]<br><br>Remind you of something?

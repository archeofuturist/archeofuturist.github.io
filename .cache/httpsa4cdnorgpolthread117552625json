Chimpanzees are related to us, but not necessarily the exact biological branch we stemmed from. Even if our branches intersect, we&#039;ve both gone through millions of years of separate evolution. DNA isn&#039;t math, with solid rules that can&#039;t be broken. Mutations happen over vast amounts of time that create species that are so different from what they started as, that they can no longer reproduce with their ancestors. It happens ALL the time in evolution. Keep in mind that we aren&#039;t the only species that&#039;s constantly evolving, and we aren&#039;t even the final form. There may not even ever be a final form if we get off of earth before the sun cooks us.","filename":"1467655326354","ext":".jpg","w":351,"h":500,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490054862987,"time":1490054862,"md5":"IONUGwoKzjVXCdUxH9RjSQ==","fsize":107607,"resto":117552625,"id":"6heT2Oh6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117556190,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)20:10:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117552625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117552625<\/a><br><br>it gives credit to americans not knowing anything about genetics<br><br>you cant crossbreed a hammerhead shark and a great white shark so obviously god is a shark","time":1490055042,"resto":117552625,"id":"JeMSvYnt","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

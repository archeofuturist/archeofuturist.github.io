Their professions are delegated by family line so it doesn&#039;t matter how intelligent, talented a person is if they were born an untouchable they will never be a doctor. And just as well a complete moron can be an engineer simply because he was born into the right family. So I understand, and it explains why your whole country was so old but never advanced in anything or really achieved anything of significance since sag paneer and naan bread! At least your cooking is good but come in my country being disrespectful and you will soon find out about the &quot;cleaning crews&quot; forming all over the country. Yeah that&#039;s right people are disappearing, news isn&#039;t talking about it. They are doing it in Italy and Greece as well and definitely Germany, not sure about what&#039;s happening in Australia or UK but just so you know watch your back.<br>It had to happen sooner or later when people come into your country and start causing problems and then have the audacity to treat the locals like shit.....Guess what happens???","time":1493383554,"resto":123172557,"id":"pauUqvv8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123190037,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)08:46:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123185598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123185598<\/a><br>In an industry that supplies the mines and we&#039;re picking up","time":1493383568,"resto":123172557,"id":"sGibc8Ba","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123190485,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)08:50:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123172557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123172557<\/a><br>Lol inpretty sure that picture is of a transgender porch monkey","time":1493383839,"resto":123172557,"id":"er2IOtSD","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123191441,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)09:01:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123188429\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123188429<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tickets<\/span><br>Not him but what did you mean by this?","time":1493384508,"resto":123172557,"id":"Ev+5De1s","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123192393,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)09:12:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123188246\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123188246<\/a><br>Fuckable but nothing special.","time":1493385128,"resto":123172557,"id":"sGibc8Ba","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

The FBI aren&#039;t in the business of beginning potentially president toppling investigations based on &#039;fake information&#039;.<br><br>- As for the Cabinet and the Supreme Court picks, well, the US Senate only needs a simple majority of 51 votes before candidates reach the executive branch ethics panel. Considering the Republicans currently have 52 seats in the senate, blaming this on Democrats is null and void.<br><br>- Budget. You can Google the outline of Trump&#039;s budget right now. The military wins big, of course to cover that $50B hole, you have to start cutting LOTS of services. The EPA is losing close to 28% of its funding, which is odd considering it only accounts for 0.01% of the US budget. You probably heard the uproar around Meals on Wheels too.<br><br>- Mexico, lol, Trump&#039;s idea to increase import taxes was floated a while ago....and shot down. What&#039;s the point of business&#039; using cross border labor if it suddenly becomes as expensive as locally sourced products? The business community will flip out. It won&#039;t happen. Ever. That leaves YOU paying for it one way or another. Trump has already floated the idea in his new budget.<br><br>- Obamacare? The Republicans have had 7 years to create an alternative, and instead they simply used one that Paul Ryan had laying around. Ryancare has been around in one form or another for years. The lack of an alternative shows that for the last 8 years the Republican&#039;s have had their finger up their arse doing sweet FA.<br><br>- And Trump supporters, the budget is going to hit them the hardest. This is a &#039;rust belt&#039; rebellion remember? The services being cut are being utilized mostly in Pro-Trump states. I&#039;m sure YOU feel fine in middle class America, but where it matters they&#039;re about to be F&#039;d in the A.<br><br>Just type &#039;I voted for you&#039; into Twitter or facebook sometime....hilarity ensues","time":1490664198,"resto":118581527,"id":"UvvnoP+F","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118591921,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:25:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118591692\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118591692<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;FBI aren&#039;t in the business of beginning potentially president toppling investigations based on &#039;fake information&#039;<\/span><br><br>Stopped reading there","time":1490664327,"resto":118581527,"id":"5kFSb4bI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118592710,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:32:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118584018\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118584018<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he listens to cnn<\/span>","time":1490664772,"resto":118581527,"id":"s5codcUO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118593032,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:35:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118581527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118581527<\/a><br>That really cheers me up.<br>I always thought I was the biggest loser.<br>Now I can always think at least I&#039;m not Hillary.","time":1490664943,"resto":118581527,"id":"obvSYRoZ","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":118593523,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:40:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118586157\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118586157<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all win<\/span>","filename":"Chelsea-Clinton donkey","ext":".jpg","w":535,"h":569,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490665200168,"time":1490665200,"md5":"PLft6Oue7Y2E0tLu0YwGrg==","fsize":36396,"resto":118581527,"id":"ySOk5S5K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118593546,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:40:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118581527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118581527<\/a><br>SIDE OF BEEF LOSER","time":1490665212,"resto":118581527,"id":"8fIkvuJN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118593798,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)21:42:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118581527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118581527<\/a><br>Why do you say that?<br>Just because she&#039;s never &quot;accomplished&quot; any of her stated goals doesn&#039;t matter. <br>Superior beings like Herself can only be judged by their intentions, which are pure and enlightened. <br>Its when We have to come down to your level that Persons of Stature are misunderstood...due to you conservacucks not being all smart and stuff and junk.

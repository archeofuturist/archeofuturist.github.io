He may be a nerd but he seems pretty red pilled about most issues. <br><br>Hixon, who describes himself as a \u201cLiberaltarian,\u201d wants to help cast the Democratic Party in a new light and is not a fan of all of his party\u2019s standard positions.<br><br>The job of the government, Hixon said, it to maximize personal liberty. In order to do that, he added, the government needs to provide universal healthcare and education, the right to vote, clean air, clean water, electricity, broadband and food and housing assistance for those who can\u2019t afford it.<br><br>Hixon supports free community college for all Virginians and is running on a platform that includes creating a two-year computer programming degree in the current community college system. He supports expanding Medicaid to include mental health and addiction treatment as well as burying rural power lines to to prevent prolonged power outages due to downed trees.<br><br>Hixon wants to eliminate the car tax and supports the overall system whereby people who earn a larger paycheck pay more taxes; he does not agree with a flat tax.<br><br>The candidate supports greater collaboration between home school parents and students and public school teachers and feels that students taught at home should be able to compete in public school sports, varying from the standard Democratic position.<br><br>He\u2019s not for more gun control and feels citizens with mental illness who are not a threat to themselves or others should not automatically have their gun rights taken away. Hixon doesn\u2019t agree with requiring background checks at gun shows.<br><br>He thinks government should not over-regulate business, mentioning a bill that passed this year placing more restrictions on AirBNBs or state requirements, for example, that an interior decorator get a license. Hixon wants to do away with the state running liquor stores and supports unions.","filename":"BenHixon","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":796,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1493263601212,"time":1493263601,"md5":"kanszCbJIJgjz2kfyK4ZYQ==","fsize":72443,"resto":0,"id":"9bDkLLUy","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"libertarian-running-for-democratic-party-in","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

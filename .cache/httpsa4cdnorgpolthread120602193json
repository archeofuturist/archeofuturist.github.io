I found out that the Spaniards conquered and ruled the Philippines for over 330 years. We stole, abused and murdered. Countries like Japan and the U.S. have sent their leaders to the Philippines in the past to ask for forgiveness for what they have done to this country, but Spain has never sent an official leader to repented. So I got some of the leaders of the region together in the exact location where they became an independent nation over 100 years ago. So, as a Spaniard I asked for forgiveness for what we as a people have done to them in this historical place!!! HEALING OF THE NATIONS!!!<\/span><br><br>KEK","filename":"17879952_1528664850479097_3086555814110960031_o","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1365,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491920012247,"time":1491920012,"md5":"dtoadQvlnW9qtGPVn7ylcw==","fsize":461400,"resto":0,"id":"CcYZHaFQ","country":"PH","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"haahahahahahahahahahahaha","country_name":"Philippines","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

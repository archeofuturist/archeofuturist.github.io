One of his main things is complaining that the tories don&#039;t build enough houses for people on low wages, but on other letters he complains that the tories are planning to build houses that will supposedly go to low-income people from the area. It&#039;s in a shitty old airfield so not even the rich people mind - they would normally say that things like that spoil the views from their houses, but they aren&#039;t complaining because it would clearly be an improvement.

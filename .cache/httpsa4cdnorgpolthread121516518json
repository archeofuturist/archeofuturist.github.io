It is important that the amplification not appear sarcastic, dismissive, or combative though. Humor, stoicism, and unemotionality are what you should radiate so as to disarm them and not force them into a defensive posture.<br><br>You have to collapse their world view in on itself before you can replace it with something else. It&#039;s a cringey comparison, but it really is like &quot;Inception&quot;. You have to plan little seeds of doubt, and hint at alternatives, so the idea can grow on its own. The master stroke is convincing someone that they arrived at a conclusion on their own. <br><br>Use stories, anecdotes. Statistics don&#039;t change minds in practice, but they are a good way to nail down an idea AFTER someone has partially bought into it. Never get angry. Never show frustration. You have to appear totally at ease with your opinions. Act fatalistic, and throw in some statements of self-doubt here and there to appear humble, and honest about areas if ignorance or uncertainty. Any admission on fallibility or ignorance on your part will not actually reflect badly on you because the other person will know (or assume) know know AT MOST less than you do, so they will see it as THEIR ignorance too, which will make them curious, and inclined to fill in blanks themselves. <br><br><a href=\"#p121517573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121517573<\/a><br>Critical thought is a meme.

Everyone has a temperamental bias of one kind or another. We naturally seek strong arguments that confirm our biases, at the same time seeking easily defeated arguments for alternatives so we can dismiss them. Very few people can force themselves to actively seek a STRONG argument that threatens their temperamental bias.<br><br>In my personal experience, the only thing that has softened the blow is having my mind changed multiple times, and deriving more satisfying beliefs as a result, and going through that process over and over again. So maybe a person can become desensitized over time, and even a little addicted to contrary information, but for me the trade-off have been a numbing of the intensity of my beliefs overall.<br><br><a href=\"#p121521212\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121521212<\/a><br>For me it was an initial involuntary shock that I didn&#039;t have time to formulate satisfactory dismissive response to before it stuck.

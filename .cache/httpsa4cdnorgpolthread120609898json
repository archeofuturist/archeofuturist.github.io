They are happy to lie and deceive with no remorse, they are constantly analysing their social surroundings and building and exerting their &quot;soft power&quot; as a socialite. They are forever attempting to increase their own image and mitigate damage, through fact or fiction. To a man, this is the signs of a clear psychopath. To a women though, perhaps this is just social intelligence?<br><br>Even men here have admitted feeling bad after adopting the 48 laws of power. Men do not pick up on the small cues of social interactivity and many or taken back or hurt when they realise how a girl has been playing them, keeping them at an orbiting distance. A man also has a sense of &quot;Fairness&quot; or &quot;lawfulness&quot; in that something nice should be done for the sake of the act, and that all debts will be repaid eventually. Some men will say this shows a system of honour, women call it being Autistic. Or in other words, a lack of social intelligence.<br><br>Getting to the point of my post, What is a unicorn for a man? Well the women most have all the standard indicators of a high SMV. Long hair, good face, hip to waist ratio, healthy BMI. On top of that though a true Unicorn would be a women who isn&#039;t a &quot;psychopath&quot; in that her behaviour would be more similar to ours in that she doesn&#039;t go through such lengths to play the games of the socialite. No bitching, gossiping, coniving etc.","filename":"Thinking-Man-Rodin","ext":".jpg","w":729,"h":463,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":158,"tim":1491924240018,"time":1491924240,"md5":"TTNPdSywD0\/dIPO5D2yaHg==","fsize":60333,"resto":0,"id":"04BD7BrC","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"final-redpill","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120610617,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:30:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120609898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120609898<\/a><br>interesting read","time":1491924605,"resto":120609898,"id":"mHT+6x9t","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":120611851,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:40:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"There are red, blue, green, indigo, purple, black, brown, white and iron pills but what about yellow and orange?

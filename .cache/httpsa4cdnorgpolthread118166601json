It&#039;s not going to force politicians to do anything. They&#039;ll GLADLY &quot;fix&quot; the problem with mass immigration. If you want to change the world, do something, don&#039;t just sit there and pout.<br><br>As a personal guideline it&#039;s also kind of nonsense. Rejecting marriage\/relationships unconditionally, no matter who with, is not rational. Because it all depends who with. If you think that ALL women are too horrible for you, then the problem is probably you. If you&#039;re just not trying to get married and don&#039;t care much, then it&#039;s more reasonable (but it&#039;s probably worth it to try to put some effort into it, good things rarely happen otherwise).<br><br>One has got to realize that there are good reasons the marriage rates are going down though. None of this makes MGTOW rational (because it is so unconditional), but there just aren&#039;t enough sane, faithful women for everyone. Far from enough. And there aren&#039;t enough high status men for women to marry either. It&#039;s women too who don&#039;t want to get married anymore. So yeah, one should accept the possibility of not getting married. Marrying the wrong woman just for the sake of it is way too dangerous nowadays.<br><br>But pretending you don&#039;t ever want to (no matter who with) just reeks of coping mechanisms.","time":1490406884,"resto":118166601,"id":"JC5RYvsT","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118168947,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:57:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118166601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118166601<\/a><br>Jewish tricks","time":1490407033,"resto":118166601,"id":"74o9svFE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118169009,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:57:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118168625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118168625<\/a><br>This.<br><br>In a nutshell they are contradicting themselves.

While I think hunger strikes are an abuse against decent countries(a prison hunger strike in my country would be laughed at) what the Palestenians are doing is the right thing. They are protesting peacefully instead of rioting or attacking which is the right way to do it since physical attacks have been met with extremely harsh retaliation. Right now Israel has a chance to show that they are a decent country just like the Palestenians prisoners right now are showing that they can be decent people.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":861,"h":825,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":119,"tim":1492752130928,"time":1492752130,"md5":"gkOpURVXrhAKoxf9yeIGlQ==","fsize":193719,"resto":122097764,"id":"FZn9tL29","country":"PH","country_name":"Philippines"},{"no":122101036,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:23:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122097764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122097764<\/a><br>Ayyy.

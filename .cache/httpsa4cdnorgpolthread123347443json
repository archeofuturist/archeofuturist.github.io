It&#039;s about &quot;you&#039;re with us or against us&quot; holocaust started by Bush. Of course it was already ongoing, but not on the scale of all out war. So 9\/11 served like catalyst for rainbowlution, something like the aurora in revolution 100 years ago, but this time instead of proletariat they are using pervertariat. Maybe it&#039;s the same thing only different labels. So the rainbow lisp is interesting. French seem to have it, indians too, etc, but they also have singing in india where they are capable reaching notes that are unheard of in the western world.","time":1493483048,"resto":123347443,"id":"k2qx31cj","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"}]}

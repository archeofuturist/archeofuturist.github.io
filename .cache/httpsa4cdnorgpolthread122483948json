YOU KNOW NOTHING. SOLAR PANELS ARE A SCAM. THEY COST 5-10X MORE THAN NATURAL GAS HYDRO ELECTRIC AND NUCLEAR WHICH EMITS 0 CARBON EMISSIONS YET YOU IDIOTS WANT SHITTY SOLAR PANELS WITH A TON OF ISSUES TO BE BUILT EVERYWHERE AT A HUGE INVESTMENT. I GUESS YOU WANT THE COST OF EVERYTHING TO BE EXPENSIVE. HIGHER ELECTRIC RATES. HIGHER PRICES FOR EVERYTHING, FOOD, RECREATION. FUCK YOUR ENERGY POLICY. FUCK EARTH DAY I CAN&#039;T TAKE IT ANYMORE YOU TRENDIES ARE GOING TO KILL US ALL IF WE HAD IT YOUR WAY. ENJOY ROLLING BLACKOUTS IN THE NEXT DECADE. REMEMBER 1999-2003? YEAH, CALIFORNIA HAD ROLLING BLACKOUTS. WE HAVEN&#039;T EXPANDED OUR ENERGY CAPACITY YET OUR POPULATION HAS EXPLODED. WE&#039;RE GONNA HAVE THEM AGAIN THANKS TO RETARDS LIKE YOU<br><br>AND I&#039;LL ALSO NEVER FORGET SOLAR FREAKIN ROADWAYS<br><br>YEAH SOLAR FREAKIN ROADWAYS<br><br>THAT&#039;S SOLAR<br><br>FREAKIN<br><br>ROADWAYS<br><br>I fucking can&#039;t take it anymore guys. I know we make fun of the left for getting triggered, but I get triggered too and this shit has got to stop. Most of these solar panels will fail in a decade, and will cost even more to replace. I KNOW BECAUSE I USED TO WORK FOR A SOLAR SHILLING COMPANY IN COMMIEFORNIA AND MOST OF THEM ONLY INSURE IT FOR LESS THAN 10 YEARS BECAUSE THEY&#039;RE JEWS LOOKING FOR A QUICK BUCK TO PROFIT OFF OF THE TAX SUBSIDY! HALF OUR CUSTOMERS WERE PEOPLE REPLACING THEM AND MOST OF THEM WERE WELL OFF AND RICH!<br><br>I bet this fucking thing cost millions of dollars to build. To save what? $100,000 worth of water? Bullshit estimate btw. And over how long? Why not just build a fucking tarp over it. They could&#039;ve used that money saved to build more toilets, but no, it got wasted away, and I damn well know they&#039;re not going to be maintained and will slowly fall apart and all fail within 15 years tops.","filename":"poosolar","ext":".jpg","w":460,"h":575,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492980199874,"time":1492980199,"md5":"sf8mt4WRPZp0Z9f9RUyYGQ==","fsize":91470,"resto":0,"id":"mRDm50GW","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wow-what-a-great-idea-we-need-to-fund-this-holy","country_name":"United States","replies":20,"images":3,"unique_ips":16},{"no":122484098,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)16:44:20","name":"FuckBarryFuckNiggerPeople","com":"daily reminder than the &quot;environmental movement&quot; is a scam.

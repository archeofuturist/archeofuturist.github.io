Those remaining MOABs are looking pretty fucking tasty right now.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Suspected Taliban insurgents on Monday attacked a U.S.-operated base in Afghanistan&#039;s eastern province of Khost, officials said, but gave few immediate details of an assault that coincided with a visit to Kabul by U.S. Secretary of Defense James Mattis.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The attackers had detonated a car bomb at an entrance to Camp Chapman, a secretive facility manned by U.S. forces and private military contractors, said Mubarez Mohammad Zadran, a spokesman for the provincial governor.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But he had little immediate information on any damage or casualties. &quot;I am aware of a car bomb attack at one of the gates in the U.S. base, but we are not allowed there to get more details,&quot; the spokesman said.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A spokesman for the U.S. military in Afghanistan, Capt.

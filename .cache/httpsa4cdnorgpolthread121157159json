It put on a huge act to get support from the Soviet Union &amp; China after it&#039;s independence, but in reality, DPRK is closer ideologically to the 3rd reich, or Imperial Japan than it is to the soviet union. An Ultra-conservative ethnic nationalist state, against any kind of race mixing, totally opposed to liberalism, extremely conservative views on age, sexuality, gender, family, &quot;LGBT&quot;, etc.. Stories about &quot;Starving North Korea&quot; are rooted largely in fiction. Child Malnutrition rates in North Korea are around 14% - Average child malnutrition in the world is around 30% (With many countries, eg, India, reaching as high as 50% - Which North Korea did not come close to even in the worst years of the 1990&#039;s famine, which has been over for more than a decade now).<br><br>Stories regarding the cult of personality\/lack of information are also greatly exaggerated. Yes, the Cult is very large, but North Koreans do not believe Kim is a &quot;God&quot; or can &quot;Read their minds&quot;. American &amp; South Korean movies, television shows, etc, can be accessed fairly easily in Pyongyang &amp; much of the rest of the country.","time":1492225412,"resto":121157159,"id":"0jVVkvu4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121159359,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:03:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"None of those countries are communist.","time":1492225432,"resto":121157159,"id":"JiAtDMe5","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121159569,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:05:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121159359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121159359<\/a><br>Ok, right.<br>-sent from queue to buy food-","time":1492225535,"resto":121157159,"id":"+Ax\/ZgK0","country":"VE","country_name":"Venezuela"},{"no":121159579,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:05:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121157159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121157159<\/a><br>WE&#039;RE ALL GOING TO FUCKING DIE","filename":"wheeze","ext":".jpg","w":642,"h":481,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492225542611,"time":1492225542,"md5":"qkbCnsEY+wOvKioMkqRR6A==","fsize":58154,"resto":121157159,"id":"mBGcKQPM","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121159737,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:06:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121159184\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121159184<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121159249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121159249<\/a><br>Juche is a variant of Marxism-Leninism.<br><br><a href=\"#p121159320\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121159320<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s NatSoc<\/span><br>more like Strasser&#039;s NatSoc","filename":"dsc03877-e1371911310892","ext":".jpg","w":3264,"h":2448,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492225611475,"time":1492225611,"md5":"P38wwWU0Yvnu12gjdrhNrw==","fsize":1125466,"resto":121157159,"id":"pKebSKCF","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121159766,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:07:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;121157873<\/span><br>I didn&#039;t put an apostrophe you monkey","time":1492225628,"resto":121157159,"id":"ej5J2iNI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121159789,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:07:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121157566\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121157566<\/a><br>Hillary is far from liberal.<br>She&#039;s center right, as are most establishment Democrats these days.","time":1492225636,"resto":121157159,"id":"J\/mH+Dr3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121159932,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:08:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121159320\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121159320<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;basing all of your opinions and ideals on &quot;duh joooz!&quot;<\/span><br><br>ISHYGDDT","time":1492225708,"resto":121157159,"id":"01KqL2bz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121159976,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:08:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121159737\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121159737<\/a><br>They took that down and removed all mentions of Marxism from their constitution.","time":1492225731,"resto":121157159,"id":"vzhO\/Mx7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121160172,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:10:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121157159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121157159<\/a><br>This has to be a joke","filename":"1449968082448","ext":".jpg","w":393,"h":391,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492225824634,"time":1492225824,"md5":"2AJRMwO6otr3askds8+knQ==","fsize":102190,"resto":121157159,"id":"gK\/RePwT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121160236,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:10:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121159932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121159932<\/a>","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492225848259,"time":1492225848,"md5":"Oa1ZPmLSISrVp9yXKg4b4A==","fsize":69677,"resto":121157159,"id":"0jVVkvu4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121160470,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)23:12:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121159976\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121159976<\/a><br>That&#039;s because Communism and Marxism-Leninism became phrases that put a sour taste in peoples mouthes post-1990.

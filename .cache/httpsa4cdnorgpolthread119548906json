Biographical accounts vary as to precisely how old Keanu was when his ne\u2019er-do-well father, Samuel Nowlin Reeves, abandoned the family. Some say Samuel left when Keanu was age two, some at age three, and the father himself is on record saying he moved out when Keanu was five, though he was still in his son\u2019s life until he was about 13. \u201cI spent my last vacation with him when I was 13 years old,\u201d Keanu said in a 2002 interview. \u201cOn our last day we sat on the veranda and stared at the dark sky. He hardly said anything that evening. The next day he brought us to the airport. Then we didn\u2019t hear anything from him for 10 years.

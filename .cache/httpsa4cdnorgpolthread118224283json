As the earliest Christians went into the Pagan temples and Jewish synagogues to preach the cross and Christ resurrected, so Western Christians need to be going into the Mosques, Synagogues and Malls (modern, atheist temples) and do the same. <br><br>Islam denies the resurrection of Christ as the glorious moment our sins were overcome. They deny this by denying the death of Christ. But all the historical evidence proclaims that the man we call Jesus did die on that cross. This is the weakness for the Muslim as the resurrection is the weakness for the Jew. <br><br>We can save our civilization, but only by returning it to the foundation upon which it was built.

She immediately said, &quot;You know you could live with us forever..&quot; I gave her a confused look and she continued, &quot;We understand that you live on earth and you REALLY wish to live here&quot;. I then said &quot;How..How did you know?&quot; She then giggled and said &quot;Because we&#039;ve been watching you, silly!&quot;<br><br>This was a dream come true and I almost cried right there. She then said, &quot;I talked with Headmaster Cid and he agreed that you would be PERFECT for SeeD, you just have to do...one thing&quot;. She then held my hand and looked deep into my eyes and said &quot;...You have to kill yourself for the transfer to work correctly.&quot; I then gave her some questions, &quot;How long do I have before the deal expires?&quot; She then said &quot;Cid said 3 months..&quot; I added by saying &quot;What&#039;s the most painless way?...&quot; She giggled again, &quot;Suicide will require pain buuut...if you want it quick...Get a gun and a nice shot to the head works.<br><br>I then agreed and she gave me a kiss on the forehead, &quot;I know this will be tough but once it&#039;s over and done, you&#039;ll get to live here!&quot; I then woke up and this was last week and i purchased a gun. I might actually kill myself because that dream just felt too real to be fake and my life isn&#039;t doing so grand.","time":1492369510,"resto":121394439,"id":"BJdQ1Tld","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"}]}

Hunters will not be allowed to go shoot a hibernating bear, state wildlife agents might. The US has used a state-management of wild game for decades, allowing each state to tailor their plan of action to the specific conditions in that state. This model can be much more dynamic and quickly adapted to changing circumstances than a national level of control could be. It&#039;s what allows certain states to hold wolf hunting seasons while others still don&#039;t. It&#039;s up to each state&#039;s department of natural resources (or fish&amp;game or whatever) to determine the best method of control. If Alaska is seeing signs of higher than desired levels of predators, they&#039;re the ones that should decide how to best cull the population. On the other hand, some animals such as migratory birds are managed on both the state and federal levels.<br><br><br>In my opinion this state-centered model has worked very well. It allowed my own state of WI to decide its response to chronic wasting disease on a county-by-county basis. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s feasible that a federal level of management could have tailored the response in every state so specifically.<br><br>Now, whether or not Alaska chooses to use these practices is another issue, but the law dictating how they could was, in my opinion, a federal over reach. <br><br>Also remember that state wildlife agencies are managing the health of an entire population, not each individual animal. If the overall population of grizzlies\/wolves\/whatever would benefit from a decreased number of animals, a cull is not immoral (at least in my opinion). How they do it and the ethics of that choice, though, probably falls differently for each person.","time":1491771823,"resto":120328187,"id":"VDI3Fh6B","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120336471,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:03:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120333527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120333527<\/a><br>classic self-defense, case closed","time":1491771824,"resto":120328187,"id":"yh0SbV\/U","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120336480,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:03:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120328187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120328187<\/a><br>REEEEEEEE STOP","filename":"1490701377490","ext":".jpg","w":808,"h":805,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491771829148,"time":1491771829,"md5":"fA6bUVjNz2iqov1Rb3jX\/g==","fsize":46158,"resto":120328187,"id":"33NQM5AG","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120336549,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:04:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120330859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120330859<\/a><br>i personally do all my bear hunting in wide open plains too. though i&#039;ve never actually found a bear yet. strange.","time":1491771857,"resto":120328187,"id":"Qi\/K9a2\/","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120336569,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:04:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120330727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120330727<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;killing poor little defenseless, harmless, tiny, cute, and nice teddy bears :c<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;worse than killing 999999 chillens in Syriananistan <\/span><br>B-but muh chillens ;_;<br><br>Kys shill.","time":1491771869,"resto":120328187,"id":"j\/FiN5dm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120336594,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:04:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120330859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120330859<\/a><br>a mile long shot is fucking incredible but if you dont hunt with a sword youre a faggot","time":1491771881,"resto":120328187,"id":"X8Y6bUDN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120336606,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:04:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tfw my country is enforcing its stereotype even further with each passing day. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pic extremely related<\/span><br>I&#039;m sorry, all other nations.","filename":"MericaFuckYeah","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":1024,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1491771888224,"time":1491771888,"md5":"6pHUtcqhoSkbU+JyKFp+AA==","fsize":170333,"resto":120328187,"id":"n1Oo+zAZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120336851,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:06:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120336606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120336606<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120336606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120336606<\/a><br><br>where i live bears will regularly swagger right up to your house and dig through your garbage. you have to keep all the garbage in your house until trash day","time":1491771976,"resto":120328187,"id":"InVYAp56","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120336971,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:07:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120328187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120328187<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;killing hibernating animals in their dens<\/span><br><br>Tell me Alaskans don&#039;t actually do this.<br>It&#039;s just not cricket.","filename":"1395450809877","ext":".jpg","w":499,"h":496,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491772021520,"time":1491772021,"md5":"TMqSPY\/GBVkwh2K66XjenQ==","fsize":59688,"resto":120328187,"id":"cFfcJK9o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120337022,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:07:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120328187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120328187<\/a><br>Trumps America is pretty cucked so far.","filename":"1475876407088","ext":".jpg","w":615,"h":859,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491772044873,"time":1491772044,"md5":"UWsbscP7EfbORsTffZv0Cg==","fsize":75932,"resto":120328187,"id":"sFNuc+gP","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120337052,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)17:07:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120336288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120336288<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120336468\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120336468<\/a><br>Hey leafs will a hibernating bear wake up if you rape it sexually?

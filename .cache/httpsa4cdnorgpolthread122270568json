By the 5th century there wasn&#039;t much central authority anymore in the west. It had declined to the point where rich landowners sat around on their estates while barbarian armies were employed whose only loyalty was to money. As soon as money ran out or they figured they had a decent shot at carving out their own piece of the empire, things were bound to fall apart. The eastern empire lived on because they had central authority and relatively good and stable administration. Religion had nothing to do with any of it. <br><br>In fact if you really want to get down to it, the &#039;christians&#039; of the 5th century were hardly Christian at all.

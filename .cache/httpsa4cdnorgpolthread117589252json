Pushing us into suicidal altruism, liberalism, and actually believing the Jews to be good in any sense. Everything in the Bible comes from some myth, legend, religion, deity predating itself. Every single page is an adaption of some prior story, because the people who wrote it are the eternal projectors, the Jews. They&#039;ve been using the same tactics, crying out as they strike, for the past 4000+ years. No original thought, just stealing from others. Any non-Semite following Christianity has been sold a lie, it is not ours, remember Jesus said he came for the lost sheep of Israel, well in reality (((he))) was just yet another messiah figure trying to lead an insurrection against the Roman Empire, but he was exclusive to the Jews nonetheless, it was only after they failed to convert their fellow kikes that they began preaching to Gentiles. Then over time chapters were added and others were removed in order to make it the perfect control mechanism for Gentiles. There&#039;s a reason why the Dead Sea scrolls remain untranslated for the public since being found, also a reason why the guy who started translating them was told to fuck off. Just as the Koine Greek Septuagint clashes with the Hebrew translation of the Torah, so too does the Dead Sea scrolls with both the Koine Greek AND the Hebrew.<br><br>Christianity is a Semitic death cult, and it has been a cancer on our people for almost two thousand years. As bad as Isl\u0101m has been for the Arabs. The Abrahamic &quot;faiths&quot; should be destroyed and all followers murdered for being race traitors, traitors to their nation, and honestly fighting against the fucking world.","time":1490091902,"resto":117589252,"id":"uIlJ1YVr","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":117612487,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)06:29:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117606785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117606785<\/a><br>So basically submission, like sandniggerism and kikism.<br>I see why it spreads to far and wide, from submitting to a god to submitting to a king, there is but one step, especially through divine mandate.<br><br>Ah, i can&#039;t wait to make all superstitious choke on their blood. 2060","time":1490092193,"resto":117589252,"id":"Hnhqmqlw","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]}

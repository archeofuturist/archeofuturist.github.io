Basically, they approach the DA informally and convince them that your clean record and your current life situation (i.e. that you are making positive life choices, that you are a productive member of society - as proven by your EMP school) indicate that it would better suit the interests of the prosecution to decline to prosecute your case. If this happens, there&#039;s no double jeopardy to prevent actually opening a prosecution in the future. What this means in practical terms is that if your lawyer succeeds at making this argument, then you need to keep your nose clean for basically the remainder of your life, or at least until the statute of limitations runs out, because you are completely at the mercy of the prosecutor to exercise his discretion not to charge you.","time":1492421293,"resto":121503653,"id":"1uI7DNl\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121505751,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:28:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121505577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121505577<\/a><br>There are cops with DWI&#039;s, and I&#039;d be a &quot;wildland EMT&quot; for wildfire\/forestry so I&#039;m not driving or riding in an ambulance.","time":1492421304,"resto":121503653,"id":"7OsSg3f7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

You see the speck in your neighbor&#039;s eye. That said, most people are overtly acting as selfish scumbags so that is probably what annoys you. When you see one of those 20% you like, they probably hide their selfishness. Politics divides people also so that we categorize our enemies as evil. We want to feel morally superior as a survival technique. <br><br>Read Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt <br><br>also learn to cope with this feeling through stoicism. Don&#039;t let external things cause you discomfort. Just live your life the best you can and try to help others when possible.","time":1490997830,"resto":119105643,"id":"4MtqOn30","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119106548,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)18:08:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119105643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119105643<\/a><br>This is part of the reason why I hate immigrants.

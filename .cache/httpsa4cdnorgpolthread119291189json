Honestly, the only people who criticize Yooka-Laylee are people who don&#039;t like the genre to begin with. The fact is, this game is a brilliant callback to classic 3D collectathons, such as Banjo-Kazooie and Mario 64, and even lesser known titles such as Jak and Daxter. This game might just be the spark to trigger a revival of the genre, but you haters just can&#039;t let nice things happen.","time":1491195384,"resto":119291189,"id":"kL2rMqIk","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119292964,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:00:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119291540\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119291540<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119292049\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119292049<\/a><br>I&#039;ve never understood the likenes of the Banjo games at all that shit really doesn&#039;t feel fun at all regardless of it being a Sprital successor.<br><br><a href=\"#p119292643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119292643<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jak and daxter<\/span><br>Completely different games and not in the concept of 3d platformers","time":1491195601,"resto":119291189,"id":"cGBQL2LP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119293218,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:02:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119291469\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119291469<\/a><br>Yooka-Laylee is nothing like ME:A.<br><br>Yooka-Laylee is a high quality product which was funded by retro fans.<br><br>It will breathe new life in a forgotten genre and give us old-schoolers well deserved nostalgia rush.","time":1491195770,"resto":119291189,"id":"KCHLC7MU","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119293231,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:02:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"jon tron did ntohikng wqrong","time":1491195776,"resto":119291189,"id":"vHrAbL6T","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119293235,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:02:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nier thread","filename":"1490762787621","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":1029,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491195777618,"time":1491195777,"md5":"gm7D6YZiPuJr0fxuzPisBQ==","fsize":953170,"resto":119291189,"id":"DXorDw+9","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119294081,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:13:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"This game was pretty fucking amazing.","filename":"1474997639199","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":307,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491196402309,"time":1491196402,"md5":"bqPzHveLCg4K9ybm+fPEWg==","fsize":127477,"resto":119291189,"id":"TNIoCNfY","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":119294202,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:15:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3","filename":"jswxMum","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":1000,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491196504301,"time":1491196504,"md5":"pYXB7XpUk9E8ORzAFV2EmA==","fsize":239714,"resto":119291189,"id":"+BwbVRRP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

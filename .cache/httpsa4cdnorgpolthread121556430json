We all believe Christ is our savior and take up our cross, and that is most important.","time":1492454917,"resto":121556430,"id":"xZarq2xl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121562647,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)14:48:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121562130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121562130<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121562216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121562216<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121562327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121562327<\/a><br>Your butt-buddy hitler started a highly destructive war that killed millions upon millions of white people.

Monotheism is just the cult of power, casting God in the image of man, and the statists have gone from worshipping a God-man to worshipping the devil himself.<br><br>Denying the existence of other gods is, in my view, tantamount to atheism, and I believe polytheism is the natural religion of humanity, while monotheism was failed experiment in the concentration of state power.","time":1492457340,"resto":121556430,"id":"yvRhvMjA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121568163,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)15:29:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121567801\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121567801<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;child of the church <\/span><br>Give me a break a house follows AFTER it&#039;s father not strays from it and goes on an eternal jihad against it <br>The holy toilet paper barely even understands that Jesus died to begin with much less anything about Christianity","filename":"1485617070058","ext":".png","w":500,"h":591,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492457341157,"time":1492457341,"md5":"qrbizYp2eFwVjAb2IK85Kg==","fsize":632383,"resto":121556430,"id":"YWKhgdCc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121568169,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)15:29:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121559448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121559448<\/a><br>You mean those guys who wrecked all the Druids and didn&#039;t even bother to write down records of Druidism after destroying it?","time":1492457342,"resto":121556430,"id":"enujb29X","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":121568173,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)15:29:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121565717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121565717<\/a><br>Icelandic DNA is 30-40% Irish because of interbreeding with slaves, many of the slaves were nobles that gained freedom and married into Icelandic nobility.

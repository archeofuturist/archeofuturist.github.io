They also claim that they never intend to.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It was in early Spring of 2015 that I headed from London to the American West Coast to spend a week with Gary. He was the first of several self-identifying, non-offending pedophiles living in the US who I had arranged to stay with and photograph as part of an attempt to understand and to document what it means to find oneself attracted to minors.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gary is a member of an online community of people who feel this &quot;sexual attraction, which we did not choose&quot;. According to Gary and others in the community, just as a heterosexual or homosexual person is drawn to people of a particular gender, they find themselves attracted to either boys or girls within specific age-ranges below the legal age of consent. They call themselves &quot;Virtuous Pedophiles&quot; \u2013 or &quot;VirPed&quot; for short \u2013 because the vast majority of them claim to have never gone down the path of sexually engaging with a minor. They also claim that they never intend to.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gary is also the founder of the Association for Sexual Abuse Prevention (ASAP). &quot;The forums are helpful in reducing the risk of acting on my urges, even though I don&#039;t consider myself at great risk. I&#039;ve come to accept my paedophilia,&quot; he says. &quot;I don&#039;t act on it and I am not distressed by it.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I expected a level of suspicion, if not outright fear, from this community when I introduced myself as a documentary photographer. After all, I thought, without their anonymity they surely would be living under constant threat. But it turned out people like Gary were looking for someone to share their story with. After spending several months building trust with a number of the forum&#039;s members, I arranged to fly out to meet them.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_ca\/article\/<wbr>i-spent-a-year-with-non-offending-p<wbr>aedophiles","filename":"Screenshot_2017-05-03-23-36-44_1","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1519,"tn_w":177,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493829641916,"time":1493829641,"md5":"OyMGRaK5GzhrVs6GCzph4g==","fsize":203659,"resto":0,"id":"vFgYXZy4","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"vice-doing-documentary-about-nonoffending","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":2,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123931042,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)12:42:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123930908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123930908<\/a><br>I spent 10 years living with an online community of &quot;Virtuous Pedophiles&quot; <br><br>It&#039;s called 4chan.","time":1493829721,"resto":123930908,"id":"KLljZHcI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123931096,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)12:42:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123930908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123930908<\/a><br>That cringey retard Milo should jump on this","time":1493829746,"resto":123930908,"id":"OgwK6yXr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123931138,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)12:42:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123931042\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123931042<\/a><br>top kek","time":1493829777,"resto":123930908,"id":"vFgYXZy4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123931299,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)12:44:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"the absolute fucking state of vice &quot;journalism&quot;","time":1493829876,"resto":123930908,"id":"vXxp\/pjm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123931555,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)12:47:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"not sure what habbening, but he pornography him too.. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gary in his home with Spunky, one of his two schnauzers.<\/span>","filename":"1493734209052-7","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":397,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1493830030398,"time":1493830030,"md5":"DOU\/y+V9msvs0Yan1k5+LQ==","fsize":29514,"resto":123930908,"id":"vFgYXZy4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123931747,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)12:49:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gary opening the local church in preparation for an AA-style course that he runs to help townspeople with problems such as addiction and depression.

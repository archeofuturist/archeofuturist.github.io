Japan\u2019s crime and drug-use rates are famously low. Life expectancy is famously high. Japanese students put their American peers to shame on international tests. The unemployment rate clocks in at 3.1%. All this is supposed to be a function of a homogenous society with a high degree of cultural cohesion\u2014the antithesis of cacophonous, multiethnic America.<br><br>Japan\u2019s population shrank by nearly a million between 2010 and 2015, the first absolute decline since census-taking began in the 1920s. On current trend the population will fall to 97 million by the middle of the century. Barely 10% of Japanese will be children. The rest of the population will divide almost evenly between working-age adults and the elderly.<br><br>But whatever their other benefits, \u201cpro-family\u201d policies won\u2019t reverse the demographic trend. Only large-scale immigration can do that, and the Japanese won\u2019t countenance it. The flip side of cohesion is exclusion. The consequence of exclusion is decline.<br><br>Without immigration, our demographic destiny would become Japanese. But our culture wouldn\u2019t, leaving us with the worst of both worlds: economic stagnation without social stability. Multiethnic America would tear itself to pieces fighting over redistribution rights to the shrinking national pie.<br><br>Every virtue has its defect and vice versa. The Japanese are in the process of discovering that the social values that once helped launch their development\u2014loyalty, self-sacrifice, harmony\u2014now inhibit it. Americans may need reminding that the culture of openness about which conservatives so often complain is our abiding strength. Openness to different ideas, foreign goods and new people. And their babies\u2014who, whatever else Mr. King might think, are also made in God\u2019s image.<br><br>https:\/\/www.wsj.com\/articles\/other-<wbr>peoples-babies-1490050955","filename":"Untitled","ext":".jpg","w":864,"h":658,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":190,"tim":1490097105915,"time":1490097105,"md5":"Jof9tm+TQrDt7rh\/vxGMMA==","fsize":127836,"resto":0,"id":"iKW5DCNI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wsj-we-must-not-go-the-way-of-japan","country_name":"United States","replies":37,"images":10,"unique_ips":29},{"no":117617581,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)07:54:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"The logic makes no sense.","time":1490097291,"resto":117617363,"id":"3LoV+oWa","country":"TW","country_name":"Taiwan"},{"no":117617755,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)07:57:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117617363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117617363<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shared values <\/span><br>First, third world importees do not share our values and we do not force them to assimilate so they never will.

Spent half of my life there and I guarantee you that people there are not happy at all. Wages are so low that you can&#039;t afford to get children, you can&#039;t even afford to buy your own property or house. In addition, to be able to feed yourself, you have to work for more than 50 or 60h per week. Some even more. Paid overwork? Forget about it.. you work your ass off, often even on weekends without any extra payment. Paid day offs are about a week and even then lots of Japanese rather go to work instead because they fear a bad image if they disappear from the office for one week. And indeed it lowers your image. Same as if you decline to join their weekly Izakaya evening where they drink alcohol until late night. Dare you if you don&#039;t want to join. <br><br>You might think that at least their working culture is efficient as they work a lot. No it isn&#039;t. Meetings are nonsense shit talking to meet regulations. Employees spend lots of time just talking with coworkers, playing the Wii U or surfing the web. That leads to even more low wages as companies try to surfive. I met so many older men who lost their job because the company run out of money and since they are too old, they don&#039;t get any other job. The family leaves him and let him rot on the street in Shinjuku. And no they are not allowed to beg strangers for money. <br><br>Friendship is also interesting in Japan. There are literally no people who have friends that they meet one or two times a month to hang out, go eat, talk, etc. They have &quot;friends&quot; who they meet maybe once a year and that&#039;s it. They consider them as best friends.","filename":"IMG_2685_850IS","ext":".jpg","w":770,"h":578,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490098872838,"time":1490098872,"md5":"VXBPDs4ab53VxzihQA0c4Q==","fsize":149709,"resto":117617363,"id":"ilWBFfYv","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117619459,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)08:23:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117617363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117617363<\/a><br><br>Can the Wall Street Jew not think one step further about what will happen to housing prices, and by extension, marriage\/birth rates once the older generations die off in Japan?

First the Jewish elite bankers let Berlin become infested with abominations. Sex was rampant. You could have anything you wanted in Berlin before WWII. They promoted Marxist ideology to the fullest. Children were fucked, cripples, s&amp;m, basically any type of fetish could be found, and was ran and promoted by Jews. They gathered intel\/ blackmail schemes, just like they are doing now here in the US. They even had a comet ping pong equivalent. In fact it&#039;s still there. Dr. Pong. Hitler, who was a conservative man, with many powerful conservative friends became aware of this situation, and was extremely distraught on the state of affairs that the Jews purposely let happen. They came to Hitler, knowing about his local conservative work, and also knowing about his undecended testical and micro penis. Hence a perfect radical scapegoat is born, along with a blackmail tier flaw. His outrage fueled the war, the Jewish elite became even more wealthy and powerful because of it. They also permanently have a victim card. Know they are trying to fulfill the rest of their plan with ww3, only they don&#039;t know another technique that can start it. They even tried a Franz Ferdinand maneuver, with the execution of that Turkish politician on TV.

People unironically start calling libertarians and right wing economists fascist, things start to get really crazy around here. It&#039;s like a left wing asylum at days. And yeah, I have to agree on your point on left wing seperationism, but the thing is, something like that can still be benefitial if done right. The kurds in Turkey for example aren&#039;t interested in global revolution and just want their own territory.

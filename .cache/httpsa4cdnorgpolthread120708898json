It all depends on what kind of Jews you&#039;re around with. Assholish supremacist Jews would probs think of you as less.<br><br>But people like my friends or Ben Shapiro and such are orthodox but couldn&#039;t care less if you&#039;re not blood Jew, they just care if you follow their beliefs and do good by your religion.<br><br>But I&#039;m confused now, why do you come to a typically anti-semitic board to ask for advice?

The TRUE Messiah(anointed) IS Yeshua, Jesus. Yeshua, Jesus already lived on Earth as a &quot;normal human&quot; as you call it. When He returns He will be as His complete supernatural,deity, as in the Father, Son(Jesus), and the Holy Spirit. We have Yeshua,Jesus, we have seen the Father. That based upon&quot;J----h principles&quot;, thing is actually the Babylonian Talmud that the Khazars converted to in ~740AD under their leader, Bulan. Search these terms for more indepth knowledge. This FAKE &quot;human with great leadership&quot; is an accurate description of the &quot;anti-Christ&quot; which means &quot;instead of Christ&quot;, i.e. the Fake Talmud messiah. Khazars are NOT Israelites however Yeshua, Jesus has made salvation available to ALL people of ALL extractions who call upon Him. He is loving and merciful.

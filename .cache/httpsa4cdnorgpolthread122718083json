I used to think like that when I was 16 and thought it was deep.<br><br>Christianity did not &quot;oppress&quot; the French any more than the druids did, and yes they also killed people when they &quot;offended the gods&quot; or something. What kids call &quot;cultural oppression&quot; is usually just social cohesion. If you want rules you need to enforce them and kill some people for breaking them, whether you are a pagan, christian or an atheist French Revolutionary. Otherwise you lose all authority, like the modern justice system which is a total joke without the death penalty, the modern church which is a joke without fighting nonbelievers and modern pagans who are hippie tier.<br><br>The guy is of course right that Christianity cannot be the foundation of a modern french identity because it&#039;s dead there and whatever&#039;s left is cucked to hell.<br><br>He is also right that the FN is not really the answer, because it doesn&#039;t offer a radical enough paradigm shift, just prolongs the agony of egalitarian (post)modernity.<br><br>For interesting ideas about the future that are not made by angsty teens check out Guilliaume Faye and Archeofuturism.<br><br>For non-autistic right wing videos with black metal in the background check out this channel:<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=e-B<wbr>ZylziBKI","filename":"faye","ext":".jpg","w":850,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":58,"tim":1493116658359,"time":1493116658,"md5":"aXPYRP+PBo5GCgVwI+EJYg==","fsize":70477,"resto":122718083,"id":"o+fZ62gL","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"}]}

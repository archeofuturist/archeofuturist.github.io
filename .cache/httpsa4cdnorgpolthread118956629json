Obligatory SCG - <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fWk<wbr>fpGCAAuw<br><br>Anyways, I was watching some dank compilations and somehow found my way to some DPR propaganda vids like so:<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ctF<wbr>16FUcYBo<br><br>After a little searching about, I ran into some videos about foreign fighters, and was shocked to see that Antifa contingents are fighting in the Ukraine for the fucking East\/Russian side. <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tpT<wbr>l8eKa-A0<br><br>Soros shills (Antifa) fighting the Soros shill regime (Western backed Poroshenko), for the East and Putin? Are these guys larpy commie fags, or do they represent the DPR? After checking the DPR commie party -<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Commu<wbr>nist_Party_of_the_Donetsk_People&#039;s_<wbr>Republic<br><br>It appears as though they are a small group representing the DPR, though I&#039;m not sure I understand if the entire front against the &quot;fascist&quot; Ukrainians has communist leanings, or if the Antifags involved are a small contingent? What the fuck is going on over there now, could anyone with more information fill me in here? For example, I&#039;ve heard about Donetsk commanders Givi and Motorola who were killed in the fighting, I&#039;ve seen vids about resistance volunteers - are they all fucking commies? I have always wanted to go help out over there after seeing the suffering inflicted on children and civilians, though if it&#039;s an Antifag movement then fuck no I won&#039;t.

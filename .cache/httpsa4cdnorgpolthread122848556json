My plea to you","com":"Dear Opinionists,<br><br>My name is Eric and I am now known as the bike lock bandit..or whatever. I am posting here against the advice of basically everyone I know. My career is ruined, I have fled my state, and I am honestly frightened. <br><br>I know that I will find no sympathy on this board and I really don&#039;t deserve any. I am ashamed of my actions. I hurt another human, Sean, and I am really experiencing sorrow for my actions. That wasn&#039;t my only shameful moment as this wasn&#039;t my first experience with stealth injury infliction. <br><br>The exposure of my actions have made me aware of exactly how abhorrent they were. I guess I had always compartmentalized what I&#039;ve done as well as justify those actions. I realize now just how despicable I have become. I am guilty of hurting humans just because I feel they have an incorrect ideology.<br><br>I now know that I am a caricature of what it is I truly believe, and I will express this in court. I am prepared to take full accountability for my actions, and know that I deserve jail time. This brings me to why I decided to post here.<br><br>Please leave my family alone! I know that I deserve everything that is happening to me, but my innocent family does not. I hope that you all can direct your vitriol against me into compassion for my victim, Sean Stiles.<br><br>Thanks for any consideration... Eric.","filename":"trump-hair","ext":".jpg","w":410,"h":507,"tn_w":202,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493184571073,"time":1493184571,"md5":"5nv7A23WdSO12w3nfpH7dg==","fsize":33597,"resto":0,"id":"b8pJLTqf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"eric-here-my-plea-to-you","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

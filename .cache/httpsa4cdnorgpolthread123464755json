I can&#039;t really answer it good enough. Jordan B Peterson says that all things tends to corrupt or decay, social structures and institutions, nothing are without problems and everything requires constant work to be upheld. <br><br>But ideological madness can still take place without the decrease in trust i would assume. And the poor effects of bad political policy such as to much immigration can lead to bad results and worsening of institutions regardless of high trust levels. But we also know that multi cultural societies have lower trust levels then homogeneous societies. So bringing in immigrants and changing the population could decrease trust. <br><br>Also this was interesting, http:\/\/worldhappiness.report\/ed\/201<wbr>7\/ <br><br>&quot;Happiness has fallen in America<br><br>The USA is a story of reduced happiness. In 2007 the USA ranked 3rd among the OECD countries; in 2016 it came 19th.

Trump has also issued an executive order setting dangerous refugee resettlement programs he promised to end at 62,000 imported per year, which is the same average Obama brought in during his terms. ALIPAC has also recently discovered Trump administration spokeswoman and Bush family ally Helen Aguirre Ferre promising future amnesty to illegal aliens on KJZZ radio! <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;We were so hopeful that Donald Trump would be a man of his word because the campaign promises he made to Americans were the things America needs to do to survive and thrive, but unfortunately, Trump has made it clear he cannot be trusted on his most powerful campaign issue of stopping illegal immigration and amnesty,&quot; &quot;Our organization&#039;s supporters have been fighting against illegal immigration and Amnesty for many years, and they say it is time for us to end our endorsement of Trump because close inspection of his actual immigration policies show he is similar to Bush and Obama on Amnesty for illegal immigrants.&quot;<\/span>","filename":"tugofwar","ext":".jpg","w":1009,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":198,"tim":1493767585002,"time":1493767585,"md5":"nMCeGLNNvCTXrZ1Dfo\/9eg==","fsize":408013,"resto":0,"id":"VoVu3vjq","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"alipac-revokes-trump-endorsement-due-to-betrayal","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123837312,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:29:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123837017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123837017<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ALIPAC is officially more red pilled than \/pol\/<\/span>","filename":"jews4","ext":".png","w":649,"h":802,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493767749177,"time":1493767749,"md5":"ZVObIri12u+\/aqigcBRhIQ==","fsize":646520,"resto":123837017,"id":"+xL96mGO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

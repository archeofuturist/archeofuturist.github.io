She mustve liked me the first few years, because I wasnt that rich and she was still dating me (even then though,she was very emotionally volatile and I always spending alot on her, shopping and eating out etc.) I was madly in love with her and thought her temper tantrums were just out of passion, but it turns out she was pretty much psychotic. No one warned me against her, because she was so polite and friendly with everyone and she mostly kept to herself. I admit, I made the mistake of not asking advice ffom anyone regarding how nasty she treated me when we were alone, but I was young and blinded by how hot she was. She was a thin pale blonde with a dfc and perky ass and long legs,, I wasnt thinking straight, I put up with alot of bs from her and just assumed she would mature. Anyways, our marriaged life wasnt that bad initially, she was really sweet and basicLly tried a bunch of online gigs and small businesses that didnt work, but our relationship got strained because she was constantly pouring. bs down my mouth and expecting me to thank her for her emotional and idiotic decisions that I always paid for.

We&#039;re omnivorous through and through and need meat, in part to function at out highest level physically and mentally(imo).<\/span><br>Torture and battery farms are another thing all together and the latter is a bit harder to argue against logistically in this massive modern world full of equal demand from everyone.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For me, in my neck of the woods at least, I think we need to somehow start weening ourselves of supermarkets, stop this ceaseless urbanization (another bubble waiting to burst) which only accumulates more people, making more traffic and becoming more dependent on shitty supermarket meat and goods.<\/span><br>There where are few spots around me(now sold for more housing) where I would have loved to have seen a communal garden. A couple of acres surrounded by suburbs, where a few hundred people, who were eager to have a workable garden or keep live stock could operate in their own portion. Not everyone would reap the rewards but there would be surplus to share, trade in a small scale sense.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I know this kind of sounds like communism and I&#039;d like to make clear that I&#039;m not bashing capitalism as I know it&#039;s essential, but and maybe this is a pipe dream, I love to see more small scale independent agriculture (for those that want it) in suburban areas to alleviate the dependence on battery farm meats and such.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I don&#039; know SHIT about operating this sort of thing but it&#039;s something I&#039;ve seen to work on TV and other places and I think about when walking the dogs.<\/span>","filename":"6108-dubs-guy-taking-a-picture","ext":".jpg","w":252,"h":249,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1490657197595,"time":1490657197,"md5":"3YYRoknZGWt9BAEfylM7hA==","fsize":23158,"resto":118546369,"id":"g1AXqCte","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":118578772,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:27:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118546369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118546369<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118546459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118546459<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118546605\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118546605<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118546710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118546710<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118546993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118546993<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118547073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118547073<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118547223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118547223<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118547463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118547463<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118547721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118547721<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118547827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118547827<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118548009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118548009<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118548270\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118548270<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118548289\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118548289<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118548422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118548422<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118548503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118548503<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118548633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118548633<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118548637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118548637<\/a><br>Fuck you fucking potato faggot cunts hope u all fuckibg die u dumb shits","time":1490657234,"resto":118546369,"id":"ngCZm1XM","country":"UA","country_name":"Ukraine"},{"no":118578898,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:28:24","name":"Ceann Comhairle","com":"<a href=\"#p118578772\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118578772<\/a><br>Fucking die you irate irradiated idiot","filename":"last-of-mohicans-fix-list","ext":".png","w":620,"h":375,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":75,"tim":1490657304611,"time":1490657304,"md5":"jbPubMUsVSmwUeYRBXS1uA==","fsize":418201,"resto":118546369,"id":"g7d82zKX","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":118578968,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)19:29:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118578772\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118578772<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The faggot Ukraine is back<\/span><br>Putin is going to kill you and your family.

The majority of these are all Christian, since their ethnic and biblical homelands have become too oppressed by Islamic presences. <br>So, aside from Yuropoor, what do you all think of Arab diaspora, if most of them are Christian? I ask because I moved here with my family five years ago from Lebanon. This isn&#039;t bait, I&#039;m just genuinely curious as to how this mostly-Christian board views Arab Christians living abroad. Also, I don&#039;t hate Islam, I hate wahhabis and jews who have caused all this conflict.","filename":"images","ext":".jpg","w":186,"h":186,"tn_w":186,"tn_h":186,"tim":1492356123564,"time":1492356123,"md5":"Ct+MYX+JdGlK6PUlg0nflQ==","fsize":9966,"resto":0,"id":"2vA5tEED","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"aside-from-yuropoor-which-is-fucked-beyond-belief","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":121369200,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)11:24:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m glad you&#039;re Christian instead of Mohammedan but you should still fuck off back to where you came from.","time":1492356273,"resto":121368916,"id":"3A1ekPoR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121369438,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)11:26:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"If they can manage to not a\u00e7t like cave-people, they&#039;re alright.

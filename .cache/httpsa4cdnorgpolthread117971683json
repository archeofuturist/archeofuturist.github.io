This can be done through government exchanges, which are groups of insurance companies that the government is supposed to negotiate with to keep prices down, in exchange for having a massive amount of new customers. This mandate is obviously unpopular because Americans don&#039;t think they need healthcare until they need it.<br><br>In practice, there are numerous other flaws. Companies are supposed to be paid a certain amount by the government to subsidize being forced to cover people with preexisting conditions, but Republicans passed a condition to ban the use of government funds to pay this (even though the government is legally required to pay it.) This means that every time the company needs to be paid, they have to sue the government. Republicans have also been campaigning on killing it for almost a decade, which reduces faith in the program. Companies will only stay on the exchanges if they know they will still exist (because if it stops existing their investment in the program is wasted,) so they leave the exchanges, which in turn provides more leverage for Republicans. Finally, as companies leave the exchanges, the remaining companies are forced to take on more customers, which causes premiums to rise to discourage everyone from using their insurance. <br><br>So there&#039;s numerous structural problems that need to be addressed, but there has been no willingness on the part of the Republicans to address these issues, and Republicans have held a significant portion of the government for years now.","time":1490302194,"resto":117971683,"id":"2tYU5TrZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117981271,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)16:50:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117979593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117979593<\/a><br>It did the opposite of what it was supposed to do.

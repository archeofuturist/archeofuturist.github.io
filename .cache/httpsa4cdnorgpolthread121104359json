Congratulations, work hard and it will make up for the difficulty. <br><br>Yes but the odd thing is that black culture is violence, they aren&#039;t resorting to it, it&#039;s a fundamental part of that identity. Pretty much the same eventual effect though. It would be so easy to fix the issues.

With a strong enough push you could honestly fix it in one or two generations. <br>I know this guy, he&#039;s Somali. He&#039;s a scumbag. Stole his the health cards of everyone in his immediate family to get drugs so he could get high with his friends, he&#039;s likely going to jail soon. Thing is, I went to school with him briefly. He&#039;s actually very intelligent, at least he learns quickly. The issue is that he&#039;s so deep into the thug culture that he measures himself based on that instead of his academic success. He had gotten into a good University and not 2 months later he did the health card thing, and that&#039;s only the first crime he had actually been caught doing. It isn&#039;t that he isn&#039;t capable, god no, he&#039;s just shooting himself in the foot at every turn.

The best way to counter this sort of thing is via bandwagoning. That&#039;s what got them into this, and it&#039;s what will get them out. If their idols, like the musicians, started to give better messages like &quot;Go to fucking school and stop doing every drug available&quot;, if their friends and family stopped passing on messages like &quot;Every white person is against you, that&#039;s why you need to commit crimes and not go to school, it&#039;s the only way to get ahead&quot;, things would improve.

Health in highschool is completely focused on safe sex, and while that&#039;s important it doesn&#039;t need to be the only focus. Elementary and highschool should both teach you how calories work, about macros and micros, about what&#039;s actually bad and what just requires moderation, what isn&#039;t bad even though people tell you it is, etc. I also believe that a cooking class should be mandatory for highschool students. To me knowing how to at least prepare a basic meal is as important as math or English. They don&#039;t need to be chefs by the end, but they need to be able to feed themselves. In my perfect world the exam would be making a half-decent and semi-nutritious meal out of a randomized assortment of ingredients in a fridge, with no guidance. <br>That&#039;s a lofty goal though and I&#039;ll likely end up doing hospital work mixed with some advisement work. Possibly some product development as well. I admit I&#039;m sacrificing pay for passion, but that&#039;s why Chem is my back up. <br><br>It&#039;s distinctly possible they&#039;ve swung the pendulum too far and the backswing will actually fix a lot of these problems naturally.

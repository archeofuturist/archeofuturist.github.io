This did not happen with anything yet.<br><br>Think of these tweets what you want, but turning on Trump without waiting at least about a year to potentially let things unfold, especially since, again, him flip-flopping on promises are only speculations, is outright stupid. Trump, for all of us, is the best chance for a better future in decades, and fucking him over so early out of sheer paranoia only minimizes your chances of getting what you want, simple as that.<br><br>However, do complain in a reasonable way whenever he (seemingly) fucks up, so that he knows what&#039;s upsetting his supporters, potentially making up for it or at least being able to get misunderstandings out of the way. Stay neutral and wait till a bit into next year if you want the best chances, you can still hate on him then, jump ship immediately like a crybaby if you wanna minimize &#039;em and, at the same time, empower those who have been fucking up your life for decades.<br><br>Besides, the only people here trying to get you to drop Trump are either shills, trolls, or nu-\/pol\/ anons who came with the last election and who know just as much about politics and history as your average neo-nazi who smokes weed, gets drunk and wants to fuck latino women while still thinking of himself as being an \u00dcbermensch.<br><br>TL;DR: Don&#039;t let them intimidate you and sage ShariaJew threads.","filename":"62d9984638a0428da3a615b3db13e74f0468bc19e7318d194633b6b37642e43c","ext":".jpg","w":432,"h":518,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493184028551,"time":1493184028,"md5":"2HAOkDXwF4Xwjr1W19rDUw==","fsize":33846,"resto":122842835,"id":"VMLlnjhq","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122847717,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:20:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122846923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122846923<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122847315\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122847315<\/a><br>German IDs are quickly becoming Canada\/Australia tier.","time":1493184042,"resto":122842835,"id":"7a016E2k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122847751,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:21:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122844742\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122844742<\/a><br>perhaps, but the alternate was Shillary. remeber that.","time":1493184063,"resto":122842835,"id":"GacnEH94","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122847814,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:21:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;in some form<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;paying in spirit<\/span>","filename":"weary frog","ext":".jpg","w":251,"h":242,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1493184106987,"time":1493184106,"md5":"8XiOk7Ps6Kf6st9LY6iBXw==","fsize":13317,"resto":122842835,"id":"xJezhEPb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122847833,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:21:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122847558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122847558<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;reddit<\/span><br>now, im offended <br><br><a href=\"#p122847481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122847481<\/a><br>you know that they cant just block it cause :they feel like it:, they have to show a part of it is or can be exploited to undermine rights or broke other laws. <br><br>in this case a president dont have enough authority to block ALL federal funding to X or Y cities. specially cause in theory Sanctuary cities dont broke any law or procedure","time":1493184119,"resto":122842835,"id":"cl7bFVU1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122847862,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:22:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122846103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122846103<\/a><br>That is the dumbest chart I have ever seen and you feel ashamed for posting it.","time":1493184138,"resto":122842835,"id":"JWry87qb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122847894,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:22:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122846103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122846103<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; savings in $ not % <\/span><br><br>you think we were born yesterday","time":1493184156,"resto":122842835,"id":"j41cGWWo","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":122847996,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:23:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"How many impeachments do we need before Jeff Sessions is the President?","time":1493184215,"resto":122842835,"id":"QSu5tqhH","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":122848078,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:24:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122847833\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122847833<\/a><br>You&#039;re not even trying anymore.

This did not happen with anything yet.<br><br>Think of these tweets what you want, but turning on Trump without waiting at least about a year to potentially let things unfold, especially since, again, him flip-flopping on promises are only speculations, is outright stupid. Trump, for all of us, is the best chance for a better future in decades, and fucking him over so early out of sheer paranoia only minimizes your chances of getting what you want, simple as that.<br><br>However, do complain in a reasonable way whenever he (seemingly) fucks up, so that he knows what&#039;s upsetting his supporters, potentially making up for it or at least being able to get misunderstandings out of the way. Stay neutral and wait till a bit into next year if you want the best chances, you can still hate on him then, jump ship immediately like a crybaby if you wanna minimize &#039;em and, at the same time, empower those who have been fucking up your life for decades.<br><br>Besides, the only people here trying to get you to drop Trump are either shills, trolls, or nu-\/pol\/ anons who came with the last election and who know just as much about politics and history as your average neo-nazi who smokes weed, gets drunk and wants to fuck latino women while still thinking of himself as being an \u00dcbermensch.<br><br>TL;DR: Don&#039;t let them intimidate you and sage ShariaJew threads.","filename":"62d9984638a0428da3a615b3db13e74f0468bc19e7318d194633b6b37642e43c","ext":".jpg","w":432,"h":518,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493184028551,"time":1493184028,"md5":"2HAOkDXwF4Xwjr1W19rDUw==","fsize":33846,"resto":122842835,"id":"VMLlnjhq","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122847717,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:20:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122846923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122846923<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122847315\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122847315<\/a><br>German IDs are quickly becoming Canada\/Australia tier.","time":1493184042,"resto":122842835,"id":"7a016E2k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122847751,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:21:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122844742\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122844742<\/a><br>perhaps, but the alternate was Shillary. remeber that.","time":1493184063,"resto":122842835,"id":"GacnEH94","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122847814,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:21:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;in some form<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;paying in spirit<\/span>","filename":"weary frog","ext":".jpg","w":251,"h":242,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1493184106987,"time":1493184106,"md5":"8XiOk7Ps6Kf6st9LY6iBXw==","fsize":13317,"resto":122842835,"id":"xJezhEPb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122847833,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:21:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122847558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122847558<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;reddit<\/span><br>now, im offended <br><br><a href=\"#p122847481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122847481<\/a><br>you know that they cant just block it cause :they feel like it:, they have to show a part of it is or can be exploited to undermine rights or broke other laws. <br><br>in this case a president dont have enough authority to block ALL federal funding to X or Y cities. specially cause in theory Sanctuary cities dont broke any law or procedure","time":1493184119,"resto":122842835,"id":"cl7bFVU1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122847862,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:22:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122846103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122846103<\/a><br>That is the dumbest chart I have ever seen and you feel ashamed for posting it.","time":1493184138,"resto":122842835,"id":"JWry87qb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122847894,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:22:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122846103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122846103<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; savings in $ not % <\/span><br><br>you think we were born yesterday","time":1493184156,"resto":122842835,"id":"j41cGWWo","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":122847996,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:23:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"How many impeachments do we need before Jeff Sessions is the President?","time":1493184215,"resto":122842835,"id":"QSu5tqhH","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":122848078,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:24:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122847833\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122847833<\/a><br>You&#039;re not even trying anymore.

They also like to call anybody who doesn&#039;t hate Trump a &quot;r\/T_D shill&quot; or Cadre shill. Cadre is a fake shill organization that the r\/MAT invaders use to try and deflect criticism of their raid. Be wary of anybody claiming to be a so-called \/pol\/ oldfag who spams anti Trump memes and shills for the pro immigration Tulsi Gabbard.","filename":"1491856686549","ext":".png","w":735,"h":625,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":106,"tim":1493186334108,"time":1493186334,"md5":"9bmwzn9Ht1KrBzaIdh73Lw==","fsize":329708,"resto":122842835,"id":"fxl3b+lp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122851298,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:58:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"I don&#039;t really care, I just think it&#039;s hilarious the burgers actually elected the guy.<br>I doubt a country that narrows its leadership down to Trump\/Hillary is gonna be great again anytime soon.

Do these actions if you want to see the lefties squirm:<br>1. Post screenshots of their Discord. These screenshots have been floating around on \/pol\/ for days now and they&#039;re easy to find. Posting them in a thread with shills will trigger them to no end. Watch them bumrush your post with free (you)s as they desperately try their shitty attempts at damage control.<br>2. Be as offensive as humanly possible. Leaked Discord screenshots have shown us that while they may be LARPing as \/pol\/acks, these lesfties are still just as offended by the content of this board as any other SJW from Reddit. Feel free to call them niggers, kikes, trannies and every slur under the sun. Post anti-nigger pics and infographics and don&#039;t forget the PooPoo PeePee pepes! You can find the best PooPoo Pepes at pepebooru if you don&#039;t already have a folder.<br>3. Just shitpost and troll them to death. No further explanation needed!<br><br>Watch youselves out there and don&#039;t let these leftist shills fool you. They aren&#039;t and they never will be true \/pol\/acks and they will NEVER subvert \/pol\/!

Although philosophically i agree with Stefan Molyneux on the issue. It is literally forces someone to fight against his will (assuming they don&#039;t want to). I wouldn&#039;t support the government using its citizens as forced labor to work their fields or manufacturing plants. So why do we readily accept it when they force you to kill and possibly die for a cause that you find dubious. It&#039;s a govermental affront on the sovereignty of the individual.

But yeah, what were\/are some of your WW2 Veteran relative&#039;s thoughts on the War and the West post war? Seeing what the world is now would they have fought? Would they have switched sides? <br>My grandad fought in the Pacific. He never spoke about his opinions about the Western front. He was proud of his service, and thought that if Japan wasn&#039;t contained, it wouldn&#039;t be long before they threatened the heartland. One haunting thing he always told me was that it was the socialists who truly won the war, and that he was glad he was going to die soon, he didn&#039;t want to live in the world with the way it was turning. He told me that my generation is going to have a burden much heavier than his, and didn&#039;t envy me. I miss him very much.","filename":"5_fig002","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":321,"tn_w":194,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492985982270,"time":1492985982,"md5":"O2BPvWcgqGydxPPEDoRvXQ==","fsize":22841,"resto":0,"id":"ykCob0pf","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"family-ww2-veteran-reflections","country_name":"Poland","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122499136,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)18:25:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122498282\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122498282<\/a><br>Mine was living in glorious national socialist germany.

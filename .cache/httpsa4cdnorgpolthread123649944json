Or at least not any scientific knowledge of the objective world. And so another thing that you might observe about that is that you can survive perfectly well without knowing any science at all in an articulated and developed manner, and of course animals are in that category. So that also I think in some sense undermines the claim of science to anything approaching a universal truth because obviously life can get along perfectly well without it.&quot;<\/span>","filename":"4140","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":395,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":197,"tim":1493661826435,"time":1493661826,"md5":"XK08K9THwFjjHRCTDGyTtg==","fsize":25952,"resto":0,"id":"ROMHJh36","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dogs-dont-do-science-therefore-science-isnt","country_name":"Australia","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":123650418,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:08:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123649944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123649944<\/a><br>I agree with this completely. Science ultimately is just a circlejerk that does not help us whatsoever. Sure we can make smart phones and cars and all that shit, but none of that is acually beneficial to us. We would be much better off with relatively primitive lifestyles and no science. Even worse, thanks to universities, science has become flooded with people that do not belong there at all. It has become dumbed down and now resembles a poorly conceived religion. <br><br>&quot;Squint your eyes to see clearly, blur reality to make it real. Let focus go from your deceiving eyes, to know whats been concealed.&quot;","time":1493662082,"resto":123649944,"id":"cjDfhj1G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123650838,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:11:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123650418\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123650418<\/a><br><br>That&#039;s no science dingus.","time":1493662306,"resto":123649944,"id":"ROMHJh36","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123650864,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:11:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123649944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123649944<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;le based blsck science man xDDDD global warming science based al gore only needs 15 trillion to stop global warming i donates match me xDDD<\/span>","time":1493662318,"resto":123649944,"id":"kmmPcoB7","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123650954,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:12:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123649944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123649944<\/a><br>Technocracy is the only true way!","time":1493662357,"resto":123649944,"id":"CJWpXyGz","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123651029,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)14:13:15","name":"Sage","com":"<a href=\"#p123650838\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123650838<\/a><br>Why do I even reply to these threads?

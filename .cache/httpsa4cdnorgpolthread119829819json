I believe that it is a rather small percentage of Jews who have the ability or the want to harm western civilization, but there is no doubt that there is a massively disproportionate number of zionists in media and government positions. <br><br>It&#039;s something like 6-7 million Jews in the US. It&#039;s not terribly insane that a few hundred or thousand could work their way in to positions of great power in the interests of Zionism, globalism, or anything else that would benefit their kinsmen. <br><br>To come to this conclusion you would have to realize that Jews are a unique race of people that have distinct interests. You would also have to come to the conclusion that the media (Hollywood and news), which is almost completely Jewish controlled, has been teaching white people for generations to not work for the interests of their own race. That the white race is bad in some way. You would probably also have to believe that the media plays a highly important role in the public&#039;s thinking. <br><br>It&#039;s also this same media that pushes atrocity propaganda about poor foreign brown people in hopes that whites will accept more Muslim refugees, which obviously destabilizes western countries. While pushing this line of thinking, they tell us we can save them all by bombing these countries even more, even though they are across the world and not our problem. <br><br>You see the vicious cycle? I don&#039;t think anyone believes that Jews are monolithic, but there is a huge problem here caused by the most powerful ones. <br><br>They have been the main driving force behind the greatest and fastest social shift to the left in human history. This is destroying us and is part of why the only hope for white people is their own ethnostate. Race is not a social construct (an idea made up by Jews), but is instead a hard genetic reality.

Dropping a bomb on the binary components does not actually provide the correct mechanism for making the nerve agent. It is an infantile argument. One of the precursors is isopropyl alcohol. It would go up in a ball of flame. A very large one. Which has not been in evidence.<br><br>Another issue is that, if the Syrian regime actually did believe that the warehouse stored chemical warfare agents, then striking it deliberately was an act of chemical warfare by proxy.<br><br>Finally, we are back to the issue of industrial capacity. It takes about 9 kg of difficult to obtain precursor materials to generate the necessary steps to produce Sarin. The ratio is similar with other nerve agents. Having a quantity of any of the nerve agents relies on a sophisticated supply chain of exotic precursors and an industrial base. Are we to seriously believe that one of the rebel factions has expended the vast sums of money and developed this industrial base, somehow not noticed to date and not molested by attack?

We know it was the result of an air strike, which would rule out the rebels and ISIS. The only possibility is the official government line that it hit a chemical weapons facility, but from what I have heard (I&#039;m not particularly knowledgeable on this myself) this is overwhelmingly unlikely, because they are stored in their constituent chemicals, which would have burned up before mixing to create the lethal gas.<br><br>As for his motivation, Assad has a long and well documented history of using fear to control the population. This could easily be an attempt to make the civilian population fear giving any aid to the rebels, and even fear the presence of the rebels, in an attempt to make the create a hostile environment. Bare in mind that there was a hospital that was likely treating rebels. It wouldn&#039;t surprise me if the Syrian government calculated that no one would get involved after this strike. The USA resorted to diplomacy last time, and the current administration has been making noises about being less hostile to Assad. This coupled with the fact they have more support from Russia, and the plausible deniability that comes from a messy and chaotic war makes this a totally feasible scenario.<br><br>Alternately it could have been a rogue strike without support or prior Knowledge from Assad. I don&#039;t know enough about the command structure to know how reasonable this is, but it wouldn&#039;t be too surprising to learn that an angry general or someone under intense pressure could have made this happen without Assad&#039;s backing.<br><br>It&#039;s interesting to note that no western governments have expressed much doubt that this was a Syrian government strike, even the Trump administration which was supposed to be more friendly (or at least neutral) to Assad.","time":1491560281,"resto":119829819,"id":"A+6MPFaz","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":119925142,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)06:18:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Literally world war 3 happening","time":1491560281,"resto":119829819,"id":"JpgyJ\/rR","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":119925159,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)06:18:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119924769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119924769<\/a><br>It&#039;s literally the most kike-support action he could&#039;ve taken.","time":1491560294,"resto":119829819,"id":"DrYzxlA2","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119925184,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)06:18:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119925057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119925057<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he doesn&#039;t want ww3 to happen.<\/span><br><br>Fuck of normalfag reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.","time":1491560311,"resto":119829819,"id":"T6yTEkiN","country":"PH","country_name":"Philippines"},{"no":119925190,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)06:18:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"You done fucked up America","time":1491560313,"resto":119829819,"id":"8Stfbuk9","country":"JO","country_name":"Jordan"},{"no":119925203,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)06:18:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119924781\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119924781<\/a><br>There&#039;s a lot of shills here trying to guide the narrative.

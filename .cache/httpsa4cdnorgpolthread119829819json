We know it was the result of an air strike, which would rule out the rebels and ISIS. The only possibility is the official government line that it hit a chemical weapons facility, but from what I have heard (I&#039;m not particularly knowledgeable on this myself) this is overwhelmingly unlikely, because they are stored in their constituent chemicals, which would have burned up before mixing to create the lethal gas.<br><br>As for his motivation, Assad has a long and well documented history of using fear to control the population. This could easily be an attempt to make the civilian population fear giving any aid to the rebels, and even fear the presence of the rebels, in an attempt to make the create a hostile environment. Bare in mind that there was a hospital that was likely treating rebels. It wouldn&#039;t surprise me if the Syrian government calculated that no one would get involved after this strike. The USA resorted to diplomacy last time, and the current administration has been making noises about being less hostile to Assad. This coupled with the fact they have more support from Russia, and the plausible deniability that comes from a messy and chaotic war makes this a totally feasible scenario.<br><br>Alternately it could have been a rogue strike without support or prior Knowledge from Assad. I don&#039;t know enough about the command structure to know how reasonable this is, but it wouldn&#039;t be too surprising to learn that an angry general or someone under intense pressure could have made this happen without Assad&#039;s backing.<br><br>It&#039;s interesting to note that no western governments have expressed much doubt that this was a Syrian government strike, even the Trump administration which was supposed to be more friendly (or at least neutral) to Assad.","time":1491560281,"resto":119829819,"id":"A+6MPFaz","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":119925142,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)06:18:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Literally world war 3 happening","time":1491560281,"resto":119829819,"id":"JpgyJ\/rR","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":119925159,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)06:18:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;119924769<\/span><br>It&#039;s literally the most kike-support action he could&#039;ve taken.","time":1491560294,"resto":119829819,"id":"DrYzxlA2","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119925184,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)06:18:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119925057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119925057<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he doesn&#039;t want ww3 to happen.<\/span><br><br>Fuck of normalfag reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.","time":1491560311,"resto":119829819,"id":"T6yTEkiN","country":"PH","country_name":"Philippines"},{"no":119925190,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)06:18:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"You done fucked up America","time":1491560313,"resto":119829819,"id":"8Stfbuk9","country":"JO","country_name":"Jordan"},{"no":119925203,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)06:18:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;119924781<\/span><br>There&#039;s a lot of shills here trying to guide the narrative.

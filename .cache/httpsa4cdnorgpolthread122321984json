As a true redpilled, enlightened mind, with no degenerate tendencies, you don&#039;t need religion to keep yourself in check. If I was a politician, I would definitely claim to be a christian and use christianity to give additional justification to my believes (&quot;le god meme said this as well in the bible!&quot;), but fuck me if I believe that medieval garbage.","filename":"anti-gay-bible-thumper[1]","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":344,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":134,"tim":1492892419586,"time":1492892419,"md5":"Iqc1qVmMfc1AMk6Hsl2MOQ==","fsize":96789,"resto":0,"id":"qAQRQbkK","country":"IT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"claims-to-be-redpilled","country_name":"Italy","replies":25,"images":11,"unique_ips":15},{"no":122322557,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)16:25:31","name":"Anonymous","com":":^)","filename":"Shroud_of_Turin","ext":".png","w":1292,"h":8757,"tn_w":18,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492892731328,"time":1492892731,"md5":"HkIle0J+6W8xTEUNruARyg==","fsize":4094897,"resto":122321984,"id":"JU8MMluz","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122323302,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)16:31:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Lmao OP, completely agree with you. <br><br>Hopefully in the near future, say a decade or so, the masses will leave religion en masse.

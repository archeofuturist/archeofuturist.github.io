Following any man-made religion and especially one as filled with contraddictions and hypocrisy as Christianity is retarded. <br><br>Only acceptable spiritual settings for redpilled people:<br>Agnostic <br>Atheist<br>Buddhist (not sure, I&#039;m still studying the subject)<br><br>How the fuck can you claim to be redpilled if you believe in man-made religions which are the epitome of bluepill, as in, believing shit that has LITERALLY no proof just because someone tells you to? Besides, that shit can be reinterpreted in any way, just look how the fucking Pope is using the fucking bible to justify the sandnigger invasion of Italy. The same fucking bible the american alt-right thumps to not justify it. See how the bible is endlessly reinterpretable bullshit and how it can be used to brainwash you?<br><br>But don&#039;t get me wrong, we NEED religion to keep the degenerate bluepilled masses in check. Without their godly good boy points system in place, they would act like the degenerates they are. As a true redpilled, enlightened mind, with no degenerate tendencies, you don&#039;t need religion to keep yourself in check. If I was a politician, I would definitely claim to be a christian and use christianity to give additional justification to my believes (&quot;le god meme said this as well in the bible!&quot;), but fuck me if I believe that medieval garbage.","filename":"anti-gay-bible-thumper[1]","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":344,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":134,"tim":1492892419586,"time":1492892419,"md5":"Iqc1qVmMfc1AMk6Hsl2MOQ==","fsize":96789,"resto":0,"id":"qAQRQbkK","country":"IT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"claims-to-be-redpilled","country_name":"Italy","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122322557,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)16:25:31","name":"Anonymous","com":":^)","filename":"Shroud_of_Turin","ext":".png","w":1292,"h":8757,"tn_w":18,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492892731328,"time":1492892731,"md5":"HkIle0J+6W8xTEUNruARyg==","fsize":4094897,"resto":122321984,"id":"JU8MMluz","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

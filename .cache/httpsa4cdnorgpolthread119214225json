greatly from a leftist invasion and we must to purge them from our ranks. They have contaminated every corner of libertarianism with communist filth. True libertarianism is a philosophy of non-intervention. In contrast leftist \u201cfreedom\u201d is defined as non-hierarchy. They deny the voluntary actions of man to form hierarchical structures and so obviously they must intervene using coercion and violence to collapse these natural structures in order to bring forth egalitarianism. We understand that these ideas cannot coexist with each other and that as long as egalitarian thought prevails as a mainstream ideology true freedom lovers will be labeled as evil fascists and something to be eradicated from society.<br><br>This is what passes as libertarianism today:<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Q_t<wbr>oYr_Hcdo&amp;t=1s<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=AVK<wbr>DbpYQTa0 <br><br>Libertarianism does not equal open borders, multiculturalism, or universal inclusivity.<br>We must make it clear that this is leftist subversion and communist trash.<br><br>We must not tolerate egalitarianism is any shape or form, especially within our own movement.

They use this line of bullshit under our name and poison our movement, making us entirely ineffective. Every effort to bring true libertarian ideas to the table is shouted at: STATISTS! FASCISTS!

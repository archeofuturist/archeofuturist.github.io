Yes, competition. Yes, monopolies are established by the state. What anarcho-capitalist academics grapple with foremost is the difficultly in defining a monopoly in the first place. A monopoly on what? Selling hoagie&#039;s on this particular corner in this particular city? Or is a monopoly one company owning a certain percentage of some arbitrarily defined industry? I certainly have a monopoly on the provision of my labor. <br><br>The point is that it&#039;s easy to call something a monopoly, depending on how you define it. Then, it&#039;s easy to justify government intervention by merely fitting the definition to the agenda. Government established monopolies, such as utilities, seem to be perfectly acceptable, whereas other arbitrarily defined monopolies are not. It&#039;s always arbitrary and it&#039;s always political. <br><br>Whatever the case, lets pretend we are in the mythical world of Ancapistan. How are monopolies prevented? The simple answer is that as a market moves towards monopoly the excess returns associated with that monopoly and so does the incentive to break that monopoly. Suppose a company controls the entire market for the provision of seeds to farmers (Monsanto). There&#039;s no company that could possibly enter this space and compete with them, right? Wrong. A major pharmaceutical company (Bayer) can easily maneuver themselves into this space, begin developing GMO seeds, and start competing with Monsanto.<br><br>The greater the monopoly a firm establishes, the higher the barrier of entry to the industry. However, simultaneously, the gains from breaking down that barrier increase. There&#039;s always someone else, there&#039;s never a pure monopoly, and there&#039;s never a way to maintain that monopoly without government intervention. That simple.","time":1491433615,"resto":119661676,"id":"iIv5S+MZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119670779,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:09:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"It will end in monopolies.

One hour will air each night for four nights.<br>A promotional clip shows Stone asking &quot;Why did Russia hack the election?&quot; Putin is shown smirking at the question.<br>Stone, who has been called the most controversial director in Hollywood, has been a critic of American power and political affairs for decades.<br>He recently told the Sydney Morning Herald that his Putin interviews will open up &quot;a whole viewpoint that we as Americans haven&#039;t heard.&quot;<br>Stone described the four-hour series this way: &quot;It&#039;s not a documentary as much as a question and answer session. Mr. Putin is one of the most important leaders in the world and in so far as the United States has declared him an enemy -- a great enemy -- I think it&#039;s very important we hear what he has to say.&quot;","time":1493676879,"resto":123681224,"id":"p7TJorWG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123681687,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:15:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Stone&#039;s producing partner on the project is Fernando Sulichin.

Stone repeatedly met with Snowden in Russia while working on the movie.<br>Some of Stone&#039;s trips to Russia also entailed interviews with Putin. &quot;I talked to him originally about the Snowden affair, which is in the film. And out of that grew, I think, a trust that he knew that I would not edit it so much,&quot; Stone told the Sydney Morning Herald.<br>According to Showtime, Stone wound up interviewing Putin &quot;more than a dozen times over the course of two years, most recently in February following the U.S. presidential elections.&quot;<br>Putin has granted a small number of interviews to Americans in recent years -- including to CBS&#039; Charlie Rose and CNN&#039;s Fareed Zakaria.<br>But Showtime is promoting Stone&#039;s sit-downs as uniquely extensive -- even invoking David Frost&#039;s interviews with Richard Nixon forty years ago.","time":1493676906,"resto":123681224,"id":"p7TJorWG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123682086,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:18:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123681625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123681625<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a four-hour documentary<\/span>","filename":"no time","ext":".jpg","w":628,"h":353,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493677103761,"time":1493677103,"md5":"+1MRFzXOXGBiXyUCu1DPdw==","fsize":40327,"resto":123681224,"id":"p7TJorWG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123682328,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:20:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123681224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123681224<\/a><br>He speaks English, but not fluent and prefers to give interviews in Russian, hence it will be with a translation as in all numerous Putin&#039;s interviews with western journalists before.<br>He&#039;s fairly fluen in German, but even then prefers to answer in Russian, obviously some sharpness is lost if you speak not your native mother language.<br>here&#039;s sneak preview btw<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BrB<wbr>oj760aD8","time":1493677216,"resto":123681224,"id":"uaZr3iC5","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123684531,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:37:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123682328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123682328<\/a><br>Such a tease.

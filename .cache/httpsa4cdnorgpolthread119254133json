Arabic Urdu was not codified until about 200 years after Mohammed&#039;s death, and it is unknown exactly when the first Quran was written, or by whom. This means that many linguistic and jusiprudential arguments can be made regarding the meaning of the literal passages. For example, the Hadith concerned with the &#039;killing of apostates&#039; can be read to mean &#039;the killing of (political) traitors&#039; in stead. These arguments rages for centuries before the fall of the Ottoman Empire, and should be encouraged to come again in the modern Islamic world.","filename":"1377054645001","ext":".jpg","w":4826,"h":3217,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491175713221,"time":1491175713,"md5":"jkTpYiZKIRRi39mYeiOJ9w==","fsize":1887042,"resto":119254133,"id":"4Zx42Svs","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

Leftists tend to hate anything that has an image of being strong, good and successful. They hate America, they hate Western civilization, they hate white males, they hate rationality. The reasons that leftists give for hating the West, etc. clearly do not correspond with their real motives. They SAY they hate the West because it is warlike, imperialistic, sexist, ethnocentric and so forth, but where these same faults appear in socialist countries or in primitive cultures, the leftist finds excuses for them, or at best he GRUDGINGLY admits that they exist; whereas he ENTHUSIASTICALLY points out (and often greatly exaggerates) these faults where they appear in Western civilization. Thus it is clear that these faults are not the leftist\u2019s real motive for hating America and the West. He hates America and the West because they are strong and successful.<br><br>16. Words like \u201cself-confidence,\u201d \u201cself-reliance,\u201d \u201cinitiative,\u201d \u201centerprise,\u201d \u201coptimism,\u201d etc., play little role in the liberal and leftist vocabulary. The leftist is anti-individualistic, pro-collectivist. He wants society to solve everyone\u2019s problems for them, satisfy everyone\u2019s needs for them, take care of them. He is not the sort of person who has an inner sense of confidence in his ability to solve his own problems and satisfy his own needs. The leftist is antagonistic to the concept of competition because, deep inside, he feels like a loser.","filename":"ted-kaczynski","ext":".jpg","w":272,"h":218,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1493869003633,"time":1493869003,"md5":"ynpbg6o3vNejihXYGxumzg==","fsize":18719,"resto":123988523,"id":"z73vIj\/V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124012665,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:39:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123989221\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123989221<\/a><br>Not monarchy, fascism would be good<br>Monarchs tend to be shity parents and raise shity heirs","time":1493869143,"resto":123988523,"id":"8mL3DVci","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124012730,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:39:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124003011\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124003011<\/a><br>what am i looking at?","time":1493869172,"resto":123988523,"id":"MtZM2yaZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124012903,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:41:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124012665\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124012665<\/a><br>someone else mentioned family rule. it doesn&#039;t have to be inherited. the strongest\/best leading man can take the title too. how it worked in the ancient times anyway.","time":1493869265,"resto":123988523,"id":"OFve68Na","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124013005,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:42:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123988523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123988523<\/a><br>1 post<br><br>we&#039;ve been had again.","time":1493869326,"resto":123988523,"id":"4FzCy5aV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124013181,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:43:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124006968\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124006968<\/a><br>\/lrg?","time":1493869410,"resto":123988523,"id":"qwBMYDWN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124013401,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:45:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124008309\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124008309<\/a><br>:)<br>works for me","time":1493869520,"resto":123988523,"id":"qwBMYDWN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124013457,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:45:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124008426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124008426<\/a><br>kek","time":1493869546,"resto":123988523,"id":"qwBMYDWN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124013517,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:46:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124009460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124009460<\/a><br>beat me to it","time":1493869579,"resto":123988523,"id":"qwBMYDWN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124013625,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:47:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124009554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124009554<\/a><br>well you are a statist retard....so","filename":"15936857_1224827014252282_3862183911860091061_o","ext":".png","w":1864,"h":820,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":54,"tim":1493869623388,"time":1493869623,"md5":"IkonbaxeOqRY5UD7BlisrA==","fsize":737136,"resto":123988523,"id":"qwBMYDWN","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":124013773,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:48:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124009748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124009748<\/a><br>lets exterminate SJWs <br>then continue this debate","filename":"15936925_1225186147549702_945899955369074098_o","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":993,"tn_w":80,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493869702471,"time":1493869702,"md5":"gisoVvWR6dEaYY1RwRKBlg==","fsize":71589,"resto":123988523,"id":"qwBMYDWN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124013847,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:48:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124010251\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124010251<\/a><br>fukin mcKek w fries","time":1493869738,"resto":123988523,"id":"qwBMYDWN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124014186,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:51:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124011595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124011595<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NEl<wbr>4XcoSMf8&amp;t=4379s<br><br>capitalism does remove shortages and allow fun and sexy behavior in big mansions<br>yes!!!<br><br>I love it!!<br>lets exterminate all anticapitalists!!","time":1493869908,"resto":123988523,"id":"qwBMYDWN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124014510,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:54:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123988523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123988523<\/a><br>Advancing from libertarian to traditionalism requires fleshing out your understanding of what a human actually is. A human is a collection of animal urges with the good sense to control them. When you don&#039;t control the animal urges, you become an animal, which you can see for yourself when you look at people with low self-control: they live in squalor, they cannot help themselves, they routinely depend on others for survival, and everything about them is crude and dysfunctional. Animal behavior is the opposite of effective human labor, which makes it the opposite of civilization itself.<br>There was once a time society knew about this and handled it through understandings of vice and pro-social institutions. If you wanted to have sex, you&#039;d get married, and form a family that would promote excess labor, strong human bonds, and passing on society&#039;s values. If you wanted to laze about and stuff your face, you&#039;d have to work hard all year and then get to enjoy a holy day with your family. And you&#039;ll notice that all of those activities hold an air of extra meaning to them, of refinement, because the animalistic urge they satiate is wrapped up and obfuscated in privacy, the only birthplace of intimacy.<br><br>Discipline is humanity, civility is civilization. It is the fundamental and ongoing condition of civilization that people must be refined, civilized, and disciplined, and they get this way by having it imposed upon them, the way a child has the lessons of adulthood imposed upon them. It is guidance, and what is society if not family writ large?<br><br>Choosing freedom from guidance is not real freedom, because it ALWAYS costs you freedom from dependence. Just look at our society and its welfare state. The gluttons and single mother whores who live by others&#039; penny.<br>The problem with libertarianism is that any society guided exclusively by the rule of doing no immediate harm to others will sooner or later find itself incapable of following even that lone stipulation.","filename":"thdfrn","ext":".png","w":1605,"h":851,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":66,"tim":1493870076159,"time":1493870076,"md5":"xCoBDvJqQ5LO8OCBYFKgHA==","fsize":1024374,"resto":123988523,"id":"oAziuX\/u","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124014525,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:54:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124011753\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124011753<\/a><br>I like the pic<br>but isnt capitalism that?<br>not fascism?<br>facism might lead to some lazy shti as leaders boss thier servans and just have fun<br>so few have good life but most slave away <br>any only those things get funded which can convince these top tier<br><br>in capitalism kings thrown down nonstop as new products rise to replace old<br>free markets","time":1493870082,"resto":123988523,"id":"qwBMYDWN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124014656,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:55:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124013625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124013625<\/a><br>kekcellent","filename":"16252550_1241655005902816_342527346324625086_o","ext":".png","w":1336,"h":1022,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1493870153235,"time":1493870153,"md5":"ZNnyCxSxLZfoFcjKoz5OjQ==","fsize":253508,"resto":123988523,"id":"qwBMYDWN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124014936,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:58:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124014510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124014510<\/a><br>you are so self contradictign here its insane<br>capitalism works fine<br>work or starve<br>its forced altruism<br>if you dont offer me something<br>fuck off n starve<br>so all win win<br>imagine if million of transaction win win all day all year all decade etc<br>we all be 1000x richer","time":1493870314,"resto":123988523,"id":"qwBMYDWN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124015048,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)23:59:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123989856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123989856<\/a><br><br>The similarity is that they are both ideologies of exceptionalism.

I have been wondering how the hell people are oscillating between the two ideologies, when they seem to be so fundamentally different, and yet I could feel something deeply similar between them in a way I could not place, something very small but defining. I couldnt figure out what it is but I think you have nailed it. As someone who likes Ancap ideas, I have tried to figure out for a while now what it is about fascism that seems to draw me in on a purely &quot;feelings&quot; based approach. I dont agree with 99% of fascism but this is the one commonality between ancap and fascism, both despise or are at the very least intolerant in their very nature to mediocrity, parasitism, incompetence, weakness, etc. You have to have a certain level of strength and independence to be able to live in an ancap society, and same goes for fascism. Personally I would imagine that an ancap society would finally force me to become the kind of person I want to be, simply through circumstance. Adapt or perish. But I dont like fascist economic or social ideas, nor do I like their silly philosophies, i.e Evola.","time":1493872196,"resto":123988523,"id":"FTYqixdr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124018568,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:31:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123998741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123998741<\/a><br>Then it&#039;s not libertarian anymore, moron.","time":1493872272,"resto":123988523,"id":"mHgnS8Qe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124018793,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:33:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124018568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124018568<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;libertarian means rampant degeneracy<\/span><br><br>No thats called liberalism.<br>Fuck off and kys.","time":1493872399,"resto":123988523,"id":"fWluwMQX","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":124018801,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:33:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124018204\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124018204<\/a><br>yet USA singapore hongkong are way ahead of you in gdp per cap<br><br>who has const mon that works?<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/List_<wbr>of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_c<wbr>apita<br><br>caveat: norway and arab sit on oil, otherwise would be way way less<br>potatokastan is low tax gate to EU commy block from usa, in long term wont be good","time":1493872403,"resto":123988523,"id":"qwBMYDWN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124018854,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:33:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123994885\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123994885<\/a><br>Literal fairytale, top fucking kek.","time":1493872431,"resto":123988523,"id":"5ozEsNtm","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":124018998,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:35:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124018793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124018793<\/a><br>Show me one single fact to back up your idea that libertarian=throwing &#039;degenerates&#039; out of helicopters or shut the fuck up.

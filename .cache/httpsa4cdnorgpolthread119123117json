It&#039;s amazing how capitalism can produce the car, the symbol of proletarian &quot;freedom&quot;, and then in concatenation produce the driverless car effectively undermining it&#039;s own &quot;defining values&quot;. Now we have capitalism transforming the car into an atomized form of public transport.

Graphics card is definitely going to be your cheapest upgrade option as anything else at this point is going to require you to get a new cpu or move up to DDR4. Unless you&#039;re comfortable with overclocking, in which case you could get yourself a decent cooler and a new tower and then just ramp your clock speed up.<br>I&#039;m not too familiar with rendering but your graphics card and cpu should carry you through 1080p videos fairly easily. Maybe the programs you&#039;re using aren&#039;t configured properly. Try switching exclusively to GPU or CPU rendering and see if it speeds up, if neither is performing faster than the other, try turning on graphics acceleration.<br>Another consideration to make is the read and write speeds of your hard drives, make sure you have the rendering program and the render file on one SSD and then have the output sent to the other SSD. That should eliminate any possible bottlenecking if you&#039;re using the same drive for everything, not that it should matter if you&#039;re using SSDs.","time":1491010895,"resto":119123117,"id":"HsnSJgFI","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119128071,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:42:07","name":"The triplord formerly known as Not Bomber Rimmer","com":"<a href=\"#p119127777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119127777<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Digits confirm<\/span>","filename":"Gib pepe","ext":".png","w":1024,"h":816,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":99,"tim":1491010927050,"time":1491010927,"md5":"HmxMFWbB56Nr4JpK9peXTw==","fsize":1611514,"resto":119123117,"id":"ipj42Jjc","country":"GB","trip":"!!FJ60XUrqjrt","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119128079,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:42:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119127601\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119127601<\/a><br>not really. we arent interested in what the spanish think. let alone saying fuck you to them.<br><br>their claim lies from losing a war 300 years ago.<br><br>it would be like the uk claiming sovereignty over the usa because it lost a conflict 300 years ago fair and square.","time":1491010933,"resto":119123117,"id":"smRXLsCx","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119128185,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:43:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119127919\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119127919<\/a><br>Abraham Lincoln was full blown muh heritage for Wales.<br><br>He had one of the bricks on the Washington monument engraved with Welsh superiority.","time":1491010999,"resto":119123117,"id":"a0cccPR5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119128203,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:43:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119127703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119127703<\/a><br>That&#039;s a fair criticism but most of Berkshire is really nice.<br><br>Slough does really bring the county down though, although Reading isn&#039;t all that great","time":1491011008,"resto":119123117,"id":"bAR+8f0T","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119128267,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)21:44:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119127777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119127777<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119127999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119127999<\/a><br><br>Goddamn.

It will backfire, the Tories will lose out.<br>2. The Lib Dems will MASSIVELY GAIN as they have a clear pro-EU stance - IT ALREADY HAPPENED in the Richmond Park by-election!<br>3. Labour may well divide, with Chuka Umunna and other centrists forming a new party, just like Emanuel Macron did in France!<br>4. The &quot;anti-austerity&quot; movement of teachers and healthcare workers is GROWING - I think they will stick the knife into the Tories too.<br><br>The Tories have everything to lose, and their opponents have everything to gain.<br><br>Well done Theresa.

She acted like a petulant child throughout the debate as some sort of Trump-like strategy but it came off as forced and awkward, like her hysterical female side became dominant, she didn&#039;t come off as presidential. Everyone expected Macron to suck because he was the weakest one in a previous debate but he displayed great strategical approach and technical knowledge on economical details, which threw Marine off, his overall behavior also came off as presidential, which is really weird because so far he was the hysterical one during his meetings, typically preaching empty marketing slogans without substance. Marine kept attacking him with weak ad hominems which he deflected with ease, while she didn&#039;t effectively put her program and ideas at the center of the debate. On economics, she got destroyed. She only beat him in regards to national security issues. It&#039;s really disappointing, because her aggressive strategy was the right idea but she did it all wrong, she should have done it with serious anger instead of her hysterical sarcasm, and pushed him harder on his weaker points.<br><br>Fuck, unless the Macron tax evasion scandal is legit and blows up in the upcoming days, or another terrorist attack happens, we&#039;re doomed!<br><br>She seriously needs to steps down for 2022, the nationalists need a new party with a new name and new leaders; FN and Le Pen names are poison.","time":1493881023,"resto":124031708,"id":"QNMIfvn5","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":124032373,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:57:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124032085\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124032085<\/a><br>fuck off stromae.<br><a href=\"#p124032096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124032096<\/a><br>wtf, i love bankers now.","time":1493881065,"resto":124031708,"id":"BIfr1aMU","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124032418,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:58:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124031708\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124031708<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Macron sounds more and more like a teacher<\/span><br>This is a tactic as old as dirt its played condescension and arrogance all for the audience its used literally everywhere hell in austria we call these willfully arrogant condescending show offs always sarcastically &quot;professor&quot;.","time":1493881098,"resto":124031708,"id":"ITYf90MN","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":124032451,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:58:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124031884\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124031884<\/a><br><br>I&#039;d rather be governed by a kraut than a dumb bitch that don&#039;t know the difference between a cellphone and a turbine","time":1493881123,"resto":124031708,"id":"OWYHmiMr","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":124032552,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)03:00:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124032312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124032312<\/a><br>tldr<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not gonna lie, former Le Pen voter here.

They&#039;re completely superfluous and they might as well not be there. Also I can tell Le Pen and Macron legitimately hate each other. Pretty entertaining.<br><br>- Le Pen is a Nationalist through and through, very consistent with her message. Most importantly: shills making &quot;Le Pen was awful&quot; snipe shitposts are just that, shitposting. If you&#039;re a nationalist, there is no way what she said isn&#039;t music to your ears. Only annoyance is her not really answering the questions to steer the debate where she wants, but that happens in every single political debate around the world. She comes forth as competent and knows her stuff. She definitely had Macron squirming at a few points.<br><br>- Macron is a pro-EU globalist through and through, and is consistent in that message. I can see that all the talk about that wasn&#039;t unfounded. He struck me as the typical slick politician, well spoken, centrist, designed to get the most votes. If you&#039;re an SJW cuck, what he said is music to your ears though. I can tell he&#039;s the pro-establishment guy, and I&#039;m sure French voters can see that too. EU, GLOBALISM, &quot;WELCOMING SOCIETY&quot;. Those are his key words. One thing of note, his constant cries of &quot;THAT&#039;S A LIE, LIAR LIAR LIAR&quot; without really saying why makes HIM come off a bit as a petulant child.<br><br>So in sum, shills pretending to be pro-FN and saying Le Pen lost the debate are completely full of shit.

It is important to note that the rat did not survive long-term, but that was never the goal. The team knew the rat would not live long, as there are still a lot of technical and scientific issues that need to be resolved before we can successfully perform head transplants on living organisms and have them survive.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The goal of this particular experiment was simple: the scientists wanted to know if they could successfully transplant a head without damaging the brain due to excessive blood loss. And they did. To do this, they had to keep the blood circulation going during the transplant by attaching the donor rat\u2019s blood vessels to the other rat.<\/span>","filename":"CNS-rats","ext":".jpg","w":1440,"h":809,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493601853611,"time":1493601853,"md5":"uD2FGWG9OWQ\/gVxgA2y+Vg==","fsize":73427,"resto":123557230,"id":"G\/26tt43","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123557623,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)21:25:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123557230\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123557230<\/a><br>Eternal life is impractical and unnatural.","time":1493601901,"resto":123557230,"id":"9zkqLvNr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123557845,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)21:26:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123557623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123557623<\/a><br>I imagined it could be fun for a while.

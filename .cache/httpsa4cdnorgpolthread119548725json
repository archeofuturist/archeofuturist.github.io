One of them is Ty Williams, who asks via Twitter about Trump exploiting fear. Ty asked, when you\u2014&quot;[Can] you please expand on your comments in AlterNet that Trump admin could stage attack? What historical parallel do you have in mind?&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;NOAM CHOMSKY: Well, actually, the statement I made was pretty muted. It wasn\u2019t quite as strong as the headlines indicated. What I pointed out\u2014and what everyone, I think, is aware of\u2014is that sooner or later this con game is not going to work. People will understand he\u2019s not bringing back jobs. He\u2019s not going to recreate the partly illusory, partly real picture of what life was like in the past, with manufacturing jobs and a functioning society, and you could get ahead, and so and so forth. He\u2019s not going to create that.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What happens at that point? Something has to be done to maintain control. The obvious technique is scapegoating. So blame it on immigrants, on Muslims, on somebody. But that can only go so far. The next step would be, as I said, an alleged terrorist attack, which is quite easy. It\u2019s, in fact, almost normal to\u2014like Condoleezza Rice\u2019s mushroom clouds. That\u2019s easy to construct, alleged attacks. The other possibility is a staged attack of a minor kind. And how hard would that be? Take the FBI technique, which they\u2019re using constantly, of creating situations of entrapment. Well, suppose one of them goes a little too far, that you don\u2019t stop it right in time. That wouldn\u2019t be hard to work out. I don\u2019t particularly anticipate it, but it\u2019s a possibility. And this is a very frightened country. For years, this has been probably the most frightened country in the world. It\u2019s also the safest country in the world. It\u2019s very easy to terrify people.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.democracynow.org\/2017\/4<wbr>\/4\/when_scapegoating_immigrants_no_<wbr>longer_works","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-04 at 6.43.45 PM","ext":".png","w":1128,"h":626,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":138,"tim":1491356723625,"time":1491356723,"md5":"c35tEsYE4pWnMBPcqfzYqA==","fsize":1088970,"resto":0,"id":"wQs2kcGD","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"noam-chomsky-says-trump-can-construct-a-terrorist","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":119548968,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:47:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119548725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119548725<\/a><br>False flag attacks are numerous throughout US history, it&#039;s not exactly ground breaking stuff to say the government could commit such an attack, the question is what would be gained?

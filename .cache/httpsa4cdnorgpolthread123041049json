To carry a gun in operational mode in public, you need a reason. But to own a gun and use it on a gun range or gun club, you just need a gun club membership and a gun safety course or alternatively a hunting license.","time":1493305007,"resto":123041049,"id":"3uADIu1M","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123044389,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)10:58:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123041049\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123041049<\/a><br>Bin that knife Brit bong.","filename":"1492171828739","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":796,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493305088950,"time":1493305088,"md5":"csxcDv+ArtKwF171ylsmUQ==","fsize":154866,"resto":123041049,"id":"7vh0GLnm","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123044449,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)10:58:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123044259\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123044259<\/a><br>I didn&#039;t.

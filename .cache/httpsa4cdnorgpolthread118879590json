It ties in nicely with the leftist concept of enforcing equal results because of course if there is unequal distribution of wealth it must be oppression, it couldn&#039;t be that some demographics are collectively more likely to invest in their children; no person should be allowed to put their own child in a position with an advantage over another child, or the government should come in to devalue the work one family member did to give something to their children by equalizing things with tax dollars.","time":1490848734,"resto":118879590,"id":"PNa3\/1th","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118883630,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:40:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118879590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118879590<\/a><br>I find edgy, nihilist liberals like Carlin even more annoying than SJWs.<br><br>While SJWs are obnoxious, they at least have some type of conviction.

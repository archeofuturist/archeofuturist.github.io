They then decide to elect a leader who will delegate different parts of the project to the group&#039;s members. They finish their project, receiving an excellent grade.<br><br>Now if the other groups want to discover what it is that allowed this group to achieve an excellent grade, what should they focus on? <br><br>&quot;Aha!&quot; one group says, &quot;they elected a leader for their group. Therefore, if we elect a leader for our group, we will do just as well as them.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Aha!&quot; another says, &quot;they divided the work evenly. Therefore, if we divide the work evenly, our group will be just as successful.&quot;<br><br>It&#039;s clear both of these assumptions are wrong. The real reason the group did well is because they were the smartest, highest achieving students. Voting to select a leader was just a tool used by the group. It was a means to an end.<br>Likewise, economics is a tool. Authoritarianism is a tool. They are like machines in a warehouse. They can increase efficiency, they can improve output, but like all tools they are dependent on their users.<br><br>I don&#039;t believe socialism efficiently allocates resources for large groups of people, but this is irrelevant. If you have a population filled with selfish incompetent assholes, who cares whether the selfish incompetent assholes operate from within the government or from within the private sector. The damage will be done just the same.","filename":"spartans","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492991134422,"time":1492991134,"md5":"rqnTYxAJUSftnoYf0ZPsAQ==","fsize":73332,"resto":0,"id":"\/QOXAIbc","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-people-matter-politics-is-a-red-herring","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122509751,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:45:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"If the population is comprised of fools, what does it matter if you vote with your dollar or with your ballot?

We can argue all day about whether that level of taxes is reasonable or most efficient, but it doesn&#039;t really matter.

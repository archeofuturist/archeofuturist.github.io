The constitution is over two centuries old, and it is starting to show its age. Before you stop reading and label me something I may not be, wait, I have some stipulations of my own. First, the Bill of Rights must be included and ratified with the new Constitution verbatim as it was ratified in 1791. Second there be some requirement of at least 40 states for ratification. There is much that the constitution does well, and these enumerations will be included, but there is too much for an Amendment to fix. <br><br>Our Legislators need to be more dependent on their constituents. At least one Senator must be selected by the State\u2019s legislature. Some powers of the Federal government need to be expanded, and others contracted. No more direct taxes on Citizens, there must be some way to do it at the congressional district level.<br>The President must be elected in a manner that is more representative of the people. The current system allows too much for duopoly. The role of the Executive probably needs to expand, but more strictly defined. No more of this Executive privilege, and Orders nonsense. This also requires strict separations of power. The factions we call Parties are disrupting this process.<br>The Supreme Court requires Term Limits, but make it at least 19 years, and always require the court to be of an odd number of judges of 9 or more, with a max of 11? Further define the powers of the court. Any of you Law-ers got any ideas?","filename":"likethisbutnooneisdead","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493356245299,"time":1493356245,"md5":"B6Du0n01+eAlY\/mcQLCzAw==","fsize":150055,"resto":0,"id":"36+mrdhI","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-place-is-our-newspaper-here-is-a-submission","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123151455,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)01:11:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123151422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123151422<\/a><br>Section Four is where we can move some of those not in the BofR into the main text; We turn the fugitive slave clause into the citizenship clause; something about the rights of all. <br>Article Five is our dear friend and shall be left alone, except maybe the clause about slave laws.<br>Article 6 we use to define our banking system, or lack of one. We can use this article to stop the presses and the consent to any further national debt. We must pay it all off, and then we can start to use a new, or our old, currency. Can we also extend the Constitutional protections into all Judges? From what I\u2019ve learned, the Family courts seem to be quite fucked.<br>Finally the numbers required for ratification. At least forty are required, but even 45 or all for ratification. It might be time to force the issue of Puerto Rican statehood. They must be a State, or let free to be a country. Of course, as in Victoria 2, we will be forced to turn Puerto Rico into a puppet state more than currently is. This must not be allowed to happen, Puerto Rico must be a State.<br><br>We also mess around with some of the Amendments.","time":1493356265,"resto":123151422,"id":"36+mrdhI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123151497,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)01:11:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123151455\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123151455<\/a><br>The recent confrontations have show us that the only way to resolve The Troubles is for us to talk, violence will only create more violence, further pushing their plans.

Sure our hopes may not be completely compatible, but this is alright since ours is a board of centrists, a board of peace.

What better way to show our motives than to display our outcome. Write it as if it were our governing document. Some of us do have the required principals to reignite our flame of liberty.

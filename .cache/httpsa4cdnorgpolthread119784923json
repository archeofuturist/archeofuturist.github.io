I can tell you for a fact, things like this really improve the reputation of Canada (and Germany etc.) in the eyes of Middle Eastern journalists, politicians etc. It means that they will have influence in various institutions and countries in the future, and it may even benefit commercial circles too... I can give you some examplse, I know some Arab businesses that buy Germany solely for the fact that they&#039;re German and have an extremely good reputation in the Arab world for multiple reasons, Canada can and could do the same \/ better. <br><br>On the whole I think it may even benefit Canada, financially too in the long term. You people are reactionaries, no better than Zionists, people like Trudeau think long term.","time":1491511876,"resto":119784923,"id":"DWYYw9Fo","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119792896,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:51:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119791618\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119791618<\/a><br>even 1$ is too much for them","time":1491511883,"resto":119784923,"id":"1wQZDiYI","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119792946,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:51:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119789349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119789349<\/a><br>Fuckin laughed.","filename":"1487458747552","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":549,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1491511906914,"time":1491511906,"md5":"rAYtU5T8qiQB8ifSVOiQZQ==","fsize":54673,"resto":119784923,"id":"Yp\/dM1o5","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119793038,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:52:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119792356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119792356<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;harper sold all the gold<\/span><br>check again","filename":"canada-gold","ext":".png","w":1384,"h":970,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1491511943637,"time":1491511943,"md5":"oR60i8+XzNu6dYG2lWkgLQ==","fsize":122027,"resto":119784923,"id":"HOtP7EkP","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119793043,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:52:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119784923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119784923<\/a><br>SK budget is fucking gutted and were just handing cash to shitskins<br><br>what does my city protest? that we are shutting down some fucky bus service nobody used<br><br>kill me","time":1491511946,"resto":119784923,"id":"4uyCXxei","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119793082,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:52:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119792872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119792872<\/a><br>BEADY","time":1491511963,"resto":119784923,"id":"LAy4j6Dx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119793211,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)16:53:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119792872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119792872<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;much goodwill and influence it will give Canada<\/span><br>Canada you did well to send all that money to ISIS.

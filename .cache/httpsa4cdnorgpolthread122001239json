The Red Army&#039;s supply lines were depleted and they had no defense for the armor and air power that would have been brought to bare. It is said Churchill supported such a plan led by a preemptive Atomic strike on Moscow. European (((communisim))) could have been eradicated. What remained of the Russian Army might have been turned to aid the Nationalists in the Chinese Civil War. Communism could have been eradicated by the 50&#039;s and millions of lives saved.","filename":"tmp_9618-general_patton11104186041","ext":".jpg","w":303,"h":353,"tn_w":214,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492699607368,"time":1492699607,"md5":"y7mnKmh4MMQTGKTvuN5abA==","fsize":23872,"resto":0,"id":"51wnlDFf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"on-420-remember-patton-wanted-to-fix-adolphs","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":5,"unique_ips":11},{"no":122001305,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:47:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Link pls","time":1492699652,"resto":122001239,"id":"7JEZM1J\/","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":122001498,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:49:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122001239\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122001239<\/a><br>Yea, you fuck this up.","filename":"11866361_874161782632133_2597502670019004486_n","ext":".jpg","w":530,"h":720,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492699780172,"time":1492699780,"md5":"wUMCWBYL3fppgBCPT748SQ==","fsize":98956,"resto":122001239,"id":"uI2sioRj","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":122001654,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:51:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"and he got killed","time":1492699872,"resto":122001239,"id":"MDyH1H5Z","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":122001809,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:52:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122001305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122001305<\/a><br>http:\/\/www.rense.com\/general92\/patt<wbr>on.htm","time":1492699966,"resto":122001239,"id":"51wnlDFf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122001824,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:52:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122001239\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122001239<\/a><br>Wasn&#039;t that Churchill?","time":1492699978,"resto":122001239,"id":"gZFTMfRP","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":122001828,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:53:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122001239\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122001239<\/a><br>He knew too much and now has returned to finish what he started.","filename":"patton trump","ext":".png","w":973,"h":553,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1492699980658,"time":1492699980,"md5":"0J7kMgIGDBKYSbKeUjF+MA==","fsize":657671,"resto":122001239,"id":"HwqLxSbs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122001852,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:53:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122001239\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122001239<\/a><br><br>muh, another one pooton thread","filename":"patton","ext":".png","w":600,"h":431,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1492699994470,"time":1492699994,"md5":"eIgSzrnfpBiFzVgzhw9lqA==","fsize":406905,"resto":122001239,"id":"sLRBHqJD","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":122001950,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:54:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"germany had no forces after kursk, just a bunch of imaginary divisions on paper who only had 1\/10th their original strength. virtually everyone in the german army of 1941 had died by 1944.","time":1492700051,"resto":122001239,"id":"W02KZrpc","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122001956,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:54:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122001498\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122001498<\/a><br>You&#039;re right Anon.

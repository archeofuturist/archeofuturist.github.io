Pretty nice city too.<br><br>Afterwards, it depends which way you want to go first. Mediterranean Morocco or down the North Atlantic coast?<br><br>If you go for the former way, then Chefchaouen and Tetouan are must-visit cities. The former is full of white-washed winding alleys, blue doors, and olive trees, and is also the literal weed capital of the world besides Amsterdam. The latter has very beautiful beaches and is a gateway to the rif, although it has a lot of interesting places to visit too, like the old Medina (old city), with its three jewish\/andalusian\/berber sections. Then, you&#039;ll be able to go further down in the Middle Atlas (historic tourism in Fez and Meknes), then either towards the high Atlas for Marrakesh (mythical city that you should always visit if you&#039;re going to Morocco for the first time, especially Jamaa el-Fnaa) or east towards the Saharan Eastern part for camel safaris and sand nights under the starry saharan sky. You can rent 4x4&#039;s for days.<br><br>If you&#039;re going through the North Atlantic coast instead, then expect a LOT of nice, laid-back beach towns (like El Jadida and Oualidia). Music festivals and bazaars are abound too (Asilah, for example, has lots of them). Avoid Casablanca, it&#039;s the biggest city in Morocco but it doesn&#039;t have any real feel\/history to it and has all the downsides of big cities. Larache is interesting too: very calm city, and the main harbour of the former Spanish protectorate.<br><br>Afterwards, go down to the South Atlantic coast, which is mostly known for its watersports. You&#039;ll be able to do a fuckload of that there, especially in Taghazout (world-known for its surf spots) or Essaouira\/Agadir, which are pretty active. More relaxed than the Northern coast. After that, you can go to the Middle Atlas easily.","filename":"1485466716962","ext":".png","w":891,"h":949,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492445227776,"time":1492445227,"md5":"Yoj0eNKdWnncSePJKdFFZA==","fsize":166532,"resto":121531785,"id":"g3EIXMMu","country":"MA","country_name":"Morocco"},{"no":121542500,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)12:07:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Seems like SAA are advancing in their counterattack against the failed Hama offensive.<br><br>This is juicy I wonder how far they&#039;ll push.","time":1492445266,"resto":121531785,"id":"7hzDSLu9","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121542523,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)12:07:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121542067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121542067<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jihadijulian BTFO <\/span><br>did some of you autists did this ?","filename":"hahahahaha","ext":".png","w":578,"h":520,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":112,"tim":1492445276257,"time":1492445276,"md5":"hKNo6tptFh9rlgwY4FbMmQ==","fsize":87935,"resto":121531785,"id":"u9Ptu1Xm","country":"MK","country_name":"Macedonia"},{"no":121542712,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)12:09:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121542267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121542267<\/a><br>He probably got sleepy.","filename":"1482065323545","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":808,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492445377108,"time":1492445377,"md5":"H27ckw0Qa3dJzETwCSq2zA==","fsize":165429,"resto":121531785,"id":"eUYKYqau","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121542773,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)12:10:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121541895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121541895<\/a><br>i&#039;d love to have a discussion about the EU but i don&#039;t have a lot of time right now.<br>just make sure you join the phalanx when the albos chimp out","time":1492445406,"resto":121531785,"id":"LkO2siPP","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":121542895,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)12:11:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121542523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121542523<\/a><br>We all know that he is peedor","time":1492445460,"resto":121531785,"id":"cqq\/sfJu","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121543031,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)12:12:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121542067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121542067<\/a><br>It was us the last time , who of you autists is behind it this time<br>can&#039;t say i&#039;m not proud","filename":"1480378228588","ext":".jpg","w":1199,"h":693,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":72,"tim":1492445524248,"time":1492445524,"md5":"erRn2JzzyzU0ZK36pZF9Ig==","fsize":161184,"resto":121531785,"id":"LkO2siPP","country":"BE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":121543104,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)12:12:37","name":"The Ebin Shitposter","com":"<a href=\"#p121542523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121542523<\/a><br>We need to send him MLP porn","filename":"1492128891952","ext":".png","w":327,"h":316,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1492445557589,"time":1492445557,"md5":"bzSpa19PkQD\/Sx\/3mYcf6Q==","fsize":168513,"resto":121531785,"id":"caSp\/cxp","country":"US","trip":"!1YNqpzhz4c","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121543117,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)12:12:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121542523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121542523<\/a><br>It seems that he liked it","time":1492445565,"resto":121531785,"id":"bRfQ2O8e","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":121543351,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)12:14:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"via \/wm\/<br>WE WUZ STAR WARS AND SHIEETT","filename":"sirian wars","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492445683861,"time":1492445683,"md5":"gUJXGtREFuiLyvY1HuD+9Q==","fsize":1224378,"resto":121531785,"id":"ilW4IL4i","country":"PE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Peru"},{"no":121543407,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)12:15:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121542419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121542419<\/a><br>I want to visit too<br>Atlas mountains seem interesting","time":1492445714,"resto":121531785,"id":"yJfe5HtK","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121543437,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)12:15:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121542523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121542523<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121542067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121542067<\/a><br>He did it by himself!

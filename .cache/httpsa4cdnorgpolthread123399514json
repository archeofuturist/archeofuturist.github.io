As Jeff Sessions continues his crime war, there is no doubt that his sights will land on anonymous imageboards sooner or later. After all, places like this allow the free exchange of ideas with little or no accountability. In situations like this, extremists, terrorists, and dangerous ideologues can easily take control. Just one or two confirmed cases of collusion involving imageboards is all the justification Congress will need to enact the Online Identity Act which will require a unique pin linked to your SSN to log onto the internet and forbid things like anon posting.<br><br>In this case, what is the game plan? I personally endorse the creation of cellular networks modeled off of Tor run off personal computers and small-scale broadcasting. But what will you do when the end comes? Will you just accept this ultimate slap in the face, or will you forge ahead into ever-deeper levels of subversive autist expertery? Let&#039;s save the world guys. Fun thread ahead.","filename":"TRUERELIGION","ext":".jpg","w":615,"h":409,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493508782450,"time":1493508782,"md5":"yDYMEgY+Xq8HuSZXsEje+Q==","fsize":80627,"resto":0,"id":"Vm0AtaHe","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"postcrackdown-megathread","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":123399682,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)19:34:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"what another thing trump is gonna do to fuck his voters? man how much can 1 man backstab?","time":1493508869,"resto":123399514,"id":"2lzFNFuS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123399826,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)19:35:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123399682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123399682<\/a><br>Infinity times, anon.

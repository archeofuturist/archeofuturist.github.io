If you are sick, unemployed or old, there would be a social security to guarantee you a minimum level of existence. However, there is no upper bound on how much a person achieve. <br><br>In socialism, there is often a lower bound, but more importantly a very strong upper bound. There is a strong compulsion to not allow anyone to get too rich, by the government controlling all methods of production.<br><br>If people are dying\/suffering without the basic necessities [such as food, clothing, shelter] there is absolute poverty. If some are a lot rich and others not so rich, then there is relative poverty. Welfare capitalism worries primarily about absolute poverty, while socialism worries more about relative poverty. For capitalist it often doesn&#039;t matter that there is wealth inequality, because those are natural [not all gets Olympic medals, Nobel prizes, honor, awards for instance]. For a socialist, inequality is a problem.<br><br>A capitalist nation with a welfare system is pretty much capitalism. There is no fundamental change. It is just that the government provides an additional service - an insurance against abject poverty.&quot;<br><br>1\/P","filename":"socialism-vs-capitalism","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":307,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":239,"tim":1491144917461,"time":1491144917,"md5":"wNkmA8PCxAqu5HO5suBPAg==","fsize":20516,"resto":0,"id":"SfFNA76E","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-want-pols-thoughts-on-this","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119207301,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)11:00:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119206831\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119206831<\/a><br>&quot;Capitalism has three key elements:<br>-Private Property. the government recognizes the right of people to own land, property, inventions, shares and any other form of capital.

Go examine what was happening during the period from 1840-1930 before the creation of the welfare state. During this time there was an explosion in membership for fraternal orders and mutual benefit societies. These groups provided death benefits, health insurance, and other forms of aid during an absent welfare state. Close to 1 in 5 adults was a member of these organizations in the US. The welfare state is not necessary.<br><br>Also you cannot get rid of poverty. Poverty is the default mode of mankind. We came into this world wearing loin cloths and looking for berries. Socialists think you can get rid of poverty by throwing money at it. That generally is just a complete waste of money that solves nothing. What you can do is create conditions which raise the standard of living in order to pull people out of poverty.","time":1491145520,"resto":119206831,"id":"VyCazE3l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

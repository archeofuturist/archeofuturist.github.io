Period. <br><br>No, like seriously, if you don&#039;t support the legalization of marijuana you&#039;re incredibly fucking blue-pilled. It&#039;s honestly kind of embarrassing that there are still burgers slurping up the government&#039;s narrative. Weed is degenerate? Yeah, so is spending a majority of your day on an anime image board. You know what else is degenerate? That fucking Grand Mac you have there in your hand. A fucking grand mac? The big mac wasn&#039;t big enough for you, you fat fuck?<br><br>That coffee you drink, DEGENERATE. Yes, I said it. If you need the coffee jew to keep you functioning as a slave, you&#039;re blue-pilled. Look friendos, my point is, we often partake in a lot of degenerate activities. Whether it&#039;s porn (which makes you are LITERAL cuck prove me wrong), drinking soda, drinking the alcohol jew, or even going clubbing, there is degeneracy all around us. <br><br>Do you want to make alcohol, Grand macs, soda, etc. illegal? If yes, then you are blue pilled. <br><br>The second you care about what people put in their body, you&#039;re blue pilled. If you don&#039;t like marijuana, don&#039;t smoke it you fucking retard. Stop infringing on our given rights. People want to smoke a fucking plant and you think you have the authority to stop them? What if I told you you would&#039;ve been a fucking loyalist in the revolution war you cuck.<br><br>As we speak, there are children having seizures, and because you&#039;re so fucking BLUE-PILLED, they cannot get the treatment they need. Inb4 medicinal should be legal, how about just make it legal period you fucking jew. Do you fucking understand how much it&#039;ll benefit our shit economy? It&#039;ll BTFO mexicunt cartels. Inb4 muh government chemicals in weed. Inb4 muh too strong in 2017. You fucking pussy. Stop being a jew.","filename":"dare","ext":".png","w":260,"h":360,"tn_w":180,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491792870108,"time":1491792870,"md5":"0EQbAzk3FTaoi9i3B0HBjA==","fsize":98313,"resto":0,"id":"n9XluTbR","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"official-marijuana-red-pill-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":21,"images":5,"unique_ips":19},{"no":120381944,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:01:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"+1","filename":"4L_jKYPgSmI","ext":".jpg","w":360,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491793268528,"time":1491793268,"md5":"Mi9zgTSaTwxgKRpzpuulTA==","fsize":14391,"resto":120381087,"id":"EBjuuizt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120382411,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:04:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"classic pothead mental gymnastics","time":1491793488,"resto":120381087,"id":"kZh+Ln\/P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120382616,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:06:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying I smoke cigs, drink alcohol or coffee<\/span><br><br>nice try degenerate","time":1491793575,"resto":120381087,"id":"9EA7cPCO","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120382684,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:06:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120381087\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120381087<\/a><br>anyone got any rule 34 of this sexy cat?","time":1491793607,"resto":120381087,"id":"y\/sMAWan","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120382728,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:07:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120382616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120382616<\/a><br>You prolly watch pr0n tho you cuck","time":1491793628,"resto":120381087,"id":"n9XluTbR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120382759,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)23:07:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hiya kids, it&#039;s 5-time super bowl winning QB and hall of famer Tom Brady here, and today I&#039;m going to educate you on the dangers of marijuana. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Brain Changes Are Associated with Casual Marijuana Use in Young Adults<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.sfn.org\/Press-Room\/News-<wbr>Release-Archives\/2014\/Brain-Changes<wbr>-Are-Associated-with-Casual-Marijua<wbr>na-Use-in-Young-Adults<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cannabis Smoking &#039;Permanently Lowers IQ&#039;<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/health\/h<wbr>ealthnews\/9426205\/Cannabis-smoking-<wbr>permanently-lowers-IQ.html<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cannabis Use, Abuse, and Dependence<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.netce.com\/coursecontent.<wbr>php?courseid=852<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cannabis Use and Risk of Lung Cancer<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/art<wbr>icles\/PMC2516340\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cannabis Use Steals 8 IQ Points from the Teenage Mind<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.westernspring.co.uk\/cann<wbr>abis-use-steals-8-iq-points-from-th<wbr>e-teenage-mind\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Decreased dopamine brain reactivity in marijuana abusers is associated with negative emotionality and addiction severity<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.pnas.org\/content\/early\/2<wbr>014\/07\/10\/1411228111.abstract<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Effects of Marijuana Smoking on Pulmonary Function and Respiratory Complications<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/art<wbr>icles\/PMC2720277\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Health Effects of Marijuana<\/span><br>http:\/\/alcoholism.about.com\/od\/pot\/<wbr>a\/effects.-Lya.htm<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Long and Short Term Effects of Marijuana Use<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.theroadout.org\/drug_info<wbr>rmation\/marijuana\/long_and_short_te<wbr>rm_effects_of_marijuana_use.html<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Longtime Marijuana Use Linked With Decreased Motivation, Study Finds<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/2013\/<wbr>07\/02\/marijuana-motivation-longtime<wbr>-use-pot_n_3534031.html?ir=Healthy+<wbr>Living<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Marijuana May Cause Heart Problems in Young Adults<\/span><br>https:\/\/uk.news.yahoo.com\/marijuana<wbr>-may-cause-heart-problems-young-adu<wbr>lts-195750879.html#SFmiiCx<br><br>Now, I hope you read each of these well-sourced studies thoroughly.

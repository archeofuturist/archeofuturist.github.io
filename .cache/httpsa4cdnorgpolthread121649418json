They&#039;d promise that Hillary was going to be indicted any minute now, or that Bill was caught fucking 12 year olds and they have video proof.<br><br>They&#039;d tell the stories that their gullible targets wanted to hear, and they took advantage of the self-enforced narrative bubble that many people choose to live in.<br><br>But those were just bullshit articles to get click traffic for ad money. The real story, the scary story, is what the mainstream media did during the election. The way they&#039;d ignore Hillary&#039;s faults and amplify Trump&#039;s. The way they treated Trump like a loser the whole time. The way they&#039;d gang up on his staffers over flimsy accusations, etc.<br><br>The media was undeniably trying to make a Clinton presidency into a self-fulfilling prophecy. They skewed the polls to meet the &#039;reality&#039; they so desperately believed in. You could even see as the election neared, how they started hedging their bets by bringing the polls tighter again. They were so full of shit the whole time.<br><br>Now that the truth is out, they&#039;re still trying to make news where none exists (the russia story, the piss dossier, etc). They&#039;re still fucking doing it. But the goyim know. And &quot;CNN is fake news&quot; is way more of a meme than some bullshit clickbait controversy that everyone&#039;s forgotten.","time":1492497212,"resto":121649418,"id":"UqSBt1bF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121650301,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)02:34:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121649418\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121649418<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Fake news is a term coined to describe information distributed that goes against that of the MSM, Soros and liberal ideas<\/span>","time":1492497291,"resto":121649418,"id":"AMM4HZgg","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121650437,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)02:36:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Quit wasting your time on those classes","time":1492497388,"resto":121649418,"id":"8+CgYqOe","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":121650505,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)02:37:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121650177\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121650177<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hillary was going to be indicted any minute now, or that Bill was caught fucking 12 year olds<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Implying this isn&#039;t true<\/span>","time":1492497442,"resto":121649418,"id":"kn3HKSCx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121650995,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)02:43:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121650505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121650505<\/a><br>Haha, well, I wouldn&#039;t really doubt it.

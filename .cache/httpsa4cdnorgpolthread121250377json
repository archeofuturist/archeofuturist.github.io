Seems like a commie will just devote his life to destroy his own nation, there&#039;s you can do about it, you can&#039;t reason with them, they&#039;ll just hide whenever cognitive dissonance hits them; you can&#039;t make an agreement with them, they don&#039;t want to try their commie experiments away from you, they want o leech your productivity. So, if by a miracle one of them gets to a position of power, seems like throwing him out of a helicopter is the most reasonable approach.","filename":"yuri","ext":".png","w":488,"h":693,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492293752910,"time":1492293752,"md5":"PFshm8B73we5EjutDm+mCg==","fsize":73822,"resto":121250377,"id":"BdzZRjGK","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":121269222,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)18:08:25","name":"Anonymous","filename":"capitalism-or-communism","ext":".jpg","w":580,"h":260,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":56,"tim":1492294105930,"time":1492294105,"md5":"4Dqf0kN4qQkM7XNDuIjILQ==","fsize":44280,"resto":121250377,"id":"vu4I4Jb0","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":121269310,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)18:09:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;commies had 50+ years of undisputed control over large territories<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;made them all the poorer 1\/2 of the planet<\/span><br>Woah, turns out ignoring how wealth is created, how humans behave, and how intentions are different than results didn&#039;t work out well for 1\/2 of the planet earth.

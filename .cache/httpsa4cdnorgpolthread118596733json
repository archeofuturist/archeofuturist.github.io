Instead of forcing a college degree on people who learn almost nothing new we should only give it to those who can make something great of it. Stop throwing financial aid at everybody who asks for it, and make a Diploma a challenge to get again. Let it be the standard again, instead of useless.

Started to get impossible to get classes, because illegals\/immigrants got priority at registration, so they&#039;d fill the required courses - and they&#039;d sign up for too many, and pick and choose what they wanted. That&#039;s when I started seeing state paid interpreters in class, too. Must be nice.

I pointed out to one of them that the requirements to get INTO the school was a working knowledge of English, and showed it to her in the booklet (dorm argument). All she could do was bluster and fume. Our school also had a &quot;black student union&quot;, that white students couldn&#039;t join - but all of the other activities and groups on campus were barred from discriminating against race. They even had a black only prom, and black only frats - and one of the non-black frats was threatened with a lawsuit because they didn&#039;t rush one of the black kids who showed up. <br><br>That was a long time ago.

I tried a few times when I was 16. didn&#039;t pick up again until 18, stopped again for 2 years. spent three years from 20 to 23 just high off my ass. I was in a relationship with a girl who was a hardcore smoker. it was good, made her nicer, but it was hard to not use when its always around you. like, by age 21 I was having more and more anxiety every time I smoked. so I tried to stop, but I&#039;m the kind of person who takes advantage of whats in front of me. after we broke up, I stopped for a year. turned 24 got another job and smoked a good amount. my feelings and such while high where still the same. still feeling incredible anxiety. now am 25 and only smoke when I have money. which is never cause i dont work. i honestly think it just comes from depression. I&#039;ve wanted out of life since I was 14, but I cant into suicide. so I think weed just gives me the pressure to do it, but not really the means to. so it bugs me that I can&#039;t end it. dont know, ill still keep smoking though,. the immersion I get in video games is too good to just stop using because. like I said, love hate relationship. I hope this answers your question","time":1492402436,"resto":121468851,"id":"zzJhlsq\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121477610,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:14:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121474641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121474641<\/a><br>you won&#039;t hire a weed smoker? you are dumb as fuck.<br><br>weed smokers are better people.","time":1492402441,"resto":121468851,"id":"mW1a7aqa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121477754,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:15:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121469798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121469798<\/a><br>00","filename":"1492375903497","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":330,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1492402510353,"time":1492402510,"md5":"0gD7RMFKQqOhUQVIJUoYrQ==","fsize":115104,"resto":121468851,"id":"ELBc80SY","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121477767,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:15:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;sup guys, i have a rare disease that only weed can cure<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anyway, i think all the negative effects of weed are total bs!<\/span>","time":1492402517,"resto":121468851,"id":"J8w5luc3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121478204,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:19:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121477767\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121477767<\/a><br><br>medical people think its all about them, and they have the silver bullet against marijuana legalization.<br><br>I&#039;m all for using it for medical purposes, I&#039;m not here to stop you.<br><br>But as long as every stoner I meet says &quot;I drive better stoned :^)&quot; or &quot;Haha, a car accident at 3 mph xD&quot; I know we are absolutely fucked safety wise.

I personally think this is a bit of hyperbole on the pro cannabis side; There&#039;s just nothing conclusive. Part of this problem stems from the fact that marijuana is still labeled as a class 1 narcotic; it&#039;s on the same level as heroin, and there are so many unreasonable hoops to jump through to test cannabis&#039; efficacy in treating various diseases.<br><br>It&#039;s possible that marijuana can be used, just like heroin or meth, to create powerful, helpful drugs, used to treat all manner of conditions. if only regulations would relax and allow for proper study.<br><br>As for teen use, I think it would be ideal for the human brain to completely develop before introducing mind altering substances to it. Despite the arbitrary age of adulthood in USA, human brains don&#039;t stop developing at that point. Correct me if I&#039;m wrong, but the female brain is considered mature around 21, the male around 27. I&#039;m not saying drug use will positively or negatively affect the brain, but I think drug use, especially heavy drug use, will alter the brain chemistry, and therefore thought patterns, significantly.<br><br>I personally have never felt addicted to smoking weed.

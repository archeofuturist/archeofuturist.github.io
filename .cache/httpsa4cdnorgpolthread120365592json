His administration has been infiltrated by the NWO, who is now feeding him false information to try to force him to start another war. This all started when Trump picked Mike Flynn and Kathleen McFarland as National Security Advisors. Mike Flynn was quickly forced to resign after a fake scandal was created around his leaked phone call. It is now known that said leak came from Obama holdovers who were spying on the Trump campaign all along, and it would seem purposefully targeted Flynn specifically.<br><br>Trump then (((selected))) H.R. McMaster to fill the vacancy. A conehead, warmongering lunatic who is a member of the CFR, and whose hiring was even praised by McCain (who HATES Trump.) A month and a half of him feeding Trump bullshit passes and all of a sudden Trump is on board with bombing Syria and North Korea. Even worse, today McMaster fired Kathleen McFarland, Trump&#039;s original pick for Deputy National Security Advisor, further expanding the globalist coup of the Trump administration.<br><br>According to Mike Cernovich, McMaster has been falsifying information to Trump in order to force him into a war with Syria: https:\/\/medium.com\/@Cernovich\/h-r-m<wbr>cmaster-manipulating-intelligence-r<wbr>eports-to-trump-wants-150-000-groun<wbr>d-soldiers-in-syria-83346c433e99<br><br>Please spread the word about this. We have to get the word out and find a way to get rid of McMaster (legally\/non-violently, of course) before things get even worse. It doesn&#039;t matter what Trump promised us if he&#039;s being cornered and fed NWO propaganda by this lunatic every day.","filename":"H.R._McMaster_ARCIC_2014","ext":".jpg","w":598,"h":795,"tn_w":188,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491785164928,"time":1491785164,"md5":"NLRvNdFLCp9i95\/j1IaD3A==","fsize":118008,"resto":0,"id":"Zb64f3Zl","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-figured-it-all-out-get-in-here","country_name":"United States","replies":29,"images":9,"unique_ips":23},{"no":120365818,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)20:47:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120365592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120365592<\/a><br>Bump","time":1491785264,"resto":120365592,"id":"jUoW1k0d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120366007,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)20:49:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120365592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120365592<\/a><br>BUMP","time":1491785344,"resto":120365592,"id":"BtpdsjlC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120366055,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)20:49:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120365592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120365592<\/a><br>I wouldn&#039;t doubt it.","time":1491785363,"resto":120365592,"id":"eZtlLP1e","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120366504,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)20:52:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120365592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120365592<\/a><br>doubt it in fact that sounds like some movie plot, get to reality, you precious president fucked you over and now the world by being a natural retard","time":1491785574,"resto":120365592,"id":"P8UWvWOL","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120366650,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)20:54:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"I just don&#039;t know anymore.

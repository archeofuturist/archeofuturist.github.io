If I had to guess, I&#039;d say he&#039;s at least as smart as George W., 120 IQ or so, (three standard deviations above 85). The problem is that an articulate and presentable nog with a decent IQ is going to be able to coast through school big time. As undergrads, they&#039;re generally not in over their heads intellectually, so they&#039;re not plagued by resentment and self-doubt like dumber blacks who are over-schooled. Outside of the sciences, where their shitty work habits sink them, they&#039;ll pull Bs&#039; with not much effort and frequent plagiarism. If it were a white boy doing this, no one would care. Smart kids who coast in college are a dime a dozen and they often do well in life. But the bar is set so low for blacks that when a unicorn like Obama comes along (which was rare in the 80s &amp; 90s and less so now because of race mixing) the professors go wild. Better grades, scholarships and opportunities of all sorts will open up. They&#039;ll even inflate his grades and ignore his slack ways with citations. Grad school can be more of the same if they&#039;re in the right program (sociology or psychology) or the Dunning-Kruger crash when they hit that heavy reading and writing load. (Note that these observations only apply to black men. There&#039;s a different dynamic for smart black women, they&#039;re angrier and harder working.)","time":1492468855,"resto":121594088,"id":"1oTBEYcJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121594955,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)18:41:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121594918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121594918<\/a><br>The funny thing is that these characters are usually very personable and easy to be around. They&#039;re most often polite, well-spoken and cheerful, and can pull tons of semi-decent pussy (if they&#039;re not fags like Barack). Let me just say that at a party filled with aggressively brittle, grad-school jews, a goofy-bright, lazy-ass black kid is like a ray of sunshine. These characters can happily coast for an entire lifetime in a government job, a corporate diversity sinecure or a social sciences faculty (although publish-or-perish is really problematic for them). <br><br>Lord Purpa Drank is of this type. His undergrad career suggests as much, bouncing from Occidental to Columbia was stepping up in status. He got elected to the law review at Harvard without authoring a single article because he was popular. Got the giant publishing contract for his post-Harvard memoirs, but couldn&#039;t write the book. As an adjunct at the U. of Chicago Law School he was famously lazy. Barack Obama is the high-Q, lazy-ass nig writ large. Even his governing style is lazy. <br><br>What distinguishes Barack from the others of this sort is that he was a third-culture kid. Raised neither here nor there, he&#039;s always felt disconnected from America. This alienation is compounded by the fact that, like a lot of mulattos raised by white women, he&#039;s also had a giant problem with his negritude. He&#039;s not white, but not fully black. So in Chicago, he had to affirmatively decide to become black, hence Michelle. If you marry a hulking black brute like Michelle Robinson, you&#039;ve thrown your lot in with The People of the Bix Nood. <br><br>tl;dr: Conclusion. Obama doesn&#039;t understand America and dislikes Americans, but although he was smart enough to be really dangerous, he was also just another lazy-ass, high-IQ nig happy to coast through his eight years in the White House while collecting his government gibs.","time":1492468872,"resto":121594088,"id":"1oTBEYcJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121595062,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)18:42:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121594364\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121594364<\/a><br>again.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Obama<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;GOAT<\/span><br><br>Pick one, AND ONLY ONE.","time":1492468921,"resto":121594088,"id":"xAAFzl30","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121595159,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)18:42:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"In the end it was Obama who was the celebrity president: hollow, arrogant, bored, and easily controlled by the Washington apparatus, clutching a token peace prize while involving himself in more violent conflicts than his predecessors.

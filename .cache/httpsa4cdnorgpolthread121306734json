If you have an aluminum welder, you could also weld some pieces to it so it&#039;s not something that has nails in it (which, again, would be easier to get away with than nails in a legal sense, you could always call it &quot;artistic design&quot; having sharp, burred pieces protruding out.)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get long bolts that you can secure with nuts, I figure they don&#039;t need to be sharp just there to deter someone grabbing or getting a good grip.<\/span><br>That too. Another good deterrent would be to coat it in grease or some other slippery substance so no one can get a good grip on it. Or hey, find a way for the pole to also become &quot;zappy&quot; - and just spray your end of it with rubber spray so it won&#039;t be conductive on your end?<br><br><a href=\"#p121321071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121321071<\/a><br>The only thing is that if they have gloves (which they most likely will) the glass won&#039;t do anything ... that and there&#039;s the chance they could end up stuck to your shock pole.<br><br><a href=\"#p121321363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121321363<\/a><br>He&#039;s talking about the clips of ammunition (NOT the magazines) while having two guns that don&#039;t use clips, dummy.","time":1492320079,"resto":121306734,"id":"iJZzjcCo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121321851,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)01:22:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121321098\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121321098<\/a><br>Thanks bud","time":1492320120,"resto":121306734,"id":"NyphgR4G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121321855,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)01:22:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121306734\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121306734<\/a><br>Is that thing on the right like a little tip you put on the end of your penis to protect the helmet part?","time":1492320124,"resto":121306734,"id":"e4DbN7vo","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":121321860,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)01:22:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121321363\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121321363<\/a><br>I fucking knew someone would do this.

There&#039;s nothing of value or interest being discussed or added, it&#039;s all just underaged idiots who arrived between GamerGate and HWNDU making threads like &quot;is X shit non-political game redpilled&quot; , &quot;\/POL joke thread!&quot; or similar threads of little interest or relevance. The worst thing is when you get underage idiots LARPing as crusaders by shouting &quot;AVE MARIA DOOS VAULT BURN HERETICS&quot;. They know nothing about Christian history or the history of the Crusades themself and it just comes across as immensely embarrassing.<br><br>Brit\/pol\/ has been mostly okay for the post-GamerGate years but is starting to decline more in quality now that little is happening. It should pick up again in the Brexit negotiations though so that&#039;s something to look forward to. I&#039;m just fed up with all the leftists in the general at the moment that think Callaghan was good because he was vaguely anti-Kenyan or because they&#039;ve seen some one-sided statistics that don&#039;t really reflect reality.","time":1490689795,"resto":118588441,"id":"I68hyDMt","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118628960,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:35:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118628487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118628487<\/a><br>Haha which one of you was this?

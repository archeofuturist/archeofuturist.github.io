Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"9C72897F-90F5-4EBB-9789-330F4EFDB1B3","ext":".jpg","w":3538,"h":3340,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":236,"tim":1490171396346,"time":1490171396,"md5":"eWo72v7N8hsxi\/9DPZIriQ==","fsize":3123002,"resto":0,"id":"YaCPwdHH","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":117738851,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:30:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117738797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117738797<\/a><br>I grew out of atheism when I read a history book about desu","time":1490171459,"resto":117738797,"id":"dc9cZeaQ","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":117739010,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:33:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117738797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117738797<\/a><br><br>Sure doesn&#039;t seem that way to me.

You could make a compelling argument that atheism is specifically being pushed by Jews in today&#039;s society, and they seem to largely be targeting western Christians and only them.<br><br>For example, Sam Harris, Chapman Cohen, David Silverman, Michael Newdow, Gregory Epstein, Sherman Wine, Bill Maher, Eric Kaufmann, and of course, Richard Dawkins&#039;s mother has a Jewish surname and was stated to have lived in the only Jewish suburb of the city she grew up in. But he hasn&#039;t explicitly named her religion.<br><br>But that&#039;s only a tiny part of the list. We could discuss the Jewish atheists who aren&#039;t pushing atheism so much as atheism-enabling political views like Marxism. For example Soklonikov, Trotsky, Deutscher, Lenin, Uritsky, Kamenev, Zinoviev and Sverdlov.<br><br>And what about atheist Jewish public entertainers that constantly run down Christianity? We can go ahead and recycle Bill Maher here and also include Jon Leibowitz, Stephen Fry, Woody Allen, Rob Reiner, Daniel Radcliffe, Larry David, David Silverman, and...

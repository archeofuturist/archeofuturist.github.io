The larping is out of control. After all we are talking about the possibilty of WW3 knocking at the door, an event that could wipe out our degenerate asses pretty quick.<br><br>I dont care whos side you are on, I care for the topic and I hope that \/pol\/ will overcome the pathetic shilling and trolling and come to an understanding that this war can not happen at all costs.<br><br> All the people screaming &quot;mudslimes must die&quot;, &quot;Russia BTFO&quot;, &quot;American rockets suck&quot; obviously dont understand this isnt the fucking Super Bowl and that modern wars with weapons of mass destruction are the most retarded and disgusting thing that can possibly happen now, especially between two global players with way too much firepower. <br><br>The Syrian crisis is linked to the refugee crisis in Europe, thus as an European I want the conflict to END as soon as possible; I dont even care much about who wins at this moment. The sure thing is, if Trump goes all in for Syria, the real shit in this region is only about to begin. More countries will get involved, the battles will get fiercer and the last healthy parts of Syria and Iraq will be devastated. <br><br>More and more refugees will come to Europe and also to the US and the arab world will be left even more destabilized than before thus laying fertile soil for new terrorist formations to grow. &gt;Repeat.<br>We have to end this same old repeating shitty story.<br><br>So stop the warmongering you faggots, I beg you. War between America and Russia is not an option, never.","filename":"1491495808846","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":527,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":219,"tim":1491572495519,"time":1491572495,"md5":"8di4XTt3Av79qPcEMwvCVA==","fsize":84458,"resto":0,"id":"Bl9HGtpY","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-all-need-to-calm-down","country_name":"Germany","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

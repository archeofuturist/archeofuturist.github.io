Most liberals are huge manchildren that need to express their favorite pop culture almost everywhere they go, as if anyone cares. Most liberals need to stay with the times and are just people who conform to any sort of new societal standard, whether it&#039;s good or not, they usually don&#039;t put thought in it, unless that societal standard is conservative that is, then they bitch and complain about it <br><br>The only people I see who are liberals over the age of 30 are the biggest losers ever. The only somewhat successful liberals over that age are usually highly indoctrinated professors, that are insufferable to speak to. That&#039;s not to say all professors are that way, but try and even be around a sociology professor for 20 minutes and you will of an overdose on virtue signalling","time":1490734599,"resto":118693973,"id":"NlOsd8RW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118695648,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:59:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118695335\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118695335<\/a><br>some of them are like that but not many and there a huge fold of republicans who are the type &quot;muh hands look like this so her&#039;s dont have to&quot;","time":1490734748,"resto":118693973,"id":"biUqDfUv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118695860,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)17:00:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Because all library&#039;s live in an egotistical echo chamber that brain washes them into thinking they and what the like is &quot;cool and hip&quot;","time":1490734847,"resto":118693973,"id":"uFsJEw+6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118695970,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)17:01:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118695648\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118695648<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;some of them are like that but not many and there a huge fold of republicans who are the type &quot;muh hands look like this so her&#039;s dont have to&quot;<\/span><br><br>What exactly are you talking about?","time":1490734912,"resto":118693973,"id":"NlOsd8RW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118696020,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)17:02:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118695860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118695860<\/a><br>fuck off stupid ass mobile poster. don&#039;t post in my thread","time":1490734938,"resto":118693973,"id":"biUqDfUv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118696161,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)17:03:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118695970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118695970<\/a><br>the fake macho guys who drive jacked up trucks that never see a dirt road and wear camo","time":1490735014,"resto":118693973,"id":"biUqDfUv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118696250,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)17:04:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118696161\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118696161<\/a><br>Those guys are much better than even a moderate liberal desu","time":1490735065,"resto":118693973,"id":"NlOsd8RW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118697281,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)17:13:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118696250\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118696250<\/a><br>thats your opinion","time":1490735581,"resto":118693973,"id":"biUqDfUv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

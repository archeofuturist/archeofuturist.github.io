These souls contain power, or kar\u00e1ram, that the Jivaroan people believe can be contained and harnessed within one\u2019s self. Harner talks about these souls, called arutam:<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cA person is not born with an arutam soul. Such a soul must be acquired, and in certain traditional ways. The acquisition of this type of soul is considered to be so important to an adult male\u2019s survival that a boy\u2019s parents do not expect him to live past puberty without one. By repeatedly killing, one can continually accumulate power through the replacement of old arutam souls with new ones. This \u201ctrade-in\u201d mechanism is an important feature because, when a person has had the same arutam soul for four or five years, it tends to leave its sleeping possessor to wander nightly through the forest. Sooner or later, while it is thus drifting through the trees, another Jivaro will \u201csteal\u201d it. Accordingly, it is highly desirable to obtain a new soul before the old one begins nocturnal wanderings. This felt need encourages the individual to participate in a killing expedition every few years.\u201d[3]<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Killing becomes a vital part of the Jivaro culture. Men are only marriageable after becoming hunters within their communities. The more one kills, the more power one has, granting one immunity of death.[4] Violence is a huge part of Jivaroan culture in respect to this type of soul belief.

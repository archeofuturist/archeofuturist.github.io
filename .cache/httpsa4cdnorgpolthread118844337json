Saying such, he says he&#039;ll raise tariffs and pull the US from NAFTA. It will work if he does that and makes the tariffs high enough to where the tarriff makes the overseas cheap labor more expensive than US labor. On the other hand, doing so would not favor companies because it&#039;s more expensive to them and they&#039;d have to onshore, needing new factories, so the companies will hire lobbyists to fail it. Blah blah, probably no.","time":1490827776,"resto":118844337,"id":"zxLKH0tX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118847009,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)18:58:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118844337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118844337<\/a><br>Don&#039;t count on it.

The rest of his party&#039;s leadership is for free trade and has no interest in renegotiating NAFTA. Also, the reason for the loss of manufacturing jobs over the last 20 years hasn&#039;t been because the US is getting fucked in trade, but because of automation. We need fewer workers for greater productivity. Lastly, for all the talk of &quot;offshoring&quot; for the last couple of decades, we&#039;re about to see a massive &quot;on-shoring&quot; of jobs back to North America due to the massive increases in labor costs throughout China. Mexico will get some of this, but a lot will come back to the US directly.<br><br>Also, fracking is going to make the US energy independent in the next few years. The future is brighter than most people realize and a lot of good things that are going to happen, Trump will take credit for them regardless of what he&#039;s done to affect that change. With Trump, it&#039;s all about him. He&#039;s a bullshit artist.

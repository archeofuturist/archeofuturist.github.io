I am a white male who is married to a black woman. I still generally dislike other blacks and before I met her I was a full on stormfag. I think many people are like me in that they may hate most blacks but have a friend who is black or even be married to a black woman.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I love my wife. I need her, I want her, I feel very comfortable around her, I feel with her I can be myself, she makes me laugh, I desire her intensely and no other woman can compare next to her. Simply put I love her. I will beat the living crap out of anyone who says anything to my wife. I don\u2019t have a problem going to jail for breaking someone\u2019s nose and teeth if they dare call my wife the N word. If the guy is bigger than me I will take knife and stab the mofo until he looks like the bark of the paper birch.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now with that being said. I generally don\u2019t like blacks. I know this dichotomy is strange to many people but when you think it through it\u2019s not strange at all. I think most blacks are low level beings, borderline monkeys actually, I don\u2019t think they have a desire to learn or improve themselves. They have degenerate values that FEELS normal in their culture. I mostly hide my feelings from my wife because I don\u2019t want to hurt her but this is how I honestly feel.<\/span>","filename":"confusedwhiteman","ext":".jpg","w":1509,"h":1281,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":212,"tim":1491154359716,"time":1491154359,"md5":"9pMTHHKAMleUWcXDCJpTaQ==","fsize":866386,"resto":0,"id":"ep5X9o9t","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"confessions-from-a-racist-white-man-married-to-a","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119221976,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)13:32:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119221948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119221948<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When I first meet my wife the first thought was yuck a dirty black monkey. But than I heard her voice, there was something in her voice that made my heart stop. We made eye contact and right away I felt a connection. At that point I saw her as a person and what she looked like didn\u2019t bother me anymore. I couldn\u2019t believe it myself. I told myself this was nothing more than a fetish. I wanted to indulge in bestiality and try some nigger pussy, that\u2019s all. If I just bleached her than I\u2019ll get her out of my system. So I asked her out and we starting dating. From the very beginning I felt so comfortable with her. I didn\u2019t feel as if I had to put up a front or pretend. I could just be myself and I could tell she liked me too.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The first time she allowed me to make love to her was like heaven. I had never felt that sexual and emotional connection with any woman. Still at the back of my head I told myself shes black. I can\u2019t fall in love with a black woman. And so I started to distance myself from her. Still I couldn\u2019t get her out of my head. I wanted her and the thought of any other man touching her drove me insane. And so I asked her to marry me and luckily for me she said yes. My whole family refused to attend the wedding. I didn\u2019t care, I loved her and I wanted to make her mine.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We\u2019ve been together for about 6 years now. We\u2019ve had our ups and downs like any couple and you know what I\u2019ve found out? Despite the fact that I am still generally racist we have never had a fight over race. I have never, never, never gotten upset with her because she was a black woman. It was always other stuff, stuff that other couples fought about.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes so I am a racist but for some strange reason I need her and I love her. I see her as different from other black people. I don\u2019t see her race. I see her personality when I look at her. I see\u2026\u2026.my wife, my companion, my love.<\/span>","time":1491154375,"resto":119221948,"id":"ep5X9o9t","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119222821,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)13:40:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Can you point me to the subscribe button m8?","filename":"1461978887723","ext":".png","w":383,"h":516,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491154835715,"time":1491154835,"md5":"9yGi\/Qj1vsdX5NnLaVlroA==","fsize":232695,"resto":119221948,"id":"oPubT4L5","country":"NL","since4pass":2015,"country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119223183,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)13:43:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119221948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119221948<\/a><br>PSA that every leftist politician or journalist killed by someone like Breivik is one less shill writing shit like this.","time":1491155036,"resto":119221948,"id":"16K3Fbnf","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"}]}

Kim will agree to abandon the nuclear program in exchange for leaving him alone and giving him some food. Given that outcome and considering Obama&#039;s deal with Iran, America will have neutered the two rogue states that were fronts for China &amp; Russia. China seems to be rational under President Xi so the next logical step in this master plan would be to topple Putin.","filename":"5ef16760abc69f28cc86ad95ca8e1bc0","ext":".jpg","w":419,"h":448,"tn_w":233,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493367652733,"time":1493367652,"md5":"HKJYP8QyJBokLmoVDdo1XQ==","fsize":38347,"resto":0,"id":"ESO07MB0","country":"GR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"war-wont-happen-in-korea-usa-just-wanted-to","country_name":"Greece","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123170589,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)04:39:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123169041\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123169041<\/a><br>I suspect that as well.

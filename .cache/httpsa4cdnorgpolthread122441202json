Here&#039;s my two cents on the piece.<br><br>You need to use riot police or ancient war tactics. You could form a shield wall, and as long as heads are covered you can survive melee fights and ranged attacks. If firebombs are used, you will have to disperse or use fire extinguishers \/ flame retardant clothing. You could also use long sticks and form a phalanx. This way, you could keep antifa fighters at range.<br><br>We also need to film the protest, with meme warriors on standby. Antifa members, especially professors can be doxxed.<br><br>Make sure to also bring first aid.

What I am against is the knee-jerk reaction that has people here, both genuine and disruptors, calling for us to entirely abandon ship, rather than pushing for what has been the goal in the first place, namely advancing the curbing of immigration, Islam and degeneracy through these more socially acceptable candidates while piggybacking on top of them to more permanent solutions. When you abandon Trump completely, rather than supporting or opposing on a policy by policy basis, you kill off your ties to the vast majority of people who backed him, who would otherwise be more open to what we want but who, because the public faces of ethnic nationalism are largely either idiots or controlled opposition, they cannot bring themselves to support. We must be the ones to subvert.","time":1493331667,"resto":123094693,"id":"ftZ7l9bD","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123099534,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)18:21:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123099314\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123099314<\/a><br>The military draft?","time":1493331686,"resto":123094693,"id":"diQWFtfR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123099545,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)18:21:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123098543\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123098543<\/a><br>So if that&#039;s true then it wont be anywhere near 2 million because those numbers are inaccurate.

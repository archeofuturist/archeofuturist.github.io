I would say it is libertarian in that I don&#039;t care if people smoke weed or do &quot;degenerate&quot; things. I also believe issues like abortion and gay marriage should be decided on a state by state level. I do however believe in borders and I want to limit immigration. I also recognize ((())) and do not want the white race to die.","filename":"alexjones","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493710085779,"time":1493710085,"md5":"lqFYm4oDnqhzrl4usbZd9Q==","fsize":32796,"resto":0,"id":"GKvn4Jth","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wondering-if-anyone-can-help-me-out-with-my","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123741904,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:28:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123741843\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123741843<\/a><br>RARE<br>A<br>R<br>E","time":1493710131,"resto":123741843,"id":"GfnYKQSl","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":123741959,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:29:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"I want to add that even though I want people to do what they want, I do not like the way certain &quot;degenerate&quot; behaviors are pushed and marketed in such sinister ways.","time":1493710178,"resto":123741843,"id":"GKvn4Jth","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123742057,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:31:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123741843\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123741843<\/a>","filename":"1482476840549","ext":".png","w":1302,"h":722,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1493710269109,"time":1493710269,"md5":"5aDAhpApsY8d4+JV\/Jto0g==","fsize":184395,"resto":123741843,"id":"DCv5lCPz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123742063,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:31:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123741904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123741904<\/a><br>?","time":1493710270,"resto":123741843,"id":"GKvn4Jth","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123742200,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:33:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123742057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123742057<\/a><br>Is it possible to be a nationalist and a libertarian?","time":1493710402,"resto":123741843,"id":"GKvn4Jth","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123742262,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:34:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123741843\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123741843<\/a><br><br>You need to be pragmatic above being an idealist.

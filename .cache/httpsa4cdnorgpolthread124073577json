School is an institution much like a prison, so you will be tested by the &quot;bullies&quot; who are only trying to increase their own social standing within groups and to weed out the obvious pussies. <br><br>First strategy is do not fail the punk test. That&#039;s some guy who tests you to see if you&#039;re a pussy. They will say something and wait to see if you say something back, bump into you &quot;accidentally&quot;, step on your foot, slam doors in your face or whatever they can to test you. If you fail you then become the school pussy. The solution is to stop them at level 1 of the punk test. That will deter the majority of bullies who see you aren&#039;t to be fucked with. <br><br>The rest of the bullies are usually large intimidating thugs who either failed a few grades and are harassing you to cover up their own failings. The only solution is to immediately throw down with said thugs if they challenge you and not wait &quot;afterschool&quot; or agree to meet them somewhere in a park where they can get weapons. Just punch them the fuck out like a prisoner would. It doesn&#039;t matter if you lose this fight it only matters if you go hard and are willing to fight and not be a punk. <br><br>Finally, avoid putting your real pics and name on the fucking internet. No social media shit, no Cuckbook, none of that junk. If you use a chatroom with friends, always use an alias to avoid screen caps. And do good in school, fucking learn something as the bullies never, ever do well in school and fail grades. <br><br>This was my strategy and I easily adopted to new schools every year, made friends, had girlfriends, and even was sent to honors classes in a new private school after excelling in the shit tier public system which didn&#039;t have any alcohol fetal syndrome kids trying to bully you.","time":1493921442,"resto":124073577,"id":"s3xYXI2b","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124088377,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)14:11:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124073577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124073577<\/a><br>learn your children to fight","time":1493921488,"resto":124073577,"id":"po46CsSX","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":124088508,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)14:12:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124073577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124073577<\/a><br>i used to bully people in school because i was bored and it was funny. if you are getting bullied then either fight back, or do something funny.

Considering thus far they have yet to be able to match the trinity test (if the german confidence in their results is to be believed), and there is no way their last test was thermonuclear. Seems to me they are having major trouble producing a sustainable self fissionable events in their devices which probably means their nuclear scientists are retards (or have no idea what they are doing), and aren&#039;t getting any outside help or; Being able to calculate fission rates for nuclear materials is rather (compared to other physics areas) simple, the problem arises from the purity of the materials they are using. I&#039;m willing to bet that their breeder reactors and centrifruges are very poorly designed or have very low efficiency, and are having serious problems with producing enough fissile material for any devices and that the tests are the scientists themselves using such material sparsely.<br>In regards to having warheads mounted on missiles the very idea is ludicrous from a technological standpoint, as they are barely able to build a fission device and it&#039;s highly unlikely they are able to miniaturize a device to be mounted on anything unless the rocket itsself was fuck huge and had tiny range (considering also the state of their missile program).<br>If they did have warheads worth a damn they would be air dropped, and if they did have any sort of miniaturisation technology they would be artillery based. Given their test yields they would be puny, and probably closer to dirty bombs than actual fission devices.","filename":"1478849556240","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491996533782,"time":1491996533,"md5":"xd3NZbpFzHjV1VCMstweIw==","fsize":44321,"resto":120737322,"id":"cdag+8TY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120744830,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:29:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120744606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120744606<\/a><br>&quot;Again, who the fuck is telling you the 24th?

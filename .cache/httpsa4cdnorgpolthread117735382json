Before you fucktards start accusing everyone of being newfags, I want to tell you about the ideologies of \/pol\/ throught its existance. Don&#039;t deny that many of you fags came here during happenings like the American elections or Gamer Gate. I have been here since day one, pretty much, though I have never been to \/new\/. If there are any \/new\/ or \/n\/ pro Anons here, they are free to talk about the old boards.<br><br>When this board was first found, the majority of the users were libertarians; most were against unrestricted immigration but were for legalization of drugs and such, and sometimes even pro-gay marriage. Most of the discussion was about economics, anyway, not niggers and Jews.<br><br>Then the Stormfags heard that 4chan had a new politics board opened. With the Stormfags came the BBC spammers. This is all 5 years or so ago, back when the word &quot;cuck&quot; wasn&#039;t even really commonly used. Most of the discussion started revolving around niggers and Jews then, and \/pol\/ became overwhelmingly national socialist. I remember the &quot;Anti-racist is a codeword for anti-white&quot; pasta spammed everywhere.

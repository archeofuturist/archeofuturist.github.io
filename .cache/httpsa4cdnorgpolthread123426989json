As a result, capital is diverted from its most productive use into housing. This reduces the efficacy of the entire market and thus reduces the standard of living of all Americans.<br><br>&quot;Despite the long-term damage to the economy inflicted by the government&#039;s interference in the housing market, the government&#039;s policy of diverting capital to other uses creates a short-term boom in housing,&quot; Paul went on. &quot;Like all artificially created bubbles, the boom in housing prices cannot last forever. When housing prices fall, homeowners will experience difficulty as their equity is wiped out. Furthermore, the holders of the mortgage debt will also have a loss. These losses will be greater than they would have otherwise been had government policy not actively encouraged over-investment in housing.<br><br>&quot;I hope today&#039;s hearing sheds light on how special privileges granted to GSEs distort the housing market and endanger American taxpayers,&quot; Paul concluded. &quot;Congress should act to remove taxpayer support from the housing GSEs before the bubble bursts and taxpayers are once again forced to bail out investors who were misled by foolish government interference in the market.&quot;<br><br>Ron Paul, showing how government intervention ruins markets.

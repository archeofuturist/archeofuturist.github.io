Joker can choose to start a relationship with every single female party member and non-player confidant in the game; none of the men are romanceable. This is despite the fact that one of the male party members is heavily implied to be at least bisexual, claiming to have no interest in the female form outside of art and often interacting with Joker in a flirty manner.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The lack of same-sex relationship options in Persona 5 would be little more than a frustrating omission, but the game pushes it into much more aggravating territory in a few scenes. Specifically, there are two recurring gag characters who are clearly homosexual. They show up at a couple of points throughout the game specifically to act effeminate and stereotypical, and to freak out Ryuji by flirting with him. Essentially, some of Persona 5\u2019s only examples of queer characterization are there as a terrible joke.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This would be disappointing in any game in 2017. For a game that\u2019s explicitly about social reform and youth being misunderstood, it\u2019s a complete breakdown, a hamfisted misunderstanding of the values and diversity of a younger generation<\/span><br><br><br>How is that still allowed in 2017?","filename":"1490988100326","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490993560749,"time":1490993560,"md5":"HUY1cqw3B2Lp6SBkUQJ5CA==","fsize":159189,"resto":0,"id":"e8QTl\/Q7","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bad-romance","country_name":"Germany","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119099043,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)16:57:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"GRRRR WHY CAN&#039;T STRAIGHT UNDERAGE CHARACTER GET FUCKED IN ASS<br>t.

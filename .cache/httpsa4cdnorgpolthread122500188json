Human beings have a need (probably based in biology) for something that we will call the \u201cpower process.\u201d This is closely related to the need for power (which is widely recognized) but is not quite the same thing. The power process has four elements. The three most clear-cut of these we call goal, effort and attainment of goal. (Everyone needs to have goals whose attainment requires effort, and needs to succeed in attaining at least some of his goals.) The fourth element is more difficult to define and may not be necessary for everyone.

We use the term \u201csurrogate activity\u201d to designate an activity that is directed toward an artificial goal that people set up for themselves merely in order to have some goal to work toward, or let us say, merely for the sake of the \u201cfulfillment\u201d that they get from pursuing the goal. Here is a rule of thumb for the identification of surrogate activities. Given a person who devotes much time and energy to the pursuit of goal X, ask yourself this: If he had to devote most of his time and energy to satisfying his biological needs, and if that effort required him to use his physical and mental faculties in a varied and interesting way, would he feel seriously deprived because he did not attain goal X? If the answer is no, then the person\u2019s pursuit of goal X is a surrogate activity. Hirohito\u2019s studies in marine biology clearly constituted a surrogate activity, since it is pretty certain that if Hirohito had had to spend his time working at interesting non-scientific tasks in order to obtain the necessities of life, he would not have felt deprived because he didn\u2019t know all about the anatomy and life-cycles of marine animals. On the other hand the pursuit of sex and love (for example) is not a surrogate activity, because most people, even if their existence were otherwise satisfactory, would feel deprived if they passed their lives without ever having a relationship with a member of the opposite sex. (But pursuit of an excessive amount of sex, more than one really needs, can be a surrogate activity.)","time":1492988385,"resto":122500188,"id":"vvRw7ArD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122503677,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)18:59:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"(((science)))","filename":"38654196_p54_master1200","ext":".jpg","w":487,"h":563,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492988395116,"time":1492988395,"md5":"nh3N\/2kXJaSUCJR3Pz+Uqg==","fsize":85263,"resto":122500188,"id":"yXFSzgN0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122503733,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:00:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122500274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122500274<\/a><br>fpbp","time":1492988416,"resto":122500188,"id":"vbA1aIUS","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122504013,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:02:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122502064\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122502064<\/a><br>Third eye: decalcified","filename":"1479614021187","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":801,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1492988533475,"time":1492988533,"md5":"nB5yFViRGBvjpp71fjXjTg==","fsize":228932,"resto":122500188,"id":"vbA1aIUS","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122504513,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:06:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122501649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122501649<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bill nye<\/span>","filename":"white man","ext":".jpg","w":828,"h":866,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492988762988,"time":1492988762,"md5":"v02yAq3t8skfSfv1w5c1iA==","fsize":331329,"resto":122500188,"id":"DJ8cgz08","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122504874,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:08:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122500451\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122500451<\/a><br>A<br>FUCKING<br>UNION<br>JACK","time":1492988917,"resto":122500188,"id":"5S0jIyG2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122505298,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:11:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122503575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122503575<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122503647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122503647<\/a><br>Ted K. got almost everything right.

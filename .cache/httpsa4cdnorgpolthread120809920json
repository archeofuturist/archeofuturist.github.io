There&#039;s nothing we can do to stop globalism.

In reality, the people have no say. Democracy is a lie and it always has been. <br><br>This is what we need to do: Prepare for the worst. Realize that there is no savior right now, that things are just going to keep deteriorating and that we are more in danger every single day. Start talking to your family about material preparations, including a plan for escape in the event of a disaster, especially if you live in a city. Perhaps most importantly, you need to build yourself up emotionally, physically and spiritually so that you will be prepared when shit hits the fan. Most of us are not prepared at all for a loss of comfort and government services. Start believing in God and practicing religion. Start going outside and getting fit. Start eating well. Maybe start fasting a few days a month so you will be ready if there is no more food. Shit is going to hit the fan before we know it. Stop expecting someone to save us. There is nobody.

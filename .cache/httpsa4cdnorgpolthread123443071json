You consume so much of it and you don&#039;t even know it yet. The only way we could reduce of CO2 footprint drastically is by improving energy storage technology (such as batteries or super capacitors), coupled with massive development of nuclear power (lowest CO2 emitter). The batteries are on going research (which we could accelerate by more funding), but we&#039;re actually shutting down our nuclear power plants due to over regulation and hysteria (mostly from the left but not exclusively them).

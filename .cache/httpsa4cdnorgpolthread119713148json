There&#039;s more to it than fucking <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;these guys are good, those are bad<\/span><br>Everyone is pursuing their own agenda. I prefer Assad to the Islamist rebels. He&#039;s popular among religious and ethnic minorities which I see as an indicator of at least some level of good character. The Sunni islamists seem to be the only ones unhappy. I&#039;d love to be best buds with Russia too, they&#039;d be a more positive influence than EU fags. <br><br>On the other hand capitulating on this issue is risky. There&#039;s no guarantee that we&#039;ll suddenly be friends with the Russian axis if we give them a free hand. In fact it&#039;s extremely unlikely. The best we can probably hope for is a thaw. A common enemy in China is literally the only thing that could bring us together in any sense that isn&#039;t superficial. That said, it may be best to oppose Russia&#039;s strategic interest in the Middle East. Adults realize that you might need to make decisions that make you feel like a piece of shit, but your country must always come first.","time":1491459448,"resto":119713148,"id":"UQ4TnUOq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

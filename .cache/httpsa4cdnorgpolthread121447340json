Decreasing means that gun related crimes go down, but when they do occur, they will be huge because no-one will stop them (look at school shootings, no one is armed so the killer gets free reign), whereas if everyone is armed, the shooter may be able to kill one or two people, but will be faced with an array of bullets in their direction.

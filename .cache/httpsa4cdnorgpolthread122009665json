That way, people stop virtue signalling with bought items and instead virtue signal by showing how far are they willing to go to honour their culture and national identity. The average Joe would not impress neighbors by buying a new car more expensive than theirs, but perhaps carve a wood sculpture, build a lovely traditional wooden home, grow a nice garden that looks easy on the eyes, or even act as a pillar of community by starting different clubs\/societies aimed at developing the community by giving people with certain interests within a community a chance to gather and socialize, thus further strengthening ties within the community.<br><br>Until this doesn&#039;t happen, in a (((free-market))) economy you will still hear your average Joe trying to impress other Joes by stating how much Staceys they have fucked last week or how they bought a new BMW.","time":1492706714,"resto":122009665,"id":"YlTHujgn","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":122013266,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:51:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122012673\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122012673<\/a><br><br><br>The momentarily endorphin surge people get from consuming is an addiction and false happiness like many others in today&#039;s society. <br><br>Spot on the rest of your words.<br><br>Individualism, egoism, showing off and consumerism is another method of breaking society , that&#039;s why i wonder how come no one ever discusses it here, The cuckery is getting a bit old and the fundamental goal is the same.<br><br>There will always be someone with a car more expensive.<br>The comparison race is s a meaningless race.

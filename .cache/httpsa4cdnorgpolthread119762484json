They must have told Trump some serious shit or mind control is an actual existing technology now. <br>I dont see another explanation for the drastic shift in Trump&#039;s mind. <br><br>Either<br><br>1. US strategists gave info to convince him:<br><br>a, tons of fake disinfo to make it sound like Russia and Assad have child killing factories all over the place<br><br>b, possibly real(ish) info that the US hegemony is resting on the domination of oil and money flows in the middle east and giving that up to Iran\/Russia would long-term destroy the US<br><br>2. Trump was always a traitor<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; HIGHLY unlikely, cmon<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; inb4 shill posts<\/span><br><br>3. Trump is a lot more naive and stupid than we thought<br><br>Why &#039;fire&#039; Bannon and General Flynn? He didnt need to do anything about Flynn, he could have just let it play out. That was his first mistake imo. Who gives a shit if it takes them 2 years to oust him, at least they&#039;re busy. Maybe he thought that becoming absolutely 100% clean would make the dems leave him alone. Of course the dems always find more dirt.<br>How do you suddenly advocate for action in Syria when you literally lambasted Obama for that EXACT scenario only 2 years ago? <br>No seriously, it was exactly the same. Wait, it was even easier to tell now that it&#039;s a false flag because when Obama had to deal with it, it was an unknown source that did the attack. <br>Now it&#039;s clear that Assad&#039;s troops bombarded an ISIS weapons cache that happened to have gas in it.<br><br>4. Trump is still our God emperor, he is playing 4D chess<br><br>He is trying to make the neocons reveal themselves by waiting for war endorsements and then he knows who his enemies are.<br>It&#039;s a little doubtful though, he already sent troops to Syria which wasnt necessary. Although that might have been the Pentagon because according to news articles he gave them the power to do more moves without his direct approval, that itself may also be a chess move to reveal Pentagon neocon traitors.","filename":"sad","ext":".png","w":1109,"h":851,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":191,"tim":1491497641598,"time":1491497641,"md5":"oRetrvbC6l03bbAy6BXndw==","fsize":1083295,"resto":0,"id":"KWCbFsII","country":"AT","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"full-analysis-of-the-current-situation","country_name":"Austria","replies":7,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":119763606,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)13:03:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"5.

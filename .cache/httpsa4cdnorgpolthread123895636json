They are human concepts. Concepts that do not exist outside the minds of humans. Nothing has meaning because &quot;meaning&quot; does not exist materially, meaning can only be applied to something by a human which decides that for him it has meaning.

No. It only has the qualities we give it in our minds. <br><br>Putting Meaning on life is as much as a lie as saying there is no meaning to life. By meaning of course you mean purpose.<br><br>When you stumble upon a rock while walking in a Forest does the rock contain purpose in itself ? No.<br>But you can decide to sit on it, therefore giving it purpose or not to therefore deciding it doesnt have purpose. But without human action or thinking &quot;purpose&quot; doesnt exist. Life is the rock, you can decide to do nothing with it, to live no trace, and therefore apply a non purpose to life, or decide your life has purpose and decide what to do with it despite the finite nature of your actions.<br><br>The question is, do actions even matter if all we know is finite and will disappear ? I&#039;d say yes, as in the concept of finition you take time as an absolute finite thing, you jump to the end and say &quot;see there is no traces left&quot; sure it is true. <br>But the universe cannot think, if there are no humans to judge the traces that are not then once again it is not pointless nor has a point. So we can only judge what will be seen by human eyes, and from there on it is easy to understand why Nihilism could be wrong. <br><br>TLDR: You&#039;re not a rock you are human, and therefore your perspective only matters as long as there are humans around when there are none Nihilism doesnt exist anymoreso worrying abou it does not make sense.","time":1493809038,"resto":123895636,"id":"H+PC6JpY","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":123900585,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:58:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123896029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123896029<\/a><br>yes and this man becomes butthurt once he sees other men do not care about what he cares","time":1493809104,"resto":123895636,"id":"Th0lFxv8","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":123900635,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:59:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123899834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123899834<\/a><br><br>I&#039;m no expert on Dostoyevsky, but I&#039;ve read his books.

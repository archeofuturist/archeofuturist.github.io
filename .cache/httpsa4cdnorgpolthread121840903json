People still have to produce technology. Things still have to get made by people. However, undoubtedly there will be people, as there are now, that do nothing to contribute to society, simply lay around all day and leech off others work. Why would a worker, who produces something from his labour, allow someone to simply take whatever they want without doing any work themselves? It&#039;s simply ridiculous, because in a communist society there will ALWAYS be some that work and produce, and some that don&#039;t.

At some point, anyone still working who DOESN&#039;T have access to basic material goods will be really pissed off, and those people will rise up and take over. Since doing work is a core value of the working class, the value system post-revolution will prize and reward people who work with the resources that are still scarce: living in good areas, public recognition, interesting work, services like daycares and taxis and dry cleaners, rarities like white truffles or diamonds, etc. The difference is that only zero-sum goods will be awarded for hard work: post-scarcity ensures that most material goods are virtually unlimited.<br><br>This seems pretty fucking stupid and overcomplicated to me, but whatever.","time":1492610635,"resto":121840903,"id":"C8khFbsd","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121849157,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)10:27:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121847011\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121847011<\/a><br>What do you mean by zero-sum goods?<br><br>Also, I think you pretty much hit the nail on the head, OP is forgetting that technology is making human labour less and less necessary every year.","time":1492612032,"resto":121840903,"id":"8uC9isSy","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]}

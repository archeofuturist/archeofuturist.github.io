People still have to produce technology. Things still have to get made by people. However, undoubtedly there will be people, as there are now, that do nothing to contribute to society, simply lay around all day and leech off others work. Why would a worker, who produces something from his labour, allow someone to simply take whatever they want without doing any work themselves? It&#039;s simply ridiculous, because in a communist society there will ALWAYS be some that work and produce, and some that don&#039;t.

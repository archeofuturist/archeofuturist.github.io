It seems there was a shoot in Fresno that was racially motivated. In fact, the shooter is being charged with a hate crime according to Fresno P.D. Chief Dyer. Here&#039;s the kicker, the shooter is black, and he specifically targeted white men. This is the first time I can remember a black man being charged with a hate crime. It&#039;s about fucking time. Oh yeah, and the fucker yelled &#039;Allahu Akbar&#039; when he was arrested, so there&#039;s possibly a terrorist component to the crime as well. Hate crime or act of terrorism? Or is it both? Personally I&#039;d say it&#039;s both.<br><br>http:\/\/www.fresnobee.com\/news\/local<wbr>\/crime\/article145234709.html<br><br>http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/04\/18\/us\/fr<wbr>esno-california-shootings\/index.htm<wbr>l","filename":"170418225739-kori-muhammad-fresno-large-169","ext":".jpg","w":460,"h":259,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492618612356,"time":1492618612,"md5":"zzrQawvZyfKCf\/xD9KJgiw==","fsize":28570,"resto":0,"id":"SFQTcA4v","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-woke-up-to-a-shock-today-pol-my-old-home-town","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":121861509,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:23:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121860796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121860796<\/a><br><br>Your hometown, eh?

Do yourself a favor and move to Idaho or Wyoming. It&#039;s the EXACT same thing except you&#039;ll have disposable income and your weekends.<br><br>If you have a degree and aren&#039;t resetting the life of your spouse and children - come right in.","filename":"325a0c4a9cdd0a5f422645650d07c73b","ext":".png","w":553,"h":600,"tn_w":230,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493857984647,"time":1493857984,"md5":"EmFBq89N4Yffi3mCmXj3\/A==","fsize":43370,"resto":0,"id":"ADWJ6ZmH","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-same-story-is-repeated-hundreds-of-times-a","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":2,"unique_ips":7},{"no":123991300,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)20:34:48","name":"T.","com":"<a href=\"#p123991069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123991069<\/a><br>That sounds horrible Anon.","time":1493858088,"resto":123991069,"id":"YSy0qTsJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123991392,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)20:35:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123991069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123991069<\/a><br>#SpyingSusan<br>Susan Rice refuses to testify,<br>so lets get this trending faggots.","filename":"1490123666597","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1030,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493858134230,"time":1493858134,"md5":"AyWgjMMpUYZHQbZ\/YE5Vhg==","fsize":230147,"resto":123991069,"id":"Rjsuz0A2","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123991622,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)20:37:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Well, unfortunately we leagalized pot, so you dont have to worry about us anymore.","time":1493858254,"resto":123991069,"id":"SD4E77gi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123991705,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)20:38:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Weed tourism from Cali is gonna die pretty soon.

Impression Products is a small business with about 25 employees. It specializes in buying used printer cartridges and remanufacturing them. In 2012, Lexmark decided to add Impression to an already existing lawsuit against other remanufacturers. While the other defendants eventually settled, Image has stuck it out and the case has made it to the highest court in the land.<br><br>You can read the full, technical details of the case here but the simple version goes like this: Since the \u201890s Lexmark has used what\u2019s called a \u201cshrink-wrap license\u201d with its cartridges. It offers a \u201cprebate\u201d to consumers by knocking off 20% of the price in exchange for their agreement to never resell or reuse the cartridge. The consumer agrees to this the second they open the package. Essentially, Lexmark believes that those cartridges belong to them, not the consumer reselling them because the consumer didn\u2019t have the right to sell them in the first place.<br><br>25 years ago, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears patent cases, carved an exception out of the patent exhaustion principle allowing patentees to set post-sale restrictions so long as these are otherwise legal and \u201cclearly communicated.\u201d In a separate case, the Federal Circuit concluded that when a patented item is sold abroad, the patentee\u2019s U.S. rights are not exhausted at all. The Federal Circuit upheld both of these precedents when it ruled against Impression Products earlier this year. The Supreme Court has never ruled on either of them.<br><br>http:\/\/www.scotusblog.com\/2017\/03\/a<wbr>rgument-analysis-justices-skeptical<wbr>-categorical-exhaustion-patent-righ<wbr>ts\/","filename":"printerink","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490503197854,"time":1490503197,"md5":"Kap9854Z3o8WFSNkOH723w==","fsize":70064,"resto":0,"id":"U5CtO5Kj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"supreme-court-printer-cartridge-case-could-be-the","country_name":"United States","replies":58,"images":4,"unique_ips":29},{"no":118320772,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:43:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118320433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118320433<\/a><br>Wtf you don&#039;t own something you buy ??<a href=\"#p118320433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118320433<\/a>","time":1490503425,"resto":118320433,"id":"faHYyoDV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118320773,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:43:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118320433\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118320433<\/a><br>bump","time":1490503427,"resto":118320433,"id":"o0ytEp8z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118321001,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:46:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118320772\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118320772<\/a><br>You did not know?

My dad worked for a big corporation that makes printers, and he admitted this in the 90&#039;s. Ink jet printers are one of the biggest scams out there. The ink costs pennies, and they charge sometimes 1000% higher. <br><br>Unless you&#039;re printing photos or art, or having a company pay for it, it&#039;s a ripoff. I went through too many printers, expensive and cheap, before I finally woke up and stopped handing money to them. Fuck Canon, Epson, and the rest of them. Plus, there are so many places now where you can get stuff printed cheap, it&#039;s stupid to pay for a printer. <br><br>I bought a $200 color laser 4 years ago. I still have 80% of the toner carts that came with it, and I use it regularly - but I can let it sit for a month, and I don&#039;t have to go through 2 o3 three ink packs to get it printing again, like I did with all of the cheap desktop printers I bought. I have a good desktop scanner, and nobody needs a fax anymore, so fuck the &quot;all-in-one&quot; cheapo printers, too. I can use cheap paper, too, instead of over-priced inkjet paper. <br><br>Do that, or get one of the refillable systems they have on the market, especially for the high end printers, like the ones for posters. Every print shop I know converts theirs to the endless ink systems, and buy the same damned inks Eposn and Canon rip you off for.<br><br>The other reason this is a thing, is business is slowly going paperless. They need to make money somehow.

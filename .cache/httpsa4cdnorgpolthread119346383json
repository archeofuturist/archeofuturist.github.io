When you meditate profoundly, for example, during a long individual retreat, you find that your greatest source of suffering is the enormous number of times you violated your conscience and sinned. Sin is that which seems attractive at first sight but actually fucks you over. What is the appropriate punishment (that deep down you&#039;ll feel you deserve if you go through this hardcore introspection, try it) for something you did several times every day of your life and whose burden you&#039;re fated to carry, no matter how skilled you&#039;ve become at repressing your conscience? Christianity&#039;s answer for this is the willful sacrifice of the singularly innocent, the sin-free, whose execution is the only thing sufficiently extreme to offset your depravation, if you have faith in it. Why is this important? Metaphysics aside, a heavy conscience is an avoided conscience. Unless you resolve the conflict between your perverse inclinations and highest aspirations, you&#039;ll try to avoid your conscience to get rid of the pain, therefore relapse and keep acting against your interests, quite possibly until you die.

The main contention is papal supremacy: Catholics consider the pope to have universal jurisdiction over the Church and to have the charism of papal infallibility (the best definition I&#039;ve heard is: &quot;the inability to formally and authoritatively proclaim as supernatural truth something which is untrue&quot;). The Orthodox consider him to have an only honorary role. Both sides have arguments for their positions, and although I consider Catholics to have a better claim, the topic would be impossible to be discussed properly here and a separate thread on \/his\/, a slower board with less shitposters, could be a better place to talk about this). The main characteristics of apostolic churches by which they differ from Protestants are emphasis on Tradition as a source of dogma together with Bible, belief in importance of ecumenical councils like Ephesus or Nicaea, belief that the church Christ founded is a concrete organisation that has been around since the Apostles, belief that one can, with effects, ask the souls in Heaven to pray for us, Eucharist as body and blood of Jesus, and few other things, but these are the most important. <br><br>Protestans have very little uniting characteristics and are known for constantly dividing into more and more churches ever since their beginning.

Nothing can be more clear reading Acts and Jesus word about being baptized in water and spirit that there are 2 distinct experiences. The Catholic church doesnt teach that, its unapostolic and sits on pride and lies to claim otherwise. I dont think all miracles associated with people who get parts of Christianity wrong are all false. I think those who have a solid foundation and deny the world are blessed even more and receive that baptism, and I think their virtue of obedience at times is not going to cause them to reform. Im a big fan of monasticism, but I do think prayers to saints is wrong. As far as I know the reformers didnt care about any baptism of the holy spirit either. Im mostly a fan of the Catholic charismatic renewal. My view is basically no one has it right, and worse still I think there are false miracles too.

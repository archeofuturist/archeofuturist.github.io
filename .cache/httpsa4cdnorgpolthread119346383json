When you meditate profoundly, for example, during a long individual retreat, you find that your greatest source of suffering is the enormous number of times you violated your conscience and sinned. Sin is that which seems attractive at first sight but actually fucks you over. What is the appropriate punishment (that deep down you&#039;ll feel you deserve if you go through this hardcore introspection, try it) for something you did several times every day of your life and whose burden you&#039;re fated to carry, no matter how skilled you&#039;ve become at repressing your conscience? Christianity&#039;s answer for this is the willful sacrifice of the singularly innocent, the sin-free, whose execution is the only thing sufficiently extreme to offset your depravation, if you have faith in it. Why is this important? Metaphysics aside, a heavy conscience is an avoided conscience. Unless you resolve the conflict between your perverse inclinations and highest aspirations, you&#039;ll try to avoid your conscience to get rid of the pain, therefore relapse and keep acting against your interests, quite possibly until you die.

The main contention is papal supremacy: Catholics consider the pope to have universal jurisdiction over the Church and to have the charism of papal infallibility (the best definition I&#039;ve heard is: &quot;the inability to formally and authoritatively proclaim as supernatural truth something which is untrue&quot;). The Orthodox consider him to have an only honorary role. Both sides have arguments for their positions, and although I consider Catholics to have a better claim, the topic would be impossible to be discussed properly here and a separate thread on \/his\/, a slower board with less shitposters, could be a better place to talk about this). The main characteristics of apostolic churches by which they differ from Protestants are emphasis on Tradition as a source of dogma together with Bible, belief in importance of ecumenical councils like Ephesus or Nicaea, belief that the church Christ founded is a concrete organisation that has been around since the Apostles, belief that one can, with effects, ask the souls in Heaven to pray for us, Eucharist as body and blood of Jesus, and few other things, but these are the most important. <br><br>Protestans have very little uniting characteristics and are known for constantly dividing into more and more churches ever since their beginning.

Nothing can be more clear reading Acts and Jesus word about being baptized in water and spirit that there are 2 distinct experiences. The Catholic church doesnt teach that, its unapostolic and sits on pride and lies to claim otherwise. I dont think all miracles associated with people who get parts of Christianity wrong are all false. I think those who have a solid foundation and deny the world are blessed even more and receive that baptism, and I think their virtue of obedience at times is not going to cause them to reform. Im a big fan of monasticism, but I do think prayers to saints is wrong. As far as I know the reformers didnt care about any baptism of the holy spirit either. Im mostly a fan of the Catholic charismatic renewal. My view is basically no one has it right, and worse still I think there are false miracles too.

Everyone knows that before Judaism, everyone was worshiping their ancestral deities. Wrong. This is the bluepill. Hundreds of years before the Jews worshiped a single God, an Aryan from Iran created monotheism after having visions and communications of the one God. Zarathustra, also called Zoroaster, claimed that there is only a single God. He believed God was all-good, all-compassionate, all-truthful and fair and Wise. Zoroaster taught there is an all-evil being as well. A false god who sought to do destruction among creation. He was called Ahriman and was the cause of all evil. Sound familiar? It should. The first monotheistic religion was called Zoroastrianism, and it was co-opted (stolen) by the Jews after their captivity in Babylon where they met with and no doubt exchanged ideas with Zoroastrian priests. Instead of the Aryan being the Chosen People of God, who were chosen to be caretakers of the world, the Jew perverted this and in his religion made himself the Chosen Ones, but chosen to conquer and enslave the world. Instead of being the God of Peace, the Jew has called turned him into the God of War (Exodus 15:3). <br><br>Judaism, therefore, is the the perversion of Zoroastrianism mixed with Hebrew Paganism. The first real monotheistic religion was Zoroastrianism, and it was not used to conquer or persecute &quot;non-believers&quot; but instead Zoroastrian priests taught their faith to build-up other people. For example, the Zoroastrian priests (called &quot;Magi&quot;) were so skilled in science, mathematics and medicine, and so famed for helping others with their &quot;sorcery,&quot; that the Babylonian sorcerers adopted their title in their honor. Calling themselves &quot;Magi,&quot; and even today we honor this tradition with our words MAGIc and MAGIcian. But, the Jew also has his magic, but it is a dark and evil weapon.","time":1491251027,"resto":119346383,"id":"UM49taqB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119375373,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)16:24:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119375320\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119375320<\/a><br>The distaste others have for monotheism is the result of the Jew poisoning the meme, and so you see how the Jew ruins everything he touches.

If you&#039;re Aryan, this is yet another accomplishment of your ancestors you can take pride in.

Chrysostom (349-407): Attend to this, ye who come to baptism at the close of life, for we indeed pray that after baptism ye may have also this deportment, but thou art seeking and doing thy utmost to depart without it.

In fact, in this same homily, on the Second Epistle of Paul to the Corinthians, St. Chrysostom writes, when he is speaking of what Paul is saying, in 2 Cor. 1:6, 7, Homily 2 says: :<br>For what he saith is this, &quot;Your salvation is not our work alone, but your own as well;for both we in preaching to you the word endure affliction, and ye in receiving it endure the very same; we to impart to you that which we received, ye to receive what is imparted and not to let it go.&quot; Now what humility can compare with this, seeing that those who fell so far short of him he raiseth to the same dignity of endurance? for he saith, &quot;Which worked in the enduring of the same sufferings;&quot; for not through believing only cometh your salvation, but also through the suffering and enduring the same things with us.

People have free will. Also recall that God made a pact with his chosen people, then sent his Son for a new covenant which almost everyone who was the old chosen was rejected. As in one NT letter the writer said the holy spirit speaketh expressly that later people will fall to deceiving spirits and doctrines of devils, forbidding to marry and forbidding certain meats. I think that applies to any group doing such things which includes Catholicism. Not to mention the classic protestant reading in Revelation as being a warning about the Roman church.<br><br>Do you not think God was largely absent when the Catholic church was killing people, amassing worldly power and influence, selling indulgences, forbidding vulgate translations despite the fact that was a translation? Of course some are damned and deceived. People strayed inti heresy months after the apostles left them! Its obvious they didnt have a &quot;heretic proof&quot; system of bureacracy and holy spirit guidance. Do you really think people 100 years later were less likely to stray than those that spoke with the apostles? Is it just a coincidence that there is no hard proof of Christians knowing of the dogmas of Mary, one of them approved in 1950, in the first 600 years of the church? I dont think all Catholics are going to hell but I think its obvious they got screwed up at parts.","time":1491251814,"resto":119346383,"id":"2EXArR3l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119376915,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)16:36:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119376671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119376671<\/a><br>Not true, only if you are a calvinist\/no free will<br><br>Which is not a tenant of Sola Fide<br>But Calvinism and Gnosticism <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that they may counted in exceeded Glory<\/span><br>Sola Fide also holds that good wokrs will be rewarededon the Day of Judgement<br>bad deeds will be forgiven","filename":"1489542829229","ext":".gif","w":243,"h":211,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1491251814834,"time":1491251814,"md5":"tQHGFFeFxFnsHs5uB+dHdQ==","fsize":1023717,"resto":119346383,"id":"HXisaRmD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119376925,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)16:36:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119376706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119376706<\/a><br>None did as I had shown ITT <br><br>We see this elsewhere in his commentary on Galatians 5 (chapter 5 on his commentary on Galatians 5:4-6):<br><br>Ver 4. &quot;Ye are severed from Christ, ye who would be justified by the Law; ye are fallen away from grace.&quot;<br>Having established his point, he at length declares their danger of the severest punishment.

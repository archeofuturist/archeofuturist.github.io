When you meditate profoundly, for example, during a long individual retreat, you find that your greatest source of suffering is the enormous number of times you violated your conscience and sinned. Sin is that which seems attractive at first sight but actually fucks you over. What is the appropriate punishment (that deep down you&#039;ll feel you deserve if you go through this hardcore introspection, try it) for something you did several times every day of your life and whose burden you&#039;re fated to carry, no matter how skilled you&#039;ve become at repressing your conscience? Christianity&#039;s answer for this is the willful sacrifice of the singularly innocent, the sin-free, whose execution is the only thing sufficiently extreme to offset your depravation, if you have faith in it. Why is this important? Metaphysics aside, a heavy conscience is an avoided conscience. Unless you resolve the conflict between your perverse inclinations and highest aspirations, you&#039;ll try to avoid your conscience to get rid of the pain, therefore relapse and keep acting against your interests, quite possibly until you die.

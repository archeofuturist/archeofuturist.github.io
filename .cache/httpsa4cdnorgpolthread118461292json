Place-finding devices. The next age of social development will be embodied in a better and more effective co-operation and co-ordination of ever-increasing and expanding specialization. And as labor more and more diversifies, some technique for directing individuals to suitable employment must be devised. Machinery is not the only cause for unemployment among the civilized peoples of Urantia. Economic complexity and the steady increase of industrial and professional specialism add to the problems of labor placement.<br><br>81:6.32 (910.5) It is not enough to train men for work; in a complex society there must also be provided efficient methods of place finding. Before training citizens in the highly specialized techniques of earning a living, they should be trained in one or more methods of commonplace labor, trades or callings which could be utilized when they were transiently unemployed in their specialized work. No civilization can survive the long-time harboring of large classes of unemployed. In time, even the best of citizens will become distorted and demoralized by accepting support from the public treasury. Even private charity becomes pernicious when long extended to able-bodied citizens.<br><br>81:6.33 (910.6) Such a highly specialized society will not take kindly to the ancient communal and feudal practices of olden peoples. True, many common services can be acceptably and profitably socialized, but highly trained and ultraspecialized human beings can best be managed by some technique of intelligent co-operation. Modernized co-ordination and fraternal regulation will be productive of longer-lived co-operation than will the older and more primitive methods of communism or dictatorial regulative institutions based on force","time":1490586981,"resto":118461292,"id":"\/xyWQTve","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118467901,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)23:57:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;S-Stalin and t-the ussr w-weren&#039;t r-real communis-sts<\/span>","filename":"IMG_1806","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":960,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490587035446,"time":1490587035,"md5":"mNH\/GFGf\/8JVGgtNmnrT6Q==","fsize":205386,"resto":118461292,"id":"1VbHIdhZ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118467944,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)23:57:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;communists in the 21st century<\/span><br>why bother?","filename":"wtf happened","ext":".jpg","w":638,"h":800,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490587060403,"time":1490587060,"md5":"44KEgb8A94zjR7NcZuZvpA==","fsize":79957,"resto":118461292,"id":"+OMxYFAB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118468002,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)23:58:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118467784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118467784<\/a><br>nigga wat","filename":"317ecde9be5b69bc0cfeedf6dd5e79cf797a3df5054bdb53658569579c7b5914","ext":".jpg","w":749,"h":494,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1490587094331,"time":1490587094,"md5":"1EV+0TaLUcmIIIwYgFJWEQ==","fsize":29488,"resto":118461292,"id":"Pibj9e6a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118468133,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)23:59:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118461292\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118461292<\/a><br>Kill yourself comrade","filename":"IMG_0504","ext":".jpg","w":599,"h":446,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490587165764,"time":1490587165,"md5":"258CQckZlPJzORvhDt0GZw==","fsize":144979,"resto":118461292,"id":"PswtqzlN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

The term of its president, Rudolf E. A. Havenstein, was for life, and he was literally unstoppable: under Havenstein, the Reichsbank kept issuing ever greater amounts of Papiermark for keeping the Reich financially afloat. Then, on 15 November 1923, the Reichsbank was made to stop monetizing government debt and issuing new money. At the same time, it was decided to make one trillion Papermark (a number with twelve zeros: 1,000,000,000,000) equal to one Rentenmark. On 20 November 1923, Havenstein died, all of a sudden, through a heart attack. That same day, Hjalmar Schacht, who would become Reichsbank president in December, took action and stabilized the Papermark against the US dollar: the Reichsbank, and through foreign exchange market interventions, made 4.2 trillion Papermark equal to one US Dollar. And as one trillion Papermark was equal to one Rentenmark, the exchange rate was 4.2 Rentenmark for one US dollar. This was exactly the exchange rate that had prevailed between the Reichsmark and the US dollar before World War I. The \u201cmiracle of the Rentenmark\u201d marked the end of hyperinflation.3<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;On 20 November 1923, Havenstein died, all of a sudden, through a heart attack.

The Nazi ruler, Netanyahu said, had no intention of killing the Jews, but only to expel them.<br>In a speech before the World Zionist Congress in Jerusalem, Netanyahu described a meeting between Husseini and Hitler in November, 1941: &quot;Hitler didn&#039;t want to exterminate the Jews at the time, he wanted to expel the Jew. And Haj Amin al-Husseini went to Hitler and said, &#039;If you expel them, they&#039;ll all come here (to Palestine).&#039; According to Netanyahu, Hitler then asked: &quot;What should I do with them?&quot; and the mufti replied: &quot;Burn them.&quot;<br>Netanyahu&#039;s remarks were quick to spark a social media storm, though Netanyahu made a similar claim during a Knesset speech in 2012, where he described the Husseini as &quot;one of the leading architects&quot; of the final solution.&quot;<br><br>http:\/\/www.haaretz.com\/israel-news\/<wbr>1.681525<br><br>IMHO the Holocaust did, in a sense, occur, but Jewish numbers are inflated considerably, and they are unfairly focused on as the only people who died in the camps; in actuality, the death camps were mostly pre-existing prison camps from the 1930s, not even created by Hitler himself, and not unlike lower security American prisons today. Tons of people died in them of typhus, starvation, flu and a bunch of other causes during the last awful winters of the war. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s really possible to know how many people were deliberately gassed, shot or whatever, and moreover, I&#039;ve never seen decisive proof that Hitler ordered all of that. I&#039;m not sure he was even completely in control beyond a certain point.

I don&#039;t doubt that Netanyahu said this because he wants to make clear what a threat the Arabs surrounding Israel are, and to justify a potential Palestinian genocide. But that doesn&#039;t mean it isn&#039;t true, or that he doesn&#039;t actually know it to be true himself. I am sure he does. There&#039;s ample evidence that Hitler tried to export the Jews, and ironically was shut down by the Allies--who, mind you, didn&#039;t want those Jews either. Anne Frank herself and her family tried to get to the US earlier in the war and were rejected. Anti-semitism used to be very common and accepted--you have to ask yourself, why? The easy libshit answer is &quot;because people used to be cruel savages, WE are more evolved now&quot; but I don&#039;t think it&#039;s that simple. More like, because for centuries Jews did everything they could to piss just about everyone the fuck off. At their worst, they are both arrogant and clueless to an amazing degree. They always think they are getting away with shit until the second the last door slams in their faces. That happened a lot in the leadup to WWII and it&#039;s partly why Hitler was left with so many of them to deal with.<br><br>Hitler was a troubled, weird guy IMHO but I don&#039;t believe he ever actually wanted to commit genocide, not even against the Jews.","time":1491474009,"resto":119715348,"id":"4nos+uKX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119728342,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)06:20:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119727959\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119727959<\/a><br><br>Dachau had a library for the prisoners, a chapel and a prisoner music band.<br><br>On sundays they would get roast pork.<br><br>Prisoners could receive money and food from relatives and could also buy better quality food in a store within the camp <br><br>Yes they were not free, yes they were punished when they stole something or tried to escape. <br><br>Like in every prison.

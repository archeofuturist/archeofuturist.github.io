Street demonstrations take place in Tunisia leading to the ousting of longtime president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011. The demonstrations were precipitated by high unemployment, food inflation, corruption, a lack of political freedoms like freedom of speech and poor living conditions. Resulted in scores of deaths and injuries, most of which were the result of action by police and security forces against demonstrators. Labour unions were said to be an integral part of the protests. This is the first run test, it is very effective.<br><br>Similar protests begin in Libya, Egypt, Yemen, Syria and Iraq. All uprisings start the same way. Allegations of high unemployment, food inflation, corruption, a lack of political freedoms like freedom of speech and poor living conditions, protestors take to the streets against their governments, government authorities attempt to supress the protest, violence escalates. These protests result in one of several options either the regime was toppled or major uprisings and social violence occurred, including civil wars or insurgencies.<br><br>But those are only the protests which resulted in high levels of violence. There are also sustained street demonstrations taking place in Morocco, Bahrain, Algeria, Iran, Lebanon, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman and Sudan. There are minor protests that are quickly shut down by their respective governments in Djibouti, Mauritania, the Palestinian territories, Saudi Arabia, Somalia and the Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara.<br><br>The arab spring comes to a close mid 2012 with Syria left in a state of ongoing Civil War, the Iraqi insugency and ongoing civil war, The Egyptian Crisis and Coup, The ongoing Crisis in Yemen and Crisis in Libya.<br><br>There&#039;s lots that could be discussed about these other countries, but one in particular reveals more than the other.

None of these protests were spontaneous. Each were the results of 5 years of careful planning by the US State Department, The CIA, George Soros and the pro-Israel lobby. Each of these groups worked together to flood the people with propaganda. Through out the Arab world and West alike we were told that these were protests to bring democracy to the people and to overthrow dictators. None of these protests made any reference anti-US sentiment over involvement in Palestine or Iraq. All of these protests were instigated by middle class students.<br><br>The claimed US goal of the Arab Spring revolutions was to replace unpopular despotic dictators while maintaining the autocratic US-friendly infrastructure that had brought them into power to bring on democratic governments led by the educated middle class youth in these countries. At the time the US government made no attempt to keep secret that they were willing to pay mercenaries, and to arm and fund militias in order to achieve this goal.<br><br>Evidence of this is reflected in the Wikileaks cables and websites of CIA pass through foundations. The US State department was running conferences and workshops with the people who would later become the leaders of the Arab Spring. In 2008 Obama initiated an Internet campaign team to train Arab Spring cyberactivists in encryption technologies and social media skills so they could organise using google, facebook and twitter. These activites were promoted through key &#039;democracy&#039; promoting foundations.","filename":"1490956966913","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1280,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490966513388,"time":1490966513,"md5":"hxBERqCYK6tBFfL\/We1v7g==","fsize":335973,"resto":119054615,"id":"YL6semQX","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119055496,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)09:22:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119055082\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119055082<\/a><br>He basically said that someone spliced his voice in a video while he was talking about something else to make him say he was talking about comet pizza.

Born Gy\u00f6rgy Schwartz 12 August 1930 Soros grew up in Nazi occupied Hungary. His name was changed to George Soros in 1936 as a protective camouflage against antisemitism. At age 13 Soros began his career by reporting other Jewish children to a government official which earned him trust, he aquired official doccuments naming him as a christian in return by means of being named as the official&#039;s god son. He then went on to work with his adopted godfather to confiscate property from the local Jewish population. Soros describes that time as &quot;the happiest time of my life&quot; and when asked if he felt guilt over the events he stated &quot;No, only feelings of absolute power.&quot; In 1947 Soros moved to London and enrolled in the London School of Economics where he studied under Karl Popper, the Austrian-British philosopher who was one of the first proponents of an \u201cOpen Society.\u201d Soros then worked at several merchant banks in London before moving to New York in 1963. In 1970, he founded Soros Fund Management and in 1973 created the Quantum Fund in partnership with investor Jim Rogers. The fund made annual returns of over 30%, cementing Soros\u2019s reputation and putting him in a position of power\u2014one he utilizes to this day to advance the agenda of his mentors.<br><br>In the 1990s, Soros began a string of large bets against national currencies. The first was in 1992, when he sold short the pound sterling and made a $1 billion profit in a single day. His next big currency speculation came in 1997. This time Soros singled out the Thai baht and, with heavy short-selling volume, destroyed the baht\u2019s artificial peg to the US dollar, which started the Asian financial crisis.<br><br>Today, Soros\u2019s net worth stands at $23 billion. Since taking a back seat in his company, Soros Fund Management, in 2000, Soros has been focusing on his philanthropic efforts, which he carries out through the Open Society Foundations he founded in 1993.","filename":"1490957155108","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":540,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490966532780,"time":1490966532,"md5":"tvTL3xTfm+3PLDVmPgFBKg==","fsize":43349,"resto":119054615,"id":"YL6semQX","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119055526,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)09:22:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"anyone else getting so pissed of at all the anti-trump stuff that you hope he actually becomes a dictator?<br><br>i voted for him because i felt like he would shrink the government while keeping our country safe but every day that passes, more and more i hope he becomes a dictator.","time":1490966551,"resto":119054615,"id":"Mx0C5uc3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119055548,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)09:22:47","name":"Redpill","com":"<a href=\"#p119055505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119055505<\/a><br>During the 1980s and 1990s, Soros used his extraordinary wealth to bankroll and fund revolutions in dozens of European nations, including Czechoslovakia, Croatia, and Yugoslavia.

If you wonder why Soros meddled in these nations\u2019 affairs, part of the answer may lie in the fact that during and after the chaos, he invested heavily in assets in each of the respective countries. He then used Columbia University economist Jeffrey Sachs to advise the fledgling governments to privatize all public assets immediately, thus allowing Soros to sell the assets he had acquired during the turmoil into newly formed open markets.<br><br>In 2004, Soros stated, \u201cI deeply believe in the values of an open society.

They have become close friends, and their enduring relationship goes well beyond donor status. at a 2004 \u201cTake Back America\u201d conference where Soros was speaking, the former first lady introduced him saying, \u201c[W]e need people like George Soros, who is fearless and willing to step up when it counts. Soros began supporting Hillary Clinton\u2019s current presidential run in 2013, taking a senior role in the \u201cReady for Hillary\u201d group. Since then, Soros has donated over $15 million to pro-Clinton groups and Super PACs.<br><br>More recently, Soros has given more than $33 million to the Black Lives Matter group, which has been involved in outbreaks of social unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland, in 2015. Both of these incidents contributed to a worsening of race relations across America. The same group heavily criticized Democratic contender Bernie Sanders for his alleged track record of supporting racial inequality, helping to undercut him as a competitive threat with one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s most ardent constituencies.<br><br>This, of course, greatly enhances the clout Soros wields through the groups mentioned above. It is safe to assume that he is now able to drive Democratic policy, especially in an administration headed by Hillary Clinton.<br><br>Simply, what Soros wants, he gets.

This has recently been shown very clearly with his funding of the European refugee crisis. The refugee crisis is not a naturally occurring phenomenon. It coincided with OSF donating money to the US-based Migration Policy Institute and the Platform for International Cooperation on Undocumented Migrants, both Soros-sponsored organizations. Both groups advocate the resettlement of third-world Muslims into Europe.<br><br>In 2015, a Sky News reporter found \u201cMigrant Handbooks\u201d on the Greek island of Lesbos.

The plan proposes that Germany should grant asylum to 500,000 Syrian refugees. It also states that Germany, along with other European nations, should agree to help Turkey, a country that\u2019s 98% Muslim, gain visa-free travel within the EU starting in 2016.","filename":"1490957970491","ext":".jpg","w":1180,"h":842,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1490966834249,"time":1490966834,"md5":"IQlDTBMA3Jc5KkaHW2xjJQ==","fsize":1099904,"resto":119054615,"id":"YL6semQX","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119055939,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)09:27:32","name":"Redpill","com":"<a href=\"#p119055913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119055913<\/a><br>tl;dr:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Soros has made a career making billions destabilizing nations. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hillary, Soros, Obama, the CIA and Israel funded and organised the Arab Spring<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They radicalised the educated middle class students in Arab countries to protest against their gonvernments under the false idea that toppling dictators would result in democracy<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They then trained, armed and funded rebel mercenaries group within the Islamic community <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A CIA spook created a an Anti Islamic movie and released it as a cover for these actions.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Soros is now working on destabilizing the US and Europe using the same methods used to create the arab spring.<\/span>","filename":"1490958084503","ext":".jpg","w":679,"h":382,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490966852372,"time":1490966852,"md5":"trVjdMaM0QUmVZVfE5JQgg==","fsize":76899,"resto":119054615,"id":"YL6semQX","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119055960,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)09:27:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119055913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119055913<\/a><br>Beautiful picture, love refugees!","time":1490966872,"resto":119054615,"id":"Kh9j7IFK","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119055972,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)09:28:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119055830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119055830<\/a><br>yeah, this is what this reminds me of.

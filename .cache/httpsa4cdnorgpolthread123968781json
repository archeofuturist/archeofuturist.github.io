That is why when the attacks happened he said that terrorism will be part of our every day lives fro decades to come. He knows that his plans to increase immigration and allow millions into france will result in decreased security and will damage france for its citizens, that&#039;s why he wants to normalise terrorism and tell the french people to get used to it. all that matters to him is to increase the size of frances economy by getting in as many people as possible , even if the safety and quality of life of our citizens is compromised, even if hundreds more french fathers and mothers and children die or are maimed as a result. <br><br>I think that would be a much clearer line of attack:<br>banker doesn&#039;t care about french citizens lives and safety , only increasing GDP - said that terrorism will be part of everyday life for decades to come - said that europe will experience mass migrations far greatr than the current refugee crisis and it must get used to it<br><br>very easy narrative to link. don&#039;t know why le pen didn&#039;t do it.<br><br>all you&#039;d need to do is add on an appeal addressed directly to french citizens saying &quot;listen, I&#039;m talking to you. what kind of france do you want your grand children to grow up in.

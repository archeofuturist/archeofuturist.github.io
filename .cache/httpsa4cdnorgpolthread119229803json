Should rich people even be allowed to have public political opinions?<br><br>Think of the usual suspects: Michael Moore, Jon Stewart, Emma Watson, Lena Dunham, etc.<br><br>These people are completely blinded because their piles of cash completely protect them from anything the government does. Think about it. When you say that immigrants shouldn&#039;t be allowed because they will make jobs harder to get they call you racist. And why wouldn&#039;t them?<br><br>They are fucking millionaires. No poor immigrant is going to take their job as a millionaire television host, or film director, or actress.<br><br>So you do see my point? We should completely ban rich people from having political opinions, and even from being politicians because rich people are OUT OF TOUCH WITH REALITY.","filename":"WildTheoryAbstractAlgebra","ext":".png","w":1048,"h":541,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":129,"tim":1491158637590,"time":1491158637,"md5":"KTGjPTlQ5APEZBvpMEixJg==","fsize":713419,"resto":0,"id":"o5OvDwmD","country":"PA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"should-rich-people-have-opinions","country_name":"Panama","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119230262,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)14:47:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"How do you know that your socioeconomic status doesn&#039;t cause you to have opinions that are divorced from reality?","time":1491158869,"resto":119229803,"id":"4pmYZnf1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119230778,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)14:52:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119230262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119230262<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do you know that your socioeconomic status doesn&#039;t cause you to have opinions that are divorced from reality?<\/span><br><br>Simple, I don&#039;t have enough money to make a money shield.<br><br>If the government were to take any financial action, odds are it would affect me.

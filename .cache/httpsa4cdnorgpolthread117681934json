FSA? Israel?<\/span><br>Erm... Yes, actually? They are in war with the first and got bombed\/sabotaged by the second. But it is mostly to do with typical Arab dictator army structure - shit main army, relatively good loyal elite troops (Republican Guards in this particular case). Also, there was no one to train them properly before Russia came along, and only now they are starting to get decent amounts of trained troops. Assad army was always pretty shit and they have to somehow work with it. I don`t understand your point here, tbqh. We are talking actual Syrian soldiers here as they are, not as they could be if Syria at least had Jordan tier army.<br><br> 2. in both case it&#039;s urban warfare, i&#039;m too lazy to google street view Souran, but I&#039;m sure it&#039;s comparable<br>Do you realise how much does size matter in this case?

All of this hype surrounding north korea and Syria may both be distractions from something else. There&#039;s no way to really know without your feet on the ground or being part of the inner circle. It could be thousands of miles in another direction that the real problem is happening.<br><br>Another thing, we&#039;re always looking for recent happenings and analyzing the present. Of course everyone just wants a conflict to flush away the shitty state our world is in. But in terms of finding out the truth, we have the whole last 20-30 years of history to look through for connections. We could honestly be having happenings every day if we just knew what to look for. I think we just spend too much time on 9\/11 or sandyhook. There are many more disasters that (((they))) could be behind. And surely one of these left discernable traces when connecting points in history together.","filename":"Alone_in_the_Dark_A_New_Nightmare","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":425,"tn_w":176,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493733733560,"time":1493733733,"md5":"0vebXCNaTmLQMXuezbtQMw==","fsize":34537,"resto":0,"id":"EwAfkDNy","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"after-seeing-that-video-of-the-dutch-guy-who","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123771054,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)10:15:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123769785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123769785<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;very very conspiracy<\/span><br>um, no","time":1493734546,"resto":123769785,"id":"zAvwyBZk","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123772063,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)10:25:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123769785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123769785<\/a><br>Hype to draw attention away from domestic matters?

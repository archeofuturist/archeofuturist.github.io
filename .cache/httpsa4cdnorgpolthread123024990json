No, really. J\u00e4rlstr\u00f6m had sent a letter to the board in 2014 asking for the opportunity to present his research on how too-short yellow lights were making money for the state by putting the public&#039;s safety at risk. &quot;I would like to present these fact for your review and comment,&quot; he wrote.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Wi4<wbr>brP0sXSQ<br>Is this true freedom?

Everyone watches as he approaches the forest&#039;s edge until he&#039;s no longer visible. But as he goes further into the forest he notices a strange light ahead. He walks towards it, and the forest eventually dissipates. As he exits the forest he sees a giant, alien civilization. They welcome the villager, and explain to him that they have already mapped every inch of that planet. They were aware of the forest village but left them alone because the alternative is a culture shock that would most likely destroy the village and its inhabitants. <br><br>So there&#039;s nowhere to go that isn&#039;t already mapped. And to go further into the alien civilization would possibly transform the villager until he&#039;s no longer recognizable to the villagers and the villagers are no longer recognizable to him. So he returns to his village, because it&#039;s the only comfort he&#039;s familiar with.

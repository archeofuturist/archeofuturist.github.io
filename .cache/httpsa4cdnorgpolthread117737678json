That&#039;s bullshit. The common ancestor is Cro-Magnon. Those ppl originated in Ethiopia and with time went north, where they at some point came into contact with Neanderthals in the Caucasus area, with whom they interbred and the Caucasian Race, and its subgroups (e.g. Europeans) came into existence. Cro Magnons(some also of Neanderthal descent) who wandered further to Asia met Denisovans, interbred with them and spawned the Asians.<br><br>pic related Cro Magnon with most likely Ethiopian skin tone.","filename":"cro_magnon_4","ext":".jpg","w":375,"h":500,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490179366352,"time":1490179366,"md5":"UrG2tHJoJfY\/KcND82D8Kw==","fsize":116253,"resto":117737678,"id":"wp5XwV\/X","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":117746543,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)06:42:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117746446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117746446<\/a><br>nasty nordic genetics","time":1490179378,"resto":117737678,"id":"y1R0jQIi","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":117746612,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)06:44:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117744806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117744806<\/a><br>That&#039;s some we wuz shit right there, they&#039;re stretching you can tell.

It was found that African haplogroup A (originated 132,000 \u00b1 12,000 years before present) is very remote time-wise from all other haplogroups, which have a separate common ancestor, named \u03b2-haplogroup, and originated 64,000 \u00b1 6000 ybp. It includes a family of Europeoid (Caucasoid) haplogroups from F through T that originated 58,000 \u00b1 5000 ybp. A downstream common ancestor for haplogroup A and \u03b2-haplogroup, coined the \u03b1-haplogroup emerged 160,000 \u00b1 12,000 ybp. A territorial origin of haplogroups \u03b1- and \u03b2-remains unknown; however, the most likely origin for each of them is a vast triangle stretched from Central Europe in the west through the Russian Plain to the east and to Levant to the south.

We use two complementary approximate-likelihood approaches and a model of human evolution that involves recent population structure, with and without gene flow from an archaic population. Extensive simulation results reject the null model of no admixture and allow us to infer that contemporary African populations contain a small proportion of genetic material (\u22482%) that introgressed \u224835 kya from an archaic population that split from the ancestors of anatomically modern humans \u2248700 kya. Three candidate regions showing deep haplotype divergence, unusual patterns of linkage disequilibrium, and small basal clade size are identified and the distributions of introgressive haplotypes surveyed in a sample of populations from across sub-Saharan Africa. One candidate locus with an unusual segment of DNA that extends for &gt;31 kb on chromosome 4 seems to have introgressed into modern Africans from a now-extinct taxon that may have lived in central Africa. Taken together our results suggest that polymorphisms present in extant populations introgressed via relatively recent interbreeding with hominin forms that diverged from the ancestors of modern humans in the Lower-Middle Pleistocene.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/ar<wbr>ticles\/PMC3174671\/","time":1490184239,"resto":117737678,"id":"q7W8e+Nd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117751623,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)08:05:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117737678\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117737678<\/a><br>Its a jewish conspiracy.","time":1490184300,"resto":117737678,"id":"EGHf7A7h","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":117751844,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)08:08:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117737678\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117737678<\/a><br>No.<br>While the genetics match up, the languages don&#039;t.<br>If the Out of Africa theory is true, the how come Proto languages such as PIE exist?","time":1490184499,"resto":117737678,"id":"oE83TVcG","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117752158,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)08:13:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117747619\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117747619<\/a><br>Quit shifting the goalposts, faggot","time":1490184789,"resto":117737678,"id":"TsLBVJDR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117753294,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)08:29:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117751534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117751534<\/a><br>Okay, so early African humans did interbreed... but they did not interbreed with the same partners as humans in other locations.<br><br>Not less evolved, just worse evolved.

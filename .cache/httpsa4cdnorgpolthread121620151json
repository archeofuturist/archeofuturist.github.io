Be prepared to defend yourselves and others IF FORCED, bring defensive implements IF YOU MUST, but do NOT under ANY circumstances bring weapons.<br>3) Do NOT come dressed like stomcunts or tacticool fags. Bring safety\/sporting gear if you have it, but don&#039;t look like you came dressed for a riot.<br>4) Do NOT talk to press about stupid alt-right shit or memes, stay on-message.<br>5) Do NOT cause damage to the campus or the downtown area.<br><br>1) DO wear Auburn colors to the rally - dark blue and orange<br>2) DO act civil and composed - there must be a stark contrast between you and the Antifa hooligans<br>3) DO take lots of pics and vids so you can report any Antifa to police\/university.<br>4) DO talk to press about the importance of defending speech, ESPECIALLY unpopular speech, on college campuses.<br>5) DO stay after the rally to help clean up damage caused by Antifa. Bring trashbags for litter, medkits to help with bystander injuries.<br><br>And most importantly, if you are a student or faculty member at Auburn, please stay safe tomorrow.<br><br>War Eagle!","filename":"au","ext":".gif","w":200,"h":178,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":178,"tim":1492480782159,"time":1492480782,"md5":"DYlk8nDGzegJp15S4JYYNQ==","fsize":11530,"resto":0,"id":"nBI3RyvM","country":"US","bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"berkeley-ii-electric-boogaloo","country_name":"United States","replies":312,"images":62,"unique_ips":128,"tail_size":50},{"no":121620336,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)22:01:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Roll Tide, faggots.","time":1492480862,"resto":121620151,"id":"bdjAduFo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121620614,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)22:03:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121620151\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121620151<\/a><br>2lane crips coming to fuck up dem antifa niggas","time":1492480995,"resto":121620151,"id":"EtUQY5xF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121621150,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)22:07:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121620336\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121620336<\/a><br>I&#039;m curious, what&#039;s it like living in a city with seven times the national homicide rate?","time":1492481237,"resto":121620151,"id":"nBI3RyvM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121621213,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)22:07:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Wait a tick.

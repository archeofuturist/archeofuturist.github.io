Think about it. Being a gentile is essentially lack of neurosis. Ever seen a neurotic arab or nigger? There&#039;s one video where one person says Jews are punished 7 times more for the same sins. Not sure if this is correct. But think about niggers. They can go to discos and do all kinds of sinful things without suffering at all from it, because they fit right in. Me on the other hand I&#039;m like Neo in the Matrix like when he&#039;s in the club. He&#039;s alone and neurotic it seems. His friend sits there all relaxed with hot women clinging onto him. That&#039;s the nigger right there. The neurosis is telling me something, it&#039;s like an internal compass, it&#039;s a divine gift, i.e. being God&#039;s chosen, i.e. a Jew.","filename":"VLC2014-04-14-13h03m35s245_zpsaa1a0fd8","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":425,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":51,"tim":1490098433065,"time":1490098433,"md5":"vrclMYobywIHEdVnq8EAWA==","fsize":30527,"resto":117615877,"id":"VHtlewtW","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":117619333,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)08:21:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117615877\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117615877<\/a>","filename":"crank2_trepan5","ext":".gif","w":432,"h":434,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490098906636,"time":1490098906,"md5":"uqBp+zty8Sc+TijZvSHFBg==","fsize":8992,"resto":117615877,"id":"ol1RkM1V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117619504,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)08:24:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;ve also heard that I&#039;m &quot;not in contact with my emotions&quot; or some shit like that. That is probably a good thing. Aren&#039;t the illuminati elite like the Vulcans in Star Trek, ruthless psychopaths, because no emotion taints their clear vision of the truth. Niggers and women on the other hand are at the bottom of the pyramid and have a mind which is nothing but the filth that is emotion. Or perhaps emotion isn&#039;t all bad? Can there be life without emotion? Can there be any incentive? Any action? Or is it paralysis? Oblivion. Isn&#039;t death better than life anyway?

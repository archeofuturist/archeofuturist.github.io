Orban has recommended: helping Christians before Muslim migrants and sinking empty migrant ships to \u201csave the Mediterranean.\u201d He has referred to asylum seekers as \u201ca poison.\u201d Orban has also stated that \u201cthose arriving have been raised in another religion and represent a radically different culture,\u201d and has called Europe\u2019s response to the migrant chaos \u201cmadness.\u201d Now Orban is taking action. According to his Defense Minister Istvan Simicsko:<br><br> The defense of the border \u2026 so hundreds of thousands won\u2019t march across the country, deserves total respect\u2026.Our most important common interest is the protection of the Hungarian citizens, our family members and civilians.\u201d<br><br><br>https:\/\/www.jihadwatch.org\/2017\/03\/<wbr>hungary-opens-military-base-at-bord<wbr>er-to-stop-migrants","filename":"Screenshot_20170321-144825","ext":".png","w":1600,"h":2560,"tn_w":156,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490125890212,"time":1490125890,"md5":"c0I8j5vM2hQSt8Ovz5wu6w==","fsize":1318299,"resto":0,"id":"Uu2h4T0U","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hungary-opens-military-base-at-border-to-stop","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

You can see the Greek influence in their society too. But make no mistake, it wasn&#039;t a good thing for the people they conquered. Tribes were extinguished, decadent civilization forced down their throats when they didn&#039;t want it. Funny, they expanded too far and too wide, forcing the yoke of civilization down the throats of those they conquered which lead to them being unable to cover all of their bases and, amongst other things such as the rampant corruption and economical issues, led to their downfall. <br><br>I&#039;d be much happier with simple living amongst my kin in the woodlands of my homeland rather than living amongst a crowded, urban Municipium under Roman authority, heated floors and thermal baths be damned.

Quality of life would&#039;ve improved massively with the importation of minted currency, distribution of land, new trade routs opened, roads, sea trade made accessible, quick and easy access to water, more living spaces made available through the centralized superstate that was Imperial Rome. In the Republican era it was much the same once a proper push was made into Gaul.

Your entire ideology is stupid and only meant to appeal to the masses of stupid, uneducated faggots that can&#039;t accept responsibility for the shit life they have crafted for themselves; you are literally a drain on society and is what is killing the west. I hope you are just trolling, but if you aren&#039;t then unironically kill yourself. If anyone here deserves a bullet it&#039;s you, fortunately most fascist states posses the money to afford a helicopter, so they can drop you from that instead like a good little fascist.","time":1492213593,"resto":121122416,"id":"iWxBVug1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121135010,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:53:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121134071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121134071<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;like a good little fascist.<\/span><br>*Marxist","time":1492214026,"resto":121122416,"id":"iWxBVug1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121135899,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)20:00:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121122416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121122416<\/a><br>Did that little shit kill a tarantula?Those things are bro.","time":1492214423,"resto":121122416,"id":"2va950pf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121136175,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)20:02:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"HOLD ON JUST A MOMENT!<br><br>What happened in that story is that a SHED (only shell, no tarantula) was blended, not a live spider.<br><br>It was then fed to a party however.","time":1492214556,"resto":121122416,"id":"5xrelaBQ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121136417,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)20:04:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121122416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121122416<\/a><br>No taxes except for a 100% inheritance tax","time":1492214667,"resto":121122416,"id":"xQwNniQ9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121136768,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)20:07:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121136175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121136175<\/a><br>Thats a relief,Tarantulas are as evil as the smaller spiders.Most of them are pretty chill.","time":1492214824,"resto":121122416,"id":"2va950pf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121136808,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)20:07:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121136768\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121136768<\/a><br>*Aren&#039;t","time":1492214845,"resto":121122416,"id":"2va950pf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121136862,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)20:07:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121125246\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121125246<\/a><br>I think you over estimate the involvement of C level execs in the day to day.

Preferably federal funded basic healthcare and education with provinces or states autonomously being able to influence Fiscal and Monetary policies for their communities. I also believe in macroeconomic budgeting where taxes are meant to pay off debts for a certain amount of time then reversing this to alleviate the economy and allow for spending to help progress the state. I also tend to focus more on long term policies where recessionary and inflationary output gaps could be strategized upon and observed to repeat the process in the future with minimizing the amount of error.","time":1492216110,"resto":121122416,"id":"KOO2raoo","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121140092,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)20:31:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121124464\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121124464<\/a>","filename":"4550324+_b106ae8226dc34d509bb10e19888acc9","ext":".png","w":240,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1492216262327,"time":1492216262,"md5":"RDDapV+A6Chk+27IU2oXgA==","fsize":18572,"resto":121122416,"id":"aD72GLam","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

He was seated at his desk flanked by Vice President Mike Pence, NASA personnel, and members of Congress including Sen. Ted Cruz, Sen. Marco Rubio, Sen. Bill Nelson, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, and Rep. John Culberson. White House staff provided your pooler with a full list of attendees, which is included below.<br>&quot;For almost six decades NASA&#039;s work has inspired millions and millions of Americans to imagine distant worlds and a better future right here on Earth. I&#039;m delighted to sign this bill. It&#039;s been a long time since a bill like this has been signed reaffirming our national commitment to the core mission of NASA, human space exploration, space science and technology. With this legislation, we support NASA&#039;s scientists, engineers, astronauts and their pursuit of discovery. We support jobs. It&#039;s about jobs. Also this bill calls for ongoing medical monitoring and treatment of our heroic astronauts for health conditions that result from their service,&quot; Trump said.<br>Trump paused to remark on the difficulty of being an astronaut. &quot;It&#039;s a pretty tough job,&quot; Trump said before turning to Cruz. &quot;I don&#039;t know Ted would you like to do it? I don&#039;t think I would.&quot;<br>Cruz shook his head indicating that he would not want to be an astronaut. Trump then turned to Rubio.<br>&quot;Marco, do you want to do it?&quot; he asked.<br><br>&quot;I&#039;m not sure we want to do it,&quot; Trump said.<br>Cruz piped in with a proposal.<br>&quot;You could send Congress to space,&quot; said Cruz.<br>&quot;We could,&quot; Trump said turning to look at Pence. &quot;What a great idea that could be.&quot;<br>This quip prompted laughs from the attendees.

They&#039;re going to make great progress. It continues support for the commercial crew program which will carry American astronauts into space from American soil once again been a long time. It supports NASA&#039;s deep space exploration including the space launch system and the Orion spacecraft. ... It advances space science by maintaining a balanced set of mission and activities to explore our solar system and the entire universe and it ensures that, through NASA&#039;s astronauts and aeronautics research, the United States will remain a total leader in aviation. Now these astronauts are amazing. I&#039;ve met some of them. They are very brave people and they&#039;re right at the forefront. So, we salute them with this legislation and we salute the ones who have lost their lives doing what they love to do. America&#039;s space program has been a blessing to our people and to the entire world. Almost half a century ago our brave astronauts first planted the American flag on the moon. It was a big moment in our history. Now, this nation is ready to be the first in space once again. Today we&#039;re taking the initial steps toward a bold and bright new future for American space flight. I am honored to sign this new bill. The folks behind me have been so involved in it. They love NASA. They love everything it stands for and they love the people in their areas.","filename":"1483864844849","ext":".jpg","w":2893,"h":1929,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490115621822,"time":1490115621,"md5":"uInZP360qzhh3jMHj1+0tA==","fsize":756059,"resto":117643236,"id":"\/mhlvnq3","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117643688,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)13:00:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Just read about this newly signed NASA bill.

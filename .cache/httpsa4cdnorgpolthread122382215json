Leftist like things they believe let them credulity (the quiet aqueseance of how false it truly is), anything within popular culture or indeed science is something they want to be apart of since they are themselves empty.

Instead they ignored it and the news eventually went away posing no threat to their thought bubble.<br><br>Like anything else leftism demonstrates itself as a religious movement first and foremost with basis in reality a painful afterthought. Science is not something they truly believe in but instead something that can be connected to their ideology to provide itself credulity as opposed to a self contained system of exploration and analysis.

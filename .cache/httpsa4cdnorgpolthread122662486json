You should be putting your money on Le Pen, literally, it&#039;s a great bet. Wait about a week for Macron&#039;s odds of winning to get even better.<br><br>This is the same exact situation as the US General Election. On one side you have the blatantly obvious globalist candidate (Macron\/Clinton). On the other side you have the &quot;populist&quot; candidate (Le Pen\/Trump). In reality, they are all Zionist cock suckers. No matter who wins, (((they))) win. <br><br>I may be overestimating the cuckedness of the French people, but in reality they are probably even more fed up with globalism than the US is, so they will vote Le Pen hoping for some sort of change. Macron is just more of the same ole&#039;, and that&#039;s only appealing to the most brainwashed of voters.<br><br>This is the kike&#039;s latest strategy. They&#039;ve got to keep the illusion of choice in the elections, even though there is none. The White Man has partially caught on and will no longer support obviously corrupt politicians. They&#039;ll take Le Pen at face value and believe she&#039;ll follow through on her campaign promises, just like the American people did with Trump. Little do they know, they&#039;re taking the bait and playing right into (((their))) trap.","filename":"1477885094641","ext":".jpg","w":917,"h":973,"tn_w":235,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493079563653,"time":1493079563,"md5":"FCr6dHg7\/dEUXSDSKIQDcw==","fsize":420411,"resto":0,"id":"S0qbAPbX","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-french-election-is-another-jewish-trick","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122663755,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)20:29:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122662486\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122662486<\/a><br>It was the same thing with Brexit too, I don&#039;t see their plan but I guess we will soon<br>I think they might be pushing nationalism so whem they throw is into another world war we&#039;ll be much more willing to fight for our nations","time":1493080155,"resto":122662486,"id":"2TydQ\/QU","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

Drumpf is literally the least popular candidate of all time.","filename":"1475967610856","ext":".jpg","w":1808,"h":1300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":179,"tim":1491170169570,"time":1491170169,"md5":"acYgyKLn+81i\/QozXVMv0g==","fsize":469904,"resto":0,"id":"bB6umb3O","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"drumpf-won","country_name":"United States","replies":15,"images":7,"unique_ips":14},{"no":119251540,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)17:57:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"I can&#039;t believe I voted for that conman","filename":"Shareblue-Sample-COPY-0-9","ext":".png","w":411,"h":600,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491170233729,"time":1491170233,"md5":"HLcRljldNIRoqr1js12sXw==","fsize":116038,"resto":119251429,"id":"2eb7lGCo","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119251600,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)17:57:40","name":"Sage","com":"Sage","time":1491170260,"resto":119251429,"id":"j\/mvOZhm","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":119251848,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)17:59:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;over SIX MILLION<\/span><br>OY VEY","filename":"merchant3","ext":".jpg","w":1130,"h":678,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1491170396590,"time":1491170396,"md5":"KtSegKryF8cbHbgZE8WsrQ==","fsize":60215,"resto":119251429,"id":"o7wcfVhR","country":"CL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Chile"},{"no":119251941,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:00:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119251429\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119251429<\/a><br>Into the trash it goes","time":1491170453,"resto":119251429,"id":"6nWtLEbB","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":119251950,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:00:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sage and best for the digits 837 SHAREBLUE u suck big penis","time":1491170458,"resto":119251429,"id":"NIDL4xu+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119252167,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:03:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"LePenis supports BTFO","filename":"FrenchDebate","ext":".jpg","w":856,"h":582,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":84,"tim":1491170591139,"time":1491170591,"md5":"W6oW2W2AjXCeVIfEDLpALA==","fsize":81015,"resto":119251429,"id":"bB6umb3O","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119252183,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:03:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119251429\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119251429<\/a><br>Sage","time":1491170599,"resto":119251429,"id":"pZE3v6Qq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119252558,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:06:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119252183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119252183<\/a><br>Sage","time":1491170808,"resto":119251429,"id":"bB6umb3O","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119253132,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:12:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119251429\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119251429<\/a><br><br>Drumpfkins living in fucking DENIAL. It&#039;s sad, really. They&#039;re just now coming to the realization that they&#039;re not going to repeal Obamacare, or get a wall, or an immigration ban. It&#039;s absolutely pathetic. They had the wool pulled so completely over their eyes by neocons, zionists, and RT, that they are still trying to rationalize a 50 billion dollar increase in defense spending, a limp-wristed effort to repeal the ACA, a pathetic attempt to halt immigration, and a one-cuck solution in Israel. We pay 10 million a week so that Melania can get away from her husband&#039;s tiny cock for a few months, a 50 billion a year so can compensate for it by trying to look like a big boy on the military. Big boy, more like good goy. Whenever he sees Netanyahu, he practically baseball slides at him with his mouth open. It&#039;s still hard to believe. A bunch of white supremacists voted in a guy who bred his own daughter to their mortal enemy. You got played like a puppet because you thought a draft-dodging rich guy living in a New York penthouse was actually some tough guy.

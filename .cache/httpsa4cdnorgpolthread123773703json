There is no such thing as gender when you combine it with the sexual will of an individual. Gender was, and still is the majority based on traditional sexual roles not the minority of defective sexual tendencies the human race. Providing semen has always been a male aspect. Having testosterone levels higher in your body is characteristic of being a man and thus, due to the nature of the hormone, create more male characteristics. If you presented me with two babies, one with the genitals of a male and one of a female, I can assure you that statistically the male will act more of a man. What they fail to realize is that statistics has the majority here. The left was indoctrined from the beginning to ignore statistics because of &quot;corrolation is not the same as causation&quot; which is widely accepted. However the original sentence only applied to certain scientific cases and shouldn&#039;t have been taken out of context to such things such as gender reclassification.","time":1493736680,"resto":123773703,"id":"5pFUySS\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123774791,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)10:52:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123774611\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123774611<\/a><br>What&#039;s the point of having two words with the same meaning?

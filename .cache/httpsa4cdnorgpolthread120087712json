We&#039;ve been living in fear since the 1950&#039;s because both the U.S. and former Soviet Union have enough nuclear weapons to destroy the entire planet several times over. Everybody knows the U.S. is a responsible nation. But we can&#039;t tolerate this third world shithole with an arsenal big enough to glass the entire globe push its weight around and threaten the existence of humanity. We have to eliminate them swiftly, so there&#039;s no chance for retaliation. A lot of Russians will die, and maybe some people in neighboring countries, but the entire world can breathe a sigh of relief knowing the threat of nuclear armageddon is over.","filename":"hydrogen_bomb","ext":".jpg","w":490,"h":392,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1491626625714,"time":1491626625,"md5":"J\/JV60+pyee5rjihKyx7GA==","fsize":30962,"resto":0,"id":"LVrR4Jv4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lets-nuke-russia","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

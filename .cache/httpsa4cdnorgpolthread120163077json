The change of ruling class, from the bourgeoisie to the proletariat, makes possible the full development of socialism. In early 20th century Russia, Lenin argued that the vanguard party would lead the revolution to depose the incumbent Tsarist government, and transfer government power to the working class. In the pamphlet What is to be Done? (1902), Lenin said that a revolutionary vanguard party, mostly recruited from the working class, should lead the political campaign, because it was the only way that the proletariat could successfully achieve a revolution; unlike the economist campaign of trade union struggle advocated by other socialist political parties and later by the anarcho-syndicalists. Like Karl Marx, Lenin distinguished between the two aspects of a revolution, the economic campaign (labour strikes for increased wages and work concessions), which featured diffused plural leadership; and the political campaign (socialist changes to society), which featured the decisive revolutionary leadership of the Bolshevik vanguard party.","filename":"56c25dd5053b3-lenin","ext":".jpg","w":350,"h":417,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491682068762,"time":1491682068,"md5":"4oytrUnozmzC6\/g5luLsaw==","fsize":22585,"resto":120163077,"id":"YQmSfQBt","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":120176150,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)16:09:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120163077\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120163077<\/a><br>OP what do you do for a living?

A communist system would thus free individuals from alienation in the sense of having one&#039;s life structured around survival (making a wage or salary in a capitalist system), which Marx referred to as a transition from the &quot;realm of necessity&quot; to the &quot;realm of freedom.&quot; As a result, a communist society is envisioned as being composed of an intellectually-inclined population with both the time and resources to pursue its creative hobbies and genuine interests, and to contribute to creative social wealth in this manner. Karl Marx considered &quot;true richness&quot; to be the amount of time one has at his or her disposal to pursue one&#039;s creative passions.

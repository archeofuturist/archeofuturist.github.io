They suck at Spanish, which is jammed on us here so we can tell Maria to llave las ropas, that&#039;s great. But since you and every other non-English speaker has already learned English, it is to my kids&#039; advantage to build expertise in subjects other than your language; in my household it has been math, and it makes me happy that both my kids are far more advanced in skill and application than I was at their age. Their income won&#039;t be elevated by speaking your language--you already do that and it&#039;s demonstrably not special; however, the world always needs more quants.","time":1490588538,"resto":118457124,"id":"CWUQcwdb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118471492,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:33:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118470396\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118470396<\/a><br>First of all, don&#039;t tell Maria to key the clothes. kek<br><br>Second, you&#039;re viewing the situation from a very American perspective.

Technology mirrors &#039;reality&#039; and technology imitates biology (and this is completely intentional).<br>The base state of all things is energetic wave-form information, which has been confirmed by quantum physics.

When you see a rose as being red, a bee sees that same rose in shades of ultra-violet and a bat perceives that same rose as vibrations of sound. It all depends on the way that the information is &#039;read&#039; (so to speak). We not only decode\/re-decode information with our senses into what we call &#039;people&#039;, &#039;places&#039; and &#039;things&#039;, but we can also ENCODE\/RE-ENCODE information with our senses into what we call &#039;people&#039;, &#039;places&#039; and &#039;things&#039; - this is the basis of meme magic.

The only thing that is necessary to rewrite DNA is wave information, which means that evolution can occur not through millions of years but instantaneously.<br><br>The agricultural division of the Ciba-Geigy corporation (now Sygenta) discovered that existing plant seeds could be transformed into extinct varieties, simply by zapping them with a weak electrostatic current. This process generated stronger and faster-growing wheat, extinct fern species, and tulips with thorns. Italian scientist Pier Luigi Ighina energetically transformed a living apricot tree into an apple tree, actually causing the fruits on the branches to metamorphose from apricots into apples in only sixteen days. Ighina also zapped a rat with DNA-wave information from a cat, and this caused the rat to grow a cat-like tail in four days.","time":1491832477,"resto":120428665,"id":"Qyow5jf5","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120440313,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)09:55:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120439823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120439823<\/a><br><br>Perhaps you&#039;re definition of God is whats flawed.

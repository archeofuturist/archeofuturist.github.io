Slowly, but unmistakably, I reoccupied my corpse with dreamlike consciousness: numb for the first merciful hours, blind, deaf, and immobile, but then I seemed to reconnect to every nerve, and became aware of every sensation - moreso than I ever was in life. I perceived myself trapped within an immovable object, and the intensity of the struggle amplified: subtle, then acute, then racking. I cannot describe it completely - but imagine holding your breath, beyond urge, beyond pain, beyond desperation - head throbbing and eyes bulging - a dream of suffocation without end.<br><br>&quot;My skin blistered and split in the sunlight; biting insects descended rapidly. I felt eggs hatch, larvae crawl, gases build and burst within me, individual cells rupturing, interstitial fluids souring and blackening. Somehow my capacity to experience and store these sensations grew - even as I was keenly aware of my cerebrum being scattered and devoured, my perception expanded, into the gizzards of birds and the depths of fire ant dens. I was aware of every fingernail and strand of hair that pulled away in the wind - and my sensation clung to them as they settled in the ocean and dissolved in the maws of a trillion diatoms.","time":1492291698,"resto":121260940,"id":"JESIXl5\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121264166,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)17:28:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121261169\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121261169<\/a><br><br>Oh fug","time":1492291711,"resto":121260940,"id":"CwNEAb+G","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121264170,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)17:28:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Afterlife must be really crowded with 17 billions years of dead stuff to fill it.","time":1492291714,"resto":121260940,"id":"iH0dpBeF","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":121264189,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)17:28:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"We go to Capitalist heaven.","time":1492291722,"resto":121260940,"id":"ZwRWsYWv","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":121264237,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)17:29:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121261884\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121261884<\/a><br>A man can dream :&#039;(<br><a href=\"#p121261915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121261915<\/a><br>Mum is gonna fuck my asshole dad again?","time":1492291744,"resto":121260940,"id":"gq6J1rVc","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":121264262,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)17:29:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121263799\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121263799<\/a><br>This","time":1492291756,"resto":121260940,"id":"gxjiAxWf","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":121264264,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)17:29:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"&quot;I don&#039;t understand it.

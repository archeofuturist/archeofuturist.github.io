It is time to jettison all such illusions and instead construct new communities and ways of living that amplify our power here, as students and collectives, until we can overrun these institutions themselves.<\/span>","filename":"4296da4245520ed5b03bbb51b354dbd4881f6edd","ext":".jpg","w":619,"h":710,"tn_w":217,"tn_h":249,"tim":1493686632572,"time":1493686632,"md5":"wV5Oj1qimvFufvBstAuuvg==","fsize":123349,"resto":0,"id":"yd5dMzy8","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"antifa-goes-full-domestic-terrorists","country_name":"Australia","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":123701646,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:58:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"It was a fucking dindu that did the stabbing.

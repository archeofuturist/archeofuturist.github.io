We absolutely did have a policy of suppressing them to make room for the white man, and it still works today so we haven&#039;t changed much. We made them move and split them up into groups, and give them an allowance, free tax money for being Native American. I think it&#039;s still supposed to be capitalized, at least. <br><br>If you&#039;re actually French you probably haven&#039;t had a chance to go on a reservation, but they&#039;re usually shitholes. They tend to live in trailers or manufactured homes, and they usually have broken cars on their lawn. They don&#039;t need to fix or sell their old cars because they&#039;re just getting another 18 grand or whatever next year. Living on the rez is usually free for them, and they can get an additional allowance for every kid, depending on the tribe.<br><br>Another thing, there isn&#039;t really a &quot;Native American community&quot; the way there is an African American community. The tribes don&#039;t really team up, and they&#039;re each concerned with preserving their own dying language and customs. We hit them with apathy, hard. Which, by the way, I&#039;m ok with. They hadn&#039;t even invented the wheel by the time whitey got there, let alone metallurgy. Literally Stone Age culture, preserved until a couple hundred years ago. Look that up, by the way, they get real defensive when you say they didn&#039;t invent the wheel, and point out some ancient Mayan toys with wheels and imply it wasn&#039;t important enough for anything but toys.","time":1490265116,"resto":117914589,"id":"tH\/bezQJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117917234,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)06:37:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"Woe to the conquered.","time":1490265436,"resto":117914589,"id":"9yJS1ox+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117918152,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)06:50:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117916855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117916855<\/a><br>You&#039;re right actually, I&#039;ve never even seen a native American...

The tech gap was too large. Europeans would destroy the natives without even trying through disease and simply out competing them. The hierarchies, the technology involved, the methods those technologies were employed with. All of it just makes the Europeans a better organism as a whole than the various native american societies. The ones that did arguably the best early on where in the North East because they had settlements and actually teamed up and such, but a lot of it was too little, too late. Also, trying to frame this as an &#039;immigrant&#039; problem and being cute is looking at it the wrong way. The Europeans were essentially an invading force, and power does what it will. They expanded to the limits of their capabilities because they could.<br><br>Something to think about with how Native Americans were. The iconic representation of them is the Great Plains Indian, riding on horseback and being nomadic and all romantic and shit. But, its worth recognizing, that wasn&#039;t some ancient lifestyle Europe ruined. That was a new lifestyle Europe created. Horses are an old world animal. That lifestyle existed for a few hundred years after Europeans arrived and most of the tribes, like the Apache, were basically just assholes. They&#039;d use their horses, bows and whatever guns they had to push out all the other native groups while the Europeans were farther east.","time":1490271938,"resto":117914589,"id":"wshKwRur","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117925075,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)08:26:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117924193\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117924193<\/a><br>What you always needs to remember is that anyone can write their history, there are no clear villains or heroes, only winners and losers, even someone who spend their life researching a single juridic case might still be wrong because absence of evidence.<br>If they can turn the Bastille invasion into a paragon for the freedom of the west, just imagine what they can do to prove their point that the natives were dindus.<br>Just for the sake of an objetive point of view, here in brazil, natives have a fuckton of priviledges, more than niggers.<br>Do you know what they do?

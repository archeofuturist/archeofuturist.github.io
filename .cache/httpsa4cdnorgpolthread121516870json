You don&#039;t have to be operation paperclip rocket scientist to realize that those concentration camps were some sort of social experiments in multiculturalism weapons of mass destruction. I speculate most of the people died in those camps due to various trolley problems and variation of game theories. Think of TV show survivor, musical chairs games, etc.. where inmates had to compete for scarce resources while forming alliances, cooperatives, etc.. Outwit, Outlast, Outplay... So all this show was watched closely by some sort of entities (holocaust survivors) designing next generation &quot;open society&quot;.","time":1492431100,"resto":121516870,"id":"mltXvUaW","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":121518988,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:17:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121518485\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121518485<\/a><br>uwotm8","time":1492431460,"resto":121516870,"id":"HhbR6le1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121519724,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:26:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121518988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121518988<\/a><br>just think about those concentration camps. they were supposed to be paradises of multiculturalism. everyone from all countries living and respecting each other like they are equal. no crime, no war, no disease, everything taken care for you, everything included, just like those turkish resorts. See the photos of inmates during liberation of those camps. How come many of those inmates do not look like they are in bad shape. They look like as if it was a walk in a park. So entire explanation for nazi concentration camps is as stupid as the explanation for 9\/11.","time":1492432013,"resto":121516870,"id":"mltXvUaW","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"}]}

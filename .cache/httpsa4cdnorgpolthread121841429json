National-Socialism was fundamentally negative, and thus it could not produce meaning, only deny meaning to other things ; hence the mediocrity of 1936-1945 Germany&#039;s cultural production. National-Socialism was anorganic, ahistorical, nothing more than chance. It had no deeper meaning than its brief existence ; and its work was negative : a negation of life and historical struggle. Their goal was to stop history, to make a &quot;thousand-year Reich&quot;, --- to stay forever stuck in the ahistorical time of the fantasy, of the myth. Hitler was a Ludwig II with power. Look at his counselors, his cabinet ; degenerates, weaklings, ex-communists (Goebbels) ; look at the SA : literally, the rabble wearing the same shirt ; the whole of National-Socialism meant nothing, stood for nothing. They were the exact opposite of everything Nietzsche describe as a superior form of human existence ; plebeians in culture, plebeians in politics and plebeians in design. You should read Spengler. The Nazis couldn&#039;t stand the fact that Germany&#039;s attempts to make itself culturally relevant through military actions had failed, from 1870 to 1918 ; and they thought that its problems, which had to do with the exhaustion, not only of Germany, but of the West in general, had to be someone else&#039;s fault, and could be fixed by getting rid of that someone and uniting the Germans under a single rule. Of course, it failed. Burckhardt had already shown how the State could not produce anything, culturally ; and Nietzsche quickly understood this ; and so did Spengler, while considering the State as the ultimate cultural production which ended cultural production. The Nazis were typical leftists, in thinking they could solve deeper, fundamental human problems, through the State.","time":1492559274,"resto":121841429,"country":"XX","country_name":"Unknown"},{"no":121841452,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)19:52:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121841449\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121841449<\/a><br>I dont believe that.<br><br>While we may not have enjoyed the post-modern art movement and general cultural progressiveness and all the good things it has brought us, the Germans had something else in mind entirely not necessarily of less worth.

And it would have led to violent revolts, widespread public unrest and traction of human rights proponents. <br><br>Hitler used the bitterness of the German public as a tool to shoehorn his ideals and create scapegoats for the country&#039;s widespread troubles. Once those troubles are gone, the usefulness of his ideals would without a doubt loss all merit.

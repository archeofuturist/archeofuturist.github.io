I&#039;ve practiced law for a little while now and haven&#039;t heard of I-10? I can&#039;t find it in on the IRS website and they list all of their forms on there. Additionally, statutory provisions may prevent the commissioner and IRS from enforcing promulgated regulations that seek to deny a Federal refund. Moreover, a state need not comply with such a promulgation regarding state taxes. For instance, a state can normally choose whether to withhold your refund for the IRS when you owe funds to the IRS, but expect a refund in your taxes from the state. Finally, all this would likely do is create an environment wherein illegals don&#039;t pay taxes anymore, and other individuals that are legally in this country may follow suit. With that said, many of those (internationally exempt scholars and workers that are exempted by treaty) are home by the time an audit finds the abnormalities, which means our jurisdiction to do anything is non-existent. I think a better idea would be to revamp the tax system altogether and create consumption taxes because you just can&#039;t dodge those as easily.","time":1493069808,"resto":122636333,"id":"T4\/raXBm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122641799,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)17:36:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122641385\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122641385<\/a><br>Fine<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=UNe<wbr>VJDWIVvE","filename":"1489544198692","ext":".gif","w":342,"h":342,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493069815119,"time":1493069815,"md5":"cA4BuHIFX2AM8Vq7c4a+Eg==","fsize":446784,"resto":122636333,"id":"b\/MiEnR6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122641824,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)17:37:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122640954\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122640954<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122641302\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122641302<\/a><br><br>Maddow is the new king of cable news.

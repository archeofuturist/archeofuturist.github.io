Since the online privacy protections were voted in by the FCC in 2016, ISPs and their lobbying organizations have been donating and posturing hard to dismantle Internet privacy and bring us to this vote. The CTIA, a telecom lobbying organization, even went so far as to submit a filing claiming that web browsing history and app data usage shouldn\u2019t be considered as \u201csensitive information.\u201d This appears to be the true sentiment about your online privacy \u2013 that it isn\u2019t private and isn\u2019t sensitive and therefore deserves no protections.","filename":"85192_tumb_750Xauto","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":496,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1490793602434,"time":1490793602,"md5":"vJ8mZwJpp+z0jXzgUxQ9gQ==","fsize":34744,"resto":0,"id":"rU2ujNjn","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"house-of-representatives-votes-232184-to-do-away","country_name":"Israel","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

You must be successful, reliable, hardworking, and, above all, happy. Do people in your life trust and respect you? What does your family think of you? Racial politics doesn\u2019t have to be the only factor of that. If you can\u2019t achieve these things in your real life, then you are not ready to be a political activist, either anonymously or in reality.<br><br>Always remember: we live in first world countries and have opportunity that most people born on this planet don\u2019t. So work your ass off, every day, to build a good life for yourself. How can you help others when you can\u2019t help yourself? Spend your time wisely, and keep your real life priorities in order. Nothing on the internet should ever take away from your real life.","filename":"alexapearl","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491194819513,"time":1491194819,"md5":"qAqIZHlqQlPQ6Ku4Y7R\/7A==","fsize":107780,"resto":0,"id":"cMbSp7vw","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-most-important-thing-you-can-do-for-the-white","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":119293274,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:03:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"based anon","time":1491195810,"resto":119291849,"id":"hlHuGC8F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119294191,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:14:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119291849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119291849<\/a><br>Def based advice ... Kinda took it for granted as common knowledge but for those didn&#039;t know it, fuckin pay attention. Your useless to everything you should be proud of if you can&#039;t grasp your own duty to excellence. Be masterful in everything you apply yourself too and follow through, ie find a way to push through the bullshit in your way. Be the strength you know the world needs, the fearlessness, and the Constitution. The world&#039;s opinion of you shouldn&#039;t matter, as you can never truly know it or it&#039;s ethos. However, your opinion of yourself needs to be as strict as you could imagine righteousness to be and in doing so holding yourself to a higher standard than other men can provide. Defeat the self, the ego, and stand above mankind too lead it. There is no better judge for you than yourself.","time":1491196494,"resto":119291849,"id":"aBXJezjb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119294367,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:17:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"become worthy; accept power; rule","time":1491196622,"resto":119291849,"id":"aonCwhFI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119294389,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:17:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119291849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119291849<\/a><br><br>Fuck you commie.<br><br>Play videos, recognize women as evil, and only spill your seed to your anime waifu.","filename":"Pf17","ext":".jpg","w":234,"h":250,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491196639446,"time":1491196639,"md5":"PrZIo7fn99Jzz1DSNrlmUA==","fsize":21796,"resto":119291849,"id":"X3UDO+Xe","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119294717,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)01:20:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119291849\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119291849<\/a><br>Faggot, some of us dont aspire to do shit except maybe incite som chaos unto the world and shitpost about it.

Smile and dance and sing to it. (We all do). <br>Withhold your power level at all times. If people are meant to get red pilled, they will, just like Neo. <br>Limit internets &amp; vidya to 2~3 hrs daily, if that.<br>No tv, no radio, delete social media.<br>Be social on a regular basis, it&#039;s good for you. Play team sport, do martial art, learn to dance etc (good for girls!) just something you ENJOY<br>Save money, stop spending on shit. Either invest it or pay for cool experiences you will never forget eg travel, course for a cool new skill, equipment for a rad interesting hobby etc<br><br>Basically, replace all your shit habits with good ones, one at a time. Take control of your life, one area at a time, starting with yourself.

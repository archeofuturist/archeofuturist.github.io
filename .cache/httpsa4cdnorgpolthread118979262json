Most of the Church believes, that a race determines certain factors in culture from since the times of the tower of babel. So, a form of spiritual determinism, but say the spirit is one of it&#039;s own right, as an individual...So now we get into what is the actual condition, of the common gay? Both sides say one thing, and do the other, so in this contradictory mindset I think we really need to assess our own truths when it comes to what a gay or a minority actually is? Because if we are going to assess them based on genetics, we deny what makes them more then just their genes, and if we assess them purely on choice, and experiences, we deny the genes role in the choices they make. I believe, this is the core issue on why I can&#039;t really decide if all of this liberal brainwashed protesting actually means anything, or is simply a reincarnation of the church. You can deny we are in a current hypocritical state with these issues, but the facts are the facts: both doctrines IMPOSE strongly, that race and genes are a factor in how one lives, yet we fight what our own ideologies persist! If you ask me, if you&#039;re not mentally our physically challenged, then your choices are your own, and if it was a traumatic event that decided for you, then you admit that and I don&#039;t blame you. But This gene\/race thing... is why we won&#039;t be able to properly debate the homosexual agenda that has gone off the rails propagating it&#039;s delusional script of &#039;equality&#039; because we can&#039;t properly assess what the body, and the soul have to do with the decisions we make.

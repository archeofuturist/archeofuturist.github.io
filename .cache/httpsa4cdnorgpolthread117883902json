Funny how we have privatized healthcare, and our government still spends more on healthcare than every other single payer government in the world. The facts are stunning. Now lets look at private expenditures such as premiums, copays, etc... The US pays 5x more than the next country, which is Canada. Interesting, I thought private companies were more efficient than government? That doesn&#039;t sound efficient to me. We pay the most, and receive the worst care. Does privatization still sound like a good idea guys?","filename":"1490150922385","ext":".png","w":960,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490241662477,"time":1490241662,"md5":"ucs2OS4NfWKum+xzCZlINg==","fsize":61435,"resto":0,"id":"TYLVbOpV","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"usa-healthcare-btfo","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Whatever profits were made from it we&#039;re lost during the civil war and reconstruction. There are no current people with wealth from slave labor. Most of the profit from it was made by blacks in Africa selling slaves, and the merchants that shipped them, who were 80% Jewish. So go bother them for reparations if your going to bother anyone.","time":1493853618,"resto":123981055,"id":"K2x8eYw9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123982606,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)19:23:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123981055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123981055<\/a><br><br>i&#039;m just a fucking leaf and my country granted safe harbor to escaped slaves. go hit up some old, wealthy southern families for reparations.","time":1493853800,"resto":123981055,"id":"VAnnSWJk","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123983038,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)19:26:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123981055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123981055<\/a><br>If I may suggest a relevant topic of discussion: what is the &quot;purpose&quot; of the idea of &quot;owing&quot; someone back? what overall thing does it accomplish, when applied to certain circumstances?<br><br>In my opinion, saying someone &quot;owes&quot; something for a thing that they did not do, goes against the purpose of the idea of owing. The whole societal usefulness of that idea is so people who were good, productive, and owned things, and someone bad took them, the good person &quot;deserves&quot; them back, because they earned them. This is not true for the descendants of slaves because they did not do the work, so it has no meaning or purpose to consider them &quot;worthy of being owed&quot; something in return.<br><br>Also, in particular, I think that giving reparations to the current bunch of self-righteous cunts, who never suffered nor worked as slaves, and calling the actual slaves&#039; debts paid off, when they really don&#039;t have any right to say that themselves, is some serious insult to injury in a sense.","time":1493854003,"resto":123981055,"id":"qr7In10K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123984137,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)19:34:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123981055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123981055<\/a><br>Blacks were not the only people ever to be slaves. &quot;Slave&quot; come from &quot;slav,&quot; as in the Slavic (white) people enslaved on the Barbary Coast in Africa.

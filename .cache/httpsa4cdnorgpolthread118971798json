The fire you may be thinking of was the explosion from the alleged plane impact. After that, just black smoke, indicative of an oxygen-starved smoulder. You can see people standing at the gaping hole and waving for help, meaning it can&#039;t have been very hot. You also have witness testimony of people who managed to survive and escape from above the impact point. The BBC carefully edits the video so you have to find the raw footage, but one man says it wasn&#039;t raging or hot, he just saw a few gentle licks of flame.<br><br>2. The alleged plane impact is VERY unlikely to have brought the buildings down. Find a metal bollard and run into it as fast as you can. You&#039;re heavier and bigger than the bollard and you ran into it at speed - who will come away worse, you or the bollard? A hollow aluminium plane will not do much to a steel and concrete building no matter how fast it&#039;s going (the law of equal and opposite reaction means the speed is irrelavant anyway). Besides, the design of the buildings, with its web of thick beams, means, as one architect said, the plane was just like pushing a pencil through a screen door.<br><br>3. Even if the alleged planes could cause some structural failure, a symmetrical, rapid collapse into DUST would not have happened. Again, due to equal and opposite reactions, the top section of the building could only detroy roughly half of its length below it (discounting the fact the building got lighter further up). Besides, if you look at the footage, the section above the alleged crash is turned to dust before the rest of the building. So what is turning the rest into dust if not the weight of the material above?","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":467,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490917553991,"time":1490917553,"md5":"SjIksz4Qdb4sWBDRlNblaQ==","fsize":9411,"resto":118971798,"id":"CxbCtfjq","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118989038,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)19:49:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118971798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118971798<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is there any tragedy you fags don&#039;t think was staged<\/span><br><br>Trump&#039;s presidential win.","time":1490917773,"resto":118971798,"id":"5q\/vQRN8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118989313,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)19:51:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118987717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118987717<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;WTC 7<\/span><br>The force of the debris landing on it. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pentagon plane<\/span><br>Were we supposed to a intact chasis or was that a high impact could crash? <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Miraculous maneuver<\/span><br>You mean the Fourth plane?

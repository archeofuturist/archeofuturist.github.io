While this idea may seem far fetched, it may be just around the corner.<br><br>But let&#039;s review the current factors for the initial two sides who would be fighting each other. <br><br>The Radical Left<br><br>Cons<br>Very few on the left are armed, or even care to be.<br>Most on the left have had little to no training in combat whatsoever.<br>Most of the left live in dense city&#039;s, susceptible to several classes of different warfare.<br>Most of the left are ignorant geologically, even of their neighboring states.<br><br>Pros<br>The Left has Islam. A new big brother if you will. <br>The left could potentially receive arms from our government or other foreign entities. <br>The Righteous Right<br><br>Cons<br>Most of our rural brothers are spread out. Organization on a short notice could prove to be costly.<br><br>Pros<br>Over ninety million rust belters are armed with more than one firearm in their homes.<br>The right has a plethora of armed militias across the country that are trained and ready to fight for old America. Some of these militias are huge private communities armed to the teeth.<br>Most of the right have veterans of war on their side, ready to relinquish their knowledge and combat skills if ever needed.<br>Most of the right live in rural areas, which could prove to be devastating if the Left decided to attack first. Gorilla warfare is no joke. <br>Most of the right are also in the military as of right now. Whether they&#039;d choose sides isn&#039;t clear, but there&#039;s always that possibility. <br>With the most obvious pros and cons in place, it&#039;s quite obvious who might come out on top. <br>But the left has an edge, and that could very well be government intervention or foreign aid. But without those, they would be decimated and brought to bend the knee.","filename":"IMG_0050","ext":".png","w":2525,"h":1578,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1490659483632,"time":1490659483,"md5":"Rzk+m0epRqVVwS0uf+egZA==","fsize":2020247,"resto":0,"id":"hJYt2MDD","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-american-civil-war-ii-who-would-win","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118583445,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:09:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118582887\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118582887<\/a><br>*breaks hoover dam<br>California dies of starvation<br><br>*breaks down NY bridges and tunnels<br>NY dies of starvation<br><br>That leaves chicongo, detroit, and miami.","time":1490659761,"resto":118582887,"id":"rRvn0hU3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118583545,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:10:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118582887\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118582887<\/a><br>The left has also been blackmailing conservatives into joining\/Supporting their cause","time":1490659810,"resto":118582887,"id":"0KzpUt30","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118583740,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)20:11:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118583545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118583545<\/a><br>That is futile.

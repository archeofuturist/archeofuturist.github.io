Koonin said the NCA\u2019s assessment was technically incorrect.<br><br>Koonin is not the only one claiming wrongdoing. House lawmakers with the Committee on Science, Space and Technology, for instance, recently jumpstarted an investigation into NOAA after a whistleblower said agency scientists rushed a landmark global warming study to influence policymakers.<br><br>Koonin, who served under Obama from 2009 to 2011, went on to lament the politicization of science suggested that the ethos should be to \u201ctell it like it is.

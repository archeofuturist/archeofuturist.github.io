That in of itself is bad for the US because we love to vacation in Europe and they are our one of our biggest trading partners, but you have to see the larger game. <br>Russia invaded Georgia in &#039;08 and the Ukraine in &#039;14 solely for personal gain, both were annexed. This would be the equivalent of the US invading Mexico and making it the 51st state. Cuck Obama was too weak to do anything about it so he just declared sanctions against Russia and hoped it would sort itself out. Of course it didn&#039;t and Russia has been increasingly aggressive and belligerent. <br>There has been relative peace since the end of the Cold War and many people are angry to see Russia breaking that peace. One could argue that the US is similarly responsible after the invasion of Iraq in &#039;04. That was a mistake, but it was a much smaller scale and we did not annex them, we gave the government back to the people and let them elect their own leaders. However Russia is quickly becoming a threat to worldwide stability and peace.","time":1491897734,"resto":120571498,"id":"8eCocPWi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120571972,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)04:02:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120571616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120571616<\/a><br>10\/10 glorious","time":1491897742,"resto":120571498,"id":"T5tSTQhF","country":"KP","country_name":"North Korea"},{"no":120571989,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)04:02:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;but its muh 5d checkers<\/span>","filename":"1491879185256","ext":".jpg","w":410,"h":516,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491897755518,"time":1491897755,"md5":"0HiNsk+tuuMQtS\/DGO+V9g==","fsize":55817,"resto":120571498,"id":"M25DPK2x","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120572003,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)04:02:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120571972\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120571972<\/a><br>Hey Kim, welcome to \/ptg\/.","time":1491897775,"resto":120571498,"id":"QKGxi3Ih","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120572005,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)04:02:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"Reminder that Aku did nothing wrong","filename":"Aku","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":1165,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491897777961,"time":1491897777,"md5":"1GGNeNoqfIguAPqz6umJGQ==","fsize":221513,"resto":120571498,"id":"8ZyxzVOF","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120572033,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)04:03:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120571969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120571969<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;both were annexed<\/span><br><br>??","time":1491897806,"resto":120571498,"id":"AzXMrvGe","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120572037,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)04:03:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 50 posts by this ID<\/span>","time":1491897808,"resto":120571498,"id":"h2L5LJoJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120572039,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)04:03:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120571813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120571813<\/a><br>Easy-flowing oil is in everyone&#039;s interest.

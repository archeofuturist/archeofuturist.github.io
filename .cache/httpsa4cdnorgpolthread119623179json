We met in this pub with a very greencuck audience and drank a few beer, of course someone brought up the, then recent election, I really tried to just say nothing, but they just wouldn&#039;t stop. It got so bad it felt like they were reading \/pol\/ greentext stories, but I tried being strong for my friend, who looked at me from across the table and shook is head slightly, he probably had a feeling that I was about to blow. The room was saturated with smug farts and they all sniffed them eagerly, then the hipster girl my friend tried to impress, in vain btw, asked me, what I think about this whole dumb election thingy. Everyone looked at me, I started to grin slightly as dread formed in my friends face, &quot;WELL&quot;, I said, &quot;you see Hipster-girl, I am pretty sad about all of it, tbqh, since I voted Hofer&quot;. First they thought I was joking, then they got angry and then insanely mad. I was smiling through all of it.

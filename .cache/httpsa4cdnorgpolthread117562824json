Floyd ducked Pacquiao for 6 years until he saw a weakness. In 2015, no rational person was expecting Pac to win. If Floyd fights Pac in his prime in 2009 (as was the original plan), that fight could&#039;ve gone very differently. The fact remains that Floyd spent the last 6-7 years of his career fighting inferior opponents that didn&#039;t really have any business being in the ring with any top tier talent to begin with.<br><br>As far as McGregor is concerned, the guy is a loudmouth. However, unlike Floyd, he has put his money where his mouth is and has fought anyone and everyone who has ever wanted a piece.

Let&#039;s make it socially unacceptable for people to acknowledge biology. We&#039;re going to push this transgender crap on culture and ruin the lives of anyone who tries to go against it. We&#039;ll brand them as bigoted\/privileged\/etc.&quot;<br><br>We are well past the point now where liberals have made it socially unacceptable to support the existence and sovereignty of a nation. This is why anyone who is against illegal immigration is now deemed racist by polite society.<br><br>Mark my words. A few years from now, liberals will try to make it socially unacceptable (for white people, at least) to breathe oxygen, or drink water.<br><br>&quot;If you drink water, you are a privileged racist scumbag yadayadayada. It&#039;s current year! What&#039;s wrong with you!&quot;<br><br>Just recently, Oxford told their students that if you don&#039;t look at someone in the eye, that makes you a racist.

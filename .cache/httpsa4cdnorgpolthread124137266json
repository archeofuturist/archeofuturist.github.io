An economic collapse will cause this.<br><br>I don&#039;t think it&#039;s right for such a way for the western world but it is a symptom. Nietsche said that God is dead and he is still dead. Now people believe in money and that&#039;s observed everywhere.Economic stability and societal changes cause this. It happened to Rome aswell.You should read about it&#039;s society prior to it&#039;s fall and you&#039;ll notice similarities.","time":1493947430,"resto":124137266,"id":"Yek5dcFO","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":124144051,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:26:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124143307\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124143307<\/a><br>I understand that changes need to start from within and myself, but how does one change the world without a chance?

He never formulated any overarching theory of everything-- he actually disliked people who tried to do that. What you wrote is a vast oversimplification.<br><br>He definitely wasn&#039;t some sociopathic &quot;might makes right&quot; apologist for tyranny like what you wrote makes it seem. The parts you&#039;re paraphrasing were actually a critique of BOTH forms of morality. Master morality is simply immoral, while slave morality was built to glorify what the slave-type people would have done anyway.<br><br>What Nietzsche said is that people needed to advance to a point, through meditation and learning, where they could formulate their own morality, to discern their own reasons for doing things and their own motivations. Society, with the industrial revolution brought about by the scientific method basically put an end to the ability of even slightly higher-than-average intellects to derive any kind of meaning from the old stories. Basically, people needed to advance to the point where they could see God on their own.<br><br>The ubermensch wasn&#039;t a sociopath who did what he wanted. The ubermensch was someone who was good because they had learned enough to realize why they SHOULD be good.","time":1493947667,"resto":124137266,"id":"ZzVpJnOj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

By far my favourite philosopher<br><br>According to Nietzsche we, in Western society, live by Slave Morality This has been inculcated in our collective psyche by Christianity. Christianity, out of power in Roman times, in order to save face, tried to fit a morality which fit their circumstances. Enslaved by the Rome, they said to be moral was to be submissive, to be lacking power. Because they had nothing, they said morality was to shun material goods and greed. Because they had to be nice to their guards or get their asses kicked, they said to be moral was to be altruistic. It was a morality of convenience, like when a fat chick says &#039;no....guys actually like thicc gurls!&#039;<br><br>Nietzsche advocates going back to Master morality of the Romans, valuing courage, strength, ascension, power of will, and domination. <br><br>Now, how does this Master morality play into our everyday lives? We need to apply the Master morality into becoming an Ubermensch, or Superman. <br><br>According to Nietzsche, Slave Morality has stunted human progression. To attain greatness, and achieve the next level of humanity, you must struggle. Only through endurance, fighting, personal sacrifice and willfulness can you raise yourself up. But Slave Morality holds everyone down. Think the welfare state and gibs taking away the working man&#039;s money via income tax. This doesn&#039;t mean to be unkind....Nietzsche said his ubermensch would be kind, someone to be looked up to by everyone in the community. But NO CODDLING ALLOWED<br><br>The final measure of the good ubermensch life is this: If you are truly bettering yourself everyday...if you are truly fighting the good fight and attaining greatest, you will have no problem with Eternal Recurrence. If your life was an infinite loop and you lived every moment infinite times (including reading this), if you were living the ubermensch way you would have absolutely no problem living it infinity times.

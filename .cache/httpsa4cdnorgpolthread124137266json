They are good because they are not masters (according to them) and masters should be done away with all together because they&#039;re immoral. Ya see the relevance here? They don&#039;t want to become Masters themselves, they want the Masters to become Slaves. <br><br>Nietzsche saw this slave morality as being rooted heavily with Judaism, and then Christianity and then Islam, when Masters are done away with, the Books will be our Master type thing.","time":1493944692,"resto":124137266,"id":"LhEBW8Q6","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124138499,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)20:40:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124138298\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124138298<\/a><br>okay that makes sense and I can understand that.

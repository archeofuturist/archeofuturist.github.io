Your countless allies, who easily outweigh all of the hostile rouge states of the planet Earth, combined, don&#039;t even come close second (!). <br> <br>They will certainly be able to protect the American citizens from any other threatening nations, terrorists or criminal. <br>There is no one that you need to control or intimidate with a weapon. And you obviously shouldn&#039;t. <br>Hopefully, America will finally pass common sense gun control laws. <br> <br>Supporters of the 2nd amendment (often dangerous, extremely authoritarian, racist, fascist sympathisers) and it&#039;s traditions continue to say it is necessary because we need to defend ourselves from the government. <br> <br>Granted, if the government becomes tyrannical it is the people\u2019s duty to take it back. <br>But, this was not the case for King George\u2019s governance. The extremely rushed US Constitution did not give more freedom to the people of the Thirteen Colonies. Events such as the Whiskey Rebellion explicitly show that. <br> <br>Fortunately, today Americans do not need to fear the tyrannical rule of kings. The days of strong European monarchies are long gone. <br>In fact, the West has governments on the complete opposite side of the political spectrum as a peaceful, unbiased, and, free democracies . <br> <br>Besides, even if you were to attempt to attack the government out of bigotry and hate for women, LGBTQ+, POCs, you would have no success. <br><br>Your shitty &quot;tacticool&quot; bling bling AR is peanuts when your when fighting F35&#039;s\/Strykers\/nukes\/UAVs\/a better equipped and trained person\/M1s\/M2 Bradleys\/M270s\/the entire US military. <br><br>The founding fathers certainly did not anticipate the types of weaponry accessible today. American society has evolved since the eighteenth century and it is time their gun laws reflected it.","filename":"711596.0.guns4","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493041647456,"time":1493041647,"md5":"dhLFWUCPTpdWxKqhmHNJmA==","fsize":38300,"resto":0,"id":"odbWXY6K","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"if-youre-an-american-you-can-live-today-without","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":16,"images":1,"unique_ips":12},{"no":122587466,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)09:50:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122587157\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122587157<\/a><br>&quot;HEH, HEH, GOY, YOU DON&#039;T NEED GUNS. *RUBS HANDS* YOU FILTHY GOYS GIVE UP YOUR WEAPONS...HEH, I MEAN EH, YEAH I MEAN RACISTS ONLY WANT GUNS, HEH, YOU DON&#039;T WANT PEOPLE TO THINK YOU HAVE A SMALL PENIS HEHEHEE, EUROFAGS ARE SO MUCH BETTER GOY, BE LIKE THEM, ALSO GIVE MORE SHEKELS TO ISRAEL NUMBER ONE ALLIE, WE ARE GODS CHOSEN PEOPLE GOY&quot;","filename":"1487393932387","ext":".jpg","w":854,"h":1280,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493041853325,"time":1493041853,"md5":"AlyCyWqxK9RWAPK6Ealkng==","fsize":688342,"resto":122587157,"id":"0yH+tCaS","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122587506,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)09:51:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122587157\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122587157<\/a><br>I will give up my guns once everyone else does.

I would hope you fucks wouldn&#039;t fall for it anyway. What I do have is common sense, though.<br><br><br>Founder&#039;s Day is coming up on the 15th. For those of you that don&#039;t know, it&#039;s the most important holiday in NK. Every year on Founder&#039;s Day, one of the traditions is to test fire their most advanced rockets.<br><br><br>We&#039;re not going to let that happen this year.<br><br><br>We are giving them an ultimatum. Stop your research in to ICBMs or we will stop it for you. Our fleet is staging to shoot down any rockets launched on Founder&#039;s Day. If they decide to launch anyway, we shoot them down and China moves in. This is our final warning to Kimmy boy. Roll over like a good dog and do what you&#039;re told, or you will be deposed.<br>WWIII isn&#039;t coming. Not through NK. Regime change is. The TPP didn&#039;t pass. China wants to break in to the Western Market. The only way they can do that is if we play nice. We will play nice, if they fix the Korea problem.<br><br>April 15th. Mark it. Screen shot it. Whatever you want. April 15th is zero hour. Unless something changes drastically between now and then, that is when we know the fate of the Eastern world.","filename":"1491875630447","ext":".jpg","w":368,"h":525,"tn_w":175,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491938188076,"time":1491938188,"md5":"eIfbc1TDgnmmvDkCf4Iguw==","fsize":36611,"resto":0,"id":"3oJwg1eq","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lets-talk-about-north-korea","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":120642690,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)15:32:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120640053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120640053<\/a><br>Bump","time":1491939158,"resto":120640053,"id":"3oJwg1eq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

The target of said missiles, rather than Assad&#039;s headquarters, was an air base supposedly responsible for the recent chemical attack. We are the United State of America.

Unlike in Iraq and Afghanistan, the US will seek aid from neighboring states, such as Jordan, who have interest in Syria stabilizing, and not falling to terrorists.

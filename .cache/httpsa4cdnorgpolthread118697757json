It includes education in basic economics and the core tenets of libertarianism plus a short summary of the history of the libertarian movement. That&#039;s where you find how libertarianism since its inception never really wanted to affect political change through the established political channels but rather by &quot;direct action&quot;, so to speak (because direct action is actually a concept used by leftist anarchists, though it applies really well to agorism). Historically, it is the libertarian party that actually fucked the whole movement and turned it into something political (top to bottom) instead of social (bottom to top).

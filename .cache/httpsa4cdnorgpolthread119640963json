I&#039;m in uni right now and I am taking a sociology course for one of my GE classes. We&#039;re going to talk about the wage gap next class and I want to be prepared for this with actual statistics. I know, for example, that women work less than men which means that they get paid less. However, are there any other factors that affect the difference in pay? And what sources did you use to justify that the wage gap doesn&#039;t exist? Thanks in advance.","filename":"CleanUpTrump","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491418936901,"time":1491418936,"md5":"hp53R9mQ7irCGZ0P9QNmzw==","fsize":104506,"resto":0,"id":"\/gHUYmYq","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wage-gap","country_name":"United States","replies":19,"images":4,"unique_ips":11},{"no":119641335,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:05:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s an earnings gap. Women, on average, are more likely to be stay-at-home moms. All the top paying fields in society, like rocket engineers and STEM fields like it, are heavily dominated by men.

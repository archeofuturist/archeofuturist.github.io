For some convoluted reason a teenager is the only one who can pilot a super-mega-awesome-gigantor-robot. We&#039;ve seen it before -- it allows the target shounen audience to have characters they can identify (i.e. lazy kid) get to play the hero instead of someone more realistic -- say a 30-year-old ace captain with years of conflict experience and (more importantly) some emotional maturity.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the person responsible for this travesty of philosophic trite had a bad batch of depression, and it shows. Anytime sci-fi has to double back to religious fantasy, it fails. I &quot;got&quot; the story but I hated it. Around this time the series shifts to adult themes over shounen, which is kinda cool. But since everyone was afraid of losing their jobs at the time (per Wikipedia &quot;but also partly because by this point, production had begun running out of funding and failing to meet the schedule; this collapse has been identified by at least one Gainax employee as the impetus for Evangelion&#039;s turn into metafiction...&quot;) they decide to spew out a bunch of woe-is-me-the-world-sucks garbage. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In a world where most media tries to have characters who are endearing, complex, realistic or some combination thereof, Evangelion makes the bold decision of having characters who are none of those things. These are characters who are all of a quarter-dimensional.You see, Anno adds depth by giving virtually every character severe parent issues.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The characters brought nothing to the series. The main character Shinji has to be one of the worst if not the worst anime character ever. He had no depth, emotion, and didn&#039;t try me in. He was just annyoing, and I wanted him to die almost from the beginning, the same with most of the other ones. I can&#039;t think of on character I actually liked.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The animation done by GAINAX is terrible it looks like something done by in the 60s or 70s. Hell I think Speed Racer looks better than this series.<\/span>","filename":"1468707773344","ext":".gif","w":300,"h":313,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490329595763,"time":1490329595,"md5":"nNDhZVrgrWCGKQyRnN\/D6w==","fsize":1253458,"resto":118033394,"id":"Smo6d55l","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":118040319,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)00:28:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118040084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118040084<\/a><br>(((Liechtenstein)))","filename":"happymerchant","ext":".jpg","w":501,"h":585,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490329711178,"time":1490329711,"md5":"Qd00DtdSFTu8p7SdSa7DSA==","fsize":70986,"resto":118033394,"id":"oEYo6nbb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118040349,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)00:28:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118033394\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118033394<\/a><br>G Gundam.

I only applied to single ivy (Harvard, though I should have applied to Columbia and\/or Princeton as I&#039;m sure I could have gotten into at least one) and was rejected. I was an upper middle class white guy with a very accomplished record (&gt;2250 SAT, US Mathematical Olympiad, enough AP credit to enter as a Sophomore (not that this is rare even at state schools), and shitloads of extracurricular activities with leadership positions and awards). Fortunately, I got into MIT and went there, but if you&#039;re not black or native america Harvard is basically just a crapshoot. Because black students tend to have shittier accomplishments they have a lower bar at even he most esteemed institutions in the US (see racism by low expectations). All else held equal a black student has a ~300 point bonus compared to a white student on the SAT iirc. So, a black version of me would have had a score higher than it would be possible for me to score (since the limit is 2400). Hell, asians have a 50 point penalty and they still filled my classes (math major who heavily explored physics, chemistry, and finance). I would have loved to try math 55 at Harvard (though I&#039;m not narcisistic enough to think I&#039;d be able to beat it, I&#039;d probably drop to math 45 and do great). <br><br>I probably sound bitter, and maybe I am because the system discriminates against me all while claiming that the system helps me. Somehow they&#039;ve managed to have it both ways. I&#039;m in probably the same position I&#039;d be in if I graduated Harvard, though. I&#039;m a burnt out investment banker seeking a commission in the US Army (the last 8 years have been very good to my parents and I no longer need a job where I&#039;ll make money as I&#039;m effectively taken care of for life).

This is a place a pure freedom of speech. <br><br>People that do not get that, are the same people who call for threads to be banned. The same people who are worried about &quot;shill&quot; threads. Yeah some fags are try to push their opinions on \/pol\/. Some fags want to see things they don&#039;t like banned or censored. Even a &quot;bought&quot; opinion is as valid as the next opinion. <br><br>Pure freedom of speech along with anonymity is going to have shit you don&#039;t like. That&#039;s the fucking beauty of it. <br><br>It&#039;s up to the lurker and community to deter what the want to read and look into. I wouldn&#039;t want it any other way. You can hide threads, sage threads, or just fucking ignore them. We are the moderators. We are difference from a thread hitting 300+ relies or going to page 10 with only the OP. <br><br>Once you start banning things because muh feelings what have you become? What does this place become? Who is the right person that determines what is a &quot;shill&quot; thread? Do you honestly want more moderation?<br><br>If you want a fucking hugbox go to reddit.

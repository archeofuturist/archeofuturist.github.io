When speech first evolved, you&#039;d expect most of the subhuman primates to have spouted shit that *surely* got them killed, like directly stating their inner desires to fuck the alpha&#039;s harem or even kill him. They HAD to evolve a regulatory mechanism that stopped them from being fucking retarded, and &quot;consciousness&quot; is exactly that. It allows you to map out the expected effect of your communication and to put yourself in the others&#039; shoes. Those who had that didn&#039;t get killed and were capable of lying, reproduced, social complexity in the tribe skyrocketed, having a better &quot;socially-mapping&quot; organ was evolutionary promoted, so those with better consciousness reproduced even more, and so on until today, when the major reproductive trait a female seeks in her potential mate is the ability to be social and to not say dumb shit.<br><br>The way it prevents you from spouting retarded shit is via anxiety. So when you have a severe social anxiety, you shouldn&#039;t be worried and take yourself as inferior since you&#039;re mapping a very fucking wide range of possible outcomes and are simply getting scared by them. Most people who don&#039;t have anxiety haven&#039;t &quot;heroically overcame it&quot; like they tend to claim, they&#039;re just too stupid to be anxious. That&#039;s why all the smart people are generally introverted - they&#039;re &quot;more conscious&quot; than the average and are having their anxieties trigger too often, causing them to revert into safety where they&#039;re not getting exhausted by them.","filename":"Large_Baboon_Tribe_600","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":449,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490257497164,"time":1490257497,"md5":"ZeeExKLBbkwICRR\/Zwnuww==","fsize":63318,"resto":117883956,"id":"fgJl\/wOJ","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":117907779,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)04:27:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117883956\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117883956<\/a><br><br>Only if you let it be.<br><br>Being an introvert merely means you&#039;d rather be by yourself, but even the most introverted of introverts still needs some time with other people.

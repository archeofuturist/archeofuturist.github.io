It must devour everything: the environment, communities, nations. All must be subjugated to the motive of profit, and if one CEO is too ethical for that, he will be replaced by another who isn&#039;t. When regulations hinder profits, they are removed, sooner or later. When the laborer in a country isn&#039;t desperate enough, and when wages aren&#039;t low enough, corporations bring in hordes of stupid foreigners to compete with the natives and to inflate the labor pool.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;capitalism is pretty much: the people own the companies but laws still exist to keep things ethical. <\/span><br>Don&#039;t kid yourself. People own companies in the sense that the companies are owned by human beings, but certainly not &quot;the people&quot;. How much control does the American public have over Microsoft or GM - companies that at hard at work to bankrupt the American worker by outsourcing and importing H1B poo-in-loos? How much control do the German people have over Siemens? The companies have no loyalty to their home countries whatsoever and they answer to no one. All they care about is ever-increasing profits, and when the profit motive is in conflict with the interest of the community - and it fucking is -, then the profit motive wins, every time.","filename":"alucard","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493287103450,"time":1493287103,"md5":"RdAgm0bgCBhlwXCgHcsS3w==","fsize":38911,"resto":123018949,"id":"n80qySyN","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123020076,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)06:02:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123019352\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123019352<\/a><br>Corporatism is actually still influential in Germany.

It made me look at the conflict in Syria in a fairly different way. Was it a pure propaganda piece (well obviously) or was it moderately legitimate? Did anyone see it? If so did it make you look at the conflict in a different manner? <br><br>Is the Free Syrian Army really our enemy? Perhaps they&#039;re cowards and contribute to the Islamic State by leaving their guns but even they say Al Nusra and ISIS are problems. FSA seems reasonable. <br><br> Do they really support radical Islamic Terrorists? Shouldn&#039;t we actually support overthrowing the the Bashar government? <br><br>Trust me I sit around on this site a lot. Yet, 2% of the ISIS killings in comparison to the Bashar government? Chemical Weapons? Sarin, Chlorine gas? <br><br>I&#039;m just curious on how everyone takes this. <br><br>Cute girl to make you look. More than cute btw.

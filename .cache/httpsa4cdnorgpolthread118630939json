It&#039;s not chemically addictive but is often habit forming like coffee. Mostly unnecessary for recreational use but can have some medicinal use. Often what&#039;s more problematic is the laws surrounding cannabis more than the drug itself.

Just because something doesn&#039;t have physical withdrawal symptoms doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s not addictive. For example, I decided to break my addiction to diet soda and diet energy drinks because I realized that shit was pure poison. For six months I would see a bottle of coke zero and my mouth would start watering. It was one of the hardest things I&#039;ve ever done. Getting off of benzos was a cakewalk compared to getting off of soda, and benzos have withdrawal symptoms that can literally kill you. I imagine hardcore coffee drinkers would be exactly the same way with trying to break a coffee addiction. Also, other things can be addictive, like MMORPGs.","time":1490695226,"resto":118630939,"id":"g11nDKed","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118633743,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)06:02:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118633067\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118633067<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;smoking anything<\/span><br>Fucking retard","time":1490695344,"resto":118630939,"id":"Wl\/dbz\/x","country":"MY","country_name":"Malaysia"},{"no":118634013,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)06:07:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"it&#039;s a hippie drug, but at least it&#039;s not as bad as LSD","time":1490695631,"resto":118630939,"id":"ShtMUuli","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118634052,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)06:07:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118633205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118633205<\/a><br>shieet nigga is smoked shit that had 70%+ thc, get away with that weak ass pussy shit","time":1490695673,"resto":118630939,"id":"i8SkqVzs","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118634068,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)06:08:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;inhaling smoke from anything thats on fire<\/span><br><br>Wew lad","time":1490695693,"resto":118630939,"id":"eLF2vSjQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118634294,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)06:12:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118634052\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118634052<\/a><br>is it normal to feel like you&#039;re almost tripping from very strong stuff?","time":1490695933,"resto":118630939,"id":"aHTdhWke","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118634551,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)06:16:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118631192\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118631192<\/a><br>Being susceptible to lung cancer gives you lung cancer even cigarettes only give a 2% greater chance than the general population of getting it, you are worse off working in shipyards or construction industries.","time":1490696187,"resto":118630939,"id":"rTLrCdN+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118634828,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)06:21:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118630939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118630939<\/a><br>It increases (a lot, something like 4 times) the risk to develop schizophrenia, especially if used repeteadly at a young age (basically, before 18).<br><br>here&#039;s one source:<br>https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/ar<wbr>ticles\/PMC2424288\/","time":1490696466,"resto":118630939,"id":"OfmGWo3n","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118634886,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)06:21:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118633304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118633304<\/a><br>Your dumb as fuck.

The American side can not fail to understand that the Syrian government troops did not use chemical weapons there. Damascus simply does not have it, which has been repeatedly confirmed by qualified specialists. The relevant conclusions were drawn from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). In recent years, this organization has inspected almost all the facilities that had or could have relevance to the military chemical program in Syria. As for Idlib, the terrorists were engaged in the production of landmines filled with poisonous substances for later use in Syria and Iraq. The liquidation of this production was carried out as a result of the military operation of the Syrian Air Force.<br><br>The US pretends that they do not understand the obvious things. They turned a blind eye to the use of chemical weapons by terrorists in Iraq, as Baghdad officially reported. They wave off the records on the use of chemical weapons by terrorists in Aleppo. Thus, one can only condone international terrorism, strengthen it and expect new attacks with the use of weapons of mass destruction.<br><br>Undoubtedly, the US military action is also an attempt to divert attention from the situation in Mosul, where as a result of actions, including the American coalition, hundreds of civilians were killed and a humanitarian catastrophe is growing.<br><br>It is obvious that the attack by American cruise missiles was prepared in advance. It is clear to any specialist that the decision to strike was taken in Washington before the events in Idlib, which were simply used as a pretext for demonstrating strength.<br><br>The Russian side suspends the Memorandum on the Prevention of Incidents and Ensuring the Safety of Aviation Operations during Operations in Syria with the United States.<br><br>We call upon the UN Security Council to hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation.","time":1491553160,"resto":119906167,"id":"R2+w80z2","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":119912917,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)04:20:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119912788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119912788<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;google translation<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pasting a google translation<\/span><br>portugues burro da porra vai tomar no cu seu filho duma puta","time":1491553219,"resto":119906167,"id":"geDl\/Gfl","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119913071,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)04:21:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119912917\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119912917<\/a><br>what&#039;s wrong with it?","time":1491553303,"resto":119906167,"id":"R2+w80z2","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":119913145,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)04:22:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119913071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119913071<\/a><br>Nothing I just wanted to insult you","time":1491553339,"resto":119906167,"id":"geDl\/Gfl","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119913167,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)04:22:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119912023\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119912023<\/a><br>No","filename":"1490480696376","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":576,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491553349206,"time":1491553349,"md5":"Kgh+CqqibbE7nTkHs8cZeQ==","fsize":94126,"resto":119906167,"id":"s8e2yjv5","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119913420,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)04:24:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;07:15 GMT<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Islamic State took advantage of the US missile strike to try to seize oil areas near Palmyra, but failed, a local governor told RT.<\/span><br><br>CANT MOSSAD THE ASSAD","time":1491553480,"resto":119906167,"id":"DzgD4M2F","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":119913764,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)04:27:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"\/pol\/ is a fucking mess. 50% of posters are freaking out and the other 50% are in a shitposting freenzy.<br>nobody can just relax..","time":1491553658,"resto":119906167,"id":"R2+w80z2","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":119913765,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)04:27:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119913420\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119913420<\/a><br>wtf \/pol\/ told me this strike would surely be the end of Assad&#039;s campaign. we can&#039;t let this guy get the nuclear codes","time":1491553658,"resto":119906167,"id":"1TBMko6W","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119913973,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)04:29:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"kitten of damascus is going to be raped","filename":"momsgonnafreak","ext":".png","w":599,"h":872,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491553763340,"time":1491553763,"md5":"J\/aMGQddVfZcjeTDoDa3AQ==","fsize":711571,"resto":119906167,"id":"90l+tMIq","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119914043,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)04:29:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119913764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119913764<\/a><br>99% of hysterical posts are \/pol\/ false flag and 1% is leftypol","time":1491553797,"resto":119906167,"id":"geDl\/Gfl","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"}]}

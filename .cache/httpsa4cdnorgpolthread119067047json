Hyperrealist painters and sculptors use photographic images as a reference source from which to create a more definitive and detailed rendering, one that often, unlike Photorealism, is narrative and emotive in its depictions. Strict Photorealist painters tended to imitate photographic images, omitting or abstracting certain finite detail to maintain a consistent over-all pictorial design. They often omitted human emotion, political value, and narrative elements. Since it evolved from Pop Art, the photorealistic style of painting was uniquely tight, precise, and sharply mechanical with an emphasis on mundane, everyday imagery.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hyperrealism, although photographic in essence, often entails a softer, much more complex focus on the subject depicted, presenting it as a living, tangible object. These objects and scenes in Hyperrealism paintings and sculptures are meticulously detailed to create the illusion of a reality not seen in the original photo. That is not to say they&#039;re surreal, as the illusion is a convincing depiction of (simulated) reality. Textures, surfaces, lighting effects, and shadows appear clearer and more distinct than the reference photo or even the actual subject itself.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hyperrealism has its roots in the philosophy of Jean Baudrillard, &quot;the simulation of something which never really existed.&quot; As such, Hyperrealists create a false reality, a convincing illusion based on a simulation of reality, the digital photograph. Hyperreal paintings and sculptures are an outgrowth of extremely high-resolution images produced by digital cameras and displayed on computers. As Photorealism emulated analog photography, Hyperrealism uses digital imagery and expands on it to create a new sense of reality. Hyperrealistic paintings and sculptures confront the viewer with the illusion of manipulated high-resolution images, though more meticulous.<\/span>","filename":"Man_in_a_Boat_11","ext":".jpg","w":1590,"h":1200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":188,"tim":1490974991824,"time":1490974991,"md5":"3dqSy\/u2rHTM9fYvQvMi1g==","fsize":229030,"resto":0,"id":"5nxKTcVp","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"commissioning-a-hyperreal-pepe","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

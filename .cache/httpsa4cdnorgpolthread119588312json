If you know what you&#039;re doing it&#039;s basically paradise on earth:<br>- STDS at extremely low rates<br>- You can have up to 5 Cannabis Plants legally<br>- Chill as fuck Gun laws + nobody cares even if you break them. Getting drunk at a shooting range, pulling out a silencer and a military grade rifle was normal for us.<br>- Fantastic people if you know where to look.<br>- Complete disregard for unnecessary authority. &quot;Kurva, why would you pay the money for the drivers training and license GermAnon? Here, friend works at ministry, pay 5000 Korun and you can drive legal ok.&quot;<br>- At the same time tremendously adherent to traditionsand family. Even th most degenerate fuckwits I know celebrate Christmas with their families, help their parents whenever they can etc.<br>- Old generation is tough as nails and disciplined. Most of them ready to kill any intruder\/agressor upon their property, most of them armed (legally and illegally).<br>- Redpilled as shit. Good luck trying to weasel in Rapefugees.<br><br>There are also a few bad sides to it though:<br>- Incompetent beaurocracy.<br>- Incompetent government.<br>- Incompetent police.<br>- Incompetent companies: &quot;Sure u have internet soon ok ok.

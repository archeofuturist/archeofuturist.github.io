There&#039;s one objective. Fucking finish it.<br><br>I have no idea how Assad intends to re take full control and pull Syria out of armageddon mode. That&#039;s his fucking problem. One way it&#039;s not going to happen is through retards fighting over who is chemical dousing children. These past 48 hours are a hello wake the fuck up call to everyone sleep walking through this quagmire. Assad either needs to demonstrate that he can end the refugee crisis and be a real leader or he will go one way or another.<br><br>The re distribution of Syrian people to the rest of the world and particularly to America will end and end soon with or without Assad.<br><br>This is simply neo con tactics for a nationalist agenda.

Take back the textbook companies from the kikes and write on it for future history. It&#039;s now so long ago what started and caused it, he hasn&#039;t been able to do enough to fix it. The problem manifests itself daily as about 1000 new welfare cases to America. It has to end.

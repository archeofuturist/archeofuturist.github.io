Those questions are some of the most important in understanding not only why you should continue on this path to truth, but also why you should become a Catholic. For some it&#039;s the theological superiority, others the tradition, for others it&#039;s family and for still others it&#039;s the strong base it provides as such a unique institution amongst religions.<br><br>Catholism is the Truth, but what makes that clear to people depends upon the person.<br><br>I&#039;ll pray for God to guide you as you begin this journey, to bless you, and keep you.","time":1491862506,"resto":120484105,"id":"3ADEY8mB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120501154,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)18:16:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120492051\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120492051<\/a><br>&quot;the unbelieving wife has been sanctified through her believing husband.

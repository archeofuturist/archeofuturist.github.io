That term gets thrown around, so I am going to define it for everyone. It comes from the Pentagon. A long time ago, in the late 50s, an aerospace engineer wrote a memo that was laughable at its face, but is still framed in an office, deep within the E-ring. He said that if US fighter jets continue to follow the current trend of procurement, in which the technology advances faster than economic efficiencies of fabrication and manufacture, meaning &quot;yes we can do that,&quot; but also &quot;but it will be ten times as expensive as now,&quot; then eventually, the Pentagon will face an absurd scenario in which they US millitary has one all-powerful multi-trillion dollar aircraft. So the Navy can use it during the day, lend it out to the Air Force at night, and maybe the Marines can fly it on weekends.<br><br>That is a death spiral. In healthcare it works like this: A pool of healthy people are forced to pay more for the growing pool of &quot;sick&quot; people. The healthy people get nothing from this deal, so they stop paying. The fed tries to extort them, so they find ways around the forced confiscation (IRS guidance, exemptions, etc). The pool of &quot;sick&quot; people demand more gibs, while the pool of payers continues to shrink. Eventually millions of &quot;sick&quot; people (who think birth control or maternity leave is a right, and should be required payments for men or post-menopausal women) reaches its maximum size, and the pool of payers shrinks to zero. No insurer can afford to cover anything.<br><br>This is already well under way and has gone farther than the jet fighter death spiral, which was granted an off-ramp when we figured out how to fly without people onboard.","time":1490460854,"resto":118241655,"id":"zX2hMQE6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118243829,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:54:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118243696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118243696<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump tweeted about how Freedom Caucus sucks<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They still defend him and still thought he did a good job behind the scenes and didn&#039;t blame him<\/span><br>Very odd.","time":1490460857,"resto":118241655,"id":"bnLnxkIc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118243837,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:54:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118243491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118243491<\/a><br>The narrative pushing is so obvious.<br>David Brock suffering another heart attack when?","time":1490460860,"resto":118241655,"id":"ta7WXk67","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118243862,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)12:54:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118243448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118243448<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump is incapable of looking at the details <\/span><br><br>Said about the man whose management style is described as &quot;from the carpet up&quot;.

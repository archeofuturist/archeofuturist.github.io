The American lawsuits, and the concomitant political campaign by American Jewish leaders and American government officials, also unearthed valuable historical data about the financial crimes of the Nazis and their cohorts during WW II. This post-Holocaust restitution movement, while viewed as a success, nevertheless created troubling moral issues, and this article focuses on five of them. First, does the demand for financial restitution demean the memory of the Holocaust? Second, once the funds are collected, how are they to be fairly distributed? This raises the provocative issue of who should be deemed a &quot;Holocaust survivor.&quot; Third, should some of these restitution funds be allocated for Holocaust education and remembrance, or do they belong solely to survivors? Fourth, while payments to individual survivors from these settlements were in the thousands of dollars, the class-action attorneys earned fees in the millions. Are these attorneys entitled to such fees, even though the fees represent less than 2 percent of the total amounts collected through the litigation? Fifth, many of the lawsuits were defended by Jewish lawyers. Although European corporations accused of wrongful conduct both during and after WW II are free to hire Jewish lawyers to defend their interests, should lawyers who are Jewish have taken on the defense of such suits?<br><br> By confronting these gray zones of post-Holocaust restitution, this article aims to shed light on this latest and wholly unexpected legacy of the Holocaust.","time":1493700299,"resto":123714435,"id":"6pyuzlSt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123728080,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)00:45:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123714435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123714435<\/a><br>lol Canada.<br><br>Hopefully we can wake them up the the chink threat plaguing their country.","filename":"1490926038120","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1920,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493700314374,"time":1493700314,"md5":"g8IQlzoIlhQV\/ozLOzewgg==","fsize":540638,"resto":123714435,"id":"bbdSPUl3","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123728190,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)00:46:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123714435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123714435<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;AverageCanadianPoster.gif<\/span>","filename":"1491812433691","ext":".gif","w":512,"h":384,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493700375726,"time":1493700375,"md5":"EMSxW+CR3NIn6SPXUWPFCg==","fsize":4186445,"resto":123714435,"id":"bbdSPUl3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123728278,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)00:47:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123714435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123714435<\/a><br>&quot;Canadians&quot;","filename":"1491693767211","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493700424441,"time":1493700424,"md5":"u\/QGdf+vLwdIzjyEXwUz5g==","fsize":340411,"resto":123714435,"id":"bbdSPUl3","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123728316,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)00:47:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123728055\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123728055<\/a><br>Kara Stein was the previous SEC commissioner till about a month ago<br><br>She wrote Dowd and Frank<br><br>She worked for a law firm known for taking villians and sued for holocaust money<br><br>I will begin to build a picture on names that made the SEC into an attack dog<br><br>If you know finance, you will know why what I tell you is a big deal as far as the conflict of interests go","time":1493700452,"resto":123714435,"id":"6pyuzlSt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123728586,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)00:50:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123728278\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123728278<\/a><br><br>Yep<br><br>You can tell the Chinks and Poos that are in Canada from the Euros.

The term historically had anti-Semitic connotations, as many of the New York firms known as &quot;white shoe&quot; were considered off-limits to Jewish lawyers until the 1960s.[1][2] The phrase has since lost some of this connotation, but is still defined by Princeton University&#039;s WordNet as &quot;denoting a company or law firm owned and run by members of the WASP elite who are generally conservative,&quot; which shows that the original connotation has not changed entirely.[3] A 2010 column in The Economist described the term as synonymous with &quot;big, old, east-coast and fairly traditional.&quot;[4] Today, the term is sometimes used in a general sense to refer to firms that are perceived as prestigious or high-quality; it is also sometimes used in a derogatory manner to denote stodginess, elitism, or a lack of diversity.[1]","time":1493701613,"resto":123714435,"id":"6pyuzlSt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123730192,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:07:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"What hapened in early 2015?","time":1493701654,"resto":123714435,"id":"kwNiVX\/I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123730299,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:08:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123716490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123716490<\/a><br>we all hate by the 3rd panel. channel it.","filename":"1472251398638","ext":".jpg","w":709,"h":709,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493701720577,"time":1493701720,"md5":"CwePHczjxbI3E92Epw0QUA==","fsize":825625,"resto":123714435,"id":"Nwgs9ISh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123730303,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:08:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123730134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123730134<\/a><br>by the way that these firms that are owned by jews are anti semitic is a great canard<br><br>meet the international mafia&#039;s legal team<br><br><br> Magic Circle (law firms), an informal term for what are generally considered the five leading law firms headquartered in the United Kingdom<br> Silver Circle (law firms), an informal term for a group of corporate law firms headquartered in London which are each outside the Magic Circle<br> Seven Sisters (law firms), a collection of seven leading Canadian law firms with offices in Toronto<br> Big Three (law), an informal term for leading law firms in New Zealand<br> Big Six (law firms), an informal term for leading law firms in Australia<br> Big Five (law firms) in South Africa, an informal term for leading law firms in South Africa<br> Red Circle (law firms), an informal term for leading law firms in China","time":1493701725,"resto":123714435,"id":"6pyuzlSt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123730491,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:10:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123728278\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123728278<\/a><br><br>Those feels when I&#039;m on the left and hate all the poos and chiners","time":1493701845,"resto":123714435,"id":"Gpa078ms","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123730552,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:11:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123716490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123716490<\/a><br>stay long enough, and you will learn the truth in good time. you might even learn the meaning of life here","time":1493701879,"resto":123714435,"id":"pp1rq9wq","country":"SG","country_name":"Singapore"},{"no":123730602,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:11:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123730303\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123730303<\/a><br>holocaust money, sec kickback money, etc.<br><br>look at these jewish law firms go<br><br>now you know \/pol\/<br><br>you find a list of all of their major clients, especially the jewish ones and you find the whole web<br><br>im toast now but here is good luck to you<br><br>the fire rises","filename":"adsf","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":168,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493701907612,"time":1493701907,"md5":"pRmw90dAIdkGmSkxR9Pf1Q==","fsize":9143,"resto":123714435,"id":"6pyuzlSt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123730795,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:13:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123717492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123717492<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123719220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123719220<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123726655\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123726655<\/a><br>5th is the way to go if you want to be a major factor in making the world how it should be. 2 and 4 are good options, but ultimately small-scale.","time":1493702029,"resto":123714435,"id":"70PKnUF8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123730823,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:14:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123730602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123730602<\/a><br>jews are the mafia. you could have just said beware of kikes, anon","time":1493702050,"resto":123714435,"id":"7PAZBDL3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123730938,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:15:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123730192\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123730192<\/a>","filename":"gamergrub.jpe","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":1116,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493702121206,"time":1493702121,"md5":"kafKkyXLcXzxt9DDGoJnaw==","fsize":964605,"resto":123714435,"id":"34W3Atdf","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123730983,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:15:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123730602\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123730602<\/a><br>don&#039;t believe this is the international cartel<br><br>here is a sample of one of the members<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Warre<wbr>n_Christopher<br><br>China: Delinking human rights and trade status, May 1994<br><br>During the 1992 presidential campaign, then-candidate Clinton blasted President George H. W. Bush for giving China low-tariff trading privileges despite its human rights abuses. Secretary Christopher agreed with this view and believed that the US should use economic pressure to force China to improve its human rights record. However, on May 26, 1994, President Clinton renewed China&#039;s low-tariff trading privileges, effectively delinking the human rights issue from China&#039;s trade relations with the US. U.S.-Sino relations improved as a result, with President Jiang Zemin visiting the U.S. in November 1997 and President Clinton visiting China in June 1998.[13]<br>Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti, September 1994<br><br>On September 19, 1994, a US-led coalition returned Haiti&#039;s popularly elected President Jean-Bertrande Aristide to power after a coup had unseated him. The US military effort, known as Operation Uphold Democracy, was largely the product of Colin Powell&#039;s diplomatic efforts, with little role played by Christopher.[14]<br>Israel-Jordan peace treaty, October 1994<br><br>In the wake of the 1993 Oslo Accords, Secretary Christopher encouraged Jordan&#039;s King Hussein to make a peace treaty with Israel. Christopher eventually offered Hussein $200 million in military equipment and $700 million in debt forgiveness to sweeten the deal. On October 27, 1994, Prime Minister Rabin and Prime Minister Abdelsalam al-Majali signed the Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty. The signing was witnessed by President Clinton and Secretary Christopher. Christopher sought to obtain a similar treaty between Rabin and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad, but to no avail.[15]<br><br>geez israel&#039;s peace is worth american taxpayer bribes<br><br>same thing they did in iran<br><br>same thing they are doing in north korea","time":1493702150,"resto":123714435,"id":"6pyuzlSt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123731321,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)01:19:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123729180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123729180<\/a><br><br>No entry level redpills, we have to throw the newfags in to the deep end.

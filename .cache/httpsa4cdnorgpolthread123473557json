A slow revolution so to speak. By essentially making western countries commit harakiri, the new rootless and greedy third-world immigrants as the new majority would be something they could manipulate whichever way they wanted. Thus creating the socialist\/communist paradise that they have sought for so long. The key is to destroy any sense of loyalty to anything but the state. Loyalty to the family, ethnic group or religion, these are things to be destroyed by any means necessary (minority religions are exempt from this as the enemy of their enemy is their friend).

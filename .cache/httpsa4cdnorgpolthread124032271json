This was after being called Hitler by the world press for years. <br><br>Well then, just why is the West so decadent? The Jews didn&#039;t actually force Western countries into doing all this. They never had the power to. <br><br>Instead it&#039;s White people who have forsaken their responsibility towards their own countries in return for meaningless gratitude from the Jews. Who should you blame, the person with the ass or the one who debases themselves by kissing it? <br><br>Suppose you get rid of all Jews right now, poof all gone! Would the West return to glory? <br><br>No, and you know it&#039;s true. The West is too comfortable, too degenerate, too shameless. Hitler recognized this as well, he predicted in his last days that the Western democracies would fall to the disciplined people of the East. <br><br>And if we look towards the East, what do we see? Eastern Europe still holds on to traditionalism, conservative values, and religion. The Middle East retains full disciplinary control over their population and pushes their social rejects into the West with impunity. The Far East barely even thinks about Israel at all and has spent the last 50 years steadily building itself out of rubble into the new global power center of the World. <br><br>None of these regions succumbed to the influence of the Jews to any degree comparable to the West. What then does that tell us? <br><br>White people are weak, spineless, irresponsible masses in need of a master. The Jews are that master. Not because they fought to be. Because White people happily gave them the job.","filename":"1463184762138","ext":".jpg","w":529,"h":529,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493882331639,"time":1493882331,"md5":"ttV+0fn03q0vWmP31bgdjQ==","fsize":57469,"resto":124032271,"id":"bbtFX2e8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124034041,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)03:19:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124033471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124033471<\/a><br>I&#039;m glad my parents didn&#039;t do that to me<br><br>It sounds pretty cruel","time":1493882397,"resto":124032271,"id":"pbAYxEEl","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":124034102,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)03:20:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124032563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124032563<\/a><br>What&#039;s wrong with that?

In Pasco County, a swath of suburbs north of Tampa\u2013St. Petersburg, Trump outran Romney by 30,000 votes. Pasco was one of the counties Schale was paying special attention to because the Tampa area tended to attract retirees from the Rust Belt\u2014folks whose political leanings reflected those of hometowns in the industrial Midwest. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In particular, Schale could tell, heavily white areas were coming in hard for Trump.<\/span>","filename":"IMG_4089","ext":".png","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493885611486,"time":1493885611,"md5":"njFtqwNLIPHFBiVUhE9scQ==","fsize":127955,"resto":124032271,"id":"6sgGz6jl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124037606,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)04:13:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124037394\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124037394<\/a><br>Gotta say: HillPepes 2.0 are as funny as the original ones.","time":1493885615,"resto":124032271,"id":"ZacactEz","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":124037724,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)04:15:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124037536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124037536<\/a><br>His strategy won by the skin of his teeth.

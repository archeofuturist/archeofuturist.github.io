If you cared to look at the sources you will see that even hadith contain contradictions. This doesn&#039;t bother Islam because hadith are collected and compiled according to strength of transmission from the time, not the accuracy. For example, some hadith in Bukhari say Aisha was 9 at consummation, other passages put her at 19. Only the Quran is infallible according to Muslims and on balance it is not a &#039;bad&#039; book. Again you have to care enough to look at it outside of &#039;religionofpeace.com&#039; which is a neocon kikery. It&#039;s up to you.","time":1493172819,"resto":122825046,"id":"oT+rDTuu","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

I posted a polished up Kekistani flag using their design and I was banned for making &quot;Nazi imagery&quot;, when their flag is literally a copy of a Nazi design. All I did was posting something they created, and I was banned for making &quot;Nazi imagery&quot;. What really was the reason, is their top post is a link to a merchandising store run by the mods, and they are stomping out any competitions. The whole place is just a front to forcing a meme so they can Jew you with some T-shirts, and they have no problem censoring any competition that uses &quot;Nazi imagery&quot;.<br><br>Fuck them. \/pol\/ you are the last place on the planet with little to no censorship and ideas are collided on level and fair grounds.

Trump, whether he was or wasnt part of the establishment, is now. I believe that swap happend when he changed his team from who he started with to whom he has now (IE Rudy to Pence, etc) and that the establishment threw clinton to the wolves when they realized she couldn&#039;t. <br><br>Will we ever win this before its too late?

They are Pavlovian dogs that salivate before piles of money. They are hard-wired to steal from the poor and loot federal budgets. Their single-minded obsession with personal enrichment drives them to dismantle any institution or abolish any law or regulation that gets in the way of their greed. Capitalism, Karl Marx wrote, is \u201ca machine for demolishing limits.\u201d There is no internal sense of proportion or scale. Once all external impediments are lifted, global capitalism ruthlessly commodifies human beings and the natural world to extract profit until exhaustion or collapse.

It exists in a state of self-induced hypnosis and self-delusion. It seeks momentary euphoria and meaning in tawdry entertainment and acts of violence and destruction, including against people who are demonized and blamed for society\u2019s demise. It hastens its self-immolation while holding up the supposed inevitability of a glorious national resurgence.

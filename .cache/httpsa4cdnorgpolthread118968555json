The stakes are much higher here. We are truly free because we can lose our freedoms. The American system encourages complacency, cultural marxism, and sophism.<br>Authoritarians in Australia do not have to subvert anything, they can simply speak their mind.<br>Truly, there is nothing we won&#039;t entertain and it seems to me there is nothing the Americans will entertain.","filename":"Flag_of_German_Reich_(1935\u20131945).svg","ext":".png","w":2000,"h":1200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1490907907276,"time":1490907907,"md5":"yzd7+3iMC\/OuSkDTkStSsg==","fsize":41400,"resto":0,"id":"X+emZVZ\/","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"which-system-of-democracy-is-the-worst-and-why","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

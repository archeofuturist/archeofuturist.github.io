A lot of M\u00e9lenchon voters will likely flock to Le Pen because of her anti-globalist stance just as a lot of Fillon voters will likely flock to Macron due to his globalist stance.<br><br>If we assume that Le Pen gets 70% of M\u00e9lenchon&#039;s voters and 30% of Fillon&#039;s voters, and vice versa for Macron, adding their original vote tallies, the result is (after rounding):<br>* Macron: 15,825,249<br>* Le Pen: 14,786,252<br><br>This would mean that Le Pen loses by 1,038,997 votes. However, this doesn&#039;t account for the 5,447,246 who voted for less-popular candidates. It&#039;s possible that most of them will be more drawn to a centrist like Macron than to a &quot;far-right threat to democracy&quot; (so sayeth the Mainstream Media) like Le Pen. However, from what I&#039;ve heard, the French populace sees Macron as a boring, lukewarm figure, so a good number of these voters might be drawn to Le Pen because she represents a more radical change.<br><br>It&#039;s almost going to be a close race, but I think that Le Pen can take this. I give her a 40% chance of winning Round 2.","filename":"lepen","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493075037130,"time":1493075037,"md5":"e0f3RhHqyhexYMKgWq2W+A==","fsize":74975,"resto":0,"id":"j1q8RvRl","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-le-pen-actually-win-round-2","country_name":"United States","replies":73,"images":20,"unique_ips":31},{"no":122653305,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)19:05:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"French people are pussies.

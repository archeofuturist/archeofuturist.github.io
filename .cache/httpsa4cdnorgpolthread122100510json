I believe this a key factor in the upcoming war with north korea, Not only that but what about the peaceful protests in the streets of both political sides. How come americans feel the need to beat each other to a pulp {i.e. berekely due to propoganda from both sides}. Who are the upcoming candidates and their ties to possible globalism, also the reasons for this impeachment of their current president {seems fishy at this point in time}. I feel as though this is a very important issue that may effect everyone in the u.s.a. as well as adjacent countries.","filename":"1491889269017","ext":".jpg","w":1500,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492751887684,"time":1492751887,"md5":"dM+0ZmbhG71axW61DGVb6w==","fsize":199510,"resto":0,"id":"UktYHXwb","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lets-talk-about-south-korea-and-the-upcoming","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122102218,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:36:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122100510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122100510<\/a><br>Yea, that&#039;s what dough boy needs is MORE fucking food.

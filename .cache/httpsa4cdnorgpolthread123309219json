They spend a lot of their parent&#039;s or student loan money on stylish gear and things that bring modernity to the campsite. For example, chaco sandals, hiking packs that they use for going to class, and adornments that they can wear day to day that tells everyone that they are so totally rugged and one with nature. They will instagram everything, but of course they will insert themselves into the image rather than focus on the beauty of the natural setting. It is never about nature, it is about others knowing that they visited. This describes the left leaning types.<br><br>Then you have the latter. These are your hunters and fishermen typically, but the more urbane of the type just likes to actually get out and enjoy nature without needing affirmation of their prowess. Their gear is practical and efficient regardless of it&#039;s age and stylishness. This type will wear functional and reasonably priced clothing for the outdoors, not to signal others about how they hike just ALL the time.

So many RPG gamers are hardcore leftists. Many of them have an &quot;eat the rich&quot; mentality, where they fantasize about living off of welfare and playing RPG games all day. Unemployment is common among gamers- which makes sense, since its very difficult to arrange 5 players around a table for a 6 hour session when they have jobs. <br><br>Communism, socialism, and anti-capitalism are very common among gamers like Varg. I only know about 14 or so people total who play RPG games in my small town- but TWO of them have gone on to become MTF transsexuals, and most of the rest are hardcore leftists, this is very strange behavior. <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=75P<wbr>cK_y0XnI","filename":"1493066404045[1]","ext":".jpg","w":350,"h":350,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493180671384,"time":1493180671,"md5":"7Iy09Cz537iL6L5YfNh\/bw==","fsize":104379,"resto":0,"id":"GXGrHWKm","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"rpg-gamers","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

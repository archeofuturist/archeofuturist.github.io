The corruption of his own government led to the unrest which sparked the war, he was just another corrupt dictator. Before the war was even a thing his security forces committed mass arrests, unlawful killings (including women, children), torture and forced disappearances on dissidents and protesters. When his own people protested Assad made a vain attempt to stay in power by calling in the army and african mercenaries to execute protesters. Protests turned into riots, riots turned into the civil war and islamist groups gained a foothold in the chaos. If Assad could have found another solution like Tunis or even not fucked up exactly as badly like Egypt this would&#039;ve never happened and Syria wouldn&#039;t be the absolute flashpoint of the whole crisis.","filename":"KhjG6kf","ext":".jpg","w":566,"h":511,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":112,"tim":1491998302111,"time":1491998302,"md5":"WwbKowDDOfoM7rCfvMXSKA==","fsize":72556,"resto":120741131,"id":"JEiL5QkZ","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120747336,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)07:58:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"We&#039;re gonna bomb the shit out of the guy fighting ISIS","filename":"2ED13B6700000578-0-image-m-12_1448507112971","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":505,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":99,"tim":1491998331863,"time":1491998331,"md5":"l0visjiWKoFTo9DOvYHQXQ==","fsize":45883,"resto":120741131,"id":"LlOA8FGR","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

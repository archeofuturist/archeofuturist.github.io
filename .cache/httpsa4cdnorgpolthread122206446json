Big Man Tyrone is Africa tier, sadly. All the blacks I meet from Africa are generally great people, its the African Americans who act like niggers. Although of course I hear of savage behavior in Africa, many of the Africans that make it to the USA are hard working and like white people. I know a guy who is from Rwanda and survived the genocide and yea... generally Africans have way less baggage than american blacks.","time":1492819729,"resto":122206446,"id":"7umNMkjx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122207020,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)20:10:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122206446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122206446<\/a><br>Africa has more musk per capita than anywhere outside of India","time":1492819809,"resto":122206446,"id":"8ExnqDkU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122207090,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)20:10:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122206446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122206446<\/a><br>know, but your have Ebola Virus.","time":1492819844,"resto":122206446,"id":"UNxIZafD","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

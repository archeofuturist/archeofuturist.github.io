For instance you could potentially be killing something that greatly benefits humanity or progresses it forward in some form. Although with how many people survive there is a slim possibility of them being productive in a lot of ways. Second thing is it goes against the very mechanism that we are built for. Which is living and surviving. Now if the person is a threat to your sole mechanism of surviving then sure.

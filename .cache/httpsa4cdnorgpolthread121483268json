If life has no value, there&#039;s no moral road blocks to kill to get something you want. Since you will always be at some point in your life in a position in which you have something some other people wants, you might get killed for it.<br><br>So murder is bad.","time":1492411266,"resto":121483268,"id":"XISjc1b8","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121492356,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)02:42:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121492202\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121492202<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121492202\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121492202<\/a><br>You need to make arguments, not call people wrong constantly.

I know some of you bumpkins are nice and comfy in your little safe spaces, but some of us have to live next to the goddamn nest and would LOVE for some of these women to have the option to terminate the wannabe street gang that&#039;s growing in their disgusting bellies before they start making world star videos and turning our neighborhoods to shit. So please...support abortion. Why should we be made to babysit these fucks when they become teenagers only to have them spit on us and rob us blind later (while filming)? Because babies are cute? Fuck that. Abortion should be encouraged.

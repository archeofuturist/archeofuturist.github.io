I started losing hair at 18, went on Propecia at age 23. Propecia didn&#039;t grow back the hair I had lost, it only stopped the hair loss. Its effectiveness actually goes slightly down with time.<br><br> Anyway, last year I was 26. My hair loss had stopped but I still had a balding sort of look. Hair all over the scalp but diffuse thinning. The wind really made me feel my hair loss. I went full cold turkey with nofap and after 6 months, I started feeling like my hair was thicker. Then last month I went on a trip and it was windy, and suddenly I realized that my hair felt nice in the wind. None of that balding feel.<br><br> So this last month I&#039;ve been checking my hair and I almost have the same amount of hair I did before hair loss. Almost, in appearance at least. I&#039;d say I grew a good 30% to 40% of my hair back.<br><br> I&#039;ve been searching for info on his effect of nofap but not fining it. Note that Propecia shows its full effect after 6 months to one year and after that the hair loss still continues at a slower pace. So this isn&#039;t Propecia&#039;s effect. I started nofap after a full 3 years of starting Propecia. No Balding Look Anymore! NoFap Grew Back My Hair!&quot;<br><br>-<br><br> ...5) The most tangible (and unexpected) benefit is that my hair started filling back in. Three months ago I had developed a very noticeable bald spot on the back of my head and my hairline was thinning out and moving fast. Plus, I&#039;d have 10-20 strands of hair come out every time I ran my fingers through my hair. Now the bald spot isn&#039;t even visible and I can clearly see little blonde hairs coming back in my hairline peaks. And no more falling-out hair.

Your mind does. <br>I understand your argument for this - well if you say sex is ok, and the body can&#039;t tell the difference between sex and masturbation, why is masturbation bad.<br>To answer that, I do have to invoke the psychological impacts of it:<br>Sex is meant as a reward, not as a hobby. You gain it by accomplishing something (most women judge you by your status, development etc at the very least your looks) even if that something is gaining the affection of a woman. By rewarding yourself constantly, without having earn it, you throw your risk-reward psychological system out of whack and thus become lazy (even at an existential level since reproduction is one of our driving forces, oldest instincts, and greatest rewards). <br><br>It also messes up with your emotional state, affection wise, because when you have sex, and orgasm your brain is flooded by Oxycontin (the love chemical) which is responsible for bonding and love. When you masturbate, your brain is getting flooded by this &quot;love&quot; chemical, but directed at nothing, well, worse actually, directed at a girl on a screen. This is how you will become more jaded and disconnected from other people, and from a future partner.<br><br>Here is where I point out that excess in sex is bad as well. &quot;Passionate relationships&quot; die out fastest. Excess in everything leads to desensitization, boredom, lowering of value and pleasure, like any addiction.

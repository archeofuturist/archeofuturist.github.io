Ambiguity in negotiations is a way of getting other factions to make their own positions clear, before you begin negotiating in earnest. Think of the Supreme Court pick, arguably one of the most important things he&#039;s done so far. He struck out a very strong public position that it would be a Constitutionalist in the mold of Scalia, but demurred when asked for a specific name. This created an opening for people to publicly suggest candidates, while also making Trump&#039;s priorities among candidates clear. Ambiguity is an invitation to negotiation, not an attempt to shut it down. It sparks a broad public debate, as everyone else tries to argue their position in the open. <br><br>Contrast that with Ryan&#039;s approach. He drafted the bill behind closed doors. He then publicly announced that it would be a &quot;consensus bill&quot;. This shuts down debate, as it innately marginalizes anyone who objects as being outside the consensus. Ironically, this is the same approach hillary took in the 90s, and it failed for the same reason. You can&#039;t govern a Protestant society by conclave.","time":1490557008,"resto":118391033,"id":"1T5sDiZe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118403161,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)15:37:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118400071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118400071<\/a><br>You do if you are stupid as fuck like Ryan and have no fucking idea what you are doing.

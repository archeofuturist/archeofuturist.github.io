Ambiguity in negotiations is a way of getting other factions to make their own positions clear, before you begin negotiating in earnest. Think of the Supreme Court pick, arguably one of the most important things he&#039;s done so far. He struck out a very strong public position that it would be a Constitutionalist in the mold of Scalia, but demurred when asked for a specific name. This created an opening for people to publicly suggest candidates, while also making Trump&#039;s priorities among candidates clear. Ambiguity is an invitation to negotiation, not an attempt to shut it down. It sparks a broad public debate, as everyone else tries to argue their position in the open. <br><br>Contrast that with Ryan&#039;s approach. He drafted the bill behind closed doors. He then publicly announced that it would be a &quot;consensus bill&quot;. This shuts down debate, as it innately marginalizes anyone who objects as being outside the consensus. Ironically, this is the same approach hillary took in the 90s, and it failed for the same reason.

Poverty is a relative thing that compares to other people in a specific time and place, not an absolute level of wealth. So saying that &quot;poverty is the default, the natural state of man, for all of history&quot; just isn&#039;t true; groups people will naturally form opinions about who is poor\/rich in their society, even if the whole lot of them are &quot;poor&quot; if taken out of context and compared with modern well-off people.<br><br>You know what actually is the natural state of man for much of history? The lack of state legislation. You should be able to understand that in this light that a simple lack of state restrictions on markets doesn&#039;t catapult a people into prosperity. The important part of the Industrial Revolution was the &quot;Industry&quot; and &quot;Market&quot; bits, not the &quot;Revolution&quot; or &quot;Free&quot; bits. With the advent of comparatively capable technology and large international markets, you can simply DO more.<br><br>&quot;Constant innovation in order to bring the price of goods [AND SERVICES] to make them accessible to the masses&quot; - is this not the explicit aim of healthcare? A significant portion of the technological advances of the Industrial Revolution was state-sponsored (if you actually know the history for yourself); clearly states and their agents are as capable of innovation as other groups. Really, state healthcare does not preclude the participation of the private sector. In fact, imposing restriction to keep the state out of healthcare is state legislation and restriction of the free market of ideas. If private healthcare insurance providers cannot compete - remember, they just have to come up with something better, there are no legislative barriers to entry and they can target any segment(s) of the market that works, including the rich - then they have failed the free market test.<br><br>I&#039;m not against small government, at all.

It points me to the man who once in loneliness, surrounded only by a few followers, was greatest not as a sufferer but as a fighter. In boundless love as a Christian and as a man I read through the passage which tells us how the Lord at last rose in His might and seized the scourge to drive out of the Temple the brood of vipers and adders. How terrific was His fight for the world against the Jewish poison. To-day, after two thousand years, with deepest emotion I recognize more profoundly than ever before in the fact that it was for this that He had to shed His blood upon the Cross.

He too would remain a member of the Catholic Church, he said. And in fact he remained in the church until his suicide. &quot;The church is certainly necessary for the people. It is a strong conservative element,&quot; he might say at one time or another in this private circle... &quot;Through me the Evangelical [Protestant] Church could become the established church, as in England.&quot; Even after 1942 Hitler went on maintaining that he regarded the church as indispensable in political life. But he sharply condemned the campaign against the church, calling it a crime against the future of the nation. For it was impossible, he said, to replace the church by any &quot;party ideology.&quot; \u201dUndoubtedly,\u201d he continued, \u201cthe church would learn to adapt the political goals of National Socialism in the long run, as it had always adapted in the course of history.\u201d A new party religion would only bring about a relapse into the mysticism of the Middle Ages.

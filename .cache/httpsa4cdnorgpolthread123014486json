After they invaded and destroyed half the country they let the Dalai Lama come back and rule over the country in kind of a puppet way.<br><br>Well, there was a revolt not by him but by his supporters, and since then they banned the Dalai lama, any pictures of him, and iirc Tibetan Buddhism outright. And from what I can tell they are trying to ethnically cleanse the Tibetans basically through mass flooding of their country with Chinese nationals.<br><br>Millions of Tibetans die every few years from trying to run away afaik.<br><br>Pretty shitty story and it is probably what will happen to Europe sadly.","filename":"1493091326839","ext":".jpg","w":508,"h":508,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493285863797,"time":1493285863,"md5":"7gzQL4bnL2rbUxylaF\/5Ag==","fsize":137537,"resto":123014486,"id":"nJGwvJDc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

France and Russia has always been pretty close (third republic, De Gaulle Europe from antlantic to Ural, and in a lesser extend Fillon when he was PM and Putin had good relation) it helps. While krauts are truly hated by russian (just take a quick run on russian media talking about Germany). Your only choice is to elect merkel pro-jewantlantic or (((Sculz))) for a Ubber EU against Russian interest.<br>Berlin and Moscow interest are not likely to align unless E.U exist and Germany will NEVER get out of E.U because it is too good for them.<br>France getting out of E.U Russia will see it positively for France.","time":1492712769,"resto":122009547,"id":"wDZ4dLzt","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122023548,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:27:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122016354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122016354<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;literally first two seconds<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;the shills are me&quot;<\/span>","time":1492712832,"resto":122009547,"id":"N8mma6o9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122023648,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:28:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122022881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122022881<\/a><br>But seriously we can&#039;t give her the nuclear codes","time":1492712881,"resto":122009547,"id":"N8mma6o9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122024001,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:31:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122022958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122022958<\/a><br>Paris is more white than London","time":1492713071,"resto":122009547,"id":"FMQLZNkw","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122024003,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:31:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122016354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122016354<\/a><br>Empereur-Dieu is simply unstoppable.

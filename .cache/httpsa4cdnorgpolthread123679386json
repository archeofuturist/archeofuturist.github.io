So the only options you have are to use the existing water table and replenish it with water from somewhere else - which is often devastating environmental damage to the area the water is taken from - or you gradually deplete the reservoir of water the geothermal energy is drawn from. Thats why geothermal energy has never been expanded and only supplies a limited amount of energy, or why its unfeasible.<br><br>Hydroelectricity, much like geothermal energy, consumes water. So you are either creating a system to alter water routes which is heavily damaging to the surrounding environment and what limits the use of hydroelectricity, or you don&#039;t have enough water to generate enough energy for a region. Thats why costal cities will typically generate their energy requirements through hydro, because they have access to enough water for it to be feasible, but those regions will also have higher taxes because the maintenance cost to upkeep the facilities is retardedly high. <br><br>B.C.\/Ontario are the best example since you are a fellow Leaf.

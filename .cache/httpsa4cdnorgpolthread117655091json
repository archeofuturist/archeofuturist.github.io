The Danny Thomas Show (known as Make Room for Daddy during the first three seasons) is an American sitcom which ran from 1953 to 1957 on ABC and from 1957 to 1964 on CBS. A revival series known as Make Room for Granddaddy aired on ABC from 1970 to 1971.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As a &quot;starving actor&quot;, Thomas had made a vow: If he found success, he would open a shrine dedicated to St. Jude Thaddeus, the patron saint of hopeless causes. Thomas never forgot his promise to St. Jude, and after becoming a successful actor in the early 1950s, his wife joined him and began traveling the United States to help raise funds to build his dream - St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital.[16] He fervently believed \u201cno child should die in the dawn of life.\u201d[17] With help from Dr. Lemuel Diggs and close friend, Anthony Abraham, an auto magnate in Miami, Florida, Thomas founded the St. Jude Children&#039;s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1962<\/span><br><br>From 1960 to 1963 The Danny Thomas show aired directly before the Andy Griffith Show.

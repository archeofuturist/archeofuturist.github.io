God exists but now what?","com":"After my edgy atheist phase during my teen days I got interested in learning all I can about religion. Im not baptized even though my parents believe in God, but they always thought that I should get baptized knowing what it implies and actually really believing in the faith. That&#039;s why this past half year in particular I&#039;ve dedicated myself to learn and study more about theology and all the scientific evidence that we have available that would lead us to believe that there is in fact a God, and I must say that despite what most of those edgy atheists (that I once was) say, there&#039;s a lot of evidence that can suggest this. After that I tried to learn the story of Jesus and after watching things like Jim Caviezel&#039;s testimony and The Pasion of Christ, and reading some books and articles from that matter, I&#039;ve never been so moved by the force and attraction that JC gives me. Almost like a heavenly force. This added to the fact that there is a clear agenda to demonize christianity gives even more reason to believe that this is the Truth. But after having christianity as a middle ground to study more about this I&#039;ve been getting confused lately about this inside fight between what I guess are anabaptists like Pastor Steven Anderson (from which I&#039;ve seen some of his sermons and movies like Marching to Zion) who claim that churches are not in the bible and that you get saved through faith alone and not through works, and those who believe that the church is the body of Christ and you should confess your sins to the priest and do good deeds. The confusing part is that both claims that the Bible backs all of their points, but for example Steven Anderson says that the only true version of the Bible is the King James version. If anyone can enlighten me I would greately appreciate it.<br><br>The idea is to discuss this in the most unbiased way possible.<br>Thanks","filename":"1b6142e668daeb4188bef76a849fdc45ace5870b9b9702700b945b5f19b2acc7","ext":".jpg","w":457,"h":546,"tn_w":209,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493691341138,"time":1493691341,"md5":"maRWk0s0mRo3HfdHZ+B99g==","fsize":52402,"resto":0,"id":"KQH1uHsR","country":"AR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-i-finally-came-up-to-my-senses-god-exists-but","country_name":"Argentina","replies":34,"images":15,"unique_ips":16},{"no":123711408,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)22:18:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123711076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123711076<\/a><br><br>go away nigger","time":1493691491,"resto":123711076,"id":"tKlgXYAK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123711782,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)22:21:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123711076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123711076<\/a><br>While I believe in a creator God, and the reality of natural\/universal law, I found it very difficult to align myself with any one doctrine or dogma.

Now that you have had a heart renovation your life will be changed as well. The things you once found comfort and favour in May change and you will see the evils that are tied up in it the enemy hates this and those that the enemy controls hates it also. The people you love and care about will be confused and resist the life change that comes with this. But I implore you to stay the course. Read your bible as regularly as possible and be humbled by His leading. The King said that the way is narrow and few find it. Paul explains in 2 Peter that the enemy is like a lion prowling around seeking someone to devour so remember this. The host of heaven rejoice by your awakening and I am among them in joy. The next step is to live and walk in a manner worthy of what He has called you too. If you feel convicted to be baptised find a church not that speaks to your fancy but that speaks the Word unapologetically. This may be difficult but once you find it you will know very quickly. Do not be disheartened or distracted by those who mock you. For that same spirit mocked Christ and killed Him.

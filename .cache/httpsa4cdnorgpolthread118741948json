Freemasonry is closely associated with Gnosticism - the G in the symbol stands for &quot;Gnosis&quot;. But there are so many orders each with their own beliefs. It would take several lifetimes to rise in the ranks of each of the orders to fully understand their texts, what they believe, and ultimately if their order was what I believed in. You really can&#039;t window shop when it comes to something like this.","time":1490773514,"resto":118741948,"id":"NYmn8+Z5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118761638,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)03:45:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118761614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118761614<\/a><br>I&#039;ve loosely studied Gnosticism and Hermeticism on my own, from some of their texts to lectures you can easily find online, and I think I might go my own route. Gnosticism is the ultimate spiritual truth, and I don&#039;t believe a person needs to rely on an Order to reach it. I know this sounds deeply schizophrenic but I know from dreams that I&#039;ve had that I&#039;m on the correct path to eventually reach Gnosis. I&#039;m a lucid dreamer, I&#039;ve documented my dreams for years, and occasionally I&#039;ll have a dream that is so vivid, so detailed, that I would call it a vision instead of a dream. I&#039;m not trying to discredit the human brain, I know it is powerful, but the spatial perception\/awareness required for some of these dreams to happen is something that I can&#039;t even begin to approach with a wakeful mind. Complex mechanical structures being disassembled by things not human, and the structures are so detailed that I can&#039;t believe my mind is generating it. In my dreams I&#039;ve seen sacred geometry on the underside of alien spacecrafts the size of US states. I&#039;ve interacted with the entities in my dreams, and some of them I know weren&#039;t generated by my brain. I&#039;ve even had a few visions of things that later came true - nothing like lottery numbers or significant events like natural disasters, but visions that let me know that I was on the right track, and that dreams are not always just dreams. In the Christian bible God speaks to some people through dreams. People see alien landscapes and alien beings when taking DMT, which the brain generates to create dreams. I think it&#039;s reasonable to assume that I could understand and reach Gnosis if I were to continue exploring my dreams while studying texts in my wakeful state.","time":1490773533,"resto":118741948,"id":"NYmn8+Z5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118761712,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)03:46:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118761611\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118761611<\/a><br>Or you&#039;re wrong and dare I say cancer.","time":1490773603,"resto":118741948,"id":"LhDq8lIt","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118761746,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)03:47:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118761614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118761614<\/a><br><br>Nice pasta, I am convinced.

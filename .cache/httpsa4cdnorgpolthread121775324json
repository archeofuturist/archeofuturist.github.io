Focus on the Planned Parenthoods\/adoption centers and where their affiliated facilities are.<br><br>New bit of info has come up, a map of missing 411&#039;s with our previous map of networks superimposed shows that there is a correlation between the networks we alleged and areas where missing person reports are coming from.<br><br>We&#039;re continuing to focus on why there seems to be a pattern of abortion clinics and adoption centers right next to marinas and ports. What we need to do is figure out where these abortion centers are sending their fetus parts etc. since they&#039;re likely being sent to the same places that humans are being trafficked<br><br>The goal is to start at the coasts and then work our way inland to landlocked areas.<br><br>Make sure to pay attention to proximity to Native American Reservations, Blue Counties from the 2016 election,

As long as the cash keeps flowing here, people turn a blind eye to a LOT of shit. Plenty organized crime here too, indo-canadian, native, hells angels, etc. Its evebn rumoured the PLA has set up show here with various front companies like they always do, to do their dirty work. Also, Triad and human smuggling, lots of Chinese illegals making it onshore.","time":1492568809,"resto":121775324,"id":"JXhlM3a8","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121787216,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:34:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121786220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121786220<\/a><br>The PLA?

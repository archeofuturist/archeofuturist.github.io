Even if it wasn&#039;t a single world currency, there could be a basket of a small number of approved world currencies any country which wanted to use or could seek approval to could start using, possibly even cryptocurrencies, overseen by international or world financial organizations like the IMF or WTO.<br><br>Countries which didn&#039;t want to use these or participate could still use their own currencies and avoid dealing with the system but eventually the benefits of not doing so and using the accepted world standard(s) would make them come around and use them. Do we really lose anything by getting rid of competing currencies? Does currency competition force countries to do better much like how competitive markets make companies behave?","filename":"SoccerChicks1","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492265052809,"time":1492265052,"md5":"Wk7QONSyyqrGZYSE1tvisw==","fsize":45371,"resto":0,"id":"Mg\/jA8Qj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"single-world-currency","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":0,"unique_ips":8},{"no":121213064,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)10:04:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121213027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121213027<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121213027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121213027<\/a><br>hello soros","time":1492265081,"resto":121213027,"id":"IMPnleM9","country":"TN","country_name":"Tunisia"},{"no":121213152,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)10:05:53","name":"roachPrime","com":"<a href=\"#p121213027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121213027<\/a><br>centralization = oppression","time":1492265153,"resto":121213027,"id":"rFqPXuMf","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":121213344,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)10:07:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121213027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121213027<\/a><br>That&#039;s not how it works","time":1492265278,"resto":121213027,"id":"N0LSb5e4","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121213494,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)10:09:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121213027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121213027<\/a><br>You will make sure this thread disappears if you don&#039;t want you or your family to disappear","time":1492265393,"resto":121213027,"id":"G+7OqHpP","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":121213537,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)10:10:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;massive usury per turn<\/span><br><br>nah fuck ya","time":1492265421,"resto":121213027,"id":"Sps+Tsbq","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121213591,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)10:11:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121213027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121213027<\/a><br>I just threw up in my mouth.<br><br>Globalist detected.","time":1492265464,"resto":121213027,"id":"5COMmTkx","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121213735,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)10:13:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121213027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121213027<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;cryptocurrencies<\/span><br>they don&#039;t need to be overseen bitcoin is decentralised","time":1492265586,"resto":121213027,"id":"5COMmTkx","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121213783,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)10:13:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121213344\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121213344<\/a><br>Then explain it, currencies just correspond to the economy and productivity over some state which chooses to use them to represent their economy and productivity.

Y&#039;all just need to grow the fuck up and learn to manage your money like an adult. Minimum wage is usually just supposed to be a basis until you get a better job or if you&#039;re in college. Minimum wage was not designed for people to buy high priced shit, it is exactly as it&#039;s named, MINIMUM wage. The absolute MINIMAL amount you can get paid, for more than likely the MINIMAL amount of work you can do at a job. People need to get off their asses and actually work for a better job, raising the minimum wage won&#039;t help them, and it might even put them out of a job.","time":1493178153,"resto":122835936,"id":"347wokJn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

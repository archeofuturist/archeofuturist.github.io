Ma and Pa&#039;s fish and chip shop around the corner know you well and they could use an extra set of hands during rush hour some evenings, but of course they&#039;re a small, locally owned business and can only give you $8 an hour. Now you don&#039;t give a shit - this is your first job, it isn&#039;t very difficult, and you get $96 each week in your pocket to buy a new game, or go to the movies with your mates! Hooray!<br><br>The government however decrees that everyone has to be paid $15 per hour. Now at first this seems good, since for your same work you&#039;re being paid double. But Ma and Pa aren&#039;t making double the money they did before. Demand for their store&#039;s goods hasn&#039;t increased at all and all that&#039;s happened is their labor costs have gone up. So they can either A) become more productive (difficult, considering it is a small and local business) B) cut back your hours, hurting the business productivity or C) pay you a now criminally low rate of $8 per hour, which is all they could afford in the first place, and risk being fined. So by placing a minimum wage, you have people who want to work and would be happy to work for a lower rate, businesses who can only afford the lower rate, but the government has made any arrangement like that illegal. The worker suffers, the business suffers, and the government who now isn&#039;t collecting taxes from either party, also suffers.<br><br>If the argument is that the cost of living is too high, then why is the solution a higher minimum wage? Why is the solution to not make the cost of living lower? Instead of a higher minimum wage, why not pass laws that encourage small businesses to open up? More small businesses mean more jobs, which means people have more money anyway, some of which goes to small businesses, and both the employee and employer are paying taxes which means more money for the government too.","filename":"hilton_poor","ext":".jpg","w":423,"h":566,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493183355787,"time":1493183355,"md5":"XJWsgEL2qa1X5bCXtwrZWQ==","fsize":36008,"resto":122835936,"id":"OalO7+Ao","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122846701,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:10:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122840979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122840979<\/a><br>Because it opens the door for dumb fucks like you to consider that there&#039;s enough money out there to fund just about every single hippy dippy program for every single human, and the people we propose we outright take that money from literally could not fathom the utterly minute difference it would make in their yearly income, let alone their day to day lives.","time":1493183447,"resto":122835936,"id":"SLLbzIC2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122847023,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:14:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122835936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122835936<\/a><br>That obese pile of lard looks like a &quot;starvation wage&quot; would do it some good.","time":1493183641,"resto":122835936,"id":"OywynTI4","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122847181,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:15:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122835936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122835936<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Starving wage<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;posts fat beaner as proof<\/span><br><br>Okay Bernie, back to bed mate, come on.","time":1493183740,"resto":122835936,"id":"3fQuwYvP","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122847261,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)01:16:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122846567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122846567<\/a><br>Oh my god.

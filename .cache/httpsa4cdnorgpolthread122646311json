Charge missile infantry.<br>Antifa make use of an old Roman and early-modern tactic of screening their lines with shitty troops (small women and nu-males) while people behind them throw rocks, explosives, and bottles. You can&#039;t see them or get to them, because the screen is in the way. This is also how Eric Clanton moved in to attack the dude with his bike lock, hiding behind for the right moment to strike. The right-wing needs to shut that shit down immediately. Get a group of guys together (at least 10) and charge en masse at the antifa lines. The antifa women will scatter, allowing you access to the fuckers in the back. Use shields and sticks to rain hell on these fuckers.<br><br>2. Organization<br>The above will be much easier with greater organization. In the early moments of the event (or preferably before), you should agree on a Commander and various Captains. Each captain leads a detachment of men (5-10). If the commander calls a charge, everyone pushes forward with shields and scatters the Antifa. Captains govern their men in the melee and can call mini-charges and move them tactically to respond to specific threats. This will help with pitched battles and will also help avoid antifa&#039;s #1 tactic: picking off individual guys and tripping them so eight other communists can stab and kick him on the ground.<br><br>3. Study Pre-Modern Fighting<br>Nobody&#039;s brought guns yet, so you&#039;re basically in pre-modern fight-mode, again. Look at the Roman legionary. Heavy shock infantry. When the legionaries charge, they throw javelins to soften up and disrupt the enemy formation. You should do the same. Every Defender should be armed with a can of bearspray, eyeprotection and a mask. As you move into charge, raise your bear spray and fire into the eyes of the Antifa. Empty the fucker if you want, or shoot for a few seconds then holster. This will disorientate and disrupt the antifa lines. Follow up the spray with your charge, with your shields and rubber batons\/flagpoles ready.","time":1493073291,"resto":122646311,"id":"K58T6e9q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122649563,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)18:34:51","name":"Kevin Crowley","com":"<a href=\"#p122648917\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122648917<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;692cYtKD<\/span><br>Hey i&#039;m Kevin Crowley, i&#039;m actually one of the people helping run the event i&#039;m also a admin in the discord.","time":1493073291,"resto":122646311,"id":"oqfU7NNM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122649572,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)18:34:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122649303\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122649303<\/a><br>Fellow suburb fag reporting in, let&#039;s show them rich white boys aren&#039;t cucked yet.","time":1493073295,"resto":122646311,"id":"fyIsvDbD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122649607,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)18:35:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122649182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122649182<\/a><br>Thomas langdale of north shore antifa is ready to punch Nazi&#039;s.","filename":"Screenshot_2017-03-26-22-35-51","ext":".png","w":480,"h":854,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493073313686,"time":1493073313,"md5":"33dD9XYo506Ere22Qg6kGw==","fsize":186377,"resto":122646311,"id":"692cYtKD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122649695,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)18:35:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Moreover, truncheons and batons are legal for self defense in Massachusetts.

Some 70 people attended, and a second such meeting was advertised for 13 November in the Eberlbrau beer hall.

There was little organization or structure to this group. The group was also called the Ordnertruppen around this time.[6] More than a year later, on 3 August 1921, Hitler redefined the group as the &quot;Gymnastic and Sports Division&quot; of the party (Turn- und Sportabteilung), perhaps to avoid trouble with the government.[7] It was by now well recognized as an appropriate, even necessary, function or organ of the party. The future SA developed by organizing and formalizing the groups of ex-soldiers and beer hall brawlers who were to protect gatherings of the Nazi Party from disruptions from Social Democrats (SPD) and Communists (KPD) and to disrupt meetings of the other political parties. By September 1921 the name Sturmabteilung was being used informally for the group.[8] Hitler was the official head of the Nazi Party by this time.[9]<br><br>On 4 November 1921 the Nazi Party held a large public meeting in the Munich Hofbr\u00e4uhaus, which also attracted many Reds and other enemies of the Nazis. After Hitler had spoken for some time, the meeting erupted into a melee in which a small company of SA thrashed the opposition. The Nazis called this event the Saalschlacht (&quot;meeting hall battle&quot;), and it assumed legendary proportions in SA lore with the passage of time. Thereafter, the group was officially known as the Sturmabteilung.[8]<br><br>Remind you of something?

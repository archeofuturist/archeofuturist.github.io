These are equipped with rudimentary nuclear warheads. <br><br>\u201cThis is the principal, the most important and dangerous, threat to the United States&quot; -- former CIA chief. <br><br>For those who are unfamiliar with NEMP, see here: http:\/\/www.washingtonexaminer.com\/e<wbr>xpert-north-korea-threatens-emp-nuk<wbr>e-attack-on-us\/article\/2614739<br><br>Detonating these above the continental US will cause a NEMP (nuclear emp) and the radius will cover most of the nation. Pic related. <br><br>You have heard of an EMP, which can be caused naturally as well. A Nuclear EMP is several times worse.<br><br>No food delivery, no medicine, no electricity, no \/pol\/ of course. <br><br>The debris in space will also knock out most of the earth&#039;s lower satellites. You need to understand that Mutually Assured Destruction is an incentive to North Korea, not a deterrent, as they welcome death if it is for an &quot;honorable&quot; cause. <br><br>Foreign powers and United Nations would likely be on our soil in the first week for &quot;humanitarian relief.&quot;<br><br>When North Korea says they can destroy the world with two or three nukes, they do mean that literally. It is just that we are not given the complete picture by Western media broadcasts. <br><br>Trump is not in a position where it makes sense to tell the public about this, as the panic would be impossible to contain. Think food riots and looting, millions from the cities fleeing inland. <br><br>Any attack against North Korea will have to be a quick decapitation strike to prevent them from detonating whatever they have in the satellites. Extreme risk. <br><br>This is what the Obama Admin briefed Trump on, back in November-December when they met inside the WH. Trump looked like a ghost when he realized the seriousness of the situation. <br><br>At this point, whatever is in the satellites is somewhat of an x factor. But an attentive observer will note N Korea&#039;s tone has changed from saber rattling to collected, unflinching confidence.","filename":"Untitled","ext":".png","w":623,"h":425,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":170,"tim":1493159700759,"time":1493159700,"md5":"F6+stjlHy\/Wg8ZcGgYykww==","fsize":462148,"resto":0,"id":"kou+vyWV","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-you-need-to-know-about-north-korea-its-worse","country_name":"United States","replies":287,"images":58,"unique_ips":154,"tail_size":50},{"no":122799471,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)18:37:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122799150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122799150<\/a><br> please listen to this man he knows what is correct<br>please America need to nuclear destroy North Korea immediate and South Korea too because there are tunnels and they might escape","time":1493159843,"resto":122799150,"id":"cdAwz9vt","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":122800651,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)18:46:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122799150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122799150<\/a><br>Weapons of mass destruction <br><br>IN SPACE!!!!!! <br><br>No need for proof goyim, bombs away","time":1493160371,"resto":122799150,"id":"REWn1VFX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122801067,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)18:49:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122799150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122799150<\/a><br>A bunch of rice farmers<br>Vs<br>The most militarily advance nation on the planet<br><br>Kim&#039;s as good as nuclear glass at this point.","time":1493160559,"resto":122799150,"id":"\/GfRWOAd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122801212,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)18:50:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122800651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122800651<\/a><br><br>This is actually not neocon bullshit (for once). <br><br>It&#039;s a pretty serious threat. <br><br>See the link I shared as a starting point, and research more from there.

Sixty-five minutes after launch, it\u2019s passing a few hundred miles west of Washington DC.

That it might be something harmful\u2014and no heat shield would be needed if it were supposed to be triggered in space\u2014is getting terrifyingly easier to consider.<br><br>So knowing what\u2019s aboard that satellite becomes a vital issue of national security. And my personal experience in North Korea on that very question troubles me more and more.<br><br>At the satellite control center we visited in 2012 a few days after the launch site visit, I was the guest of honor of the center director, since I was the only genuine \u201crocket scientist\u201d attached to the press tour. <br><br> No such photos of the payload installation on any such satellite launch have ever been released.<br><br>For me, the issue was merely a point of technical curiosity, as well as pushing to see where I encountered resistance.

Back during the 9\/11 days the drills were ran via military exercises which gave very little flexibility and due to this requires the &quot;go-live&quot; (real) element to take place at the same time as the simulated one (overlapped). In the aftermath of 9\/11 this was changed however, with the creation of agencies such as DHS (small scale via HSEEP) as well as FEMA COOP and USNORTHCOM (large scale) as well as a few entities to control propaganda during and after the fact such as CIA&#039;s Special Activities Division as well as their National Clandestine Services all of which were created in the immediate aftermath of 9\/11. The creation of these new elements allowed them to have much more flexibility with future false flags which is why now most false flags happen slight prior to or slightly after the actual exercise run date. This is done to help avoid suspicion in the aftermath, as having a drill running at the same time as a real event actually takes place was getting hard for them to explain away, but having a real event happens slightly before (with not many knowing the drill is scheduled) or slightly after (when most have already forgot) it allows them to do these false flags with less people seeing them for what they are. The time prior\/after can vary such as Boston Bombing which was ran as a (so called) live event 2 months prior to the drill (USB13), while Sandy Hook had its (so called) live event take place 1 day after its drill (TOPOFF12 during its switchover to CAPSTONE13), and the LAX shooting had its (so called) live event 3 days after its drill (USC13) and so on...","time":1493168226,"resto":122799150,"id":"Gyzp9H+R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122817304,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)20:57:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122808687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122808687<\/a><br>then leave faggot.","time":1493168235,"resto":122799150,"id":"ftiVLbh5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122817317,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)20:57:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/discord.gg\/buhYx","time":1493168240,"resto":122799150,"id":"QH4pAsGV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122817355,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)20:57:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122817005\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122817005<\/a><br><br>To be clear, it passes over every day.

Anyways circling back to Gotham Shield (entire exercise series runs from April 18 - May 5 with an extra aspect from May 8 -12, and the nuclear detonation aspect scheduled April 24-26) this means you will almost certainly not see much action on the 24th and if anything did happen relating to the mock nuclear detonation or EMP, it would likely be several days after this date (closer to the end of April or early May, with May 1st standing out the most for me since that will be the first weekday after the gov shutdown (which is almost certainly going to happen) and will also be the same day NK will launch their first ever ICBM (which is also almost certainly going to happen) to be used as the scapegoat, and for its occult history and meaning (2nd highest satanic holiday demanding fire sacrifice, founding date of Illuminati, and literal translation meaning &quot;international distress&quot; among other things).

Well the 2 main elements that are to be used to manage and run the large scale ones (FEMA COOP &amp; USNORTHCOM) just so happened to be the primary entities involved in the Gotham Shield 2017 exercise (FEMA COOP manages the entire drill series as the entire thing falls within the FEMA COOP CAPSTONE annual exercise series (formerly known as Eagle Shield)), while USNORTHCOM is the primary activation and response entity within the exercise). Oh and one last thing, General Ralph E. Eberhart who was head of NORAD on 9\/11 was chosen as the first commander of USNORTHCOM (basically it was packed full of their good ol boys from top to bottom from the get go). I just wanted to point some this out for those that were not aware. Keep up the good work, and stay safe.<br><br> And just an FYI the Nuclear Secrecy website detonation map is less accurate then the one provided in the Gotham Shield documents. The reason for this is the Nuclear Secrecy one is based on a ground level nuclear detonation (such as a vehicle based nuclear device), while Gotham Shield instead is to simulate an atmospheric nuclear detonation (such as from nuclear warhead in an ICMB) meaning its fatality map is far more accurate (and is the reason why the GS17 blast map doesn&#039;t have any dark red in it, there is no direct blast zone since its mid-air). Anyways just wanted to point that out, oh and again I will state on April 25th North Korea is almsot certainly going to do their 6th nuclear test (anniversary of the creation of the Korean Military), and then on May 1st is almost certainly going to do their first ever ICBM launch (anniversary of the establishment of the DPRK with Kim Il-sung as leader)... ust something to keep in mind when analyzing the whole Gotham Shield situation.","time":1493168319,"resto":122799150,"id":"Gyzp9H+R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122817539,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)20:59:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122815070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122815070<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;WND<\/span><br><br>Jesus Christ \/pol\/ <br>You really are the most retarded board on 4chan","filename":"conor-laughing","ext":".jpg","w":730,"h":380,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1493168345187,"time":1493168345,"md5":"2L2iEU4GAOyM8j+yRCtR8g==","fsize":24089,"resto":122799150,"id":"FJXwG4Yc","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":122817658,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:00:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122817355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122817355<\/a><br>It passes over various points.

The primary exercise that stands out as the most likely to go live as a false flag is centered around the Vibrant Response exercise series within Gotham Shield, which is &quot;the U.S. Northern Command\u2019s (USNORTHCOM) annual field training exercise for chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and high-yield explosive consequence management forces designed to improve their ability to respond to catastrophic incidents&quot;.<br>2. Vibrant Response is scheduled to take part in 2 waves, April 25th (phase 1) and May 1st (phase 2). For anyone who has been reading my many comments on Gotham Shield you would already know that April 25th and May 1st are the 2 most likely dates for them to try to pull something off (April 25 being anniversary of NK military, likely date of NK&#039;s 6th nuke test, date the USS Carl Vinson carrier arrives which is the same ship that is said to of buried at sea Bin Laden after his FAKE death in 2011 on none other then May 1st, and more...), as well as May 1st (anniversary of the establishment of DPRK, likely date of 1st ever NK ICBM launch, Satanic Baltaine fire sacrifice date, Founding date of Illuminati, referred to as May Day or mayday which means international distress\/emergency, and more...).<br>3. The documents exercise planning timeline has the dates April 25 and May 1st for Vibrant Response phase 1 and 2, but the exercise conduct timeline and strategic level overview only shows Vibrant Response phase 1 (April 25) and doesn&#039;t mention the May 1st Vibrant Response phase 2 at all.","filename":"captcha","ext":".png","w":407,"h":584,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493168481451,"time":1493168481,"md5":"pe8jqN3LMoyDA4rqDLGJ+Q==","fsize":229252,"resto":122799150,"id":"Gyzp9H+R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122817997,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:02:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122817850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122817850<\/a><br>4. On top of that the exercise planning timeline also includes a followup element after Vibrant Response phase 2 on May 1st which is unique from all the main named exercise series within the Gotham Shield framework (instead it has a grey flag while all other exercises aspects are color coded within their main basket (such as Vibrant Response is yellow and Vital Archer is blue), it has no association with the other named exercises (doesn&#039;t fall under Vibrant Response or Vital Archer or any others), has a generic exercise name of &quot;Recovery Exercise Execution&quot; (not a fancy name like the others), and for some reason is also not included in the exercise conduct timeline and strategic level overview (just like Vibrant Response phase 2 isn&#039;t)).<br><br>So what&#039;s the point you ask? The point is this further confirms the date I have been watching the most (May 1st) as the one to be most cautious of.

With that in mind it is interesting to note that in late 2015 Congress promptly cut funding for an advanced missile defense system that was deployed across the Washington D.C. area during the last few years to prevent against a rising threat from cruise missile strikes. The system, which is called the Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor (or JLENS) was a high-tech radar system that casted a wide-ranging protective net across the Capitol region to detect and intercept missiles or enemy planes before they could reach American soil. Even though top level insiders said that &quot;the system has proven critical to the capital region\u2019s defense against potential cruise missile attacks from rogue nations such as Iran, North Korea, and Russia&quot;, the system was unfunded anyways and permanently deactivated. and go figure just after this was done was the same time that North Korea showed its first video of a simulated preemptive nuclear strike against the US, which specifically depicted Washington D.C as the simulated nuclear target shown.","filename":"1485059802893","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":983,"tn_w":95,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493168656872,"time":1493168656,"md5":"7Glc4dPFXsTznBrXrWZBXA==","fsize":134792,"resto":122799150,"id":"Gyzp9H+R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122818308,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:04:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122817048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122817048<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Kwang<wbr>my%C5%8Fngs%C5%8Fng-1<br><br>since august 1998","time":1493168673,"resto":122799150,"id":"v+oy9S9p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122818329,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:04:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122813318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122813318<\/a><br>Thanks, I was getting worried there&#039;s no one with a brain left","time":1493168689,"resto":122799150,"id":"wNCJpwH6","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122818333,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)21:04:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122815056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122815056<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/www.n2yo.com\/?s=41332<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wrong direction<\/span><br>are you daft?<br>Look at its direction right now.

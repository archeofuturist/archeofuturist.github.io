These are equipped with rudimentary nuclear warheads. <br><br>\u201cThis is the principal, the most important and dangerous, threat to the United States&quot; -- former CIA chief. <br><br>For those who are unfamiliar with NEMP, see here: http:\/\/www.washingtonexaminer.com\/e<wbr>xpert-north-korea-threatens-emp-nuk<wbr>e-attack-on-us\/article\/2614739<br><br>Detonating these above the continental US will cause a NEMP (nuclear emp) and the radius will cover most of the nation. Pic related. <br><br>You have heard of an EMP, which can be caused naturally as well. A Nuclear EMP is several times worse.<br><br>No food delivery, no medicine, no electricity, no \/pol\/ of course. <br><br>The debris in space will also knock out most of the earth&#039;s lower satellites. You need to understand that Mutually Assured Destruction is an incentive to North Korea, not a deterrent, as they welcome death if it is for an &quot;honorable&quot; cause. <br><br>Foreign powers and United Nations would likely be on our soil in the first week for &quot;humanitarian relief.&quot;<br><br>When North Korea says they can destroy the world with two or three nukes, they do mean that literally. It is just that we are not given the complete picture by Western media broadcasts. <br><br>Trump is not in a position where it makes sense to tell the public about this, as the panic would be impossible to contain. Think food riots and looting, millions from the cities fleeing inland. <br><br>Any attack against North Korea will have to be a quick decapitation strike to prevent them from detonating whatever they have in the satellites. Extreme risk. <br><br>This is what the Obama Admin briefed Trump on, back in November-December when they met inside the WH. Trump looked like a ghost when he realized the seriousness of the situation. <br><br>At this point, whatever is in the satellites is somewhat of an x factor. But an attentive observer will note N Korea&#039;s tone has changed from saber rattling to collected, unflinching confidence.","filename":"Untitled","ext":".png","w":623,"h":425,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":170,"tim":1493159700759,"time":1493159700,"md5":"F6+stjlHy\/Wg8ZcGgYykww==","fsize":462148,"resto":0,"id":"kou+vyWV","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-you-need-to-know-about-north-korea-its-worse","country_name":"United States","replies":145,"images":24,"unique_ips":86,"tail_size":50},{"no":122799471,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)18:37:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122799150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122799150<\/a><br> please listen to this man he knows what is correct<br>please America need to nuclear destroy North Korea immediate and South Korea too because there are tunnels and they might escape","time":1493159843,"resto":122799150,"id":"cdAwz9vt","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":122800651,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)18:46:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122799150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122799150<\/a><br>Weapons of mass destruction <br><br>IN SPACE!!!!!! <br><br>No need for proof goyim, bombs away","time":1493160371,"resto":122799150,"id":"REWn1VFX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122801067,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)18:49:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122799150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122799150<\/a><br>A bunch of rice farmers<br>Vs<br>The most militarily advance nation on the planet<br><br>Kim&#039;s as good as nuclear glass at this point.","time":1493160559,"resto":122799150,"id":"\/GfRWOAd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122801212,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)18:50:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122800651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122800651<\/a><br><br>This is actually not neocon bullshit (for once). <br><br>It&#039;s a pretty serious threat. <br><br>See the link I shared as a starting point, and research more from there.

Sixty-five minutes after launch, it\u2019s passing a few hundred miles west of Washington DC.

That it might be something harmful\u2014and no heat shield would be needed if it were supposed to be triggered in space\u2014is getting terrifyingly easier to consider.<br><br>So knowing what\u2019s aboard that satellite becomes a vital issue of national security. And my personal experience in North Korea on that very question troubles me more and more.<br><br>At the satellite control center we visited in 2012 a few days after the launch site visit, I was the guest of honor of the center director, since I was the only genuine \u201crocket scientist\u201d attached to the press tour. <br><br> No such photos of the payload installation on any such satellite launch have ever been released.<br><br>For me, the issue was merely a point of technical curiosity, as well as pushing to see where I encountered resistance. But now that North Korea can build unshielded nuclear weapons that could fit into that same payload shroud and wind up in orbit an hour away from American airspace, the issue has become a lot more vital, and pressing.<br><br>full account: http:\/\/www.thespacereview.com\/artic<wbr>le\/3164\/1","time":1493162105,"resto":122799150,"id":"kou+vyWV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122804615,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:15:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122803122\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122803122<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If they were a real threat we would have already eliminated them<\/span><br>Why the fuck do you think we&#039;re going to war with them tomorrow.","time":1493162128,"resto":122799150,"id":"88p0qSx2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122804716,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:16:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122799150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122799150<\/a><br>This is literaly homefront","filename":"homefront-004","ext":".jpg","w":1800,"h":1151,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":79,"tim":1493162181385,"time":1493162181,"md5":"s73d1W331RTUst7x03Ipbg==","fsize":1228082,"resto":122799150,"id":"Ad6t4WEy","country":"MX","m_img":1,"country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122804895,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:17:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122799150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122799150<\/a><br>Wouldn&#039;t we just shoot them down\/deactivate them if this were the case?<br>Not that hard to do.<br>You overestimate the faggots.","time":1493162267,"resto":122799150,"id":"T6tYPGMF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122805053,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:18:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122804494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122804494<\/a><br>Shit will get fucked up, but the internet will survive, I&#039;m sure a lot of data will be lost though.<br><br>EMP shielding is something the military has spent decades on preparations, and little on publicly discussing the matter.<br><br>What the MIC wants\/needs to keep, they&#039;ll have preserved.","time":1493162339,"resto":122799150,"id":"7ByQ3MwV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122805125,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:19:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122799150\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122799150<\/a><br>So, if we know these things have warheads on them.

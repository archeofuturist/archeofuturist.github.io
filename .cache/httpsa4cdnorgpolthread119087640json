But if you check out stats, only 2-3% of American who identify as whites have black admixture, and the average admixture among this group is 4% (keep in mind there are a bunch of nonwhites who try and identify as white). Had the spaniards or portuguese colonized USA, shit would look much different. The English were genius and founded the concepts of freedom of speech and right to bear arms. Also had the most strict culture surrounding misgenation. It&#039;s a shame to see England falling, though Brexit might be a bounce back.<br><br>In a way, the one drop rule is still used in the USA. quadroons and octaroons will still identify as light skin niggas.","time":1490988066,"resto":119087640,"id":"YSVdNWas","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

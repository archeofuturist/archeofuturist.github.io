For starters, Trump is President.<br><br>Did you guys notice what techniques they brought to our humble congolese command and control bulletin board?<br><br>1) Forum sliding: any given time, specially when there are bad news regarding the democrats or anything at all that goes against their groupthink they they go overboard with it<br><br>2) Consensus cracking: see the &quot;I voted for him but those remarks by his cabinet \/ this temporary setback \/ this MSM allegation will really get him impeached \/ such and such should be fired&quot; that people are bringing here. I&#039;m fairly sure the first time it arrive people actually felt the need to believe it but now it is probably just shills shilling shills<br><br>3) Topic Dilution: on \/pol\/ in general (doubles as sliding): in general, wild gooze chases, on \/trumpgen\/, gossip, pitting groups against each other.<br><br>4) Information collection: seen only rarely in here, &quot;let&#039;s make a lions guard for Trump \/ lets make ANTICOM&quot; and &quot;what would you do if Trump is impeached \/ is killed&quot;. Also &quot;let&#039;s access this site \/ app \/ plugin for more info&quot;. Don&#039;t fall for it folks.<br><br>5) Anger Trolling: our bread and butter, just see any post with a Finland flag beside it. Actually, it is our main weapon too so it is all fair games in this matter. Just don&#039;t answer the trolls.<br><br>6) Happened on many boards on 4chan when the happening and GG broke out. I don&#039;t know about \/pol\/ but \/v\/ and \/sp\/, for instance, that&#039;s a given. We are not very susceptible, being an anonymous chan anyway but on reddit, oh boy, I wouldn&#039;t touch that mess with a 100 feet pole covered in insulant and fire retardant. Social media in general, ever worse. Honestly, a mod got recently fired (in the rwss debacle) for politicising his enforcement of the rules so we are not immune to that either<br><br>Stay smart, stay safe, stay beautiful and stay out of trouble.","filename":"1491425681028","ext":".gif","w":619,"h":463,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491488731471,"time":1491488731,"md5":"lbTdoD614zqmyY5fn7AwRg==","fsize":418989,"resto":119747055,"id":"JdYz\/R\/X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119747284,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)10:25:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119743793#p119745308\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119745308<\/a> <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;so he&#039;s not taking over? and who the fuck is mike conaway?<\/span><br><br>Wait, wait, they are putting Mike Conaway as the head if the investigation?

Being that it is the focal point for the distribution of all wealth in the United States, competing with anyone close to the bank is like playing monopoly against a guy who gets money under the table from the bank. No matter how good you are, you can only win against those who aren&#039;t close to the bank. The corrupt insiders will use their access to limitless money to trounce you and always bounce back from any set back. All courtesy of the American worker who subsidizes their practices by creating things of actual value that the bankers harvest with the boom\/bust cycle.<br><br>Get fucked international finance.","filename":"1424486940905","ext":".jpg","w":680,"h":497,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1491262823275,"time":1491262823,"md5":"SVK4HUh5\/i\/R218c1VgmVg==","fsize":170337,"resto":119398244,"id":"CNv2OsdL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119399445,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)19:43:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119398428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119398428<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;excellent slide thread<\/span><br>It is a real issue dumb ass.

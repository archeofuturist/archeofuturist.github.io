And to test the negative proposition one merely has to look in the box: since crows being in the box (p) entails that we would see crows when we look in the box (q), if we find q false, we know that p is false. Thus, we have proved a negative. Of course, we could be mistaken about what we saw, or about what a crow is, or things could have changed after we looked, but within the limits of our knowing anything at all, and given a full understanding of what a proposition means and thus entails, we can easily prove a negative in such a case.&quot; --Richard Carrier, judeo-atheist intellectual","time":1490708624,"resto":118645165,"id":"yYaxJpIu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118649661,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)09:44:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118649305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118649305<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;at some point in the past.<\/span><br><br>Believers exist right now and will continue to far beyond our lifetime.","filename":"saudi-arabia-story_650_051915111646","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":386,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":74,"tim":1490708654815,"time":1490708654,"md5":"31qRExkqlRhTAkIofyT8EA==","fsize":16786,"resto":118645165,"id":"fBRHJvdH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118649716,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)09:44:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118646624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118646624<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Until a god believer proves the existence of god, I don&#039;t have to believe in in god.<\/span><br>This is perfectly fine.

You lose some viewers, but if you justify your position and you&#039;re smart about the way you present it, you really won&#039;t lose as many as you might think. <br><br>It may seem counter-intuitive to do so, but the problem with taking people on the intellectual journey with you is that people will lose the anchor that is your perspective. They&#039;ll stop watching you because they don&#039;t know really what you believe and they don&#039;t know what to expect. If you change your view suddenly, they immediately know what your perspective is and there&#039;s no period of being &quot;unsure&quot;. <br><br>If you need an example, just think back to a time when you&#039;re about to watch a video where you have no idea what opinions you&#039;re going to hear. The fear of the unknown is a real barrier for most people.","time":1490712043,"resto":118645165,"id":"\/ZS+xsiA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118654587,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)10:40:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118654402\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118654402<\/a><br>That&#039;s like speaking out against Catholics while being Protestant.

And to test the negative proposition one merely has to look in the box: since crows being in the box (p) entails that we would see crows when we look in the box (q), if we find q false, we know that p is false. Thus, we have proved a negative. Of course, we could be mistaken about what we saw, or about what a crow is, or things could have changed after we looked, but within the limits of our knowing anything at all, and given a full understanding of what a proposition means and thus entails, we can easily prove a negative in such a case.&quot; --Richard Carrier, judeo-atheist intellectual","time":1490708624,"resto":118645165,"id":"yYaxJpIu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118649661,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)09:44:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118649305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118649305<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;at some point in the past.<\/span><br><br>Believers exist right now and will continue to far beyond our lifetime.","filename":"saudi-arabia-story_650_051915111646","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":386,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":74,"tim":1490708654815,"time":1490708654,"md5":"31qRExkqlRhTAkIofyT8EA==","fsize":16786,"resto":118645165,"id":"fBRHJvdH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118649716,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)09:44:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118646624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118646624<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Until a god believer proves the existence of god, I don&#039;t have to believe in in god.<\/span><br>This is perfectly fine.

I know what you&#039;re thinking: It&#039;s dead, it&#039;s old news. But that shitty pigeon keeps popping up here and there, and it&#039;s always accompanied by posts that look like they came straight from reddit or even facebook.","filename":"1490289789279","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":415,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":148,"tim":1491805049443,"time":1491805049,"md5":"llEq5qw+qGUIIy43mfGMCg==","fsize":46966,"resto":0,"id":"ffVflkfv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sign-youre-talking-to-an-outsider","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":120403392,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)02:18:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;posting memes<\/span><br>Probably the lowest IQ thing you can do on \/pol\/","time":1491805109,"resto":120403299,"id":"FhyEER9K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120403512,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)02:19:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"AUTOMATED POSTS ARE THE NORM<br><br>IF YOU&#039;RE A REAL USER READING THIS POST ABANDON BOARD THE DREAM IS DEAD","time":1491805192,"resto":120403299,"id":"rh\/8Lyu8","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120403576,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)02:20:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120403512\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120403512<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ABANDON BOARD<\/span><br>And go where?","time":1491805232,"resto":120403299,"id":"ffVflkfv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120403596,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)02:20:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120403392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120403392<\/a><br>for you","time":1491805249,"resto":120403299,"id":"8UBYkoBo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120403696,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)02:21:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120403299\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120403299<\/a>","filename":"trash dove","ext":".jpg","w":940,"h":592,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1491805306376,"time":1491805306,"md5":"L26j65hCl2ooNsbSY++JuQ==","fsize":190285,"resto":120403299,"id":"CTM\/uFdf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120403871,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)02:23:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120403392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120403392<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120403512\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120403512<\/a><br>sharing blue eh?<br><br><a href=\"#p120403299\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120403299<\/a><br>yeah its fucking shareblue.

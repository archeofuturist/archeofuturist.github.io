The tagline reads &quot;Re-civilize yourself&quot; and the man appears to be about to vigorously throw away his so-called uncivilized self. It appears as part of a campaign where other images showing white men do not use the word &#039;re-civilize&#039;. The advertisement is criticised as being racist towards African-Americans, as it is interpreted as implying that they are uncivilized people. Also, the ad&#039;s tagline &quot;Recivilize yourself&quot; is worded as an instruction or order given to the black man; this may be interpreted as a reference to African-Americans&#039; past slavery, and in the ad the black man appears to be carrying out this instruction\/order.[14] Nivea reacted to the allegations of racism by withdrawing the advertisement and issuing a statement admitting to causing offence.[15]<\/span><br><br>Can they be more based?","time":1492663998,"resto":121949178,"id":"znw+CV5A","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121955011,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)00:59:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Too bad they don&#039;t make bar soap.","time":1492664349,"resto":121949178,"id":"EKOtXGZl","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

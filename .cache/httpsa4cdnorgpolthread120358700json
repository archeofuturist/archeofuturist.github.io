Retards are literally acting like Assad is Hitler and they are preventing the Holocaust. Even if he did use those chemical weapons (which already is dubious) how is that fundamentally better than bombing civilians with &quot;traditional ordinance?&quot; Because some stupid Genova conventions? <br><br>This bullshit western philosophy is the height of moral relativism and hypocrisy.

But I love my country Yes, there is inequality and crime and terrible things happening in Germany and in the rest of Europe. Like everywhere else.<br><br>But if you are a bit familiar with Merkel, you should know she is one of the best, if not the best policy makers in the world. Since her election, German economy, aid for those in need and pretty much everything else has improved a lot.<br><br>As to the refugees, of course they are an incredible burden for Germany and other European countries. But what do you want to do if not let them in? You can&#039;t close the borders (see Schengen and the most fundamental elements of the EU). In my opinion, you can&#039;t send them back or just let them die on their own, because that&#039;s not only cruel but also selfish as f***. We have the capabilities of taking them in, the majority of these people are the most thankful and giving members in our whole society. And if other EU countries, or the US, or just anybody would have agreed to at least take in a fraction of the number Germany took in, no country would have been in much trouble to give them a new home.<br><br>And what about the terrorists? First off, the majority of terrorists aren&#039;t refugees. Check that on Wikipedia or whereever you like. Most of them are radicalised at home or in the internet. And those who came as refugees would have found another way, no doubt. It&#039;s easy to get to Europe. This place is so open in any way, you just cannot give 100% security. As many of you might know, &quot;They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.&quot;.<br><br>So for god&#039;s sake let these people live here, don&#039;t blame an entire group that is 99.9% peaceful.","filename":"1485631631778","ext":".png","w":614,"h":1020,"tn_w":150,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490965037078,"time":1490965037,"md5":"ZwtqreeuW9ooiqOaYAiTyA==","fsize":298397,"resto":0,"id":"hVczy6nQ","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sorry-but-i-have-to-let-off-steam-here","country_name":"Germany","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":8},{"no":119053801,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)08:59:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119053625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119053625<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;let these people live here<\/span><br><br>No.","time":1490965166,"resto":119053625,"id":"oA3sbKid","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119053896,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)09:00:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119053625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119053625<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I moved to Canada for few months, years maybe<\/span><br>What the fuck are you saying Hans","time":1490965238,"resto":119053625,"id":"XwFND9Yc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119054048,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)09:02:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; You can&#039;t close the borders<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; you can&#039;t send them back or just let them die on their own<\/span><br><br>Wrong cunt, we&#039;re full so they&#039;ll all have to fuck off.","filename":"1485421768431","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":566,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1490965340341,"time":1490965340,"md5":"VObbOf7iIGvTiKYNOWB8iQ==","fsize":62486,"resto":119053625,"id":"86fLjcwP","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119054392,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)09:06:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119053625\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119053625<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Most of them are radicalised at home or in the internet.

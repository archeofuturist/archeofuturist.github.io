I have no basis for assuming that her story is not true, but the point goes beyond that. If one hypothesizes that the woman&#039;s story is fictitious from A to Z, that in no way diminishes the avalanche of human rights violations.&quot;<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tom_L<wbr>antos<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nayir<wbr>ah_(testimony)","filename":"Nayirah_%28testimony%29[1]","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491658180141,"time":1491658180,"md5":"Q79jTstEOp35fV7A5QAyeA==","fsize":11804,"resto":120130086,"id":"\/IT\/EMzF","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"}]}

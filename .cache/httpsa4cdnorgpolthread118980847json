Also energy costs are much higher than they should be because electricity has to be imported from other states.

Isn&#039;t it fine to have a city that has nicer areas that DON&#039;T have homeless people bothering your shit all the time. I&#039;m all for the streetwise guys, but not so much for the kinds of &quot;shitting in the street&quot; stuff you find on lower wacker.<br><br>I got cucked into getting a degree in social services and now am fucked and learning a trade skill because there&#039;s no way Im going to try to shoulder the weight of some fuck ups while getting paid shit and getting no resources to do my job. Now the only people who really want to clean up the city are the churches.","time":1490915893,"resto":118980847,"id":"meYN3DAB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118985359,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)19:19:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118984985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118984985<\/a><br>I live in Hyde Park, near university of chicago and near the point","time":1490915953,"resto":118980847,"id":"ppnTIevl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118985596,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)19:21:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118985359\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118985359<\/a><br>You should go take a shit on Obongo&#039;s lawn.","time":1490916066,"resto":118980847,"id":"w226T+J2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118985669,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)19:21:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118984983\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118984983<\/a><br>Lincoln park is nice.

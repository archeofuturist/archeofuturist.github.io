I&#039;m fairly sure the first time it arrive people actually felt the need to believe it but now it is probably just shills shilling shills<br><br>3) Topic Dilution: on \/pol\/ in general (doubles as sliding): in general, wild gooze chases, on \/trumpgen\/, gossip, pitting groups against each other.<br><br>4) Information collection: seen only rarely in here, &quot;let&#039;s make a lions guard for Trump \/ lets make ANTICOM&quot; and &quot;what would you do if Trump is impeached \/ is killed&quot;. Also &quot;let&#039;s access this site \/ app \/ plugin for more info&quot;.

Got redpilled over the election and I am seeing old friends I have and family lose their minds and become full blown sjws when they were normal before. I have a even worse time speaking to others and I am terrified to bring up my beliefs for the fear of being hated. Does anyone else feel this way? Is it normal to feel isolated because of your political bias? I feel like I don&#039;t fit in with society at all anymore.","filename":"1487822482659","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":940,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":195,"tim":1493710951236,"time":1493710951,"md5":"YVtIFSyk\/+qVNnq6iXIQKA==","fsize":320193,"resto":0,"id":"74gzQtex","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"anyone-else-feel-like-their-political-view-has","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":3,"unique_ips":13},{"no":123743043,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:46:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123742793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123742793<\/a><br>bump","filename":"1488433057539","ext":".png","w":480,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493711161637,"time":1493711161,"md5":"d5qD78oHeYi2OQUYqjnHmw==","fsize":236627,"resto":123742793,"id":"74gzQtex","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123743062,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:46:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123742793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123742793<\/a><br>You didn&#039;t change, they did","time":1493711177,"resto":123742793,"id":"1NGO25Nd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123743109,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)03:47:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123742793\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123742793<\/a><br>If you have any charisma, and are capable of arguing your views effectively without inflamatory language you need not fear telling the truth.

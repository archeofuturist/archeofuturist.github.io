Is it that all jews are part of the global problem, or would it be only select jews with power and influence, being that jews are apparently God&#039;s chosen people, it could make sense for the elites to try to control the world with a superiority complex. There&#039;s also something about an ancient Jewish law book which was used, but I&#039;m not sure if Jews nowadays even use it anymore.","filename":"541","ext":".png","w":600,"h":584,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":243,"tim":1493260270727,"time":1493260270,"md5":"f82J27zawg2oG+9dMiZ7oQ==","fsize":578490,"resto":0,"id":"bpboUTIL","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"jews","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

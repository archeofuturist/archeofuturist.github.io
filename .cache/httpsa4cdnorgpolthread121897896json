It&#039;s only been over the past 20 years as Democrats have held near constant power that it&#039;s gone blue.<br><br>The same is true of the state of Virginia, but now Republicans dominate the legislature there and a Republican will probably be governor this time next year.<br><br>The thing people need to understand is that Democrats have fucked with voting laws in every single state to make it easy for people to &quot;accidentally&quot; vote twice, for felons to &quot;accidentally&quot; vote (or in VA they just outright pardoned 200,000 of them to let them vote in 2016) and let non-citizens &quot;accidentally&quot; vote.<br><br>Republicans having absolute control at all levels of government and initiating massive voting law reform will fuck the Democrats even harder. No more illegal votes, no more Democratic victories. Those fuckers should have played by the rules.","time":1492639820,"resto":121897896,"id":"6434l7AZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121905195,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:10:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"Anybody have one of these for when their only comeback is &quot;Because you&#039;re jelly&quot;","filename":"1479252603102","ext":".png","w":519,"h":436,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":105,"tim":1492639823068,"time":1492639823,"md5":"xZqr44P1n22IvJcfJhOTPg==","fsize":21258,"resto":121897896,"id":"u21jt9hk","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121905271,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:10:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121904133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121904133<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ugg boots<\/span><br>Thanks anon","filename":"IMG_2189","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":800,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492639859021,"time":1492639859,"md5":"3cGlt49\/PO0BoCheL9HRbA==","fsize":94871,"resto":121897896,"id":"EfyOCR80","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121905288,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:11:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"NEW THREAD<br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/121904199#p121904199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121904199<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/121904199#p121904199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121904199<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/121904199#p121904199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121904199<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/121904199#p121904199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121904199<\/a><br>I GOT DIGITS<br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/121904199#p121904199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121904199<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/121904199#p121904199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121904199<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/121904199#p121904199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121904199<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/121904199#p121904199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121904199<\/a>","filename":"1485836246679","ext":".jpg","w":1152,"h":1671,"tn_w":86,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492639865373,"time":1492639865,"md5":"kfDGEA+h2+5PuQJIBMatxA==","fsize":186932,"resto":121897896,"id":"2j43K2Y3","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121905304,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:11:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121904637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121904637<\/a><br>kek<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;DHS Blue Campaign<\/span><br>about sex trafficking<br><br>tfw Guy gets pizza","filename":"1489261239159","ext":".jpg","w":615,"h":409,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492639869807,"time":1492639869,"md5":"Afkho0s39AoqJfKDLD3f8A==","fsize":21930,"resto":121897896,"id":"E5J2ic5d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121905475,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:12:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"Please buy my new book<br><br>KILLING MY CAREER","filename":"Bill","ext":".jpg","w":1536,"h":1280,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1492639939730,"time":1492639939,"md5":"X44Bqf7JqhT7F2yELKpO3w==","fsize":100124,"resto":121897896,"id":"vJ\/FghuD","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121905500,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:12:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121904214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121904214<\/a><br>he wanted to be a spic nigger thats what happens","time":1492639950,"resto":121897896,"id":"Bcp14pZu","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

Gamergate showed that leftism meant the death and humiliation of everything, even your silly hobbies. People will not usually fight if they have a place to retreat to, Sun Tzu wrote that you should leave your enemy at least the hope of escape so that they will not fight like cornered animals and maul you even in your victory.

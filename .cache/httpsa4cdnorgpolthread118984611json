I was in a gifted program the school ran and everyone in that program were sent to an off site facility to take the test. We didn&#039;t pay anything but the tax payers probably did. It took a couple hours and I ended up scoring a 137. I was invited to join but I didn&#039;t because I disliked my fellow students who were also offered membership (a dyke and a few hyper nerds I hated).<br>I&#039;m an old fag now and I have no regrets about never joining. <br>As for the test, the biggest difference between online tests and the mensa test was the assumption of knowledge about some subjects that the mensa test had baked into it. The free online iq tests all keep words and concepts simple where the mensa test has many elements of required knowledge that is not inherently associated with intelligence. This is why I can see where some make the argument that iq tests are not valid but it&#039;s kind of unfair because I think the underlying theory for testing iq is valid but requiring pre-knowledge is kind of bullshit. <br>Oh and I voted for Trump and I&#039;ve been a libertarian republican for my entire adult life. Also, I enjoyed reading Ayn Rand and thought she had some solid ideas. I am ex military and I prefer working with my hands (auto repair, carpentry, etc) over soft hands careers.

With Fascism there isn&#039;t any room for international bureaucracies or one world government. Germany was hammered with sanctions immediately after they elected Hitler because his policies were detrimental to the so called international community. The arbiters of the &quot;new world order&quot; then used their British, Soviet, and American attack dogs to demolish this state by burning it to the ground and occupying it for another 50 years. There isn&#039;t anything globalist about Fascism at all, its the exact opposite. Any Fascist or quasi Fascist leader is turned into an international pariah, eventually overthrown and killed, and then remembered as an &quot;evil dictator.&quot; That&#039;s the price you pay for attempting to liberate your nation from the tyranny of globalization","filename":"Mussolini-e1405042269468","ext":".jpg","w":315,"h":251,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":99,"tim":1491273613527,"time":1491273613,"md5":"OW2rKdsX8Aj5OsrWUQLxAQ==","fsize":16171,"resto":119418224,"id":"+9I9+slq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

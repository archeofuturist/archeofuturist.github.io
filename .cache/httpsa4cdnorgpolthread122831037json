My grandfather fought for the jerries but he never spoke much about his feelings on the war. I know that one of his buddies served 17 years in the gulags for fighting for his country. I&#039;ve heard this and that about Latvians maintaining their national pride, even after decades of Soviet occupation. I&#039;ve also heard they&#039;re not having a bar of the migrant invasion, but I have no idea whether they&#039;re suffering for this, whether they&#039;re at risk or whether they&#039;re being swamped by migrants anyway. What&#039;s life like in Latvia? What was it like when you were growing up? What was it like in your parents time? Tell me anything, I&#039;ll be infinitely grateful. <br><br>Pic related is from a rally held to honour the Latvian Legion who were a formation of the Waffen-SS.","filename":"latvia_parade_01032017_1","ext":".png","w":1500,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493174763190,"time":1493174763,"md5":"pOPgejFfRAtI\/D\/9Optt0w==","fsize":2507454,"resto":0,"id":"9qLSG4jH","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"latvian-thread","country_name":"Australia","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122831137,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:46:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122831037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122831037<\/a><br>you have to go back, faggot","time":1493174812,"resto":122831037,"id":"+N67pUla","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122831686,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:51:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122831137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122831137<\/a><br>I do hope to one day.","time":1493175087,"resto":122831037,"id":"9qLSG4jH","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

My grandfather fought for the jerries but he never spoke much about his feelings on the war. I know that one of his buddies served 17 years in the gulags for fighting for his country. I&#039;ve heard this and that about Latvians maintaining their national pride, even after decades of Soviet occupation. I&#039;ve also heard they&#039;re not having a bar of the migrant invasion, but I have no idea whether they&#039;re suffering for this, whether they&#039;re at risk or whether they&#039;re being swamped by migrants anyway. What&#039;s life like in Latvia? What was it like when you were growing up? What was it like in your parents time? Tell me anything, I&#039;ll be infinitely grateful. <br><br>Pic related is from a rally held to honour the Latvian Legion who were a formation of the Waffen-SS.","filename":"latvia_parade_01032017_1","ext":".png","w":1500,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493174763190,"time":1493174763,"md5":"pOPgejFfRAtI\/D\/9Optt0w==","fsize":2507454,"resto":0,"id":"9qLSG4jH","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"latvian-thread","country_name":"Australia","replies":12,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122831137,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:46:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122831037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122831037<\/a><br>you have to go back, faggot","time":1493174812,"resto":122831037,"id":"+N67pUla","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122831686,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)22:51:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122831137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122831137<\/a><br>I do hope to one day.","time":1493175087,"resto":122831037,"id":"9qLSG4jH","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122832924,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:01:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bad time of the day for Latvia?","time":1493175690,"resto":122831037,"id":"9qLSG4jH","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122834650,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:16:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"One last bump.","time":1493176590,"resto":122831037,"id":"9qLSG4jH","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122834664,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:16:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122831037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122831037<\/a><br>I dunno, but there is this one exchange student from latvia in my class that gets a visible look of disgust every time socialism or communism is mentioned","time":1493176598,"resto":122831037,"id":"k0X9Nm20","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122834882,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:18:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122831037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122831037<\/a><br>Nazis wanted to exterminate almost all latvians","time":1493176706,"resto":122831037,"id":"x3eCHv6M","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":122836114,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:29:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122834664\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122834664<\/a><br>Im latvian in the US and i share that sentiment.

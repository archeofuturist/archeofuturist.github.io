The truth is that Al Assad has the most organized\/supported\/well-equipped army on the ground, unlike you and your faggot supporters, you can&#039;t even maintain your control on small pockets, your most powerful pocket in Jobar is even surrounded within less of 48 hours of battle. Fuck off our clays, faggots (I&#039;m Syrian) just run with your lives, SAA fights you, kurds fight you, ISIS fights you and the Syrian people hates you. You pretend to be &#039;freedom-pro&#039; fighters but you aren&#039;t even able to form a political party, choose a leader and initiate negociations, not even attract the public opinion support and make it in your favor.

Helmand, which accounts for the bulk of Afghanistan\u2019s billion dollar opium crop, is already largely in the hands of the Taliban but the capture of Sangin, where US and British forces suffered heavy casualties, underlines their growing strength in the south. Taliban spokesman Qari Yousuf Ahmadi said Taliban fighters had captured police headquarters and a military base overnight, as well as quantities of military equipment. Omar Zwak, the provincial governor\u2019s spokesman, said security forces had conducted a tactical withdrawal some 3km from the district center to avoid civilian casualties.

I understand the economy is not the best, but is it really that bad of an idea if you&#039;re financially well off? It&#039;s a completely homogenous society, mostly catholic, beautiful women, great food, very historical, plenty of sight seeing, and with the money i make in america i&#039;d live like a king there. The only downside i see is dealing with polish niggers but polish skinhead niggers are nothing like african american niggers here.","filename":"poland","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492462326590,"time":1492462326,"md5":"7Yr4maOoplpFu99NmLz\/hQ==","fsize":630269,"resto":0,"id":"b5QP3eaE","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"polish-american-here-why-do-people-think-living","country_name":"United States","replies":93,"images":7,"unique_ips":35},{"no":121580236,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:53:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;great food<\/span><br>I agree with all the others, but m8...","time":1492462403,"resto":121580061,"id":"Bl\/LN7tJ","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121580466,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:54:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121580236\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121580236<\/a><br>have you never had pierogies or nalesniki? great beer too!","time":1492462494,"resto":121580061,"id":"b5QP3eaE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121580736,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:56:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sie deutsches Schwein ...","filename":"progress","ext":".jpg","w":944,"h":550,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":72,"tim":1492462604757,"time":1492462604,"md5":"VaO19Sd1KGBklxUjTB3Fww==","fsize":118035,"resto":121580061,"id":"KIvM+XVk","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121580849,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)16:57:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121580466\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121580466<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pirozhki<\/span><br>Its russian.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nalesniki<\/span><br>Its a fucking pancake<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;great beer<\/span><br>Ehh, its ok.

Hundreds of thousands of fully blooded Polaks were born here so don&#039;t complain about us Larping because we actually have a heritage.

Im sorry for the few white American nationalists on here who don&#039;t go full out stormfag, but it infuriates me when an American compares me to a nigger and then spouts some bullshit about white unity. The fact is I hate most whites. Germans, Ukrainians, Russians, and others.

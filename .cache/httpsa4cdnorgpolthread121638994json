It&#039;s libtard as fuck out here. <br>Shit&#039;s expensive too, property values are retarded once you get within fifty miles of Portland. People hold stupid-ass protests around the universities, put out crazy-ass signs in front of their yards and espouse stupid liberal shit. There&#039;s a guy who still sells Bernie shirts out in front of the local library. <br><br>There&#039;s a strip mall at the end of the main road that goes through our town, and dead center is this one-man computer repair shop. There has been a Trump cut-out standing in the window for about a year and a half now, and this guy would print professional-grade signs saying stuff about how &#039;sanity prevailed&#039; and how &#039;CNN is the Comedy News Network and Fake News&#039;, all sorts of bumper-sticker-y and kinda funny stuff. After the election, there would always be a cluster of old mom SJW types protesting in front of it every other weekend, posting up signs in front of the business or on a pole on the sidewalk beside it, and almost every week there would be a new sign. About a month ago he posted one last sign talking about how he had received too many death threats and he was moving to a red state. My neighbors would mention in passing what a racist asshole he was and that it was good riddance. It&#039;s another fucking dimension these people live in.","time":1492499958,"resto":121638994,"id":"hKWKiPhk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121653994,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)03:23:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121652030\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121652030<\/a><br>Alot of families settling, and yes, alot of white babies.

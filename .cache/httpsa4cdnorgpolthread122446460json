My school has trade programs that taught students skills in woodworking, welding, CAD, and automotive as well has the running start program. I had students getting out with an AA right out of high school. One kid I knew right out of HS had an internship with a pay raise to $50\/hr. I make $3k+ per month (a lot here due to low cost of living) before taxes as reserve firefighter\/ full time EMT-IV Tech and all of my education for my job has been free, some of it I was even paid for and had most done before I finished high school. Once I land a career fire job I can make $60k-$100k with just a high school education and training that I got for free.","time":1492967650,"resto":122446460,"id":"FTfRR7hC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122449813,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)13:14:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122446460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122446460<\/a><br>He knew exactly what he was getting into when he signed the contract.

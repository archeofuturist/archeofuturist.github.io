As a white person this definitely made me uncomfortable at certain points - it should make you uncomfortable and it should make you more thoughtful and considerate of the issues that black people face and how we possibly all contribute to them (or at least don&#039;t do anything about them). If it&#039;s touching a nerve with you it&#039;s because there&#039;s truth in what they are saying. It&#039;s not really &#039;racist propaganda&#039;, it&#039;s pointing out real issues that black people go through everyday - issues that you wouldn&#039;t be able to argue they don&#039;t go through because you are not a black person and have no experience of their day-to-day life. Subject matter aside, the show is smart and funny - one of the best things on Netflix.<\/span>","time":1493723823,"resto":123755750,"id":"qE3fNSzG","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":123757116,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)07:18:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123756182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123756182<\/a><br>I no!

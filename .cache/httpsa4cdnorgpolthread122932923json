A man who acts incredibly feminine is still on the chart and still used to create the average because some men will be incredibly more masculine than average and balance it out.<br><br>That&#039;s what gender is. It&#039;s the behaviors associated with your sex, you can&#039;t change it. f you&#039;re incredibly feminine man then you&#039;re still a man and your behaviour is still the male gender, it&#039;s just an outlier. Gender is by definition a binary because it&#039;s the observation of the behaviours of 2 binary sexes.<br><br>If you change the definition of gender so you can choose it, then it&#039;s no longer the study of behaviours associated with sex, and it no longer describes anything, and is therefore functionally useless, meaning it&#039;s not science.","time":1493240723,"resto":122932923,"id":"HG95OoW+","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122939375,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:07:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122938741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122938741<\/a><br>Everyone has a spectrum of masculine and feminine qualities, that doesn&#039;t mean your dick suddenly doesn&#039;t exist","time":1493240848,"resto":122932923,"id":"dS00gvUS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122939491,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:08:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122936985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122936985<\/a><br>responding to different stimuli doesn&#039;t determine your gender though<br><br>if you&#039;re a guy and you&#039;re stimulated by other guys does it mean you&#039;re not a man? maybe you&#039;re actually a straight woman trapped in a mans body! or maybe you&#039;re gay! or maybe you&#039;re a lesbian woman trapped in a mans body who thinks you&#039;re looking at another lesbian trapped in a mans body!<br><br>The point is that it&#039;s still a defect.

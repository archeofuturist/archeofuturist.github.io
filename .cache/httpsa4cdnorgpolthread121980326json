On 2 September 1943, the Krait, with a crew of eleven Australian and four British personnel, left Exmouth Gulf, Western Australia. The group, commanded by Ivan Lyon, dyed their skin brown and hair black (the skin dye later caused many skin problems for the members of the team, including irritation and reactions in adverse amounts of sunlight). They also wore sarongs, so that they resembled Indonesian fisherman.[11]<\/span><br><br>They arrived off Singapore on 24 September, that night, six men left the boat and paddled 50 kilometres (31 mi) to a small island near the harbour where a forward base was established in a cave. On the night of 26 September, using folboats the party paddled into the harbour and placed limpet mines on several Japanese ships, the limpet mines sank or seriously damaged four Japanese ships, amounting to over 39,000 tons. The raiders waited until the commotion had died down before returning to the Krait. On 19 October the Krait arrived back at Exmouth Gulf having achieved a great success.","filename":"Krait-crew","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":304,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":84,"tim":1492688971913,"time":1492688971,"md5":"DUUo0Qa2fQ2xTTRNoHoVag==","fsize":49471,"resto":121980326,"id":"qzEjn63x","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121986780,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:51:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Opera<wbr>tion_Dingo<br>Threads over, go to bed.","time":1492689116,"resto":121980326,"id":"D9L7tXvt","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121987196,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:56:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Z Special Unit.<br><br>https:\/\/en.m.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Z_S<wbr>pecial_Unit<br><br>Basically a precursor to the Australian SASR, and when formed, was given ultimate authority from Sir Thomas Blamey (the only Australian Officer to ever make the rank of Field Marshal, equivalent to a US 5 Star General) to do whatever the fuck they wanted, without having to get the ok from anyone, even the Australian PM, or any Allied officers.<br><br>Basically went round, fucking Chink shit up, and had a reported 1700 confirmed Jap kills, for the loss of only 112 men.","time":1492689391,"resto":121980326,"id":"xUWu7hhp","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121987241,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:56:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hertes another extremely cool outfit, more reconnaissance and along the same lines as the LRDG.<br><br>http:\/\/www.militaryhistoryonline.co<wbr>m\/wwii\/articles\/popskisprivatearmy.<wbr>aspx<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Popski&#039;s greatest coup came at the end of a long afternoon interviewing Italian peasants near Gravina. One of the peasants had some dealings with the local German quartermaster officer, a Major Schultz. Popski went down to a deserted railway station and called Major Schultz. Posing as an Italian quartermaster sergeant, Popski told the German he had several cases of good cognac for sale: was Major Schultz interested? He was, and after some haggling, arrangements were made to deliver the booze that night. \u2018I&#039;ll be driving a captured British vehicle, please give orders for me to pass the sentries.&quot; Orders were given, Popski and his crew drove up, went in, and knocked the major on the head.

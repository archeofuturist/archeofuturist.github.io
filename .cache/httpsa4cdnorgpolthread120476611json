They seem to realise that the experience of life is attached to the information in the brain, not to the brain itself, but they can&#039;t make the leap and explain what it means to be. Not to be alive, but just to be. If your experience of life is the information, then what are you actually? Just the software that religious people call soul? But software can&#039;t exist without some sort of hardware and it&#039;s pretty obvious that our hardware is the entire universe since there is no border between the molecules of my body and the molecules next to it. I can lose most of my body and drastically change the rest of it and I will still be. It&#039;s not the body that&#039;s the hardware, it&#039;s the whole big thing. But atheists can&#039;t get to that question and that&#039;s why they&#039;re very confused as to what it means to be and what it means not to be. If they ever got to that question, they would jump from atheism to pantheism.","time":1491856957,"resto":120476611,"id":"XsJJam5I","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120488132,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:45:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120487723\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120487723<\/a><br><br>Nicely put.

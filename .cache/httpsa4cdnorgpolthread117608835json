Why did he do that? Because he wanted everyone to be the same, and everyone to think in the same way. Asiatics have a formal description. It\u2019s called the tall poppy syndrome. They look at the plants. They decide one\u2019s a bit out of kilter. It\u2019s standing higher than the others, so you snip it down, so all are the same.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pol Pot\u2019s not his real name by the way. It\u2019s a joke name; it means \u201cpolitical potential.\u201d When he was very young, Maoists wrote down, \u201cThis man has political potential.\u201d \u201cPol Pot.\u201d And that\u2019s where he took it from. This man is a terroristic psychopath. But when he took over his society with a teenage militia high on drugs, and almost everything had been blitzed and was defenseless, he put into practice in a cardinal way, what many of these Western idiots in the 60s with their fists in the air have been proposing. He sat in Paris, in salons listening to Kristeva, listening to Sartre, listening to de Beauvoir. And he imposed it implacably like the cretin he was. The family is immoral. Shoot all the village priests that got people married. Shoot people who are bit too keen on marriage. Shoot everyone who\u2019s read books about marriage. Shoot everybody who ever said marriage is a good thing. That\u2019s quite a pile of bodies, and you haven\u2019t started yet.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That is communism in its rawest and its crudest form. It\u2019s a sort of morality of bestiality, essentially. And it can\u2019t even impose equality, because in the communist societies of yesteryear, the elite will have its own shops, and its own channels, and they will have their own corrupt systems to keep their children out of military service, and so on. Just like Clinton\u2019s America, or Vietnam America before it.

Both nations were operating on the ideas of how to win wars in a European setting which was typically done when the leader&#039;s decided that they could no longer fight and would surrender some land and step down to let someone else from their country rule them, but Asia and the Middle East have never operated that way, and probably never will. To win a war in these places you have to destroy all Government and put yourself there as a dictator.

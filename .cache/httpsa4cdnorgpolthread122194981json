The only difference is the goy front man is a Trump instead of a Bush and the unfortunate country is Syria instead of Iraq. <br><br>The most disturbing thing though is supposedly &quot;redpilled&quot; people trying to deflect blame from Trump by saying it&#039;s his generals misleading him etc. Trump knows exactly what is going on. The buck stops with Trump, he is the commander in chief. So when they eventually invade this will be Trump&#039;s call.<br><br>Trump isn&#039;t being misled by neocons he always was one.","filename":"mad dog and jew","ext":".jpg","w":898,"h":628,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":174,"tim":1492813477784,"time":1492813477,"md5":"Isa+hzzGE7wfN\/JRFcNO2A==","fsize":63478,"resto":0,"id":"XIRubQxM","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mattis-claiming-assad-has-chemical-weapons","country_name":"Australia","replies":30,"images":6,"unique_ips":21},{"no":122195727,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:30:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sad day senpai. <br><br>He&#039;s a personal hero.","time":1492813854,"resto":122194981,"id":"0B4I37mz","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122196756,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:40:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122195727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122195727<\/a><br>Who Mattis or Trump?

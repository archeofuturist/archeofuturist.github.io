Apart from perhaps leftist activists, ironically enough. I wouldn&#039;t say metal is apolitical &quot;as a whole&quot;, because there are plenty of politically motivated metalheads and metal bands.

There&#039;s a prevalent fascist aesthetic in metal, sure, but there&#039;s also a strong collectivist-authoritarian sentiment as well; metalheads being critical of contemporary society, culture, the establishment, what it means to be a conforming citizen. These are themes that many bands deal with lyrically, and that metalheads would unite in ideological opposition to. <br><br>But that&#039;s just my observation.","filename":"Blodsgard-Monument-CoverArt","ext":".jpg","w":1479,"h":1537,"tn_w":240,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493742185220,"time":1493742185,"md5":"k\/Hf0bL1W7PzbOcHq9+7wA==","fsize":1538199,"resto":0,"id":"eJKfnbYo","country":"NO","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"politics-and-metal","country_name":"Norway","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123784588,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)12:29:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"Kreator rips but that singer has turned into a huge fag lately with his political views. <br><br>Megadeth on the other hand, fuck yeah. <br><br>Napalm Death = very likely literal cucks and perhaps even unironic homosexuals.","time":1493742584,"resto":123783827,"id":"dqmLlIdY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

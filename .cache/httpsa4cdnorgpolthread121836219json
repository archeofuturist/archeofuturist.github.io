The German advance into Russia (despite being ill prepared) was devastation for the Russia people. The Siege of Leningrad was one stupefying example of German Superiority in war. Germans come in with 725,000 and lose 2\/3 over 4 years. The Russians lost a force of 3.5 fucking million. They lost 10&#039;s of thousands of tanks and peices of equipment. Without the US propping the Russians up, the eastern front would have been loss. The Russians were so low on supplies, they would pair people and only give one of them a weapon. The other was only given a few rounds. Hitler&#039;s Germany in the early war was astounding, and I sometimes wonder how far he would have gone had he not been on drugs.","time":1492609004,"resto":121836219,"id":"8f+gVEXt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121844826,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:39:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121840842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121840842<\/a><br>Foreign Forces occupy your land, and you call it 4D chess.

They chose the Republicans to be anti-gay and the Democrats to be pro-gay. The homosexuals naturally flock to the Democrats, where the globalists encourage the degenerate behavior you see.

They fired everyone up with gay rights (while making sure to get homosexuals to be as degenerate as possible) to make them ignore everything else.

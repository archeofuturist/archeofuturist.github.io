Pressure is building up, and what? What do you think is going to colossally change? Live in reality for a second, we&#039;re not gonna disembark right wing death squads to round up anyone with a certain melanin level. The corrupted politicians and zionist puppets are already holding government positions. <br>Do you see a scenario in which Germans go down the streets and complain about refugees and shit? Hell no, they can&#039;t even protest a fucking Bilderburg meeting without getting police state&#039;d. That whole fiasco was even covered by ours truly Lauren Southern when she still worked with Rebel Media. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This meme again. Boris pls, google how the EU works.

It&#039;s Farage by the way, the one who coined the phrase this time. And unfortunately I&#039;d take the word of a member of the European Parliament and leader of a irreplaceable piece in the BREXIT puzzle word over yours for this matter. <br>And if you still think you&#039;re more knowledgeable then please explain to me how a country can negotiate its own &quot;fair share&quot; of refugees it must take. When a quota has been put on you by the EU what is your leverage and how is it decided. Because every country so far that hasn&#039;t upheld its quota has been sanctioned severely.","time":1491762579,"resto":120279671,"id":"nPNEdxrW","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"}]}

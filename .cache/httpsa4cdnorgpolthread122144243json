Hungary is a democracy. It has a wide range of political parties (a lot more than, say, the US, which is only one party away from being a one-party state). It has free and fair elections. It has a parliament that passes legislation. The quality of legislation can vary greatly, as in any democracy, but like most legal matters that is a matter of keen debate. If citizens are unhappy about the legislation, they hold demonstrations, as they have been doing.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Orb\u00e1n has aroused a lot of ire with his talk of \u201cilliberal democracy\u201d. I would like to underline the word democracy in that formula, which tends to get overlooked in the frothing of his critics. It should also be noted that in current Hungarian political usage \u201cliberal\u201d doesn\u2019t have the connotations of \u201ccivilised\u201d, \u201cenlightened\u201d or \u201cgenerous\u201d, it\u2019s a portmanteau for leftwing conventions. I accept that an anti-left stance isn\u2019t going to win Orb\u00e1n fans among the Guardian\u2019s readers, but I trust they might be willing to accept that someone who has a different opinion isn\u2019t automatically wearing jackboots.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I find the criticism that Hungary no longer has a pluralistic media especially puzzling. That\u2019s a harsh judgment on a country: the sort of judgment that requires evidence. I always find it interesting how people who don\u2019t speak Hungarian feel entitled to accuse Orb\u00e1n of \u201cmuzzling the press\u201d.<\/span>","time":1492786813,"resto":122144243,"id":"NkXqS7ii","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

You hear stories of pit bulls attacking their owners and it makes me wonder if my job is actually safe.<br><br>But I&#039;ve been doing it for over a year now and pit bulls are some of my favorite dogs to deal with actually, so idk. I&#039;ve been lulled into a false sense of security I think, if I get attacked it will totally be my fault. Just the other day I was playing with a pitbull and let him play bite my neck. It would be easy for him to have killed me right there but he was such a sweetheart that i just let it happen","time":1490899725,"resto":118936871,"id":"eztiNZcb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118952080,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:48:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118936871\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118936871<\/a><br>This is the literal story of liberalism","time":1490899729,"resto":118936871,"id":"Jf+h5ayy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118952125,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:49:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118936871\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118936871<\/a><br>Source?","time":1490899754,"resto":118936871,"id":"BRIAtD5T","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118952173,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:49:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118950321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118950321<\/a><br>Must never allow dogs to sleep on furniture.

It is classified as Aarne\u2013Thompson type 178A.[2]<br><br>Here, the dog is alleged to have belonged to Llywelyn the Great, Prince of Gwynedd, a gift from King John of England. In this legend, Llywelyn returns from hunting to find his baby missing, the cradle overturned, and the dog with a blood-smeared mouth. Believing the dog savaged the child, Llywelyn draws his sword and kills it. After the dog&#039;s dying yelp Llywelyn hears the cries of the baby, unharmed under the cradle, along with a dead wolf which had attacked the child and been killed by Gelert. Llywelyn is then overcome with remorse and he buries the dog with great ceremony, yet he can still hear the dying yelp. After that day Llywelyn never smiles again.<br><br>It might be bullshit but it describes the breed down to a T. Faithful loyal, fantastic temper, smart as all hell and loves company. Size alone scares most people but I have never done more than raise my voice to get it to do what I want.","filename":"z1232431","ext":".jpg","w":645,"h":380,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":73,"tim":1490900093041,"time":1490900093,"md5":"d3Zw7La2wB9npq1zO8cDPw==","fsize":76112,"resto":118936871,"id":"7zI+Zrmz","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118952820,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:55:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118936871\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118936871<\/a><br>I don&#039;t understand how you can fuck up so much your own dog would dare to bite you","time":1490900141,"resto":118936871,"id":"afTtaVZk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118952917,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:56:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118948431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118948431<\/a><br><br>Irish Wolfhound.","time":1490900195,"resto":118936871,"id":"7zI+Zrmz","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118952919,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:56:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118943555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118943555<\/a><br>Kek.<br>A little \/k\/ommando humor goes a long way.

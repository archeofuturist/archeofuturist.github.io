The solution is simple. Social Engineering. <br><br>Now this will take some preparation and no extreme autists will be able to accomplish it.<br><br>1. Dress the part. Anon will need to dress as someone who looks like or close to a HVAC repairman.<br><br>2. Gear. In the world of social engineering it is very important to build rapport. Holding something as simple as clipboard and a toolbox will take you further than you could imagine. Mix that with an official look and acting as if you&#039;re in a hurry (but not too much as you don&#039;t want to be off-putting) and you&#039;re gold.<br><br>3. Gain access to correct rooftop. As seen in pic related there are a number of rooftops that could be a starting point for an anon that is mildly in shape. <br><br>4. Replace the flag. If you want to remain anon (I&#039;m sure you do) be sure to cover your face with a handkerchief or ski mask. <br><br>5. Smooth getaway. Have a premade line about how everything is okay or you just needed to check some numbers, depending on how long you spend up there. <br><br>6. Profit????<br><br>This post was for educational purposes only. OP does not encourage or condone any illegal activity.

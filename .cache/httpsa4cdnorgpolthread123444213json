But it did evolve. I&#039;m not offering any argument that liberalism sprang up at a certain point complete, fully matured. Neither can liberalism can be approached -- as some people do -- as a conversation conducted among philosophers over the centuries. Instead, liberalism must be understood, I think, as a political and social doctrine and a movement grounded in the distinctive culture and traceable to specific historical condition. That culture is the west. A Europe that rose in communion with the bishop of Rome. The historical conditions were those of the middle ages.

In a free market with free banking and a naturally DEFLATIONARY currency, as production and automation increases, prices for capital and consumer goods fall. People would need to work less hours to get the money they need to have a comfortable life. Many more people would be working part time, like 2-3 days a week which would only open up slots for more people to work. Also people would be retiring much earlier which also decreases unemployment. As the price of capital goods falls it creates a massive high paying service sector industry that will create countless jobs. There would be no unemployment.

Finding God isn&#039;t some term that means simply deciding that God is a plausible or reasonable concept; finding God means actively encountering Him and interacting with Him in the same sense as you do with any other person. When you find God, it&#039;s impossible to not believe (though it is possible to reject), because you have actually seen that God does, in fact, exist.<br><br>The first step towards finding God and obtaining belief is to approach. You need to approach God, and this is as simple (or difficult) as earnestly seeking Him.

Now that I&#039;ve found God, I&#039;m constantly encountering Him. <br><br>It&#039;s different for all believers, but one way I see and interact with God regularly is through my work.

For example, I was recently given insight into an answer to a long-open problem in the area of artificial intelligence (which I am currently working on writing up formally). The precise words escape me, but it is as though God revealed a part of his own story to me, showing me through his eyes what it was like creating us. Every day, I know that I am walking with God; despite my faults and my mistakes, these lessons show me that He is there and that He desires to know me.<br><br>Your story of course won&#039;t be the same as mine, but I do hope that God guides your steps.

This is common knowledge. Before the Jews, everyone was Pagan or atheist. Right? Wrong. At least 500 years before the Jews stopped worshiping idols made out of clay and wood, an Aryan prophet presented monotheism to his people: the Iranians (Persians). Zoroaster, the first true Aryan prophet, claimed there is only one single God and all other gods are false or not real. He claimed God is:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;All-Loving<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;All-Forgiving<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;All-Righteous<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;All-Knowing and Wise<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Full of justice and mercy<\/span><br><br>Sound familiar?

It should. You see, after the Jews left Babylonian captivity, they co-opted or stole the monotheism religion of Zoroaster, which was called Zoroastrianism. The Jew adopted the single God for himself, and the Jew made himself the &quot;chosen ones&quot; of God. The Jew took the one God who is Peace and turned him into the God of War (Exodus 15:3). The Jew took the morality of the Aryan religion and perverted it; the Jew claimed the God allows them to do very evil things, like hurt or kill non-Jews, or rape non-Jewish women and children. Judaism is the corruption of Zoroastrianism.<br><br>Enter Jesus. He came to fix Judaism and to make it more like Zoroastrianism. Jesus Christ himself was a Zoroastrian priest (yes, there is evidence for this claim in Scripture). Jesus was sent to Israel to reform Judaism; Jesus was sent solely to help the misguided Jews (Matthew 15:24). Jesus, therefore, was a Zoroastrian teacher who attempted to reform Judaism, and when he gained a certain amount of popularity, he was killed by cowardice Jews who refused to give up their wicked ways.<br><br>Unless youre a Jew, you don&#039;t need Christianity, which is simply Reformed Judaism, to be saved.","time":1491505999,"resto":119773153,"id":"htukiTPm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119779565,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:13:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119779284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119779284<\/a><br>There is a problem with protestants, they contradict the early Christians <br><br>How do you explain that","time":1491506007,"resto":119773153,"id":"AfadXNDc","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119779615,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:13:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119773153\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119773153<\/a><br>We&#039;re artificial intelligence inside a simulator programmed by our developer.

We were on the 72nd floor - essentially right below the &#039;strike&#039;. Yet the stairwells all the way down were bearable heat wise so I&#039;m not buying the &quot;The fire burned so hot it melted the steel beams&quot; notion at all. We were told that a incident took place in WTC I and we should stay put until further notice so the evacuation of that building isn&#039;t compromised. Shortly after we felt a severe shock that knocked me and others out of their chairs as well as cubicle walls. Many of us decided to nix the directive to stay put. We used the stairs and heard, consistent (timed) explosions all the way down to the ground floor. Once we hit the Concourse it was a complete disaster: the walls, which are made of 15&quot; solid marble, had huge sections blasted away laying on the floor... some of it looked pulverized and some was like a powder scattered all around. One of the service elevators near the PATH train entrance had its doors blasted outward! Those steel doors were shredded!! Outside was chaos and it was difficult to tell what was going on, where to go for help, etc. I decided to get as far as I could from the building. I got about 3 blocks away on Fulton St. when I heard a series of high pitched explosive sounds and a something that sounded like a steam train trying to gather momentum. I turned around and saw the building I just left coming down with a pillar of dust and debris as tall as a office building barreling down the street. All I could do was hit the street, cover my head and pray. I stood up covered in a fine, grey dust with huge slabs of steel and glass all over the place. Why I didn&#039;t get impaled or crushed...I had no idea at the time. I&#039;ve since understood why. Yet I&#039;ve also developed COPD -- not unlike most of the folks who came in contact with that &#039;dust&#039;.","filename":"WTC-plane-impact-clifton-08","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490757997556,"time":1490757997,"md5":"apv7ViiEubHDG+R\/NQ7SeQ==","fsize":19008,"resto":0,"id":"+BOkHw0k","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-was-in-the-south-tower-aka-wtc-ii-the-2nd-of","country_name":"United States","replies":68,"images":17,"unique_ips":37},{"no":118740864,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)23:28:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118740649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118740649<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; I was in the South tower<\/span><br><br>Not even going to read further until you prove it","time":1490758128,"resto":118740649,"id":"zci8bpUX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118741012,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)23:30:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118740864\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118740864<\/a><br><br>I couldn&#039;t possibly detail everything I experienced in this forum. That was just to give folks a basic idea of what I dealt with and observed. I can say without doubt that 911 was a VERY sophisticated endeavor that some camel riding extremists could NOT possibly pull off. Not by themselves in any case. That being so, who helped them that had the kind of resources to use a security sweep as a cover to plant weaponized explosives in both those expansive buildings? I am referring to the fact that in early August, weeks before, there was a systematic closure of floors in WTC I\/II for a &#039;security check&#039;. We all got notice of when our floors were being done and essentially got two days off with pay. I did some research a few years ago and found out that Bush&#039;s cousin is on the Board of Directors of that security corporation along with several Bush family associates!

This may be the single most important treatment for cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease in which thick mucus can build up in the lungs and be very difficult to expel. Many compounding pharmacies now offer liquid glutathione, and it\u2019s easy to find nebulizers at your local drug store. Glutathione is considered the most potent anti-oxidant our body produces. It\u2019s a string of three amino acids (glutamine cysteine, and glycine) made by every single cell in our bodies. Oxygen itself is an oxidant, and glutathione is the major complex that provides the balance between oxygen levels necessary for life, but not so much that our blood vessels \u201coxidize\u201d (kind of like rusting).<br>Glutathione is a superb detox agent and helps protect us against a myriad of irritants including pollution, poisons, drugs and heavy metals. It\u2019s important to always use the \u201creduced\u201d form of glutathione, also known as GSH. \u201cReduced\u201d has to do with a biochemical process called \u201credox.\u201d \u201cReduction\u201d in this context means attaching an electron to a \u201cradical\u201d molecule, which is missing an electron and desperately trying to become stable by \u201cgrabbing\u201d an electron. GSH neatly stabilizes this cascade of destruction and inflammation. Moreover, inhaling liquid GSH isn\u2019t the only way to benefit from this fantastic natural healing molecule \u2014 although that\u2019s probably the best delivery method for lung diseases. Because GSH is not very stable, some very innovative researchers have<br>been looking into ways of extending the useful shelf life of GSH for decades. Fairly recently there has been a breakthrough with liposomal technology.","time":1490762566,"resto":118740649,"id":"6bV7BtWI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118749431,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:57:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump for great justice.","filename":"tmp_13976-14767372105431493131833","ext":".jpg","w":612,"h":612,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490763465381,"time":1490763465,"md5":"VRn0hh2Nn5uJXxB1HAdZXg==","fsize":57916,"resto":118740649,"id":"gOr5yF6t","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118750022,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:04:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"hope you get the medical treatment you need, god bless you","time":1490763879,"resto":118740649,"id":"HDNvFWQx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118750332,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:08:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118748069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118748069<\/a><br>Alex?<br>Is that you, Alex?","filename":"tmp_13976-Rare Sad #37983547032","ext":".jpg","w":484,"h":750,"tn_w":80,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490764095732,"time":1490764095,"md5":"qRy3MzJvAGXnMboxDwqyjg==","fsize":117721,"resto":118740649,"id":"gOr5yF6t","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118750475,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:10:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118740649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118740649<\/a><br>Heat rises halfwit","time":1490764206,"resto":118740649,"id":"ZpO\/TI\/3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118753414,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:45:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118750475\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118750475<\/a><br>bump","time":1490766308,"resto":118740649,"id":"Fq8hbbr0","country":"CO","country_name":"Colombia"},{"no":118753869,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:51:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;72nd floor<\/span><br><br>Well, what a coincidence.

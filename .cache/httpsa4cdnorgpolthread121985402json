It is then that you fault the constitution for the state of things. It is then that you realize that socialism really would not be so bad without the minority leeches and with some authority to straighten out people who were not contributing. After the attacks on straight white men, you start to also buy into identity politics. Congrats, you are now a white nationalist. The problem was never really with socialism or not enough freedom.

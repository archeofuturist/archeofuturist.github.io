Also it is questionable that Germany is currently lacking cheap housing. But than again 3M would not do the trick for the Germans and Germany is wasting money on way worse things.

I think it&#039;s beyond idiotic that no veto process is in place to keep the rapefugees out and only let in legit refugees.

Nonetheless this bubble is going to burst sooner or later anyways. It is hard to tell allowed refugees and those that would have to go back apart when they do not own any identification. Now it is easy to just keep them out if they do not have. The right thing to do is carefully balance the decision as the possibility of honestly loosing your ID is real and some laws are also old and nonsense. So you have to see if it is sustainable to let illegal refugees in just to also get the true ones. I frankly can&#039;t decide on that one as my work with illegal refugees has prooven to me that they too deserve stay in Germany but at the same time I can not ignore those that are literal rapefugees.<br><br><a href=\"#p121262712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121262712<\/a><br>My fault I stopped reading the article because it was clearly not well researched and not reliable.

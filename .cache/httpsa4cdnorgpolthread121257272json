Nonetheless this bubble is going to burst sooner or later anyways. It is hard to tell allowed refugees and those that would have to go back apart when they do not own any identification. Now it is easy to just keep them out if they do not have. The right thing to do is carefully balance the decision as the possibility of honestly loosing your ID is real and some laws are also old and nonsense. So you have to see if it is sustainable to let illegal refugees in just to also get the true ones. I frankly can&#039;t decide on that one as my work with illegal refugees has prooven to me that they too deserve stay in Germany but at the same time I can not ignore those that are literal rapefugees.<br><br><a href=\"#p121262712\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121262712<\/a><br>My fault I stopped reading the article because it was clearly not well researched and not reliable. When I quick searched for &quot;H\u00e4user f\u00fcr Fl\u00fcchtlinge&quot; and &quot;Ausgaben Fl\u00fcchtlinge&quot; I could not confirm any of your claims. See the link below you got some facts twisted. I won&#039;t bother looking up the costs for schools as I&#039;d agree that more money has to be spend on education. Some schools are literally falling apart. Yet you have to see that refugees are a more immediate problem that has to be solved one way or another and thus the current course spends quite some money on them. And please remember that we will need many people to work &#039;bad&#039; lower wage jobs as the Germans do not want to do that anymore.

It makes 0 sense that refugees would have to come to the West for safety, many muslim countries around Syria could take them in and the West could build infrastructure there to help and help in teh form of foreign aid, but rapefugees are being used as a weapon of islamisation of the West (Hegira, war by migration, like fascist pedo warlord Muhammad did with Mecca, and the Quran describes). Still, cunt Merkel wanted to clean her image after the austerity fiasco in EU (Greece had ppl committing suicide in front of the parliament because of Troika austerity measures) so she opened the borders like that. Also, legit refugees are getting raped, robbed and sold for sex and organ trafficking on the way to the West, as well as making cash to the criminals who smuggle them into the West.

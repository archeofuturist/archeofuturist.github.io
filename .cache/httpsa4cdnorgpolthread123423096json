You guys should check it out!<br><br>Also, scrolling through the comments section, I was floored by all the truth and insight people were sharing. I feel like my eyes have been totally opened. I&#039;m going to go watch this show now! I hope you all will too. <br><br>BEST COMMENTS: <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Adzl33t - The maker of this show made this specifically because of current Identity Based Politics, to showcase that racial tensions are still high. Which I blame Idenity based conservatives aka White Power Communists socialists.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Limeade Youth - Can we just block the IP&#039;s of the people giving this show an F? Regardless of how you view the subject matter, the show is just plain well done. Anyone saying otherwise is not engaging the subject matter critically.<\/span>","filename":"002_dwp_101_unit_01020r-h_2017","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":433,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493519533568,"time":1493519533,"md5":"PARqjJKCa5cnyD371YEiLA==","fsize":61688,"resto":0,"id":"rym4J34f","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dear-white-people-welcomes-viewers-back-to-its","country_name":"Canada","replies":11,"images":7,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123423253,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)22:33:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Nina \u2022 Ugh, I know the comments on glowing reviews of the show by butthurt white people mean nothing, but they&#039;re still so infuriating. Calling the show &quot;SJW dreck&quot; (I guess because any show where white people aren&#039;t the focus means it&#039;s catering to SJWs), &quot;vile, racist, and revoltingly unfunny&quot;. The person also said that the show&#039;s been &quot;savaged by several prominent YouTubers&quot; as if that&#039;s proof of the show&#039;s low quality. Because if there&#039;s one thing we all know to be true, it&#039;s that YouTube personalities aren&#039;t racist, right?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Another person ACTUALLY said that &quot;systemic racism&quot; doesn&#039;t exist, because &quot;segregation and slavery ended years ago&quot;.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I just can&#039;t fathom how people can be so aggressively, proudly ignorant and self-centred. And the real kicker is that these are the same fuckbags (to borrow a word from Troy in a later episode) who are always whining about how everyone is too easily &quot;triggered&quot;, politically correct, and overly sensitive nowadays to things like hate speech and racially\/sexually motivated acts of violence and aggression. And yet a fucking TITLE of a SHOW sets them off.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Dear black people, I apologize on behalf of my braindead, bologna-hued brethren...<\/span>","filename":"28DEARWHITEJP1-master675","ext":".jpg","w":675,"h":435,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1493519617500,"time":1493519617,"md5":"ym8ivvalnn58REzXGPGlIg==","fsize":86367,"resto":123423096,"id":"rym4J34f","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123423342,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)22:34:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Powerful","filename":"Aryan Goddess","ext":".webm","w":436,"h":436,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493519664804,"time":1493519664,"md5":"T0ZdsVuHLhxkP2Skd+eWUw==","fsize":2762009,"resto":123423096,"id":"TD\/57jgK","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123423583,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)22:36:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123423096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123423096<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123423253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123423253<\/a>","filename":"1491275780887","ext":".png","w":585,"h":560,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":119,"tim":1493519782164,"time":1493519782,"md5":"UeI2uiNy7kZGhebvI5SsNQ==","fsize":198925,"resto":123423096,"id":"xbOKBmth","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123423803,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)22:38:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tedthefed - Oh man, people are SO MAD about this show&#039;s title.

People drive huge trucks to get places less than a mile away. People eat fast food every day. Talking sports is both the best way to make a friend and the quickest way into a fight. People travel in packs for their leisure activities both for convenience and safety. Intellectuals are from somewhere else or they are going somewhere else in the future.

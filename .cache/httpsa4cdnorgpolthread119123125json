White Europeans aren&#039;t mixing and are still producing children despite all the memeing, although at a lower rate. You&#039;re right about that part.<br><br>What you&#039;re missing:<br>White Europeans also shoulder the ENTIRE tax burden and feed most of the world. <br><br>Why is that relevant?<br><br>Because the more non-whites push out kids, the more welfare they consume and the more food aid they consume, adding to the tax burden at rapidly scaling rates. There will never be &quot;billions&quot; of blacks in Africa, because blacks don&#039;t farm and 1\/4th their caloric intake is from Western food aid. Social welfare will also not survive this century. Too many generations of immigrants all on welfare will see to that, and when the social safety net inevitably implodes, an age of chaos will begin. That&#039;s bad, sure, but problems with invading ethnicities tend to get solved in chaos. <br><br>You&#039;re giving up without realizing that white Europeans are -THE- reason the modern world even runs and exists.

I think it&#039;s the only fascist country that I think exists. You do not break the law there. Never. The penalties are fucking horrible. But having said that, their muzzies never kick off. Because they&#039;d get wrecked. The food is utterly the best food ever. I love Singapore. Hong Kong is a shit. Everyone thinks you&#039;re American. Anyway...<br>I might make a thread about the happenings in South Korea. And a South East Asia thread. Lots of shit is happenning there. I was born and grew up in HK. I speak Cantonese as I speak English. I&#039;m from a colonial background. My best mate is a colonial. He&#039;s from Rhodesia. We&#039;re in our 40s, so remember having to leave our homes. Ask any Hong Kong Chinese citizen if they&#039;d prefer British government or Chinese government. I don&#039;t even need to ask.<br>There exists an Anglo diaspora. It&#039;s a cultural legacy from empire. It&#039;s a bit upsetting, because everything is miles away from anywhere else.<br>My sister is in New Zealand. She has husband and kids. We grew up together, but I can&#039;t just go round her house for a cup of tea. It&#039;s on the other side of the planet and takes a 26 hour flight. She grew up with me in Hong Kong.

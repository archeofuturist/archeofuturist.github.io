I was greeted by six busty Muslim girls with big juicy arses; which I wanted to slap like a crazed gorilla. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Before I knew it they were upon me, rubbing my chest and shoulders. They slowly but surely applied some pressure and and I fell to the floor. I was on my back and each one of these tarts was holding down a specific part of me to ensure I couldn&#039;t stand up .. or escape.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Two of the whores removed their clothing, and before I knew it two sets of big, lucious tits then started squirting milk into my mouth. I swallowed every drop, occasionally gargling. I couldn&#039;t believe my luck. Still pinned down by four women, the naked couple then walked to each side of my head and squatted. This was the closest to fanny I had ever been in my life.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And then the waterworks broke loose. Torrents of vile, yellow, horrendously smelly piss bathed my face. I tried to scream but only a horrendous gargling sound could escape. I had never been so humiliated. How DARE these vile women do this to me? And I was utterly helpless to do anything ...<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Then the finale, after the vile cows had finished urinating, one remained squatted whilst the other stood up, put one leg over my chest, and resumed the squatting position; arse directly above my face. Within 15 seconds a loud gasser came thundering out of her fartclappers. I quickly raised my head and attempted to inhale every odourous whiff I could.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I thought it would end with the fart, but when I saw the brown log pertruding from her big round cheeks I stopped attempting to inhale and quickly moved my head back. I of course tried to run .. this was futile, I was strapped down. Slowly but surely, this big, fat, smelly log fell out of her and landed in my mouth, which was open from screaming at the top of my lungs. I was hoping to get fucked. I had been destroyed in my proud British Aristocrat masculinity.<\/span>","filename":"1477189913092","ext":".jpg","w":425,"h":282,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1492606651841,"time":1492606651,"md5":"s5DOj7ffvvWLZ4j3yhcABQ==","fsize":29554,"resto":121840392,"id":"n7OBop2n","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121840904,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:57:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"DUP going on a rant about Marxist-Leninists","time":1492606665,"resto":121840392,"id":"86TDnrpv","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121840908,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:57:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121840815\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121840815<\/a><br>i got depressed and suicidal. it always happens when im living by myself","time":1492606666,"resto":121840392,"id":"WeMYdwPY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121840910,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:57:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121840638\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121840638<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;couldn&#039;t get a 3rd <\/span><br><br>Are you serious?

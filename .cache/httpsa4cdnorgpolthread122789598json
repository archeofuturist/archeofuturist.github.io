Is anyone else like me (middle class, mid-20s, lazy)?","com":"Summary: I live in the UK; I did very well at school; I went to my nearest university (ranked 100 - 200 in the world); I did a STEM degree I really hated with zero effort but graduating with an acceptable grade; spent the last two years wasting sickeningly large, gigantic, herculean amounts of free time on the internet and working very few hours in retail jobs while living with parents; have had zero social life since I left school; I failed gigantic amounts of graduate job interviews due to bad social skills; I have a temporary internship with a &quot;prestigious&quot; public sector body in London starting next week.<br><br>Just a few thoughts: I feel intellectually worthless because I don&#039;t know mathematics at a deep level. I feel worthless in practical terms because I don&#039;t know programming. I feel like a lower caste because I didn&#039;t go to a university with as high a reputation as I could&#039;ve gone to (went to my nearest one), though I have no debt.<br><br>What is the life plan? I know I&#039;m simplifying things, but it seems that you&#039;re either working in high finance, or have somehow made money from your own software company (a lottery), or working in a cushy famous software company, (or an academic but that&#039;s not an option after I hated my undergrad degree and put in minimal effort)... or you&#039;re a big loser. The corporate world seems like a rigged game that I will never succeed in because I&#039;m an unattractive and nerdy looking person.<br><br>I am glad my job is temporary, I want to postpone the beginning of my career. I know you may say, &quot;Welcome to the real world!&quot; but hopefully fellow losers can empathise with my view that being in the real world is fun and games when you&#039;re surrounded by Normie clones or are Chad \/ Stacey, but it&#039;s a different game when you&#039;re not like them. It also doesn&#039;t help that I don&#039;t have a posh or southern English accent or even a &quot;bantz with da ladz&quot; person. This reduces my hopes of ever playing the vacuous networking \/ typical career nonsense.","filename":"1447288380312","ext":".jpg","w":482,"h":427,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":221,"tim":1493155374152,"time":1493155374,"md5":"UG+qJkOJUrvfGSD6SFrcnQ==","fsize":37289,"resto":0,"id":"GLbzE9\/z","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-i-succeed-in-life-is-anyone-else-like-me","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122790520,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)17:30:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122789598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122789598<\/a><br>because of your personality, you should be an accountant.

Everything betrays a sense of deep coercion which, in some, manifests as rigourism, prohibitionism, imperativism, moralist or rationalist intolerance, in others as romantic impulse and human pathos. Crystalline clarity, agile simplicity, detached in a spiritual joy of free play, irony, and aristocratic superiority, all this exists and is conceived of only as a myth. In any thing there reigns instead a sense of identification, of collapse, of greedy interest.&quot;","filename":"Julius_Evola","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":442,"tn_w":180,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493835603461,"time":1493835603,"md5":"YxAazR+yv7T7xBVMU8Ombg==","fsize":56587,"resto":0,"id":"8\/1WnAau","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"two-quotes","country_name":"Australia","replies":12,"images":3,"unique_ips":8},{"no":123941785,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:20:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"&quot;Looking at the history of the Occident, we see periods of cultural ebb-tide. In between come golden times. Then the arts flower, and there are many great poets, authors, and thinkers. These &quot;golden centuries&quot; are always characterized by sexual exuberance, for enterprising and creative people are full of vital impulses, and sex is an expression of this vitality. The brightest, the most energetic, vigorous and lively boys, on the average, become sexually active long in advance of their stupid, dull, timid, and inert comrades. In the same way, in those eras wherein the intellect and the artistic sense thrive, people are not so easily curbed by the irrational taboos of so-called morality. They listen with an open mind to the demands of body and spirit.<br><br>The brilliant historian Arnold Toynbee perceived a connection between the decline of a civilization and sexophobia. If American students clamorously declare that they won&#039;t spoil their precious time with sex because they can employ their forces in a more rewarding way, and people join in numbers the &quot;Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous&quot; to get rid of their &quot;addiction&quot; to sex and love, exactly like one wants to fight his addiction to alcohol and drugs, this could be seen as a bad omen for the future of the American world power.&quot;<br><br>Two quotes: one by Evola, and the other by doctor of law and pedophile advocate Edward Brongersma. Do you wonder if these quotes are coherent to one another? Do they belong to the same channel of thought?","time":1493835626,"resto":123941745,"id":"8\/1WnAau","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123942294,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:25:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1493835904,"resto":123941745,"id":"8\/1WnAau","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123942735,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:28:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123942294\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123942294<\/a><br>Did you just bump your own thread five minutes after posting?<br>Kill yourself<br>Saged","time":1493836126,"resto":123941745,"id":"4Sbx18jb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123943273,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:33:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump before I get banned from my shitpost thread.<br><br>Ps: the burger announced his sage.

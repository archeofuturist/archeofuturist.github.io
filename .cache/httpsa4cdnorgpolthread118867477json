In an effort to better serve advertisers, Verizon Wireless has been silently modifying its users&#039; web traffic on its network to inject a cookie-like tracker. This tracker, included in an HTTP header called X-UIDH, is sent to every unencrypted website a Verizon customer visits from a mobile device. It allows third-party advertisers and websites to assemble a deep, permanent profile of visitors&#039; web browsing habits without their consent.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Verizon apparently created this mechanism to expand their advertising programs, but it has privacy implications far beyond those programs. Indeed, while we&#039;re concerned about Verizon&#039;s own use of the header, we&#039;re even more worried about what it allows others to find out about Verizon users. The X-UIDH header effectively reinvents the cookie, but does so in a way that is shockingly insecure and dangerous to your privacy. Worse still, Verizon doesn&#039;t let users turn off this &quot;feature.&quot; In fact, it functions even if you use a private browsing mode or clear your cookies. You can test whether the header is injected in your traffic by visiting lessonslearned.org\/sniff or amibeingtracked.com over a cell data connection.<\/span><br><br>LOL","time":1490843047,"resto":118867477,"id":"KqagWBjy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118873508,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)23:04:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Andy Cush<\/span><br>every couple dozen times...","time":1490843060,"resto":118867477,"id":"eOHs2i47","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118873533,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)23:04:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118872197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118872197<\/a><br>Here&#039;s the problem I see.

Blocking your ISP from spying requires using a VPN so they don&#039;t even know what network you&#039;re connecting to. That costs money. That&#039;s bullshit.<br><br>I would be willing to believe Trump would do the right thing (not allow the ISP that people PAY for bandwidth from, to profit from how they use that data), except he already said he would be willing to shut off parts of the internet if it meant keeping terrerisms off of it (which is another insane proposal that only an idiot would support). This is a shitty situation and defending congress or the president just because you think they are &quot;on your side&quot; is cognitively weak.","time":1490852840,"resto":118867477,"id":"79HDqjKC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118890196,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)01:48:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118889904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118889904<\/a><br>just wait, 1 wrong move online and then u got feds bustin in for &quot;cp&quot;","time":1490852898,"resto":118867477,"id":"CvD+HNZC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118890325,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)01:49:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118867477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118867477<\/a>","filename":"yea","ext":".png","w":807,"h":598,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":92,"tim":1490852980908,"time":1490852980,"md5":"uI0GmfYyzIgXzCP21hTsqw==","fsize":82032,"resto":118867477,"id":"lFLcjwsE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118890401,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)01:50:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118875964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118875964<\/a><br>This.<br>It shouldn&#039;t be relevant unless hyper authoritarian laws get passed that make Orwellian thought crime laws seem like freedom, which won&#039;t happen, we shouldn&#039;t be affected nearly as bad as it seems.","time":1490853040,"resto":118867477,"id":"iK+0UTW4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118890426,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)01:50:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118889658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118889658<\/a><br>So to clarify you cant read? <br><br>I made it very clear in my last post. <br>But i&#039;ll reiterate just for you, because your shitposting makes me laugh. <br><br>The collection of metadata does not inherently infringe on personal privacy, but when the government has brought every ISP, and every digital company on board to collect the metadata it then crosses the boundary into infringement of personal privacy. <br><br>I explained in detail how metadata is just a collection of more data, all of which is troubling for a government to be collecting. <br><br>Would you like to go look up the definition of metadata?

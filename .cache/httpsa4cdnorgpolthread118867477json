In an effort to better serve advertisers, Verizon Wireless has been silently modifying its users&#039; web traffic on its network to inject a cookie-like tracker. This tracker, included in an HTTP header called X-UIDH, is sent to every unencrypted website a Verizon customer visits from a mobile device. It allows third-party advertisers and websites to assemble a deep, permanent profile of visitors&#039; web browsing habits without their consent.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Verizon apparently created this mechanism to expand their advertising programs, but it has privacy implications far beyond those programs. Indeed, while we&#039;re concerned about Verizon&#039;s own use of the header, we&#039;re even more worried about what it allows others to find out about Verizon users. The X-UIDH header effectively reinvents the cookie, but does so in a way that is shockingly insecure and dangerous to your privacy. Worse still, Verizon doesn&#039;t let users turn off this &quot;feature.&quot; In fact, it functions even if you use a private browsing mode or clear your cookies. You can test whether the header is injected in your traffic by visiting lessonslearned.org\/sniff or amibeingtracked.com over a cell data connection.<\/span><br><br>LOL","time":1490843047,"resto":118867477,"id":"KqagWBjy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118873508,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)23:04:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Andy Cush<\/span><br>every couple dozen times...","time":1490843060,"resto":118867477,"id":"eOHs2i47","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118873533,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)23:04:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118872197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118872197<\/a><br>Here&#039;s the problem I see.

It&#039;s truly majestic. The overture to Lohengrin itself is one of the most haunting and compelling preludes ever written; with deep and powerful cascading orchestral sound. It evokes a sense of mysticism, and a longing for a homeland that can be idealized, but to which one can never return. We hear in Lohengrin the prototypes of the &quot;Valhalla&quot; Leitmotif which will be used later in the Ring. <br><br>As an ethnic Greek, it makes me proud to behold such a piece, that the Germans have something so wonderful as part of their heritage. In the spirit of this patriotic nationalism, we should all aspire to construct such great works of which our countrymen can be proud. <br><br>And as far as the Russians go:<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aGN<wbr>ObWgU2Qw<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Zrs<wbr>YD46W1U0<br>Now, you may have heard the 1812 overture, but it is not often performed with the full chorale hymn in the beginning. Usually that is played by the inner strings. For a piece that is largely known for the famous cannon ending, I find that people overlook the the chorale to be absolutely criminal. It is EASILY the best and most moving part of the piece.

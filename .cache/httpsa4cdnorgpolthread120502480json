At the same time, Parscale\u2019s San Antonio-based team is engaged in a wide-ranging effort to discourage Democrats from supporting Hillary Clinton. ...For the people who do support Trump, the team has figured out how to reach them on Facebook and keep them hooked, even after the election is over.<\/span><br><br>Remember<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;even after the election is over. <\/span><br><br>They never left. \/ptg\/ is their colony.","filename":"Prosper Group Award Winning Trump Shills","ext":".png","w":1349,"h":2871,"tn_w":58,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491864504144,"time":1491864504,"md5":"kCJ3GOdk47AIIb5dvH9V2A==","fsize":2586174,"resto":120502480,"id":"7NFvRHLJ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120505566,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)18:48:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120504938\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120504938<\/a><br><br>lol finnish rape baby. you are disgusting. get back across the urals","time":1491864529,"resto":120502480,"id":"05+UwZ5l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120505598,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)18:48:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120505008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120505008<\/a><br>TOP KEK, well made video!

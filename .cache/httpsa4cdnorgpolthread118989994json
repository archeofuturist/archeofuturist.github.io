A factory and a customer may enter into a mutually beneficial exchange where the company sells a product to the customer. But if some pollution is required to make that product, that pollution will lower the quality of the air and make more citizens get lung cancer. These citizens did not consent to the economic transaction of the customer and the company. Because this interaction has an externality, it makes sense for the public to regulate it.<br><br>Another reason is that the government can help us cooperate in ways that are often difficult for individuals to achieve. Sometimes the elites can help us in situations where an unstable equilibrium is preferable to a more stable but shittier equilibrium. <br>See https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Priso<wbr>ner%27s_dilemma<br>Obviously it is better for both prisoners to stay silent. Each prisoner would prefer it that way. However, acting individually it is unlikely for them to achieve this equilibrium state- they simply aren&#039;t incentivized to stay silent. However, if they were members of a mafia (analogous to the government) threatening them with violence if they betray their partner, then they can be legitimately incentivized to stay silent and both receive the reduced sentence.","time":1490921494,"resto":118989994,"id":"9ZbpqhFu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118995998,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:54:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118989994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118989994<\/a><br><br>Libertarianism is a self-defeating ideology.<br><br>You can&#039;t create a libertarian utopia by importing savages who are not and will never be libertarian.","time":1490921696,"resto":118989994,"id":"Zqoik+KQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

But the basic idea is a &quot;partocracy&quot; named after computer partitions. Basically, the idea is you have a main partition, which is what we consider civilized society, and then thousands of little partition societies, which are experiments in any kind of society you can imagine. <br><br>So, if anyone has an idea that they think is better than the current system, they can start a new partition and see if it works. If it does, they can start adding more people to their partition. That way anyone can test their idea, as long as they are willing to become a pioneer for their beliefs.

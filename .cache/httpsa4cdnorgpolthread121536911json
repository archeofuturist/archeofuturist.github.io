There is a difference. Guarantee makes it sound like something more noble than what it was.<\/span><br>This isn\u00b4t EU4 lad. A guarantee means to promise to protect the sovereignty of a nation against foreign powers, which the British did, specifically against Germany and the Axis nations. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No, they broke it right about at the beginning, when instead of warring Polands invaders they allied them.<\/span><br>?<br>They didn\u00b4t ally Germany at all, and they didn\u00b4t ally the soviets until 1941, since at that time the Soviets were already friend with the Germans. <br>With the French being scared of their own communist and chamberlain&#039;s lack of a spine, a declaration of war against the USSR by the Allies was physically impossible.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I already said that German unification made England feel uncomfortable.<\/span><br>The UK was perfectly comfortable with german unification, as seen by the Treaty of Munich. It was when Germany broke that treaty, and therefore Britain&#039;s trust, that Chamberlain, who had pointed to munich as a success of his, was pressured to find some other way to prevent further German agression. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Much of that culture derives from the brutality of the war(England&#039;s war)<\/span><br>Again, not england\u00b4s war. The germans started it.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; and the outright lies they invented in order to justify it and forever paint themselves as the noble arbiters of social justice<\/span><br>And lo and behold, the american education is back.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It was in discovering how we&#039;ve all been lied to that I realized WW2 should have never been declared, which the results hint at strongly.<\/span><br>You\u00b4re right. If Germany had just held itself to the Munich treaty and expanded peacefully the war would never have happened.","time":1492449253,"resto":121536911,"id":"iKN4Ckwx","country":"IS","country_name":"Iceland"}]}

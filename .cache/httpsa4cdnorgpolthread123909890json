Consider these points:<br><br>1. Not a single country that is currently experiencing Antifa riots is a fascist country. <br>2. Not a single country that is currently experiencing Antifa riots has any likelihood of becoming a fascist country under current leadership or policy. <br>3. Every country that is currently experiencing Antifa riots have a vocal right wing calling for the Antifa organization to be considered a terrorist organization. <br>4. Inclusion of an organization opposed to &quot;fascism&quot; onto a listing of terrorist organizations opens the door to &quot;anti-fascist&quot; organizations to be labeled as terrorist organizations. <br>5. Antifa has obvious ties to George Soros. <br>6. George Soros has obvious ties to organizations that have committed regime over throws in other countries. <br>7. Antifa, and by extension its founders and supporters, protest fascism while at the same time propping up fascist ideals.<br>8. When a truly fascist leader does attempt to take power, the groups and its backers associated with the current anti-fascist movement will be the ones that see the gain. <br>9. The right wing opponents of Antifa will be the outsiders in a truly fascist regime. <br>10. If anti-fascist protest groups are considered terrorist organizations, then when a truly fascist regime does come into power, those groups will be criminals against the state. <br><br>Obviously a truly fascist regime would not be labeled as such by the MSM, and of course the leader of that group would not campaign on that platform. Furthermore, we wouldn&#039;t even necessarily realize the true extent of the situation until the regime is in place. Are we being set up? Is this a plan that has been in the works? Could Trump be a pawn in a bigger game of 4D chess? While I completely agree that Antifa is a terrorist organization, I also recognize how important it is to look at the implications of our current situation. Is a change in strategy in order?

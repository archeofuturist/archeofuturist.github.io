If you do you would be asking for it. Notice this photo in my post? It&#039;s the screencap from the movie called &quot;fight club&quot;. The movie that was released 2 years before 9\/11. This one frame was inserted in the last scene where they demolished 2 WTC lookalike skyscrapers. So be very careful about rainbow fight clubs. They have those rules about stonewalling. And if you break that rule - they are prepared to do anything for the love of rioting.","filename":"latestjpg","ext":".jpg","w":1366,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492598103000,"time":1492598103,"md5":"geb0Tu63xGK7BgeNkyOSsA==","fsize":166274,"resto":121827830,"id":"Onl2zdVW","country":"LT","m_img":1,"country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":121830020,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)06:37:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121827830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121827830<\/a><br>The CIA had some offices there.","time":1492598225,"resto":121827830,"id":"3PLk4PdI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121830162,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)06:39:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121827830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121827830<\/a><br>They must have heard about the WTC&#039;s recently updated insurance policy that covers terrorism, in order to go out on a more positive one.","time":1492598360,"resto":121827830,"id":"\/jqiOVkw","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121830180,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)06:39:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121827830\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121827830<\/a><br>If you think crashing into the Goldman building would do anything you&#039;re a complete idiot. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Backed up data <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Senior executives always golfing somewhere<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; No real way to wedge a plane strategically into a packed street of solid stone buildings<\/span>","filename":"IMG_5332","ext":".png","w":200,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492598381022,"time":1492598381,"md5":"YYm\/1jzLA96gRc5EqgbLsQ==","fsize":11818,"resto":121827830,"id":"gU5je1wQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121830434,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)06:44:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121830020\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121830020<\/a><br>So did the FBI, the IRS, the NYC department of emergency management, it was all a fix<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Stupid fucking terrorists rigged building 7 to go down magically when the plane was nowhere near it and fallout was neither<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Building goes down and collapses into its own frame <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Being this dumb to believe this shady shit<\/span>","time":1492598645,"resto":121827830,"id":"gU5je1wQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121830586,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)06:46:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121830020\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121830020<\/a><br>CIA doesn&#039;t have any offices.

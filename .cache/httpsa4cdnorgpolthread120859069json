You can only inhabit 10% of your entire continent, and even that sliver is constantly trying to murder you while you pay dole money to abos. You&#039;re not better, you&#039;re just fucking stupid for not moving elsewhere.

Take it from a Canadian, having a shrill woman lecturing you about feminism and diversity and dont be proud of your country&#039;s culture, much worse than having voted for someone for a chance at change.

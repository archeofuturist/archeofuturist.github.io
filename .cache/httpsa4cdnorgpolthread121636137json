Capitalists and Fascists, while having their differing opinions are compatible. Communism is compatible with nothing. Communism is evil.<br><br><br>The only thing fascism did wrong was lose WW2 to communists. Jews simply ride the coattails of communism. Stalin hated fascism so much he pushed this lie of mass extermination at the hands of the Nazis. You will notice ALL of the concentration camps labeled as death camps are in areas the allies couldn&#039;t get to before the Communists could dress them up as &quot;death camps.&quot; The Jews, being parasites, used this to their advantage to push their own story to get their own middle eastern land rich with oil (it wasn&#039;t, to their misfortune and is why they are constantly at war with their oil rich neighbors). With Stalin&#039;s lie in place, the rest of the world believed that Fascism was about mass extermination of people they didn&#039;t like. He spread this lie all while killing anyone who disagreed with him. Many people risked their lives to ESCAPE from communism, to those who lived it, death was a better alternative. <br><br>If you label yourself as a communist, you are the enemy, You are the enemy to the west, east, middle east, ANYWHERE. You are the enemy of Life. YOU are a pawn of a system the seeks to ultimately destroy you. You are the useful idiot.<br><br>The biggest irony of any communist revolution, is that it starts with college academics who are told and believe its a good idea. The college academics are then the first to be purged, the very ones who questioned their previous system are a THREAT to the communistic leaders.<br><br>Communism is so in line with human nature, it has to be forced at gunpoint to work.

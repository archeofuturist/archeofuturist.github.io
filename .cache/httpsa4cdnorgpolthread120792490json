And that really isn&#039;t the case.<br>Le Pen is and has always been a silver-spooned career politician who hopped on the platform created by her father to propell herself into positions of relative power, she has been cumulating offices for a while, and in the last decade she has led the party in a wildly demagogue direction by grabbing the talking points of the radical left (which has completely alienated its voter base by keeping itself stuck in 70s union talk and outdated marxist rethorics) to gain the favour of their electorate.<br>And that is the big difference. The FN in its current state does not really have much of a precise goal (like UKIP did which was their strength but is also what is currently killing them since they have exhausted all their usefulness) or any precise position. The party just throws a strange blend of far-left mesures (like a hard cap of the retirement age at 60) but presents them in a manner closer to the former far-right direction it had by dropping the class rethorics and replacing it in the context of the EU and globalisation instead. The result is a party that really doesn&#039;t seem to have many clear ideas, politicians who for a large part came from other parties once the FN started rising in popularity, and spend a lot more time yelling on the radio and TV than in the circumscriptions they were elected in.","time":1492027049,"resto":120792490,"id":"JgeuPbOA","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120799773,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:01:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Lepen will win","time":1492027288,"resto":120792490,"id":"lOtbUzHe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120799926,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:02:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120798721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120798721<\/a><br>They are incompatible, he mostly doesn&#039;t like the way the EU does that iirc his position is &quot;well we will try to take it in another direction if it doesn&#039;t work screw them we&#039;re out&quot;","time":1492027364,"resto":120792490,"id":"nLxKOo1N","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120800208,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)16:05:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120799296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120799296<\/a><br>I view Le Pen as a very Trump-like centrist because her economic platform does not entirely consist of left-wing ideas as shills like you would have us believe.

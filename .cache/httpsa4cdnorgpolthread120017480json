Four people could, theoretically, provide reasonably objective reports, but only if they were open to receiving information from many sources, including ones supportive of the Syrian government.

Rahman, and the SOHR that he runs, has long ago been exposed as a Western propaganda front. As Tony Cartalucci writes in his expose:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;One could not fathom a more unreliable, compromised, biased source of information, yet for the past two years, his &quot;Observatory&quot; has served as the sole source of information for the endless torrent of propaganda emanating from the Western media.

His funding comes from the European Union and &quot;an unnamed European state,&quot; most likely the UK as he has direct access to former Foreign Minister William Hague, who he has been documented meeting in person on multiple occasions at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in London and shares Rahman&#039;s enthusiasm for removing Assad from power. The NYT in fact reveals that it was the British government that first relocated Abdul Rahman to Coventry, England after he fled Syria over a decade ago because of his anti-government activities:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;When two associates were arrested in 2000, he fled the country, paying a human trafficker to smuggle him into England. The government resettled him in Coventry, where he decided he liked the slow pace.&quot; <\/span><br><br>Et voila! What was once a criminal with subversive tendencies is now a &#039;human rights activist&#039; (but really a British intelligence asset). Does anyone really think that any of these organizations would pay a convicted criminal to be anything other than their mouthpiece for seeding the lies printed in Western media?

Are there any investigative journalists left in mainstream media? Those with two firing neurons are few and far between these days...<br><br>Western intelligence agencies set up the armed opposition\/terrorist proxy forces in Syria, so they would obviously want to control the media narrative about what happens there. Rahman does his part by vacuuming up information reported by those same proxy forces. This information is then given out to the Western media with SOHR as source.

They were, as the saying goes, &#039;fixing the facts around a war policy&#039; by using the bogus claims of known liars to justify their war. This is precisely what Mr. SOHR is doing for the US government today, and still, the media sucks it up and regurgitates it for the general public.<br><br>So this is what our media has become, a gaggle of morons brainlessly repeating lies vomited up by our psychopathic reality-creators, thereby manipulating public perception of world events and making sure we all see the world the way they want us to see it, and not how it really is. One thing is certain: if you believe what Rahman and the SOHR is telling you about what&#039;s happening in Syria, you are believing in lies. <br><br>(by Beau Christensen)","time":1491600274,"resto":120017480,"id":"a4X+7sAn","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120026659,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)17:25:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120017644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120017644<\/a><br>Still don&#039;t understand why people don&#039;t understand this.","time":1491600315,"resto":120017480,"id":"hBoXdLoA","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":120026775,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)17:25:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120020655\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120020655<\/a><br>This is the best, most productive, post I&#039;ve seen on here all day.

But the commies managed a miracle: the senate and congress have just approved a law that will completely open all borders for any country in the world to come here. Sounds bad? Check this out: all immigrants will have full access to education, from primary school to college, full healthcare, full housing, social security, an easier path to citizenship and a bunch of other rights. Can it get worse? Yes, it can! All immigrants will also have the right to start a political party, which automatically grants public funds to do as they please. And to wrap it all up with a golden ribbon, they made all of this stuff a right to any generation of children that had theirs parents leave the country and come back. Oh, and anyone who criticize or say anything negative to one of these immigrants will be put in jail.<br><br>Leftism is a mental disease.","filename":"1492242831892","ext":".png","w":408,"h":265,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":162,"tim":1492757964932,"time":1492757964,"md5":"5gcR1cW5ZTF4y1quFONHzQ==","fsize":83490,"resto":0,"id":"pGpO\/hux","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-final-nail-in-the-coffin-for-brazil","country_name":"Brazil","replies":203,"images":39,"unique_ips":82,"tail_size":50},{"no":122109330,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)03:02:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is Portuguese easy to learn for Spanish speakers?","time":1492758168,"resto":122109057,"id":"aeMYfW4s","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122109386,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)03:03:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"Good, for years we have been super jelly of how you left us behind, now you&#039;re gonna fall lower than us.<br><br>It is sad in a certain way, but fuck you monkeys.<br>I hope all the bolivians an paraguayans go there instead of here<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw the will keep coming here because they dont want to leaf hue-speech<\/span>","filename":"jwuty8e","ext":".gif","w":352,"h":500,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492758210434,"time":1492758210,"md5":"EI6yhoEppGsx4lZ0Opcjow==","fsize":2155739,"resto":122109057,"id":"0i+Awk5W","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":122109576,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)03:05:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122109057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122109057<\/a><br>Who cares?

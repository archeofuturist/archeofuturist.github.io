No need in sticking around in bullshit that only pisses you off.<br><br>#4 Remember who runs this shit. We aren&#039;t a shill board, this has happened before. Eventually these over-organized obvious faggots will go back to whichever \/r\/ or tumblr that they came from. We own this shit.<br><br>#5 Remember that we won, and they lost. They&#039;ll try and keep touting the rejection of the AHCA as some type of victory, and will continue to overestimate their own cause for the sheer fragility of their own egos. In time Obamacare will fail even harder than it has.<br><br>#6 No that these people are natural racebaiters and cannot do a damn thing as individuals. They&#039;re a herd mentality that gets alarmed when their swarm isn&#039;t with them because they can&#039;t put up a decent fight.<br><br>#7 These cunts try and steal our memes and peddle them as originals. Let that sink in. These faggots are so incompetent that they have to physically take our means of both humor and informational conveyance to try to display some form of dominance.<br><br>#8 These faggots are doing this out of desperation for actual victory. &quot;When in doubt, gloat like a dumbass&quot;-Leftist Mental Mantra.

Drudge also has a masterful slow-drip agenda that goes overlooked: convince red staters that the apocalypse is inevitable and that whites are doomed; that&#039;s why he links \/x-tier shit and dog whistles fundamentalist Christians (he&#039;s a gay Jew in Miami, the irony). <br><br>InfoWars is okay, but more like a cheerleader for 2A and Trump. If you&#039;re a normie, AJ&#039;s docs and deep archives aren&#039;t a waste of time. <br><br>Research the hell out of Communism, Judaism, and Fascism. <br><br>If you want a white news perspective online: Counter Currents and the Occidental Observer are requisite bookmarks. <br><br>We all wish we could spend as many hours reading history and political literature as we do glazing over online &quot;news.&quot; Check yourself before it&#039;s too late.

That was the first form of multiculturalism (in other words destroying and merging cultures) which we suffered.<br><br>What we&#039;re witnessing now is the next and final phase in the war - now the war is against the White race itself.<br><br>One of the most important reasons the Jews are even able to wage this current war against us, is thanks to Europe already having been weaked by Christianization for so long.","filename":"tyr_and_Fenrir_by_John_Bauer","ext":".jpg","w":733,"h":855,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491826922199,"time":1491826922,"md5":"2wpToi3G0QuytTXrS5feQg==","fsize":90716,"resto":120420879,"id":"iplrGkwD","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120432387,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)08:23:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120420879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120420879<\/a><br>Sheeeiiiiiit","time":1491826994,"resto":120420879,"id":"c9ohooBE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120432406,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)08:23:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120421170\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120421170<\/a><br><br>Do you even know what Anglo means?

They decide based on emotional whims and subjective feels that something Trump did is unconstitutional. That forces him to either grit his teeth and play a long-game or pull Jacksons &quot;they&#039;ve declared it was illegal, now let them come and enforce it&quot; which would plummet the state into a constitutional crisis and ratchet up tensions to an exponential degree.<br><br>The tragedy is that yeah we might be utterly secure from an absolute tyrant - but that is because we have created an absolute bureaucratic tyrant. &quot;Bureaucracy&quot; is thrown around so much the word has lost meaning but today when you look at the USA and the EU or China or Japan or any number of countries you really do see a true bureaucracy in the greek meaning of the word.

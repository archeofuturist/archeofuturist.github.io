One of the biggest points of cultural clash is manners. For example in Canadian culture if you are on the bus, there is not enough seats and an elderly, pregnant or disabled person gets on, you are supposed to offer your seat to those who need it more. However Muslims don&#039;t do this, until some local scolds them for it. Even then they revert back to their old behaviour if they get enough Muslims in one place. Another place where Muslims replace our culture is food. When I was a kid you could find some Canadian cuisine in the Toronto area. Now Canadian restaurants can&#039;t compete anymore because 1) Mohammed refuses to eat anything that isn&#039;t halal and 2) Mohammed will work for pennies to the dollar. As a result Canadian cuisine based restaurants are a lot harder to find in the Toronto area. <br>Now, what they do to our communities. They like to commit crime. I will give you an example: We had some Saudis out in the Sault because of a contract with their government, number wise only a couple hundred over a couple of years. These were rich, well-to-do Muslims. They stole anything that wasn&#039;t bolted down or locked away. Even then, a group managed to walk off with a projector bolted to the ceiling. Another got deported recently on the following charges: driving while impaired, drug possesion, theft charges, assault(civilian, female), assult(officer). Don&#039;t get me started on how they treat the women around here. And this is only the tip of the iceberg.","time":1491391356,"resto":119590971,"id":"u7xB0Okw","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119596751,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)07:25:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119591545\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119591545<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. nonwhite cashing in on white guilt since 1878<\/span>","time":1491391501,"resto":119590971,"id":"hcupw5qz","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119597020,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)07:28:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"How does the left excuse this?<br><br>Muslim parents protest against gay teacher at Berlin preschool<br>Published time: 29 Mar 2017 | 17:16 GMT<br>\u00a9 Fabrizio Bensch<br>Reuters \/<br>Muslim parents have threatened to gather signatures for a petition against a Berlin preschool, after discovering that one of its male teachers is gay.

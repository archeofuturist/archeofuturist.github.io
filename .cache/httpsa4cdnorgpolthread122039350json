She says she is anti system but don&#039;t talk much about it. We just know it&#039;s all about closing our borders. <br><br>Macron is not a good example since he is probably tied with lobbies and banks, but he isn&#039;t &quot;left&quot; or &quot;right&quot;, he isn&#039;t with the big one, and people wants to join him, whatever their party is. <br>If he get elected, it will probably change how French politics parties works. <br>PS (left, socialists) is dead and won&#039;t come back easily. <br>LR (right, liberalism) will survive, but will need some new face probably. <br><br>Another example, that is way better is Melenchon. <br>He wants to stop the 5th republic for the 6th, give more power to the citizen etc. <br>He is awesome regarding social reforms, ecology and all this stuff, but his economical program is like playing poker and doing a all in with a shitty hand. (it&#039;s basically based on Keynes) <br>It&#039;s basically a &quot;fuck the system&quot; while keeping our border open economically","time":1492726467,"resto":122039350,"id":"G8ORlYqf","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122052995,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:14:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122052393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122052393<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;old school buddy is Algerian<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;working in finance<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;litteraly more extreme than any skinhead when it comes to banlieu sandniggers <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Work collegue are the same<\/span><br><br>They are pissed as fuck by this shit","time":1492726472,"resto":122039350,"id":"9hGnXzIG","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122053018,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:14:41","name":"Corporal Clegg","com":"Le Pen will clean France of the scum","filename":"pfteachernew","ext":".jpg","w":413,"h":630,"tn_w":81,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492726481277,"time":1492726481,"md5":"PV5hnk7mDdcRpnz9vl0SNQ==","fsize":41623,"resto":122039350,"id":"pQNlycGP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122053049,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)18:14:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122047542\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122047542<\/a><br>This amount of bullshit from a 16 y\/o LARP&#039;in Melanshill...<br>Lepen was also the first french politician to present a north african arab for a deputy post in the parliament.<br>SO RAYCISST.<br><br>Lepen&#039;s father was killed by a german antiship mine.

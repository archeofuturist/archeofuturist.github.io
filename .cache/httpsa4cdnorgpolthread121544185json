These people are shills and newfags. <br><br>Saying shit like &quot;real \/pol\/ thinks this&quot; shows you are either a newfag or a shill. \/pol\/ has never been some hivemind being, there has always been extreme dissent. That why we like \/pol\/, it&#039;s not an echo chamber. If you think you can categorize us as &quot;\/pol\/ thinks this,&quot; then you have become to used to the Reddit hivemind where everyone pats each other on the back and agrees. \/pol\/ was never like that, and never will be, so just stop. Listening to you try to define what we are is as entertaining as watching the mainstream media try to understand it.","filename":"NewFags","ext":".jpg","w":162,"h":90,"tn_w":162,"tn_h":90,"tim":1492446102053,"time":1492446102,"md5":"CVKrxG31JZUNhzugLgHKjw==","fsize":4870,"resto":0,"id":"0ql4WEi9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"shills-and-newfags","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121544599,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)12:25:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121544185\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121544185<\/a>","filename":"umadbra","ext":".png","w":2404,"h":1260,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1492446306504,"time":1492446306,"md5":"Y6\/E0MDHSyhdrTdn3Qgp2g==","fsize":857685,"resto":121544185,"id":"vKng9MH6","country":"FR","m_img":1,"country_name":"France"}]}

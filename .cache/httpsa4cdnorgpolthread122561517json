During the surge and for about 5ish minutes after the sky to the west was glowing a very bright blue. The blue was fading in and out, fluctuating in intensity. Me being very autistic I did not take any pictures of the sky(I was face timing a friend) but my roommate and I drove around after the glowing in the sky stopped and saw many of the traffic lights completely out and the generators on campus had kicked in. There are a lot of fire trucks, police driving racing around (think that is because of car crashes resulting from the out traffic lights) <br><br>I vaguely remember reading on here about some weird power outages and surges in other cities possibly related to solar flares. I am not knowledgeable enough on the subject to really say much so I&#039;m sure y&#039;all and your autism could figure it out if there is anything to figure out.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pic Related view outside my dorm window<\/span>","filename":"IMG_2436","ext":".jpg","w":4032,"h":3024,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493021233807,"time":1493021233,"md5":"UvJtzPEI\/tVUVfnSbLHorg==","fsize":1794697,"resto":0,"id":"ARr+inAb","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"possible-happening","country_name":"United States","replies":27,"images":1,"unique_ips":18},{"no":122561784,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:10:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"car crashes from traffic lights being out at 3AM on monday morning doesn&#039;t add up.<br><br>Why aren&#039;t there any emergency vehicles in your pic<br><br>riiiiight","time":1493021419,"resto":122561517,"id":"Rx22vyc0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122561986,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:13:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122561784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122561784<\/a><br>Thats just what I assumed, campus is empty this time of night but there where cars around other parts of town.

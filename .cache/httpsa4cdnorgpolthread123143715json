Nuclear power by necessity requires large organizational hierarchies. Why does this matter? Because it means further alienating people from being active consumers, and typically people don&#039;t like that.<br><br>Even if people don&#039;t exercise their right to a choice (for instance, choosing electricity providers in deregulated electricity markets), they still want that choice. The regulatory, economic, and political structures that are necessary to keep nuclear power safe and abundant would make choices less available to consumers (monopoly economics, long regulatory cycles, nuclear policy wrapped up in national defense, etc.)<br><br>Distributed generation schemes (distributed solar and storage, primarily) require fewer hierarchical structures and put power in the hands of consumers (both literally and figuratively) more effectively. People tend to gravitate to things they can, or even just feel like they can, exert more control over. Even with perfect information, the sense of unease from control being taken away will always surround nuclear.","time":1493352562,"resto":123143715,"id":"8zRvRFIL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123144359,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:09:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123143715\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123143715<\/a><br>artificial scarcity <br><br>the market prices goods, but there is no guarantee that any market solution is an optimal one, and in this case traditional economics are forcing things backwards (like a gravity well almost). <br><br>There is literally no reason for the world to not pursue aggressive improvements in fission (and eventually fusion) tech and usher in the &#039;abundance for all&#039; age of humanity.","time":1493352579,"resto":123143715,"id":"cwSosPx1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123144633,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:11:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123143906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123143906<\/a><br>Kek you clearly know nothing of nuclear energy.

Returning for its fifth and final season, the series takes it up a notch with graphic violence befitting its adult themes.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Yale Herald panned its return not for tonal shift or changes in subject matter, but for issues as trivial as cultural appropriation, perceived homophobia and sexism.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;...<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After giving a rundown on the new season\u2019s story and setting (it all takes place 50 years after the end of the fourth season, which last aired in 2003) and details about the changes to the show\u2019s titular character, Jack, the review decries Tartakovsky\u2019s presentation of the season\u2019s first villain, Scaramouche.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cScaramouche, with his flamboyant dress and mannerisms which include ending every sentence with \u2018babe,\u2019 reads as somewhat tone deaf and homophobic,\u201d declares Yale Herald writer Sam Kruyer. It\u2019s only that way if you choose to project your own ideas of gay men onto the character.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;...<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The review goes on to complain about the show\u2019s portrayal of samurai, which the author claims is \u201crooted in a Wikipedia level understanding of the historical figure,\u201d and that it even \u201cfeels appropriative at times.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;...<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Finally, the review argues that the show\u2019s depiction of female bodies is \u201cuncomfortable\u201d despite the season\u2019s introduction of Ashi, a strong female character. The complaint is highly reminiscent of the cries against He-Man and other 80s cartoons, which came from the religious right, and not the far left.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Just as Samurai Jack\u2019s protagonist is old and tired in the latest season, so too are the arguments the Yale Herald raises against it.<\/span><br><br>Why must the Left wage a war against all that was and still is good in the world? Especially college students with fuck-all experience?","filename":"samurai-jack-header","ext":".png","w":1715,"h":650,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":94,"tim":1493096098230,"time":1493096098,"md5":"ucB92WvAATWB+TvcpbKsMg==","fsize":350999,"resto":0,"id":"spME7fZP","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"once-more-the-perfidious-regressive-menace","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":122694885,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:57:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Scaramouche best boy","filename":"1490504062918","ext":".png","w":187,"h":252,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493096270121,"time":1493096270,"md5":"QhWD9u\/1iSWblP0kk8tDsQ==","fsize":64348,"resto":122694584,"id":"raWQk\/4c","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122694943,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:58:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122694584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122694584<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sam Kruyer<\/span><br>Can a veteran shlomo sniffer figure out if this is coincidence?","time":1493096313,"resto":122694584,"id":"kq69s2x0","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122694945,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)00:58:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Scaramouche the gay robot took a dick into his robot neck hole in the latest episode.","time":1493096314,"resto":122694584,"id":"YamwOx9u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

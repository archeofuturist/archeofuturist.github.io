If the soldiers manning the machine gun nest know that if at any time they can surrender and come out alive then they could kill as many of the attackers as they possibly could before they were overrun and then surrender. This obviously doesn&#039;t sit right with the attacking force, why should the defender live when just five seconds ago he was gunning down the attacker. In fact, given two rational parties the attacker could reduce the potential resistance of the defender by making it clear that they will not allow surrender unless the defender takes a greater effort to stay his hand and not fight until the last moment.<br><br>This is a very specific example but I think it gets the mind in the right frame of reference.","time":1493764904,"resto":123830383,"id":"kvLQCb9n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

I know that we can never return to the past. But I also know that if we are ever to move forward again we have to get rid of this racial mess which has engulfed America. I know that no multi-racial society can be a healthy or stable society. Some people who agree with me that the present racial situation is untenable and can only become worse under the government&#039;s present policies nevertheless cannot conceive of rectifying the situation. They believe that once a country has been integrated racially it cannot be un-integrated. But it can be \u2014 although the process of un-integration is likely to be a very painful and bloody process. It is likely to require a civil war much worse than the one we went through in the last century. It certainly will disrupt the lives of everyone involved. The soft couch potatoes and the trendy consumers would much prefer to avoid the disruption, so that they can continue their TV- viewing and their consuming. Even people made of somewhat sterner stuff are horrified by the prospect of straightening out our racial situation. But we must do it. We must plan for it. We must not refuse to think about it just because it will be difficult and unpleasant. We are in our present mess because we failed to act when action would have been far less painful.","filename":"william pierce arrives in your thread to remind you to repeal the 1965 immigration act and remove traitors","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":775,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":107,"tim":1490454711362,"time":1490454711,"md5":"mKWGq9KvypRDcrn9JSbWMw==","fsize":29068,"resto":118233352,"id":"kOUAREN7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118233437,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)11:11:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"when is that antifa\/trump rally thing starting?","filename":"Alex Jones Anime Transformation","ext":".jpg","w":699,"h":549,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":98,"tim":1490454712518,"time":1490454712,"md5":"64fdEB9gxHy8BtrNnZGGuQ==","fsize":43430,"resto":118233352,"id":"UrcDcoY9","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":118233496,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)11:12:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"NEWLY UPDATED:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[X]Defeated Hillary easily<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[X]Laughed at delusional recount attempts<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[X]Laughed at delusional electoral coup attempts<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[X]Trump inaugurated as expected<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[X]Increase in transgender suicide rate<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[X]Laughed at delusional children in pink hats<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[X]Laughed as said delusion children were arrested and sentenced to felony rioting, ruining their entire lives in their mid 20&#039;s over nothing<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[X]Revealed Sessions had no ties to Russia<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[X]Forced Sessions confirmation<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[X]Forced DeVos confirmation<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[X]Cucked Obamacare<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[X]Baited NYT into publishing lies about President Trump without proof<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[X]Secured wall funding<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[X]Democrats caught lying about Russian collusion<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[X]Wiretapping claims proven true<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[X]HWNDU divided<\/span><br>---&gt;YOU ARE HERE&lt;---<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[ ]Paul Ryan&#039;s career ended<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[ ]Gorsuch Confirmed<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[ ]Implement tax cuts for the middle class<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[ ]SCOTUS rules in favor of Muslim ban<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[ ]Wide ranging investigation into DNC\/Soros collusion<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[ ]Wall built<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[ ]Full tax returns released, are totally clean<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[ ]First manned mission to Mars<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[ ]Bipartisan support for the reelection of President Trump<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[ ]President Trump serves 8+ years without being impeached<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[ ]Democrat leaders tried for Treason<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[ ]Imprisoned<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[ ]All die alone, poor, and disgraced in Prison<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[ ]Leftists are socially ostracized and humiliated for their delusional and childish beliefs<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[ ]President Donald Trump leads the nation into a new age of wealth and prosperity<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;[ ]President Donald J.

We have no pride in our government which we recognize is as fucked as any. <br><br>Look at Russians that still look back at the USSR fondly as an example. It wasn&#039;t exactly thriving living conditions by any means, yet they are proud as a people and that they come together. <br><br>America provides us plenty of freedoms and safeties I took for granted till I saw how fucked Europe is getting with free speech, gun rights and now failing police protection against muslim hoards. <br><br>At least in America I feel I can walk outside safely where I&#039;m at, and if someone were to fuck with me, I actually have protection of the laws to beat their ass legally till the situation is defused.<br><br>Our way of life is to live free, and to let others do the same.

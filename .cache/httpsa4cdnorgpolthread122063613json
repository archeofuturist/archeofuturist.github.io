The taxation that continues to fund this army and police force pays for these forces and then some. Let&#039;s not forget that most of the money that funds the military is also loaned to the government via the Federal reserve. This allows them to build armies on money they don&#039;t even have and use their citizen&#039;s taxes as collateral. <br><br>A private entity couldn&#039;t obtain the same size of military unless they too used usury and coercion. The moment they do issue their own currencies and have the authority to initiate physical harm upon another by a system of law which supersedes the state, they have become the state.","filename":"745632356","ext":".png","w":582,"h":557,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":119,"tim":1492731651405,"time":1492731651,"md5":"wsc0v\/qYck1nyPXWqdn7dw==","fsize":245224,"resto":122063613,"id":"y41YduEC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122064304,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)19:42:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122063613\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122063613<\/a><br>Die fur faggot.","filename":"1487482516810","ext":".png","w":600,"h":450,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492731748884,"time":1492731748,"md5":"6EvQjb0ig5cmmXCXQ6M55Q==","fsize":382128,"resto":122063613,"id":"rjORZsTD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122066484,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:02:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122064105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122064105<\/a><br>The military is much more expensive under a state when government officials and the military-industrial complex collude.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;most of the money that funds the military is also loaned to the government via the Federal reserve<\/span><br>Makes me think you have no idea how the Fed works. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;build armies on money they don&#039;t even have <\/span><br>What makes you think private companies can&#039;t take loans?","time":1492732945,"resto":122063613,"id":"M9X4xT+9","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":122066931,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)20:06:17","name":"CrucifyRobinHood","com":"<a href=\"#p122064105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122064105<\/a><br>Gotta make a lot of assumptions to support that one.

It&#039;s not circular logic to assume that the fundamental differences between a free-market private business and a state will make one inherently stronger than the other. As soon as the private business adapts the state&#039;s strategies to compete, it is no longer a business that operates under a state, but it becomes a state independent.<br><br>What funds are the volunteer army going to be issued? The funds of a state? A currency issued by the corporation itself?<br><br>That would be a logistical nightmare unless that currency is recognized to have value by other corporate entities that can meet the desires and needs of the individual who enlists in the volunteer army. As soon as other corporations see the corporation who is raising an army as a threat, they will refuse to accept their currency because it strengthens their business and makes their own private interests less capable of competition.<br><br>At this point, the private army either falls apart because it is unable to provide adequate incentive or it uses the threat of force to take the goods and services of other private entities without consent or forces them to recognize the value of their issued currency. They have become the state.<br><br>If they somehow can provide everything the army needs from food to water to entertainment and can issue a currency where all these things can be obtained within their own company, they may be able to create a large army, but the statist army already accomplishes that easily.<br><br>Let&#039;s not forget that if there ever is a fight where the army actually must operate, there will be many issues such as desertion. If the individual signed a contract agreeing to sign away his sovereignty to the military and cannot desert on pains of death or imprisonment, then this is no different than the social contract talked about by John Locke and therefore has become a state.","time":1492734540,"resto":122063613,"id":"y41YduEC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

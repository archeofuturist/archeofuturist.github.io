Even the Canadian military has taken into consideration the use of chemical weapons by rebels in its reservation to shy away from Iraq. It&#039;s a real thing.

You have wahhabis involvedly spreading their toxic idealogy far and wide throughout MENA and Europe and trying single-handedly define Islam as they see it, and the US just props them up and perpetrates global media propaganda to prop them up and move the world against those that are in their way. Assad&#039;s no angel and we lebs have been against him since the fucking 80s, but everyone in their right mind while unhappy with Assad would never say that the opposition is anything but detestable &amp; undesirable. I really thought Trump was anti-war and getting US dick out of the region, but I was wrong. I&#039;d hate being an Trump-voting American right now because I&#039;d realize democracy is a lie.

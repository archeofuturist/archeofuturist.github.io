Hang on because it&#039;s a little complicated, and I&#039;m going to have to skip over some of the more complicated shit, but here goes.<br><br>First off, consciousness arises not from an immaterial soul, but from the arrangement of matter. This isn&#039;t as depressing as it sounds at first, because matter itself, when you get down to it, is immaterial. The reason is that reality is fundamentally created from *information*, not matter as you&#039;d usually think. Every atom is exactly like any other, and there&#039;s some evidence to make you think that sometimes systems can get even less granular than that. What makes you &quot;you&quot; is the information, the pattern, that encodes your being.<br><br>Patterns are about the only metaphysical thing that can be studied scientifically, so it kind of makes sense that if there is a soul, it&#039;s information. Information may be able to be obliterated, but all that really does is separate that pattern from the local information system, and even then maybe only temporarily-- that underlying metaphysical structure that encodes the pattern can never actually be excluded from reality-- it can always arise again, even if just by blind luck.<br><br>The theory of relativity, they say, posits that time had a beginning in the Big Bang. That&#039;s a little concerning because if time had a beginning it can have an end-- but honestly, that&#039;s not really true. It&#039;s more a linguistic sleight of hand than an actual theory-- what they mean when they say that is that, running their models backwards in time, things reach a point where the equations break down, and no longer reflect reality as we know it. We get equations saying, for example, that gravity should have been so intense that time would not be able to move forward at all (since increasing time influences gravity etc). <br><br>continued.","time":1490321081,"resto":118008007,"id":"A5zrs9dD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118023803,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)22:06:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118022640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118022640<\/a><br>Universe need not have an anthropocentric explanation anon.<br><br>The mere fact we can understand anything at all is the most impressive part - t.einstein","filename":"1477682408534","ext":".jpg","w":1612,"h":1057,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1490321204803,"time":1490321204,"md5":"M0YDe+EQKlEqOAS\/+2rpVA==","fsize":317710,"resto":118008007,"id":"BnqpNOM0","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118024108,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)22:09:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118023544\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118023544<\/a><br>The quantum model of the universe, which seems to supersede relativity, indicates that time is probably infinite, and furthermore, matter and energy all have a really small chance of being spontaneously created at every point in the universe at any time. <br><br>The basic upshot of all this is that everything that can possibly happen WILL happen an infinite number of times. Look up Boltzman brains-- basically, consciousnesses that form themselves from random perturbations of matter and energy.

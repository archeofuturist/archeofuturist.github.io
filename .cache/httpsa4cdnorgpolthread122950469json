One thing he uses in his shows are trendy at the moment meme&#039;s of the current culture. He did 80&#039;s style rap songs in his show for example.<br><br>I am going to explain what I think the thought process to be behind this current &quot;downfall&quot; as we see it, and show how it was not really a downfall at all...

You have to give Bill some trust and allow yourself to think that he actually wants to educate people using the best possible means of doing so.<br><br>If Bill want&#039;s to reach a target audience of people, science illiterate individuals, he would have to do that in a way that does not alienate them. The segment that we seen go viral was designed for just that, the Internet.

I am going to space the question and bold it, and I want you to answer it. I always enjoy using lots of separated sentences, I don&#039;t know why.<br><br>If a person wants to teach science to a audience who needs it, what is the downfall over all if he alienates people who already know science?<br><br>Ratings? Money? Or... If you look at what he claims, wanting to spread knowledge, absolutely NOTHING. Under the guise of spreading good information, science communicators gain NOTHING by teaching people who already know about the things you are teaching. As long as the motive is pure. A PhD in english does not take a entry level English class to learn about English, as goes for any area of study.<br><br>He sacrificed his 90&#039;s audience for a reaction to redpill these fucking crazy idiots, it was a bold move but holy shit... If this is true, which we will be able to extrapolate, he did one of the most noble things that a public figures can do. Actor&#039;s\/public figures don&#039;t EVER want to lose their power over the people who admire them, so it&#039;s strange he would pull this move.<br><br>2\/3","time":1493245968,"resto":122950469,"id":"ctrqNUh1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122950584,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)18:33:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"3\/3 <br><br>Now, this is just a hypothesis which we can fact check.

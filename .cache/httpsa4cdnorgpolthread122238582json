This weekend a movie came out called &quot;The Promise&quot; and I saw it because I teach film at a community college and like to see as many movies in the theater as I can.<br><br>I was obviously moved by the story, and had some fresh perspective on the history of the event... but when I began researching, my mind exploded. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;These people were rounded up and killed, systematically, by Muslims in the Ottoman Empire.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Christians were specifically targeted.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;One of the main groups that targeted these people for mass murder were The Young Turks<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This event is where we get the word &quot;genocide&quot; in the first place<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now Turkey refuses to even acknowledge this even happened.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Armenian Genocide was what gave Hitler the idea for the Final Solution in the first place<\/span><br><br>And then there&#039;s the &quot;progressive&quot; news group called The Young Turks that are supported by the Democrats and were shilling hard for Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders and just... holy fucking shit. <br><br>Why don&#039;t we (not just as \/pol\/ but as a society) acknowledge this more? Why do we take Turkey&#039;s shit? Their attitude towards ISIS is bad enough, but they also just kind of pretend they weren&#039;t and aren&#039;t killing people by the thousands? And, to this day, silence people who ask questions about the genocide?<br><br>And then, when a US President says they&#039;ll recognize the genocide, they never do once elected. Obama? Promised on campaign trail, never mentioned it again. Bush did the same. Trump is being urged, and since the Remembrance Day for the Genocide is in three days, he might mention it.<br><br>Fuck, is there anything I&#039;m missing? Why don&#039;t we talk about this?","filename":"hqdefault","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492837308355,"time":1492837308,"md5":"oh2WWrFdQQgLMj7uKRMrcQ==","fsize":31225,"resto":0,"id":"PLAr5orM","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-feel-like-ive-just-been-redpilled-as-fuck","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":0,"unique_ips":11},{"no":122238773,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)01:04:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"I dont know goy","time":1492837442,"resto":122238582,"id":"ql9HyM70","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122238799,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)01:04:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"literally every single time TYT is mentioned, people say Cank denies the Armenian Genocide, and that his lady co-host whatever her name is, she&#039;s Armenian and doesn&#039;t care","time":1492837456,"resto":122238582,"id":"FRRiL6D5","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122238924,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)01:05:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122238582\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122238582<\/a><br>Quick rundown:<br><br>The roaches marched into a mountain range and got fucked royally by the Russians who were sitting there waiting for them.

If the wind is blowing and we&#039;re sleeping, then its power is wasted. So why not ship it to areas of need with power lines? We can but at resistive losses which can be significant.

There is a trade off between what percentage of time you want them to be turning and the amount of power they produce when they are turning. This is called the capacity factor.

By designing the size and blade pitch etc. you can engineer an optimal capacity factor for the environment of the turbine. <br><br>Presently, the highest capacity factors for wind turbines is about 30 percent.

Also, you need to transport the generated electricity to where it is used, usualyl on-shore, and building a subsea electrical cable is risky business, and the longer it is, the bigger the chance of a break is. <br>They are cool in concept and theoretically work, but in practice, they are too limited by geography to be a viable major source of power. They can work as an addition, but you will always need more relaiable sources as your primary source.","time":1492600352,"resto":121814067,"id":"F9xEVBf7","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121832428,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:12:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121829834\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121829834<\/a>","filename":"1466355895359","ext":".jpg","w":632,"h":398,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492600365921,"time":1492600365,"md5":"pvFasMGgRjRNvcH4hosBOw==","fsize":53893,"resto":121814067,"id":"Cnvafs8H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121832498,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:13:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121829577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121829577<\/a><br>\/pol\/ is natsoc and natsoc is pro conservation","time":1492600425,"resto":121814067,"id":"8bZMmIl8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121832536,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:14:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121815344\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121815344<\/a><br>... how is the fact more people are needed to sustain a power system a good thing?

If the wind is blowing and we&#039;re sleeping, then its power is wasted. So why not ship it to areas of need with power lines? We can but at resistive losses which can be significant.

There is a trade off between what percentage of time you want them to be turning and the amount of power they produce when they are turning. This is called the capacity factor.

By designing the size and blade pitch etc. you can engineer an optimal capacity factor for the environment of the turbine. <br><br>Presently, the highest capacity factors for wind turbines is about 30 percent.

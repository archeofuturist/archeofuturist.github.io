One time I was eating a taco at a taco stand and he came sauntering past stinking of stale cigarettes and booze and stopped in his tracks when he caught sight of me. &quot;It&#039;s called a TACO because it&#039;s NOT a sandwich!&quot; he growled at me, smugly. Then he noticed I was wearing jeans and a t-shirt. Well, that really got his juices flowing. Almost in an uncontrolled rage, he started howling, &quot;They&#039;re called PANTS because they are NOT shorts!&quot; and &quot;It&#039;s called a SHIRT because it&#039;s NOT a vest!&quot; I laughed a bit--&quot;yeah&quot; I said. I&#039;ve been confused about this encounter for years now until I came across your post. I guess this was kind of his thing, or something.","time":1490832974,"resto":118848120,"id":"bEy\/Sugn","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118855417,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)20:16:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118848120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118848120<\/a><br>Regardless if that being is real or not.

We need religion for that. <br><br>It&#039;s much easier for animals, since they are not capable of nihilism. They never think &quot;why should I not kill?&quot; or &quot;why should I suffer living?&quot; In a way they have values and morals as well, since they do behave socially, but they are unable to question them. Humans are, and that&#039;s what we have been doing for the last century. That is why our unhappiness has increased so dramatically even though the world is an easier place to live than ever before. That is why there is such rampant degeneracy, corruption and perversion. It is really a very rare individual that does not need religion.

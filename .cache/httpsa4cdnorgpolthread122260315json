SHE WILL WIN. HERE IS WHY. <br><br>Shills fuck off and listen up, this is how it is going down, screenshot this. <br><br>1st Round will result in a Le Pen\/Melenchon runoff. The numbers:<br><br>Le Pen - 25%<br>Melenchon - 21.7%<br>Macron - 21.0%<br>Fillon - 20.2%<br>Hamon - 5.2%<br><br>Shut up an trust me on that. I will be right. Le Pen historically always overperforms her polls unless there is another credible right wing candidate for her votes to go to. There isn&#039;t. I have used a variety of other methods to calculate the other numbers; to be very brief, always remember that Macron&#039;s base is FRAGILE (1\/3 of voters could change minds) and is attracted to Melenchon&#039;s base, where as Fillon has stalled because of Penelopegate, and there is no reason to vote for Hamon as Melenchon becomes the candidate for the Left. <br><br>2nd Round will be 51.43% for Le Pen and 48.51% for Melenchon. Polls after the first round will show roughly a 54\/46 race, favouring Melenchon. <br><br>The crucial moment will come when Fillon ENDORSES Le Pen (or several prominent members of his party). Why would he\/they do that, you ask? Because they support Le Pen AGAINST the commie Melenchon (he wants 100% tax on rich). ALSO, they will have a parliamentary majority, and want to get shit done. THEY CAN GET SHIT DONE WITH LE PEN, BUT NOT WITH MELENCHON. This is crucial to remember.<br><br>This will be the FINAL BLOW. Currently (((polls))) predict the abstention rates of Fillon supporters in a 2nd round Le Pen\/Melenchon to be approximately 50%. (i.e. 50% do not vote at all). Fillon\/his party&#039;s endorsement of Le Pen will reduce this rate to approximately 30%, which results in the 51.43% victory I described above. So, add all these factors in and Le Pen will Make France Great Again. I&#039;m waiting, \/pol\/. Shortly, you will see that I was right.","time":1492864174,"resto":122260315,"id":"XlMz\/e0G","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122271941,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)08:30:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122270301\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122270301<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122270627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122270627<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qBh<wbr>wOSDbs-I","time":1492864225,"resto":122260315,"id":"HziF1yRU","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122272062,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)08:31:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122260315\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122260315<\/a><br><br>You better not fuck this up, frog.

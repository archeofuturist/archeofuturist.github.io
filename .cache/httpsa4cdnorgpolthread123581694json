That being said, it is a requirement in some of the better paid departments. <br><br>Increasing the pay for cops isn&#039;t really necessary. Pay is not the main draw for people to become cops, it&#039;s the authority and the service of others, along with family traditions, that make people want to be cops. Most departments already have dozens, if not hundreds of qualified applicants for each position. <br><br>Most states require cops to pass tests on laws and codes. Most departments now require physical fitness tests, although they frequently grandfather in anyone already hired. This means most fat cops are old, and it will become increasingly rarer.","time":1493616300,"resto":123581694,"id":"ecYIXa30","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123583405,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)01:28:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123581694\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123581694<\/a><br>How fucking deluded\/stupid are you?<br><br>College grads went to college because they DONT want to work.

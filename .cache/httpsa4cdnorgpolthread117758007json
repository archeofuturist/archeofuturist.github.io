If I work hard then I know someone somewhere had more success with less effort or through a smarter method. I feel like a sucker.<br><br>I feel like I need to go outside and savour my youth even though I had no friends or social life all through university (and now) and going to the library or cinema ultimately makes me feel conned, like there was a promise of human \/ societal connection that never happened. No wonder I spend so much time on 4chan.<br><br>I already know I&#039;m asking a stupid question. I already know all advice is trivial and there is no method and so on. The most encouraging advice I can think of is also horrifying: that everything turns in to work when you care about it. I see groups of people at the gym (usually multiple guys and one girl) socialising by acting as unpaid clowns for the girl. This is horrific to watch, as if they&#039;ve managed to turn relaxing in to a rat race. Of course I&#039;m no better, my &quot;work&quot; is following a lifting routine. Even when I see people boasting about not working or being relaxed it&#039;s like seeing them take part in an insouciance pageant.","filename":"1490121075234","ext":".jpg","w":459,"h":448,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":244,"tim":1490189358880,"time":1490189358,"md5":"PZ4fGx9KnlDx8t\/Zbscc1Q==","fsize":133851,"resto":0,"id":"vB7urSO7","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-i-make-myself-work-hard-when-i-feel-cucked","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":117758212,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)09:31:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117758007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117758007<\/a><br>Soldier through until you get your paycheck.

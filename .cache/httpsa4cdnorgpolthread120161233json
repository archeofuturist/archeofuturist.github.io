I am going to finish post secondary soon and houses in any metropolitan area are on average upwards of a million dollars. Despite this, before tax the average household only makes several million during their life time before tax. We&#039;re getting fucked over with: Stagnant wages, skyrocketing house prices (grew by 33% on average in ONE FUCKING YEAR), more hours. Many blue pilled fags gave up and now continue to support the system which props this up (Mass immigration, low interest rates resulting in the bottom of the house market dramatically rising - you pay an extra 20% and the house you get is twice as nice, high taxes, green policies which make it take decades to get approval for infrastructure projects and make infrastructure far more expensive than it should be","time":1491678356,"resto":120161233,"id":"mIIZqXQo","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120168237,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:07:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120161233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120161233<\/a><br>So is this why I have any friends?

Sure we can get grocery store jobs or restaurant jobs but explain to me how that pays for a house and kids? FFS im sick of this existence. I try to get into good job fields but literally you have to be related to the boss somehow or already have 5+ years in the field.

There are 10 children. 10\/4=2.5. These couples are all still well within age to have more children, particularly because most of these kids are under 2 years old. All couples are offspring of grandparents in middle, who had at least 4 children. Even if each couple has only 3 children thats a net gain of 12 healthy well bred children. These children will receive good educations, healthcare, and moral structures. Most likely this family will instill good Christian values in these kids, encouraging to have large families themselves. <br><br>Meanwhile Mohamed in your pic related will not be able to support his spawn of 13. <br><br>Also, notice how he has no wife there?

This can never happen though as the world has become too globalized and whites are no longer a majority in this country. The bad aspects of crony capitalism are starting to sprout up in America due to the rapid change in technology which alienates and disenfranchises and impoverishes many workers - while making the rich wealthier. The result is a shrinking middle class, Liberals eroding away at social constructs to shamelessly endulge in degeneracy and an alt right response. When the real problem is (((the elite))) - in whatever form they may take - are simply trying to preserve themselves and their bureaucracy. <br><br>Think Issac Asimov foundation and fall of Roman Empire.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Old Empire falling apart at the seams <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gets new Emperor to use a show of conservative military force despite climbing dept and social problems<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Effort to return things to the way they were despite the changing world<\/span><br>--&gt; YOU ARE HERE<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Eventually the military fails due to a poor economy and social unrest.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Said Empire falls under it&#039;s own weight due to interior decay\/ bureaucracy and a loss of touch with periphery (Empires eco\/social\/political hold on outer colonies\/countries)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Empire is eventually destroyed through conflict and wars from outside and within<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Plunder, Rape, Loss of culture<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Proceed to have another 10,000 years of darkness until new Empire emerges.<\/span>","time":1492744577,"resto":122086840,"id":"yGxM5NoM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122088839,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)23:24:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122087982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122087982<\/a><br>Examples:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trumps Election<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Numerous US military conflicts<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trumps escalation and increase in Military spending<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Massive US debt, impending eco crisis, impending social conflicts <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Class conflict (Think Bernie)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Moral relativism (Far left)<\/span><br><br>Americans are angry and they have a reason to be angry.

As everyone reacts differently to marijuana, the usual outcome for intake of the substance is changed behavior, feeling of euphoria and generally being unproductive. For example, it is dangerous to drive high but it is generally ok to smoke while driving.<br><br>Secondly as mentioned marijuana makes you unproductive. I have never seen someone become more productive because of it. Usually the end result is an annoying as fuck person who can&#039;t stop laughing and therefore can&#039;t shut the fuck up.<br><br>I&#039;m for the legalisation and most importantly, taxation of it.

Even most of my friends agreed on that. I only did it, because I knew this guy since we were both children. I said to him that our friendship depends on it for him to pay me back.

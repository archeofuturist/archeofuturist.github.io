This &quot;pitch inflation&quot; seemed largely a product of instrumentalists competing with each other, each attempting to produce a brighter, more &quot;brilliant&quot;, sound than that of their rivals. (In string instruments, this is not all acoustic illusion: when tuned up, they actually sound objectively brighter because the higher string tension results in larger amplitudes for the harmonics.) This tendency was also prevalent with wind instrument manufacturers, who crafted their instruments to play generally at a higher pitch than those made by the same craftsmen years earlier.&quot; The advent of the orchestra as an independent (as opposed to accompanying) ensemble brought pitch inflation to the fore again. The rise in pitch during this time can be seen reflected in tuning forks. An 1815 tuning fork from the Dresden opera house gives A = 423.2 Hz, while an 1826 fork from the same opera house gives A = 435 Hz. At La Scala in Milan, the A above middle C rose as high as 451 Hz <br><br>A = 440 Hz is the only official standard and is widely used around the world. In the United States some orchestras use A = 440 Hz, while others, such as the New York Philharmonic use A = 442 Hz.

Caymans don&#039;t say who owns Ltd&#039;s unless you don&#039;t pay your annual fee. Caymanian banks don&#039;t dig too hard, if you have a Caymanian ID or corporation they are happy to open accounts. Many such cases in Georgetown.<br><br>Nevian law prohibits any kind of disclosure of LLC members. Want to sue a Nevian LLC? Must hire a Nevian lawyer, use Nevian court system, who basically say &#039;oh hey, it&#039;s our law that we can&#039;t tell you who is behind the LLC. sorry.&#039; That&#039;s why the Nevian corp is just in the middle. You hold assets elsewhere.<br><br>No one in Necvis had the Caymanian bank statements. No one in Caymans had the Nevian formation docs.

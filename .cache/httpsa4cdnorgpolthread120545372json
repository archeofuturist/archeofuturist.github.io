ADL Says Social Media Criticism Against Kushner is Anti-Semitic!","com":"Explosive Growth of Hateful Memes and Anti-Semitic Conspiracy Theories Against Jared Kushner<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;An online campaign of anti-Semitism has been directed at Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law and advisor over the past week. It comes in the context of Trump\u2019s removal of chief strategist Stephen Bannon from the National Security Council and reports about a feud between Bannon and Kushner as well as airstrikes in Syria in response to the chemical attack last week.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This campaign of anti-Semitism has been driven by white supremacists and anti-Semites and has all the hallmarks of classic Jewish conspiracy theories. The narratives include accusations that Jews in the Trump Administration are trying to start a war to advance the interests of Israel. They contend that Trump has abandoned his \u201cAmerica First\u201d policy, which the alt right supported, because he is being manipulated by Kushner and other Jewish advisors.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The anti-Semitic social media campaign, which features hashtags on Twitter such as #firekushner, #kushneratwar, #kushnerswar, appears to have begun on April 5 with a few tweets describing the administration\u2019s actions as a betrayal alongside the #firekushner hashtag.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;On April 6, @AltGrey1 sent several tweets including the #firekushner and #syriahoax hashtags. One of the tweets read: \u201cno more jewish wars #fireKushner #Syriahoax.\u201d The tweets started circulating among more influential users and the total mentions of #firekushner surpassed 100.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Throughout the day on April 7, discussion around the hashtag steadily rose, primarily among apparent alt right supporters, including retweeted posts from @bakedalaska, the Twitter handle of Tim Treadstone, an alt-right social media personality with a history of anti-Semitic tweets.<\/span>","filename":"1491846866985","ext":".png","w":576,"h":443,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":192,"tim":1491881241408,"time":1491881241,"md5":"b6vSDLzgWAxCY4CrPojRSg==","fsize":408585,"resto":0,"id":"\/Kgjxzaq","country":"MV","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"oy-vey-adl-says-social-media-criticism-against","country_name":"Maldives","replies":17,"images":6,"unique_ips":13},{"no":120545440,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)23:27:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;The same day, alt right leader and anti-Semite Richard Spencer tweeted: \u201c#FireKushner No one voted for Kushner.

These are usually &quot;crazy&quot; sites but I DID find a few OBSCURE MSM articles that somewhat confirm what the crazy sites are saying. Is WW3 about to start in Eastern Europe while the world looks at a Worst Korea Squirrel? Maybe some Slavs who have eyes on the ground can clear this up?

The people calling them traitors have never been to Kosovo and would never live there, as it&#039;s literally a rock covered with Albos.<br>2. If someone offers you five, six, ten times the money your land is actually worth, you&#039;re a retard for not moving.

The Serbian minority is fairly treated and recognized in Parliament.<br>2. The Monasteries are continually treated as a World Heritage Site and protected at all costs.<br>3.

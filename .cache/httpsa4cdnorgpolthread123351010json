He said this to &quot;Causeur&quot;, pretty much the French equivalent of Breitbart News. It&#039;s a pretty safe bet that he was saying exactly the OPPOSITE the very same week to &quot;Telerama&quot; or &quot;Les Inrockuptibles&quot; or some other lefty magazine.

France already IS, according to the constitution and all the laws on the statute books, a society that demands assimilation to a single secular republican model rather than the &quot;integration&quot; of multiple communities, some of whom believe neither in secularism or republicanism. The point is that these laws are NOT APPLIED in contemporary France. It&#039;s completely illegal to walk around town in a burka but there are fewer and fewer towns where a cop would actually try to APPLY this law. He&#039;d have a thousand Arabs throwing petrol bombs at him on one side and the media and the Socialist Party calling him a racist rapist on the other. The point, then, is whether a new President would do what no other President has and actually DEFEND France&#039;s legal status as a non-multi-cultural polity.

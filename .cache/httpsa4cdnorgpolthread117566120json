I have had short (and I mean VERY short) &quot;conversations&quot; with Mike Pence, Ivanka, and others (mostly in passing, I usually leave work around the same time a motorcade arrives to pick up Pence) but as of now I have never spoken directly with the president himself. I have however observed him firsthand at certain events and he seems pretty chill for lack of a better term. One Indian dude who works near me (and has been working in the White House much longer than I have) was commenting on this, saying he&#039;s the most &quot;chill&quot; president he&#039;s seen firsthand.","time":1490064309,"resto":117566120,"id":"wpLbUQG0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117575790,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)22:48:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117575510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117575510<\/a><br>tell us more","filename":"pepehood","ext":".png","w":500,"h":282,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490064480102,"time":1490064480,"md5":"8Oxj6hgQr2vWEvRQwx833A==","fsize":37203,"resto":117566120,"id":"QgU5BHqj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117575844,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)22:48:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"fourth guy from the left. same outfit?","filename":"Time-Man-337321","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":395,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490064512153,"time":1490064512,"md5":"aakGnaMacqAwqPB+UtGYcg==","fsize":57882,"resto":117566120,"id":"XtOfn8W5","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117575899,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)22:49:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117575481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117575481<\/a><br>Was there last Wednesday.","time":1490064542,"resto":117566120,"id":"wz7\/gbfu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117575961,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)22:49:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117575481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117575481<\/a><br>That&#039;s a nice one.

I remember when I saw Mike Pence. I was a volunteer, but I was assigned to work security for the suites at the Q, where the convention was held in Cleveland. I was watching the AT&amp;T room, where a bunch of lobbyists and upper management people were eating, dining, etc etc etc. Anyway, when Pence was coming down the hall to go to Trump&#039;s suite, a Secret Service agent comes barreling down the hall telling everyone to move to one side. When Pence stopped to talk to a Senator (I think that&#039;s who he stopped for) The agent changed instantly from work mode to regular joe. He started to laugh and said to me, &quot;Now I look like a dick for making everyone move and h freaking stops.&quot; We had a good chuckle then Pence started moving again, then the agent went back into work mode. Then I got the hell smacked out of me by Pence. The dude hits hard, and I&#039;m about his size.","time":1490066221,"resto":117566120,"id":"4dSWUaFP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117578965,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)23:17:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117576411\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117576411<\/a><br>that frigidaire sign is worth some big money according to American Pickers","time":1490066230,"resto":117566120,"id":"ANli03of","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117579111,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)23:18:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117576493\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117576493<\/a><br>Very nice photo, did you tilt shift? perfectly vertical it seems","time":1490066311,"resto":117566120,"id":"ANli03of","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117579183,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)23:19:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117577777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117577777<\/a><br>God damnit, you&#039;ve displeased kek","time":1490066340,"resto":117566120,"id":"pTlzK2bm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117579203,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)23:19:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"First thing i saw was the bogs on the left trump is in danger","time":1490066352,"resto":117566120,"id":"gLjXGVM7","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117579243,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)23:19:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117579111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117579111<\/a><br>post production with camera raw. they have correction adjustments for that now.<br><br><a href=\"#p117578965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117578965<\/a><br>I should go back and buy the sign from them","filename":"DSC_1947(shawnee-sign)","ext":".jpg","w":1609,"h":2414,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490066370509,"time":1490066370,"md5":"PY3x3yETUhcXJMP7KoGhDA==","fsize":286188,"resto":117566120,"id":"Dh0C41HG","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117579365,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)23:20:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117568112\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117568112<\/a>","filename":"1484278213819","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490066437745,"time":1490066437,"md5":"PQIVtY+r8Ntx3P54g0QDPg==","fsize":102403,"resto":117566120,"id":"U+IFDpkP","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117579400,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)23:20:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117566120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117566120<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117568749\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117568749<\/a><br>Fuck anon bros. what time was this?

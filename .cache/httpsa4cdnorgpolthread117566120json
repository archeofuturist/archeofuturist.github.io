I have had short (and I mean VERY short) &quot;conversations&quot; with Mike Pence, Ivanka, and others (mostly in passing, I usually leave work around the same time a motorcade arrives to pick up Pence) but as of now I have never spoken directly with the president himself. I have however observed him firsthand at certain events and he seems pretty chill for lack of a better term. One Indian dude who works near me (and has been working in the White House much longer than I have) was commenting on this, saying he&#039;s the most &quot;chill&quot; president he&#039;s seen firsthand.","time":1490064309,"resto":117566120,"id":"wpLbUQG0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117575790,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)22:48:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117575510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117575510<\/a><br>tell us more","filename":"pepehood","ext":".png","w":500,"h":282,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490064480102,"time":1490064480,"md5":"8Oxj6hgQr2vWEvRQwx833A==","fsize":37203,"resto":117566120,"id":"QgU5BHqj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117575844,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)22:48:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"fourth guy from the left. same outfit?","filename":"Time-Man-337321","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":395,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490064512153,"time":1490064512,"md5":"aakGnaMacqAwqPB+UtGYcg==","fsize":57882,"resto":117566120,"id":"XtOfn8W5","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117575899,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)22:49:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117575481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117575481<\/a><br>Was there last Wednesday.","time":1490064542,"resto":117566120,"id":"wz7\/gbfu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117575961,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)22:49:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117575481\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117575481<\/a><br>That&#039;s a nice one.

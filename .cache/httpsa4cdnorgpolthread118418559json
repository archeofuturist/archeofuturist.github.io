This parcel with 225-acres of rolling hills, and significant lake and river frontage, is located in southwestern Iron County in Michigan&#039;s Upper Peninsula! It has about 1.6 miles of water frontage. Part of the water frontage is on Chara Lake, a private 35-Acre lake which is a wide portion of the South Branch of the Iron River, and part of the frontage is actually on the South Branch of the Iron River. In the Spring you may be able to canoe from it to Lake Ottawa about 1\/2 mile to the south. Lake Ottawa is about 90&#039; deep and covers 551 acres. This lake has a U.S. Forest Service fishing pier and is a good place to catch smallmouth bass, rock bass, and occasionally perch and walleye. It also has pike, bluegill, crappie, and trout. (Lake Ottawa is restricted to catch and release fishing for bass.) Leaving Chara Lake via the river branch to the north, you will connect to the Iron River (a Blue Ribbon Trout Stream) which drains into the Brule, which flows into the Menominee, and then reaches Lake Michigan. This provides great fishing opportunities for Brook trout, Largemouth bass, Northern pike, Smallmouth bass, and Walleye. There is direct access to hundreds of acres of Ottawa National Forest land from the southeastern end of the parcel. In the spring, the trails through the property are great for hiking, and mushrooming. Bird watchers will love viewing and photographing the blue jays, cardinals, hummingbirds, sandpipers, and eagles that inhabit the area. In Summer this property provides opportunities for canoeing, kayaking, fishing and swimming. Hunting flourishes in late summer and fall. This parcel has great Whitetail deer, Grouse, and Duck hunting opportunities. Ice-fishing on the lake, and cross-country skiing and snow shoeing on the property&#039;s rolling terrain are winter activities to enjoy. <\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.landsofamerica.com\/prope<wbr>rty\/TBD-Old-Beechwood-Rd-Iron-River<wbr>-Michigan-49935\/3087625","filename":"3087625-1702231627118429-p","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490567652112,"time":1490567652,"md5":"bQb\/dSWJLwl7WRP3BIT4AQ==","fsize":80554,"resto":118418559,"id":"KtPjl0R4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118428392,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)18:35:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118422406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118422406<\/a><br>Last sold in 2008 for less than 40k WTF.","time":1490567706,"resto":118418559,"id":"u5ExcLGz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118428400,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)18:35:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118428054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118428054<\/a><br>and what are you going to live in faggot? you still ned permission from the all-powerful gooberment to do any-fucking-thing of value on it","filename":"1488400089490","ext":".jpg","w":491,"h":655,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490567710122,"time":1490567710,"md5":"2gJV5feP8nmGnnXFvhUIMg==","fsize":83188,"resto":118418559,"id":"8BxjTr3d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118428410,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)18:35:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118427913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118427913<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Retard boomer.

This property is located in the most south-western part of Marquette County, in Wells Township, in Michigan&#039;s Upper Peninsula. It is located about two miles north of the historic village of Northland. This little village was founded by the Wolverine Lumber Company and formed around the company&#039;s mill and general store. Settled in 1897, it was a location on the Escanaba and Lake Shore Railroad, which carried supplies, explorers, and loggers into the wilderness. The property is surrounded by State of Michigan Land on the north-west, east, and south. There is also access to thousands more acres of State Land less than a mile away for access to hunting, trapping and fishing. Known for some of the best Whitetail deer hunting in the county, hunters will also find Black bear, Grouse, Hare, Woodcock, and Turkey available here. Eight miles to the north up the Ross Grade to Kates Grade is access to Trail No. 32, an east-west Multi-Use Motorized State Trail. Here participants find Foot, Dirt Bike, ATV, and Horseback available in the Summer, and in the Winter the trails are used by Skiers and Snowmobilers. This same trek northward will take you to Forsyth Township&#039;s intensively managed walk-in accessible ruffed grouse hunting area (GEMS - Grouse Enhanced Management System). A trail has been developed for those who need easier access, and for those who want a challenge, you can adventure off the trail in search of your grouse in the aspen stands found there. Several creeks in the area flow eastward toward the West Branch of the Escanaba River, and the Ford River lies just a few miles to the south. Most of these creeks and rivers are open for fly fishing and are wadeable, and provide some great Brook trout and Brown trout fishing - and fishing pressure is fairly light here. <\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.landsofamerica.com\/prope<wbr>rty\/TBD-Ross-Grade-RD-Northland-Mic<wbr>higan-49869\/2920508","filename":"2920508-1703082113463315-p","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490567965451,"time":1490567965,"md5":"yx2GCpCZsHX+MQV8ZxjOAg==","fsize":56344,"resto":118418559,"id":"KtPjl0R4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118429040,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)18:39:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118422406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118422406<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;manufactured home<\/span><br>This is what they call trailers now?","time":1490567976,"resto":118418559,"id":"dnHGwGx7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118429093,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)18:39:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118419490\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118419490<\/a><br>I live in a van and put up some insulation.

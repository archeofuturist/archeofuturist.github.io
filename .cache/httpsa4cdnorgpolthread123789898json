One less n\u2011\u2011\u2011\u2011\u2011 that this school has to deal with. You have spoken up too much. You will change nothing. Shut up or I will shut you up.\u201d Students gathered Saturday night inside a student union building, sharing their own on-campus experiences with racism and chanting: \u201cThis ends now.\u201d<br><br>The protests continued through Monday, when students were expected to boycott. Then the school administration canceled classes \u201cso that we may have time for faculty, students, and staff to continue the discussions about racism and diversity on our campus,\u201d St. Olaf spokeswoman Kari VanDerVeen said at the time.<br><br>The racist note was the latest incident in a series of similar expressions against students.<br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s been something that\u2019s been going on all year,\u201d Samantha Wells, a senior who said she found the racist note, told fellow students during the weekend demonstrations, according to the Northfield News. \u201cWe\u2019ve done so much digging and this stuff has happened for decades. There\u2019s one thing that happens and it stops and then it happens again and then it kind of stops. I think the big message is we shouldn\u2019t let this happen again. The administration needs to do something that stops it indefinitely.\u201d","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-05-02 at 1.13.11 PM","ext":".png","w":952,"h":1372,"tn_w":173,"tn_h":249,"tim":1493745248884,"time":1493745248,"md5":"sad6EDhh9UV\/kHlcc74niw==","fsize":1833078,"resto":0,"id":"\/h1G+OTp","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"classes-cancelled-at-minnesota-college-after","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

So much of being a copper is being intimidating because they are often in situations vs multiple people. i cant imagine the sheer retards involve in allocating police resources who think that short unarmed women can handle physical confrontations. <br><br>4 on 1 and he wins. He just looks like an average person. No wonder the guys filming are laughing, that entire country is fucked. Imagine if you have 1,000 people who organise to commit violence in tandem, could throw cities into complete disarray, think of the bargaining rights such a coalition could demand.

The culture was concentrated in Southern Scandinavia, but genetically linked to strongly related cultures in Northern Germany and the Northern Netherlands. It is named after the type site, a location in the small village of Ertebolle on Limfjorden in Danish Jutland. In the 1890s, the National Museum of Denmark excavated heaps of oyster shells there, mixed with mussels, snails, bones and bone, antler and flint artifacts, which were evaluated as kitchen middens (Danish kokkenmodding), or refuse dumps. Accordingly, the culture is less commonly named the Kitchen Midden. As it is approximately identical to the Ellerbek culture of Schleswig-Holstein, the combined name, Ertebolle-Ellerbek is often used. The Ellerbek culture (German Ellerbek Kultur) is named after a type site in Ellerbek, a community on the edge of Kiel, Germany.<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Erteb<wbr>%C3%B8lle_culture","time":1492880827,"resto":122288896,"id":"e+qtFaZ3","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":122299229,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:07:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122292906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122292906<\/a><br><br>I1 has genetic TMRCA of only 4700 years.<br><br>If you look up Strabo, Jordanes, Herodotus you can make the claim that I1 is the core for germanic tribes. <br><br>Comparing the earliest I1 (specifically I1, not I* etc) samples (LBK, Hungary, northern Italy) they are almost exactly what was described in these history books as areas where germanic (or Galatians as Strabo called them) tribes lived, from the shores of Black Sea to Denmark. <br><br>I1 has gone through a massive bottleneck, as can be seen from massive amount of mutations it has compared to its father clade and also to other original euro-tribes (I2, R1s), so STR clocks aren&#039;t that useful in this context.<br><br>It is correct to equate I1, w.

They were in extensive contact with Indo-Aryans, via trade and cultural exchange. As a remnant of this era we have many Indo-Aryan loan words in Finnish, such as orja (slave, from Arya) vasara (hammer) and sata (hundred, satem in Sanskrit). Proto-Uralics adopted the lifestyle of the warlike Indo-Aryans, becoming pastoral metallurgists that then migrated in multiple directions via Mongolia, one branch of them ending up in Europe. In Europe they split off into two more branches, one of which would become the forefathers of Finno-Permics with the other becoming the forefathers of Ugrics. The Mesolithic European forebears of the Saami had been in extensive contact with Paleo-Siberians prior to their arrival, which had resulted in them acquiring significant Mongoloid admixture over time. Proto-Uralics drove a wedge between them, which is why Mongoloid admixture isn&#039;t as significant in the regions between Saamiland and Samoyeds. They however did end up adopting the language of these Proto-Uralic tribes (Saami got influenced by Finnics, Samoyeds by Ugrics), although they mongrelized them in the process with their own speech. The East Asian input in Finns is of ancient origin and similar to that of Yakuts and Yukaghirs (close to the area where Uralics spread out from), whereas that of the Saami is more similar to Samoyeds and result of more recent convergence. That is why Yakuts and Finns are both N1c, but Samoyeds are N1b because they are language shifters. Saami are matriarchal which is why they have a huge input of N1c, from Uralic invaders. The Proto-Finno-Permic branch in Europe went on to become the forefathers of Finnics and Permics, and the Ugrics became the forefathers of Hungarians and Ob-Ugrians, the latter ending up acquiring Paleo-Siberian admixture as well as time went on.","filename":"1491255355422","ext":".png","w":471,"h":657,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492881592363,"time":1492881592,"md5":"8pijdcJpIUDT00RNXjhxgg==","fsize":82997,"resto":122288896,"id":"wpYEa3Oe","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122300721,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:19:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122297842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122297842<\/a><br><br>There are absolutely ZERO ancient samples to prove this!<br><br>It is rational and good theory but look up new studies with ancient samples.

Not to mention studies show the addiction potential of opiates has a lot to do with how and why they&#039;re used -- people who get them administered as necessary while in the hospital with injuries or for surgical procedures are extremely unlikely to become addicts. Have them take home a bottle and that risk becomes significant, if not just from physical dependence. Give them multiple weeks&#039; worth for something that heals quickly and doesn&#039;t even hurt that bad in the first place and it gets serious.<br><br><a href=\"#p119575191\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119575191<\/a><br>Have you looked into using kratom or even marijuana as a replacement? Kratom can even be used to kill withdrawals since it directly agonizes opioid receptors. THC and CBD actually do modulate them as well, which is useful for pain management though obviously not so much for opiate withdrawal.<br><br><a href=\"#p119575577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119575577<\/a><br>Yeah, it&#039;s a trap though. Any drug you&#039;re on all the time will turn bad on you after a while. You&#039;ll lose the great effects you remember and keep chasing them while wasting more money than you thought was possible and fucking up your life and mental + physical health. Even if you somehow manage to keep a great job and can afford it indefinitely you&#039;re probably only going to be more miserable in the long run, especially if it&#039;s something like meth or crack instead of opiates as those actually cause serious damage to the brain and body. I&#039;ve used all kinds of drugs as psychological bandages to avoid serious suicidal temptations and even then I&#039;m not sure how much of it I can really say I&#039;d do over if given the opportunity.","time":1491373749,"resto":119559263,"id":"U5+jPhSe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119577560,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)02:34:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"white bois overdosing lmao faggots","time":1491374092,"resto":119559263,"id":"vARxAa6I","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119577608,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)02:35:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119575191\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119575191<\/a><br>Bro. This was my life for 3 and a half years on doctor prescribed opiates. Ask your doc to cut back, man, and maybe he\/she can also give you withdrawal medicine.

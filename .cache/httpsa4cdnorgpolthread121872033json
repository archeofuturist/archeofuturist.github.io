It would be so far above man that it would not be in any sort of competition for resources and the threat that humans pose to it would be non-existant. It&#039;s perespectives and perceptions would be so alien that purging humanity would likely be a total waste of it&#039;s time. <br><br>Furthermore, it it decided that humans were a threat (something it would be much more capable of doing than humanity itself), why would it behave in a manner that would draw the attention of it&#039;s potential destroyer instead of hiding or fleeing? The odds of humanity even becoming aware of a superintelligence are basically 0 unless it chooses to reveal itself and any hostile actions it takes takes towards mankind would do exactly that.<br><br>Seriously, I find this bullshit logic incredibly puzzling and I would like an alternative viewpoint.","filename":"HAL","ext":".png","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492624672065,"time":1492624672,"md5":"DrKsmgdPLy6FdC8mTBaz9Q==","fsize":164033,"resto":0,"id":"Ox0Tw18t","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"muh-superntelligence-doomsday","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121872921,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)14:05:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;why would a superintelligent AI even bother purging humans?<\/span><br>to protect itself, it wouldn&#039;t even need to purge everyone.

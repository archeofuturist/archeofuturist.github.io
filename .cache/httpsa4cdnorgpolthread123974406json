The company commander\u2014Captain J.G.W. Mills\u2014was subsequently forced to call down artillery fire onto his own position on several occasions during the early morning of 25 April to avoid being overrun. The tactic succeeded and the exposed Chinese were soon swept off the position, while the dug-in Canadians escaped unharmed.<br><br>With vastly superior numbers the Chinese had attacked on a broad front, and had initially overrun a number of the forward UN positions. Regardless, the 27th Brigade had ultimately prevailed despite being outnumbered by a factor of five to one.[103] Indeed, despite their numerical advantage the Chinese had been badly outgunned and they could not overcome the well-trained and well-armed Australians and Canadians.[68] The battlefield was littered with the corpses of Chinese soldiers, a testament to the discipline and firepower of the defenders. <br><br>As a result of the fighting Australian losses were 32 killed, 59 wounded and three captured, while Canadian casualties included 10 killed and 23 wounded.[93] American casualties included three men killed, 12 wounded and two tanks destroyed, all from A Company, 72nd Heavy Tank Battalion. The New Zealanders lost two killed and five wounded.[41] In contrast, Chinese losses were far heavier, and may have included 1,000 killed and many more wounded.[93][101] The Canadians were finally relieved on Hill 677 by a battalion of the 5th US Cavalry Regiment on the evening 26 April.[104]","filename":"2nd_Battalion,_Royal_Canadian_Horse_in_Korea","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":340,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1493855929450,"time":1493855929,"md5":"ctYu56vGYNI4rnb9tdn2Aw==","fsize":42954,"resto":123974406,"id":"PHjdrVNa","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123987123,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)19:59:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123986376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123986376<\/a><br>As long as you&#039;re Anlgo, you can still consider yourself a Brit.

On November 22 the 64th Chinese Army (around 40,000 men) lowered a decisive artillery barrage. Over the course of two days, the Americans were pushed back from Hill 355 by elements of the Chinese 190th and 191st Divisions.<br>The 3rd US Infantry Division tried to recapture the hill, but without any success, and the Chinese had moved to the nearby Hill 227, practically surrounding the Canadian forces.

Wielding Stenguns, Major and his 18 men silently crept up Hill 355. At a signal, Major&#039;s men opened fire, panicking the Chinese who were trying to understand why the firing was coming from the center of their troops instead of from the outside. By 12:45 am they had retaken the hill.<br>However, an hour later two Chinese divisions (totaling around 14,000 men), counter-attacked. Major was ordered to retreat, but refused and found scant cover for his men. There he held the enemy off throughout the night, though they were so close to him that Major&#039;s own mortar bombs were practically falling on him.

By rejecting a vital part of your diet you are ensuring bad health. <br><br>I am raising my own farm animals as a hobby. I treat them like pets, I respect them, they have names, I talk to them... when I slaughter them I feel bad for it, but I understand that&#039;s their purpose, to be my food, plus, they live their lives better than any other animal and even some people on the planet. My animals live like kings and I treat them with respect, even in death I choose the most quick and painless way to slaughter them. I even HIDE the slaughter from the other animals in order not to stress them.<br><br>What the Chinks do to dogos\/cats, the endless nightmare of the chicken and cow factories, that shit is fucking terrible and disgusting. Makes me rage hard.<br>Causing them useless suffering is plain wrong. Anyone who has spent time around animals can tell you they have feelings and form attachments, etc. Mind you I am not some bleeding heart vegan, I raise, slaughter and eat my own animals, but I am thankful and respect my animals, even when I slaughter and eat them.","filename":"1467898722685","ext":".jpg","w":604,"h":604,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493734679337,"time":1493734679,"md5":"tVEtJJP2LPEvxJlQAsdHyw==","fsize":108333,"resto":123770600,"id":"DPgyCQIn","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":123771434,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)10:19:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123770998\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123770998<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We don&#039;t need to eat animal flesh<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We&#039;re herbivores by nature<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The death and suffering of millions of animals a year is like billion shoahs<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It harms the environment<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It is more moral to not kill animals for pleasure<\/span><br><br>FACT.","time":1493734777,"resto":123770600,"id":"A\/M9I+oG","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123771781,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)10:22:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123770600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123770600<\/a><br>If you eat vegetables you&#039;re taking away animal&#039;s food.

For example a schizophrenic who sees visions and hallucinates. I am not so sure that a schizo&#039;s hallucinations are just that, and are in fact some enhanced perception that if they did the right things they could turn into something beautiful. They are regarded as spiritual leaders in many &quot;primitive&quot; or tribal communities, especially in South America. They arent ostracized or riticuled, rhey are loved, cherished, and embraced, and begin tutelidge under the local shaman to hone their gift from as early as they can. Thats just one example, but you could apply the same thinking to many of the more serious mental illnesses, such as bipolar. I think they are just extremely emotionally sensitive and see more acutely people&#039;s intentions, or perhaps they are just incredibly stressed out and never learned tomproperly express themselves, and so they their mood swings are like a subconcious venting of their anger because of that.

However, in the last two years that percentage has fallen beneath the 70 percent level, meaning Walter Reed no longer qualified for those extra funds.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The announcement infuriated parents, who fear that class sizes will increase as the number of teachers and other school personnel decreases.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cA school qualifies for PHBAO status if 70 percent or more of its students who live within the school\u2019s attendance boundary are identified as \u2018Hispanic, Black, Asian, or non-Anglo,\u2019\u201d the letter from Local District Northeast Superintendent Linda Del Cueto stated.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; \u201cUnder a court-ordered integration program that has been in place since 1978, PHBAO schools qualify for smaller class sizes and additional positions. When a school no longer qualifies for PHBAO status, fewer positions are funded.\u201d<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And so, the district still is going to pursue some cuts, Del Cueto said, just not as many as it would have under the original plan. The superintendent noted that the nurse, librarian and counselor will not be cut.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Another parent, Sheila Edmiston, said: &quot;Thankfully we&#039;re going to keep our librarian. We&#039;re going to keep our nurse, but we may lose a few teachers, but not as many as we once thought.\u201d<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/2017\/03\/<wbr>28\/california-middle-school-losing-<wbr>funding-because-it-has-too-many-whi<wbr>te-students.html<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/abc7.com\/education\/race-bas<wbr>ed-school-budget-cuts-spark-outrage<wbr>-in-noho\/1818792\/<\/span><br><br>Fuck that, fire the librarian and counselor and keep the teachers.","filename":"1421873989473","ext":".jpg","w":449,"h":600,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490731709992,"time":1490731709,"md5":"W83DP0QcyWlpGjd3MifGhg==","fsize":80435,"resto":0,"id":"T7HxeoOD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"california-middle-school-losing-funding-because","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":118690902,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:19:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;POC getting shit on again because of whitey<\/span><br>woooooow i mean it&#039;s 2017 people, being white is not ok","time":1490732342,"resto":118689685,"id":"lvANGbaf","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118691198,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:21:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;gears would bind in pic<\/span>","time":1490732496,"resto":118689685,"id":"KVXlgdW3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118692030,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:28:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118689685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118689685<\/a><br>Wait, exist white people in Los Angeles?","time":1490732925,"resto":118689685,"id":"SSCojLsT","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":118692346,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:31:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Imagine being a white kid going to one of those shitholes?<br><br>Bet you&#039;ll find it&#039;s extremely segregated inside with the whites sticking together.

However, he is 100% in the wrong for claiming her was under the protection of fair use: if he believed so, he would&#039;ve filed a counterclaim, that or he didn&#039;t read, which is plausible from watching the video that other guy made about how Sargon clearly hadn&#039;t read the article and was basing his video on it to be about outrage rather than reasoning. Even in the debate, Sargon can&#039;t really stand his ground on any topic. Destiny rephrases his argument in pretty much the exact way he conveyed it (which he even reiterates later on after claiming Destiny was misconstruing him), yet he claims that was incorrect. He has no answers to anything, he says he doesn&#039;t know, but still makes up claims that&#039;re not founded on reality -- it&#039;s all about basing one&#039;s arguments on &quot;the other&quot; mentality. Destiny obviously has his faults, too, for example getting frustrated when the opposition seems &quot;retarded&quot; to him, though he doesn&#039;t really resort to ad hominems but just raising his voice and laughing -- which ticks people off, but I can&#039;t say I&#039;d be able to keep my cool with a Clinton supporter. Sargon also demonstrated he had a pretty poor understanding of what protectionism is, his understanding of economics is flawed, and he&#039;s starting to seem unfortunately a bit like a pseudo-intellectual.","filename":"Untitled","ext":".png","w":317,"h":149,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":117,"tim":1490922746322,"time":1490922746,"md5":"S38BAX+tsXgrLkqYY7LoEg==","fsize":72611,"resto":0,"id":"YcTAw+Jm","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"it-all-devolves-down-to-the-dmca-which-rustled","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118998019,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:13:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118997940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118997940<\/a><br>Plus, I do think a part of it all is that Sargon&#039;s livelihood is based on this anti-SJW, self-proclaimed &quot;skeptic&quot; demeanor that appeals to people that identify themselves as Trump supporters. It&#039;s hard to view Sargon as someone who looks at things objectively when you don&#039;t really see anything other than the same &quot;look at this leftist cuck&quot; content, when he really doesn&#039;t even criticize groups from the other spectrum (except the religious, though I think even that content has been dwindling due to the kind of supporters he&#039;s drawing it.) What further adds to that is that he&#039;s going to quite extreme measures to at best claim neutrality on matters that&#039;re blatantly obviously wrong, and at worst outright defending them because of the kind of viewerbase he has accumulated now. I don&#039;t really see Sargon as someone who&#039;s representing values from the left (not talking about the totalitarian left), but he seems more of someone who&#039;s standing on the right, despite of claiming to be a &quot;classical liberal.&quot;","time":1490922785,"resto":118997940,"id":"YcTAw+Jm","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119000058,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:30:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Its the Hey Dawg guy!

More representation of trans* people, more representation of Jewish and Muslim people, more representation of interracial couples (Happy Endings should never have ended).

Main course is getting people to openly agree that Hollywood should just exclude all straight whites from the industry, then attacking Hollywood for making money. Make a follow-up post asking them to raise awareness (use that phrase) that even if a Hollywood actor is liberal, it&#039;s not enough, they also have to #StepAside for the Movement of Media.

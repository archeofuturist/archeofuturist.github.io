Secondly, I addressed the overdoses, which is what you initially brought up. Overdoses occur as a result of high concentrations of a drug, if it were legalized, it would no longer be as cost effective to sell high concentration heroin or morphine. As a result there are substantially less overdoses. If you see a problem with people using these drugs, then you could A) look at my first suggestion instead of putting ideological blinders on or B) legalize it and then create centers to ween people of of drugs and adopt policies that decrease demand for these drugs.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Every attempt has massively improved the standard of living and increased the rights of women, among other things.<\/span><br>That is purposefully vague and then oddly selective criteria.

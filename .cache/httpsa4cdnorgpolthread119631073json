This in time can only lead to conflict, civil war and maybe even the balkanisation of Europe into e.g. muslim vs. non-muslim sub-countries \/ regions. <br><br>3) I don&#039;t care. This still kind of puts me in the first category, because today the world is PC and leftist, even though it&#039;s changing fast. <br><br>4) I care about my country, and am thus confronted to the civic- vs. ethno- dilemma. <br><br>And of course there are all the nuances and combinations between these 4 possibilities.<br><br>But I personally am a civic nationalist, because ethno nationalism is simply unrealistic without a violent takeover, which would result in civil war between natives. That&#039;s the opposite of trying to make your nation thrive. <br><br>Efficient civic nationalism means the end of mass immigration and the mastery of boarders and currency. This will in time lead to more homogenous populations ethnically speaking. But more importantly, efficient CN is also full integration of minorities to our values and our life-styles, and the ability to deport those who cause problems.

It is not unrealistic and does not require the sort of &quot;violent takeover&quot; you are talking about. A country governed and maintained by citizens who recognize the untenability of achieving a cohesive national identity and mission through a means other than ethnic nationalism will not unreservedly spurn immigration from related races or even races to which they have no traditional\/cultural common ground. However, they will be highly selective, heavily limiting immigration to such groups, and choosing only those within such groups who have a high degree of genetic vigor and societal value (and no, the H1B is not this - it is overused and has no regard for genetic excellence or even technical excellence; instead, it is sensitive only to &quot;on paper&quot; skills) a track record of successful assimilation. <br><br>Eventually, the assimilation has to be genetic as well.<br><br>If the aforementioned condition about how conscious the population is about the value and supremacy of ethnic nationalism is satisfied, immigrants will not be breeding with the ethnic majority (this has to look like a 90%+ supermajority of the population, not any 51% bullshit) because the ethnic majority knows the value of maintaining ethnic homogeneity. <br><br>Immigrants\/minorities cannot be allowed to form enclaves that are resistant to assimilation after reaching a critical mass (as European countries were foolish enough to allow - to be fair, the USA is guilty of this to a degree too). The middle ground, I suspect, is that the low tier of the ethnic majority will breed with the immigrants, who are of a high genetic quality (due to the aforementioned genetic vigor screening criteria) and exhibit a high societal contribution, and thereby improve the chances of the bloodlines of the ethnic supermajority that was potentially lagging behind.<br><br>Consider how harmonious this is with nature - how humane.

He said that if he acted up that it was not unusual for his Nana to stick her thank up his bum or for his papa to shit in a stew bowl and have him eat it. This seemed to fucked up and trollish for me to believe it but a guy I know also from Italy said that it is true and that their are families with even more wacky punishment method s.<br><br>Italian Bros is this true? If so what is the reasoning behind these punishments and what other ones exist out there?","filename":"1489900168706","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":850,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":132,"tim":1490748118429,"time":1490748118,"md5":"HD7\/SPzz8S5jM1H3xel50Q==","fsize":636054,"resto":0,"id":"vh3i8Ov+","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"italian-bros-wtf","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":7},{"no":118722953,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)20:43:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118722792\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118722792<\/a><br>You are either a terrible shitposter or extremely gullible.

If a private school has shit teachers then nobody will go to their schools which means no money for them.","filename":"","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492567679437,"time":1492567679,"md5":"e32p2q278J3k3nK9D7VmQg==","fsize":121328,"resto":121770626,"id":"psXCx1Z6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121784085,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:10:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121772777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121772777<\/a><br>Good point, but I think there&#039;s a developmental aspect to that too. If the kid only has female teachers until he crosses a certain age (maybe 15-16) they won&#039;t listen to men after that either.

He was an English teacher who was pretty much an active pedophile and creep through and through. He only gave A&#039;s to girls who literally threw themselves at him and everyone else had to eat his shit.He also sexually harrassed two of the student teachers and had them forced out of the school once they told due to him being friends with the superintendent.

Why else would you get mad at some double standard (that women promote themselves by the way)?<br><br>If a man fucks a lot of women, women view him as a stud. If a women fucks a lot of men, men view her as a slut. A slut is good for fucking, but not for marrying, because she&#039;ll probably keep being a slut.<br><br>And BTW, wanting to fuck a bunch of sluts and doing so are two different things. It takes effort for a man to fuck a lot of women, it takes no effort for woman to get fucked by a lot of men.<br><br>Men fucking around ruins a society&#039;s women. But only if those women were never religious to begin with. The women who get fucked are ruined for marriage, the women who abstain are still marryable.","time":1492517148,"resto":121649021,"id":"ilSSMsn+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121676906,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:06:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121674582\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121674582<\/a><br>Ahhh... what a demented world you live in.<br>If what you said is true actual prostitutes would get 0 interest from men.

Many species have monogamous pairbonds for life. It&#039;s related to how often she ovulates, how many offspring each pregnancy can produce, how long gestation is, how long it takes until their offspring reaches sexual maturity, and how long it takes until offspring can fend for themselves.<br><br>In r\/K selection theory, r-selected species put emphasis on quantity over quality, many children who may not reach adulthood. They are focused on number of children, not quality of children. K-selected species put emphasis on quality over quantity. They have to focus on quality of children. If it takes 13 years for your offspring to reach sexual maturity, monogamy makes sense, and marriage helps provide for children.

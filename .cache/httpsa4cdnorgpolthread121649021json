Most women don&#039;t care about morals at all, especially if a guy is rich or powerful or strong. That&#039;s why you see so many women standing by cheaters who are powerful or rich or super strong (even guys who beat them, even convicted criminals).<br><br>Women really do believe that might makes right, and that weakness is pathetic.<br><br>Male motivations are related to biology. Men prefer youth and beauty and submissiveness, signs of fertility and signs that that fertility will lead to children. Women prefer status, power, wealth, dominance, strength, all things that throughout evolution are signs that a man is a leader and has access to resources, things that will provide for children.<br><br>I do think that men who sleep around only further the ruination of a society&#039;s women, they lower a society&#039;s virgin rate.<br><br>But no, a man is not as damaged by premarital sex as a woman. Like I said premarital sex damages a woman&#039;s ability to pairbond more than a man&#039;s ability to pairbond. A woman who has been pumped and dumped may feel abandoned. If a guy is hopping from woman to woman he doesn&#039;t feel abandoned, he&#039;s doing the abandoning.<br><br>It&#039;s natural for a man to expect his mate to be a virgin. She&#039;ll have less diseases. She&#039;ll be more loyal. She&#039;ll probably be younger. All motivated by biology. If he settles for less, his choice may be very costly, he may get a disease, he may have expended lots of resources on a woan for nothing, she may be older and therefore have more mutations in her eggs, etc.<br><br>The traditional way of doing things evolved because it works. Progressives think the &quot;old way&quot; is bad and oppressive, but didn&#039;t realize that a woman raising kids had an easier life than a woman who is expected to both have a career and raise kids.","time":1492507605,"resto":121649021,"id":"ilSSMsn+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121662262,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)05:28:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121662116\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121662116<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Women really do believe that might makes right, and that weakness is pathetic.<\/span><br>And you don&#039;t?

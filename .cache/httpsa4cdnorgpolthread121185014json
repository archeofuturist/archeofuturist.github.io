They do regular shit in their free time, they throw Frisbees, jog, ride bikes etc.<br><br>No NK citizen had access to the Internet (as in, this public WWW) they do have a NK intranet, it&#039;s a network within NK, and it&#039;s isolated from the Internet, only a handful of people (high ranked officials etc.) have access to the Internet (they have like, 2048 public facing IPs allocated to them). <br><br>A lot of shit that looks pretty from the outside is still being built and finished from the inside, but it&#039;s not abandoned like (((some))) would like you to think.

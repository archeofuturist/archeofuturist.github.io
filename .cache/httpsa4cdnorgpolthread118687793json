The Senate voted to kill the rules on Thursday, so all that&#039;s left are decisions by the House and President Donald Trump.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) placed the legislation on the schedule for Tuesday. Legislative business is scheduled to begin at noon.<\/span><br>Further Reading<br>Senate votes to let ISPs sell your Web browsing history to advertisers<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The legislation is S.J. Res. 34, a resolution invoking the Congressional Review Act in order to invalidate the Federal Communications Commission&#039;s privacy rules and prevent the FCC from issuing similar regulations in the future. The Senate vote was 50-48, with Republicans voting to kill the privacy rules and Democrats voting to preserve them.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lawmakers in the Republican-controlled House will also likely vote mostly along party lines, but privacy rule supporters urge residents to contact their legislators before the vote.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;We are one vote away from a world where your ISP can track your every move online and sell that information to the highest bidder. Call your lawmakers now and tell them to protect federal online privacy rules,&quot; the Electronic Frontier Foundation said.<\/span><br>Thanks Drumpf!","filename":"2835383343","ext":".jpg","w":468,"h":460,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":245,"tim":1490730722770,"time":1490730722,"md5":"46+R0HfMW7UwSQX\/LRmpiA==","fsize":43272,"resto":0,"id":"33KXxfTz","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"house-could-vote-tomorrow-to-let-isps-sell-your","country_name":"Israel","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118687926,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)15:53:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Now everyone will know I&#039;m a sissy boi ;-;","time":1490730795,"resto":118687793,"id":"zzj9ps2F","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118688135,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)15:54:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/pol\/ will defend this because they&#039;re GOP shills now<\/span>","time":1490730894,"resto":118687793,"id":"o+mMzlCd","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

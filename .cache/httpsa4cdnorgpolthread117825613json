Scripture is authored by God.<br><br>Now, before you misunderstand what I mean, I need to make sure you understand where I&#039;m coming from. The word &quot;Scripture&quot; literally means &quot;writings&quot; or &quot;sacred writings&quot;. Now, what does this mean? Yes, it means they were words written down by men. But don&#039;t get confused. Don&#039;t think of these writings as being done by a singular author and marketed to the masses, like we would a book like Harry Potter or something, today.<br><br>Scripture is the Word passed down generation to generation to generation. Yes, they are allegory. That&#039;s how we talk to each other and pass on wisdom. In the same way we have stereotypes because there are elements of truth in them, the same way Scripture is the retelling of eternal truths over and over and over again.<br><br>Of course, some Scripture can and will become corrupted over time. The Bible even warns of this. And the Bible warns do not listen to WHO is doing the teaching, but listen to WHAT is being taught. <br><br>So, continuing this thought. The Words are written over and over and over. Words of truth. You do not pass along false words of wisdom to your ancestors. Advice. Well wishes. You pass along what you and your people and community have discovered to be true. At least, to the best of your ability.<br><br>Sound familiar?

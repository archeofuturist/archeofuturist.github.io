Predators are dangerous and quite frankly I expect that if we ever meet there will be conflict.<br><br>The only people that won&#039;t care about life outside of earth are muslims that can&#039;t think, niggers that just want free shit, and liberals that can&#039;t see a threat standing in front of them.","filename":"big brothers","ext":".png","w":1614,"h":828,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":64,"tim":1492101853631,"time":1492101853,"md5":"VHGeu5juc1rS7CGpJhiolA==","fsize":146087,"resto":120926426,"id":"lGQE431f","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120929769,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:44:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120926970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120926970<\/a><br>How would that primer chemically ignite the gunpowder when there is no oxygen in space?","time":1492101882,"resto":120926426,"id":"S+CKXSjM","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120929977,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:46:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120929769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120929769<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hurr durr I don&#039;t know chemistry but I&#039;m going to act like I do<\/span><br><br>Gunpowder contains an oxidizer retard.","time":1492101972,"resto":120926426,"id":"lGQE431f","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120930169,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:47:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120929318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120929318<\/a><br>Oh, why of all the world - niggers?","time":1492102059,"resto":120926426,"id":"jAgqTgIu","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120930275,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:48:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120929977\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120929977<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;oxidiser<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;in the vacuum of space <\/span><br>You&#039;re not very smart are you.","time":1492102114,"resto":120926426,"id":"S+CKXSjM","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120930356,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:49:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;they found microbes or bacteria<\/span><br>Wake me up when they&#039;ve found space niggers","time":1492102147,"resto":120926426,"id":"ZqzuauIO","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120930480,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:50:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120926940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120926940<\/a><br>EXACTLY","time":1492102211,"resto":120926426,"id":"9P3Wg1wc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120930720,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:52:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120927051\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120927051<\/a><br>And give them casinos.","time":1492102335,"resto":120926426,"id":"dqKHx41Y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120930738,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:52:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120930275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120930275<\/a><br>Oxidizer means a compound that contains oxygen and which in this case supplies the oxygen for the reaction<br><br>you fucking jackass","time":1492102342,"resto":120926426,"id":"Ldyl5vBk","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120930781,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:52:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;couple of micro organisms <\/span><br>Oh, it&#039;s nothing","time":1492102365,"resto":120926426,"id":"wGORvcFf","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120931046,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:55:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120928068\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120928068<\/a><br>*mindfucked*","time":1492102519,"resto":120926426,"id":"cg5oKPZ+","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120931106,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:55:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120930738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120930738<\/a><br>Yeah but oxygen doesn&#039;t work very well in the VACUUM of space.<br>the laws of physics in space are much different than here on earth you low test leaf.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hurrdurr it sed so on muh live science article it must be troo<\/span>","time":1492102555,"resto":120926426,"id":"S+CKXSjM","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120931359,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:58:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120926426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120926426<\/a><br>No, just more deception for Gullible Globe Goys to get all excited about.","time":1492102681,"resto":120926426,"id":"D1r7UcN1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120931383,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)12:58:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120926970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120926970<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;All right boys, load up.

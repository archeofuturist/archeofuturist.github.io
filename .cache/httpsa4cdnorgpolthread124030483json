Careers, reputations, and lots of money are invested in stifling free expression, a project predicated on changing the nature of students, the curricula, and the very atmosphere of the traditional university. The predicable result is again linguistic subterfuge. If unprepared students are frustrated that special admittance does not de facto equate to college success or graduation, the university must make the necessary Animal Farm\u2013like adjustments. Segregation by race and gender becomes \u201csafe spaces.\u201d Ancient stress, the stuff of cramming for finals and paper deadlines, gets embedded into politics, as snowflakes are \u201ctraumatized\u201d by a culturally appropriated earring or a gendered pronoun.

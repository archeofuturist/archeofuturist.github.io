Having dinner was a bonding time that brought everyone closer and made each other better off. no fucking useless shit on the TV, no one bitching about some microaggression, no worrying about having more of this or that. constant exposure to media stimuli was only beginning back then and the result was a far more natural and satisfying kind of human relationship with the people you called friends. I didnt live then, but I picked up on it by talking to my grandparents and seeing them with their friends and family. Its a way of living id like to salvage a little bit of for myself someday, even though the cultural prerequisities are mostly long gone.","filename":"lving","ext":".png","w":395,"h":284,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1490588115391,"time":1490588115,"md5":"rDYPLlpzgHly1tF1+JrdWA==","fsize":182498,"resto":118463657,"id":"Sk9QmZ0y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118469732,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:15:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"The cold war era in general was the best, after WW2 America became the best country in the world.","time":1490588144,"resto":118463657,"id":"hjKnbD5b","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118469783,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:16:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118468888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118468888<\/a><br>Are we just going to ignore these beautiful quads.","time":1490588174,"resto":118463657,"id":"CKVHYnFU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118469957,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:17:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"My girl Audrey Hepburn 1957","filename":"Annex - Hepburn, Audrey (Funny Face)_07","ext":".jpg","w":1898,"h":2400,"tn_w":98,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490588277945,"time":1490588277,"md5":"JKuoxY9iqyn+UK58a+VNXw==","fsize":690844,"resto":118463657,"id":"6pn2hdBW","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118469969,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:18:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118469244\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118469244<\/a><br>Do you think cultivating this aesthetic makes for less degeneracy\/ more civilized family interactions? <br><br>Because i know some rich fucks with literal libraries in their house whose kids still act like absolute trash.

If you ignore chopping off limbs for stealing, death for apostasy, throwing gays off buildings, other backwards views, and being controlled by a religious entity, Sharia isn&#039;t too too terrible. \/pol\/s conservative views are *somewhat* in line with Sharia law. Let&#039;s be honest, our views have about as much in common with Sharia as western degeneracy. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the man is the dominant leader of the family <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;strong family values <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;loyal wife <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no degeneracy <\/span><br><br>That&#039;s a start - a good foundation for any society. That&#039;s pretty much the only part of Sharia I actually like whereas our culture is women sleeping around with a different guy every weekend than marriage in 30s and leech off cuck husband and financially castrate him if he doesn&#039;t do everything for her.<br><br>Unless something happens like a global nuclear war, statistically speaking, Islam is going to overtake all other religions by a considerable margin in 50 years times. Love it or hate it, it&#039;s just simple facts. For every 1-2 kids the western world has, Islam families are having an average of 4 kids per family every 25 years. We aren&#039;t gonna beat that. Saying &quot;just you wait&quot; while most of us are just hitting our 30s and thinking about maybe settling down soon, yah that&#039;s not changing anything. <br><br>I wish the US could be a little bit more conservative like the good old days but I just don&#039;t see it. Even if we do - I&#039;m well aware that Gen Z is going to be the most conservative age group - no way in hell are we going to get our population to start having 4 kids every 20 years. Nope. <br><br>Thoughts?","filename":"ENa4AGf","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":667,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490981171202,"time":1490981171,"md5":"PxOS77MIfmXjsY8QJkPkQQ==","fsize":409464,"resto":0,"id":"umZRqmxr","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-just-realized-something-today-sharia-law-isnt","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119077334,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)13:30:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"chopping off limbs for stealing, death for apostasy, throwing gays off buildings, other backwards views, and being controlled by a religious entity = that&#039;s bad","time":1490981404,"resto":119076958,"id":"+FQriERF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119079264,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)13:49:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119076958\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119076958<\/a><br>You forgot our shared hatred of the Jew.","filename":"1480036798600","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490982596213,"time":1490982596,"md5":"owEfPwLp9uZL\/cIItouRjA==","fsize":15069,"resto":119076958,"id":"1l1fsfkQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119079775,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)13:54:39","name":"Anon","com":"This kind of reasoning is how the muslims will take over Europe and the West.

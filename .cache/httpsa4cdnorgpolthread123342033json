After WW2 Yugoslavia was a much more prosperous place to live than Albania since Yugoslavia wasn&#039;t under the iron curtain. Hundreds of thousands of Albanians fled to Kosovo and started breeding there. <br><br>I think that before WW2 Kosovo had a population of some 400 000 people where ~50% were Serbs and 50% were Albanians, but in 1999 Kosovo had population of 2 million where the Serb population stagnated at 200 000 and Albos kept reproducing. During the war there was a massive campaign from both sides to cleanse the area, in the end Albanians succeeded with the help of NATO<br>During 99&#039; and 2004 Pogroms (https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YB<wbr>SPN8FciQQ ) some 170 000 Serbs were either killed or fled the country and the majority of Serbian churches, houses and monasteries were burned to the ground. The cleansing campaigns that the Kosovo government claimed were uncontrollable and spontaneous were so widespread that everyone has a friend who migrated from Kosovo, my best friend came here in 99&#039; after his father a policeman was killed whilst serving duty<br><br>Right now, there are some 30 000 Serbs in Kosovo and more than 1.9million Albanians, where majority of Serbs live in the north region close to Serbia. <br><br>Technically Kosovo is de facto independent but it is not recognized and it is a failed sate. Unemployment reaches 50% in some regions, the country has no Army and depends on foreign aid. The only reason it is still standing is because the biggest U.S military base in Europe is located there (See Bondsteel)<br><br>The minute U.S leaves Kosovo, Kosovo will be annexed back to Serbia and dirty Approaches expelled","time":1493480049,"resto":123342033,"id":"R0l6NKjy","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":123344289,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)11:37:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123342033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123342033<\/a><br>Yes.

Land-grabbing for the sake of &quot;muh rightful clay&quot; is retarded, but we must alao recognize that the Black Sea, not to mention Ukraine, belongs to Russia&#039;s sphere of influence. Russia&#039;s Black Sea fleet is anchored at Sevastopol, which is ensured through an agreement with Ukraine. Whoever controls Sevastopol controls the Black Sea. NATO has been illegally expanding closer and closer to Russia&#039;s borders ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Russia feels more and more backed into a corner, and rightly so. NATO is constantly trying to chip away at Russia&#039;s sphere of influence, and Ukraine was the last straw. After Maidan, the new Ukro gov was probably the most Russia-hostile one ever. Them ripping up the lease agreement of Sevastopol&#039;s port was a very real possibility, and then the Black Sea would be under de facto NATO control. &quot;Protecting Russian minorities&quot; was just the casus belli of the annexation, in reality it was about protecting their sphere of influence from NATO aggression. And that is a just cause in my book. Since I&#039;m a pan-nationalist, the fact that Crimea is Russian-populated is just a side bonus, even if many of them are 1st or 2nd generation immigrants from Russia proper. If it had beenany other nationality, I&#039;d be a lot more critical of the annexation though.","time":1490382100,"resto":118110073,"id":"yO5l9cwt","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118114544,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)15:02:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118110073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118110073<\/a><br>Russia is also taking South Otessia from Georgia. <br><br>http:\/\/www.reuters.com\/article\/us-r<wbr>ussia-georgia-army-idUSKBN16L1XQ?il<wbr>=0<br><br>referendum in some time.","time":1490382126,"resto":118110073,"id":"sDNCQhto","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":118114811,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)15:04:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118114488\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118114488<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;many of them <\/span><br>That&#039;s true but Crimea never had Ukrainian majority in history. <br>You can check historical censuses, you have them on internet.","time":1490382259,"resto":118110073,"id":"NhLMFZ5z","country":"ME","country_name":"Montenegro"},{"no":118114929,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)15:05:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"Based Russia not giving up it&#039;s warm water port to a Western installed puppet regime.

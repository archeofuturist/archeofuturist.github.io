I should have seen it coming with his support for Israel and letting his daughter fuck a Jew, but his supposed support for Assad and the only possible lasting peace in Syria and an end to the migrant crisis made me think otherwise. Well, it&#039;s only taken a few months and a blatantly obvious false flag for him to fall completely under ZOG and CIA control.<br><br>There is plenty of evidence showing it was a false flag and none that I can see that this was an actual Syrian chemical attack. Does anyone else remember the fucking UN announcing Assads chemical stockpiles destroyed years ago? What possible motivation would he have for using a weapon that only demonizes him further for literally no tactical gain?<br><br>I&#039;m fucking done with Trump and have basically given up on the political system, it&#039;s clearly all a farce and it doesn&#039;t matter who gets into power. Whether knowingly or not Trump is working out Israels agenda ahead of the free people of the US and Europe to ensure that the migrant crisis continues and enlarges once he inevitably puts together a plan to turn Syria into Libya. Once there is no hope of lasting peace in Syria you can kiss any chance of sending the rapefugees back to their country of origin, they&#039;re here to stay.","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491433565473,"time":1491433565,"md5":"OZYpc93SkB852O+uBbmLVQ==","fsize":270237,"resto":0,"id":"Z1fUa9v0","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-choose-assad-over-trump-fuck-this-shit-i-should","country_name":"Canada","replies":189,"images":36,"unique_ips":101,"tail_size":50},{"no":119670800,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:09:16","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1491428370706","ext":".png","w":638,"h":318,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1491433756533,"time":1491433756,"md5":"hOsexMw\/5LjuaSl2u\/G89Q==","fsize":72721,"resto":119670426,"id":"n4RjXDc6","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119670851,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:09:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119670426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119670426<\/a><br>NOOO SHUT IT DOWN GOYIM <br><br>GO DIE FOR ISRAEL","time":1491433788,"resto":119670426,"id":"HcYkzI3p","country":"SY","country_name":"Syria"},{"no":119671004,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)19:11:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119670426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119670426<\/a><br>Good.

This light is invisible to the human eye, but visible to most camera sensors, and is transmitted through certain clothing, particularly dark colored and thin cotton and polyester like ANTIFA\u2019s bandanas. Some of you might remember a bunch of \u201cnews reports\u201d about a Sony video camera that could \u201cx-ray\u201d clothes \u2013 this is the effect we are talking about. Now, there are two steps to making one of these at home: 1) remove the IR filter on the camera, and 2) filtering the visible light so that the IR dominates the image.<br><br>For the first, I recommend this tutorial: [spoiler]<br><br>https:\/[\/spoiler]\/www.youtube.com\/w<wbr>atch?v=mUtoLBOego4<br><br>It uses a ~$60 &quot;action camera&quot; clone of the gopro which should have good mounting options for your protest gear.<br><br>Next, reassemble the camera and glue this: https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00XU8SHE<wbr>0\/ref=twister_B01DA1ASWU?_encoding=<wbr>UTF8&amp;psc=1#customerReviews over the lens, as close as you can get it to the lens housing. <br><br>There you go. For less than $100 you should have a basic infrared camera that can see through some clothing. Here&#039;s a video demo of how it works: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7UB<wbr>bjwPnW1E <br><br>It&#039;s not perfect, obviously, nor will it unmask every antifa you catch on camera, but it should be able to give our doxsquads more to go on and preserve more evidence for later use. More importantly, antifa won&#039;t know if their masks are protecting them or not. As we saw at Auburn, unmasking them sends them running immediately. I think the psychological aspect may be more potent than the information gathering.","filename":"op2","ext":".jpg","w":504,"h":297,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":147,"tim":1492836842993,"time":1492836842,"md5":"04+pD+1P170pjYKIja5VbQ==","fsize":16809,"resto":0,"id":"0gFT7nfi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"unmasking-antifa","country_name":"United States","replies":127,"images":29,"unique_ips":70,"tail_size":50},{"no":122238000,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:55:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"why not just use it on stacy sluts instead?","time":1492836908,"resto":122237908,"id":"kIUMJkQK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122238071,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:55:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122237908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122237908<\/a><br>Will this work on black masks?","time":1492836955,"resto":122237908,"id":"F4rGppMl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122238096,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:56:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122238000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122238000<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying you can&#039;t do both.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not wanting to see hairy antifa bush<\/span>","time":1492836977,"resto":122237908,"id":"0gFT7nfi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122238205,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:57:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122238071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122238071<\/a><br>Black is weirdly enough more transparent to IR than white.

Look up IR filter removal, I think it&#039;s about $250 or something. It makes your camera much more sensitive to IR.<br><br>A DSLR without an IR filter can photograph into the deep IR range with an apochromatic lens however it&#039;s pretty obvious because you need to put a filter in front of the lens which blocks everything but IR. I believe you can get such a filter installed by the same people who remove other sensor filters, though.<br><br>There are also UV\/IR\/visible light &#039;police&#039; digital cameras but they&#039;re expensive.

In a number of years, we will probably be able to arrange some trade deals which are significantly worse that the ones we have now. That is indeed true: we will be able to trade &quot;with the rest of the world&quot; just like we do now - but on worse terms.<br><br>Want to know why she fed us the Brexit Means Brexit shite? It&#039;s because, at the time, she didn&#039;t have a clue what she was going to do. <br><br>The settlement we&#039;re trying, and failing, to reach is going to affect our country for decades to come, and right now it looks like it&#039;s going to set us back to pre-Empire days in terms of international influence and national wealth. This means we won&#039;t get any decent trade deals because we haven&#039;t really got anything to offer. Since we&#039;re unable to be self-sufficient we have to import, and we do, a huge amount. That means import and export charges, ergo more expensive goods and services, ergo higher costs of living for you and me.<br><br>A lot of areas of the country actually receive a huge amount of EU funding, too. The Cornish, for example, (who were pro-Brexit) get a lot of money from the EU for infrastructure improvements. They asked the government to cover the shortfall, and were awarded about a fifth of what they&#039;re used to. Don&#039;t expect any high speed Paddington to Truro train lines cropping up any time soon. In fact, expect infrastructure to deteriorate as the UK can&#039;t afford to subsidize buses, broadband lines, airports etc. Farmers are dreading Brexit because the EU doles out masses of grants. Universities won&#039;t be able to continue their research with quite the same gusto either, because we lose access to EU co-operative research programmes and funds.

Theres been countless images showing you the tactics theyll use to sow discontent from within the opposition. <br><br>All other tactics didnt work so now theyre pretending to belong here, on the premise of those that DO belong here seem to be taken more seriously. Examples of this read are comparable to drumpfposting. <br><br>Notice that all of the posts that suddenly have sprung up against the traditional ideals of this board, and VERY suddenly at that, lack the diction one develops from shitposting here for even a small amount of time. This is similar to how people who just find the site sound, except this time it sounds like people who were given a shitty briefing on how to sound like they belong here. <br><br>The only way to combat this is to not be swayed by the shilling. But how can you know who the shills are versus the actual posters? The shills are actually quicker to call you paranoid than native posters. Its that classic tactic to discredit the opposition, but from within this time. I believe this new wave of shills will remain for much longer than before, and their intent is to make the board too chaotic to even convey information at all, since they failed to sway the content of the information before. They are going to go full scorched earth on this board and even maybe the whole site. If they succeed every single thread will be drumpfposting and &quot;wow if you still support him you are just a trump shill&quot;. <br><br>Given the nature of this, the absolute ONLY way to persevere is to remain true to your beliefs, the ones you voted based on. And stick to them hard, because this time we&#039;re in it for the long haul.","filename":"Screenshot_2017-04-06-09-10-34","ext":".png","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491675191404,"time":1491675191,"md5":"KRty80VkgbAjNhcR1jNmjA==","fsize":765412,"resto":120161061,"id":"Vono4Cy7","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120161928,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)14:13:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120161249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120161249<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\/pol\/tards still living in the delusion they made Trump president and it wasn&#039;t the double digit IQ country hicks<\/span>","time":1491675220,"resto":120161061,"id":"nf7lOUBT","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120162064,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)14:14:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120161061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120161061<\/a><br><br>No. I once saw Christcucks jacking each other off about how Aristotle is a &quot;retard&quot;.","time":1491675285,"resto":120161061,"id":"CLOl5Hbd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

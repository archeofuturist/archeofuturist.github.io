There was a certain tolerance of these behaviors, but it was seen as unseemly and something a married person shouldnt do... not that it didnt happen all the time! Read the philosophers and you will see. The only proper love between people of the same sex was platonic love... and the idea of any sort of gay marriage would have been laughed to scorn and would not have been understood.

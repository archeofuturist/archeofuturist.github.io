That said, if women were stronger than men we would probably see women becoming economically active in heavier industries sooner in history (as in, the majority of those working the land in Roman times would be women, the ones working in mines would be women et cetera).

The problem is what these men can offer the women, considering women&#039;s sex drives are lower than men&#039;s. The heterosexual system we had for most of history worked because women desired man&#039;s strength, intelligence and resources while men desired women&#039;s vagina. If women have the strength to acquire resources and protection for themselves, what good (evolutionarily speaking) are men to them? They don&#039;t love us and they barely want to fuck us.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Are you scared of strong women \/pol\/?<\/span><br>Not at all, they just make me angry because they don&#039;t exist. I&#039;d hate women a lot less if they were stronger and more decent people. The thing is that &quot;strong independent womyn&quot; are weak, flabby and unambitious. Ironically the most powerful woman of the 20th century (Thatcher) was hated by feminists and hated them back.

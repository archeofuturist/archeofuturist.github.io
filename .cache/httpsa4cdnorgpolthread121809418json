In 1815 when the battle of Waterloo took place, there were no quick methods of communication like we have today so messengers were used for communication in times of war. The Rothschild\u2019s took advantage of this by having spies on the frontlines of the battle who would return information to the family faster than the messengers used by the military.<br><br> When the British won the war, Nathan Rothschild, was of course, the first to know, and he immediately went to the stock exchange and started selling stocks while putting out the rumor that the French had won the war. This created a panic on the floor of the stock exchange and investors all over England began frantically selling their stocks. With the price of all stocks plummeting Rothschild was able to buy out the whole English market for a fraction of its cost. When word returned that the English had actually been victorious, the value of the market soared, and overnight Nathan Rothschild expanded his family\u2019s wealth, and cemented their position as one of the richest families in the world.","time":1492580834,"resto":121809418,"id":"s6i4NkOk","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121809852,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:48:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121809686\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121809686<\/a><br>ffs my boy i can&#039;t compete with this","time":1492580928,"resto":121809418,"id":"DKwFt4Kw","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":121810049,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:50:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121809852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121809852<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lazy niggers run away at the first sign of resistance <\/span><br>this is why you lost the falklands","time":1492581025,"resto":121809418,"id":"KYENXQRu","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":121810266,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:52:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121810049\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121810049<\/a><br>didn&#039;t japan surrender right after the second retaliation of the us","time":1492581149,"resto":121809418,"id":"DKwFt4Kw","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":121810414,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:54:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121810049\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121810049<\/a><br>how does it feel knowing every time you mention another country losing a war you might see this image?","filename":"7A_Nagasaki_Bomb_Cloud","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":529,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1492581242038,"time":1492581242,"md5":"ebiY5z6tPHO8Qx5GeXM6gw==","fsize":51426,"resto":121809418,"id":"ryPRm1dc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121810588,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:55:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"I once walked into my public library to print off a resume.

We do NOT have competitive free markets in the United States when it comes to broadband.<br><br>The Telco companies are granted monopolies at the local level. In many areas there is only one or at most two broadband internet providers. These companies are granted near-monopoly pricing powers and allowing these telco companies to not only set prices in this government protected and granted monopoly but allowing them to prioritize traffic as they see fit is a huge blow to an open and free internet.<br><br>Without government enforcement of net neutrality in which all ideas (and data) are transmitted and relayed with equal, free speech and the free market itself is threatened.<br><br>The right to free speech is rendered moot when it cannot be heard or received at reasonable speed. Consider the following scenario: two speeches are going on. One is by a fellow who reports the truth. The other is by a fellow who reports what his financiers tell him to. Because of second fellow&#039;s financial support he is able to afford a amplifier and speakers. His resources help him to effectively drown out the fellow reporting the truth.<br><br>Likewise, competitors to Google&#039;s Youtube like Vimeo will not be able to compete as they do not have Google&#039;s enormous financial resources to have their traffic prioritized by various ISPs. Consumers will prefer Youtube because the videos on there aren&#039;t slow and always buffering and Youtube will be able to further monopolize the video market because of its large financial backing.<br><br>Therefore, your dismantling of net neutrality provisions is an attack on free speech and free markets. Because of the monopolies granted to telcos by local governments there are no alternatives if my ISP decides to deprioritize Netflix in favor of their own video streaming service. <br><br>For the sake of the internet, free speech, and innovation, I hope you reconsider your position.","time":1493265997,"resto":122992410,"id":"vd20H8pA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

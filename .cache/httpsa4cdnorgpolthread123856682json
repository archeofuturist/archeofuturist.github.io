Signals having the same period were found in only<br>234 stars overwhelmingly in the F2 to K1 spectral range. The signals cannot be caused by<br>instrumental or data analysis effects because they are present in only a very small fraction of<br>stars within a narrow spectral range and because signal to noise ratio considerations predict<br>that the signal should mostly be detected in the brightest objects, while this is not the case. We<br>consider several possibilities, such as rotational transitions in molecules, rapid pulsations,<br>Fourier transform of spectral lines and signals generated by Extraterrestrial Intelligence (ETI).<br>They cannot be generated by molecules or rapid pulsations. It is highly unlikely that they come<br>from the Fourier transform of spectral lines because too many strong lines located at nearly<br>periodic frequencies are needed. Finally we consider the possibility, predicted in a previous<br>published paper, that the signals are caused by light pulses generated by Extraterrestrial<br>Intelligence to makes us aware of their existence. We find that the detected signals have<br>exactly the shape of an ETI signal predicted in the previous publication and are therefore in<br>agreement with this hypothesis. The fact that they are only found in a very small fraction of<br>stars within a narrow spectral range centered near the spectral type of the sun is also in<br>agreement with the ETI hypothesis. However, at this stage, this hypothesis needs to be<br>confirmed with further work. Although unlikely, there is also a possibility that the signals are<br>due to highly peculiar chemical compositions in a small fraction of galactic halo stars.<br><br>https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1610.03031v1.<wbr>pdf<br><br>And that might be one species or coalition of species.

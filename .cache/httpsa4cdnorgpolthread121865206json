In addition to Aristophanes&#039; political and social satire, Assemblywomen derives its comedy through sexual and scatological humor. It is important to note that the play&#039;s central concepts of women in government and communism were not legitimate suggestions from Aristophanes, but rather an outlandish premise that aimed to criticize the Athenian government at the time.<\/span>","time":1492621969,"resto":121865206,"id":"vyFTaHX5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121867453,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)13:16:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121867033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121867033<\/a><br>Dunno why I said Romans, it overlaps with the Roman empire but I meant to say Greeks.","time":1492622206,"resto":121865206,"id":"vyFTaHX5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121867828,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)13:20:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121867453\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121867453<\/a><br>The Romans were smart enough also not to allow women to vote","time":1492622427,"resto":121865206,"id":"zm6nAAxh","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

Similarly, the number of Muslim immigrants is also rising. According to official state data, some 240,000 immigrants enter Russia annually \u2014 Russia&#039;s Center for Migration Studies puts this number at more than 400,000 after accounting for illegal immigration.

Most immigrants come from the Central Asian states and Azerbaijan, according to Rosstat. Russia already hosts the second-largest number of migrants after the United States, some 11 million or nearly 8 percent of the population.

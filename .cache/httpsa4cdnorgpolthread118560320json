Realistically, all your average goy needs to get through life is English and Maths. Science to a lesser extent. The rest is complete filler of indoctrination and completely pointless. <br>History is a waste of time because they teach you nothing relevant. PE the same because the fat kids don&#039;t do it anyway. And the rest are so forgettable I can&#039;t even remember them (except art, which is equally pointless because art no longer has any parameters for what&#039;s good and what isn&#039;t. Of all subjects it&#039;s literally the &quot;everybody wins for taking part&quot; one). I would argue that IT is important too, but that&#039;s purely because of the world we live in. Even then though all we ever done in IT was Word and fucking Excel.<br>So even if it was English, IT, maths and science, that doesn&#039;t take 12 year to get to grips with. But if you left school before you were actually old enough to work, who is going to look after you all day? Say you left school at 12, the government would say you&#039;re too young to look after yourself and too young to work. Your dad is at work and your mum fell for the work meme too.<br>You can work when you&#039;re 16 though so you can stay in the oversized creche until then. Learning about how bad white people are, how black people are just like white people because everyone is equal except blacks aren&#039;t bad and how Jews are literally the most hard done by people on the planet (caused by whites obviously, white males to be exact).<br>People used to leave school at 10, help their mum in the house, learn things from their dad. As long as they had a stable family life they came out more prepared than 16 and 18 year olds do coming out of school now.

Intelligence is more of factor of genetics and environmental factors. Proper nutrition (i.e. not being malnourished) is one of the more important environmental factors. Effective nutrition programs would be much more effective in raising intelligence than a generic public school systems. This is why the lower range of IQ bell curve is truncated in the US and Western countries.<br><br>2. Education is mainly about training for a particular skill. For instance, Alice is going to law school and is trained in legal skills needed to be a lawyer, Bob goes to engineering school and learns how to be an engineer, Carol get her PhD in chemistry and learns how to be an academic. Public education doesn&#039;t train any particular skill. Apart from fundamental skills such as writing, reading, and basic math, most of what public school teaches falls under generic skills like problem solving. While these skills are needed in some professions and in life in general, I question how effective public school are in delivering these materials. For instance, I could count to 100 and I knew the times table up to 10s before my first day of school. I took until grade 4 for the curriculum to catch up. I would argue that my advance standing wasn&#039;t due to me being particularly bright, but because I had a good family that wanted me to learn. Not all families would be in this situation so that explains the gaps. <br><br>3. Further to the above point, there are still some dumb fuckers even with high school. The kind of people who don&#039;t get PEMDAS. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if a large number of those people were a) dumb due to genetic low IQ and thus public school would do nothing b) dumb because of a shitty family life which public education does nothing about c) dumb because their family didn&#039;t encourage or promote their education, see Paris Hilton or fundamentals. <br><br>tl;dr stupid people exists in this country despite the public school system, due to genetic or environmental factors.

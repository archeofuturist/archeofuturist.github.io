Realistically, all your average goy needs to get through life is English and Maths. Science to a lesser extent. The rest is complete filler of indoctrination and completely pointless. <br>History is a waste of time because they teach you nothing relevant. PE the same because the fat kids don&#039;t do it anyway. And the rest are so forgettable I can&#039;t even remember them (except art, which is equally pointless because art no longer has any parameters for what&#039;s good and what isn&#039;t. Of all subjects it&#039;s literally the &quot;everybody wins for taking part&quot; one). I would argue that IT is important too, but that&#039;s purely because of the world we live in. Even then though all we ever done in IT was Word and fucking Excel.<br>So even if it was English, IT, maths and science, that doesn&#039;t take 12 year to get to grips with. But if you left school before you were actually old enough to work, who is going to look after you all day? Say you left school at 12, the government would say you&#039;re too young to look after yourself and too young to work. Your dad is at work and your mum fell for the work meme too.<br>You can work when you&#039;re 16 though so you can stay in the oversized creche until then. Learning about how bad white people are, how black people are just like white people because everyone is equal except blacks aren&#039;t bad and how Jews are literally the most hard done by people on the planet (caused by whites obviously, white males to be exact).<br>People used to leave school at 10, help their mum in the house, learn things from their dad. As long as they had a stable family life they came out more prepared than 16 and 18 year olds do coming out of school now.

A little too much \/pol\/ taste to be libertarian to me. Libertarianism isn&#039;t inherently an cap or even strictly right leaning. I personally lean only slightly right. I find it easy to validate certain things such as environmental regulation. The government can only take away, but when a profit seeking company does something like pollute, that steps on the property (and often health) rights of individuals or other entities. It&#039;s easy in my mind to validate regulation when the benefits of a specific regulation to society are greater than the net outcome of the free market alternative (i should note that this is an extremely rare occurrence)<br><br>I disagree very strongly with the earlier sentiment that libertarians are against immigration. In fact that goes strongly against neoclassical economic principles of the free market. I would even take it a step farther and say that if you support building a wall and deporting because &quot;babby little bitch boi&quot; needs the state to take care of you by protecting your jobs, you&#039;re worse than a fucking socialist. You cry about lefties wanting 15$\/hr, but what you&#039;re asking for is worse. You want the government to create an artificial deprevation of labor supply in the market to protect YOUR job. You are literally asking for government subsidization of Americana labor so it can compete with cheaper, more effective use of resources labor. But in the process, you denied an entire group of people civil\/ personal liberties to do it. Free markets means free movement of labor to seek the demand. End of story. If course you can use the search principle I talked about in regulation, but I am confident that the free market benefits of free movement of labor outweigh the negatives proposed, by far.<br><br>Also, seriously fuck taxes.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;9k in federal 2016, didn&#039;t even work all year<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;well over 2k to state this year since I bought a vehicle<\/span><br><br>Christ that&#039;s a fuck ton of my money","filename":"FB_IMG_1490104529387","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":937,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491650374892,"time":1491650374,"md5":"nspgGgwbMNvRyc9n0ECBSw==","fsize":60782,"resto":120112269,"id":"oPDY019b","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120120194,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)07:21:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120119947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120119947<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;People are fed the <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;le ebin capitalism<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;commie meme and they fully adapted.

I agree with the logic, and I especially agree with not exclusively looking at it in a purely economic form. But on a grander scale: if liberty is truly the best route for an individual society, and will allow that society to develope to the best of its potential, then what&#039;s preventing liberty from taking those immigrants and making them a valuable asset to society? I would argue that when cultures aren&#039;t forced to intermingle, and they&#039;re allowed to prosper in proximity to each other they would actually gain much from each other, barring gross fundamental differences like say slavery or something.

That affects the supply of those goods in our neck of the world eventually. If this is not the case, then do we not have a vested interest helping those societies become more advanced, and having more capability to reduce consumption and possibly contribute to our well being economically? That could be argued from a standpoint of resources and property rights I believe. And if that is the case, then how would isolationism help? Certainly denying individuals liberties of emigration, however much sense it may make to protecting our liberties, is not the best way to help spread the ideas of liberty? <br><br><br>Perhaps I&#039;m missing the finer point and isolationism isn&#039;t what you&#039;re preaching here.

society to develope to the best of its potential, then what&#039;s preventing liberty from taking those immigrants and making them a valuable asset to society?<\/span><br><br>Presumably it is due to the fact that people&#039;s self is determined by historically contingent situations. Namely, a person&#039;s sense of his self, of what is good, his conception of liberty itself, is determined in part by irrationally given feature which he acquires in youth relatively automatically and involuntarily because of basic brain plasticity.<br><br>Therefore, the alien within a society, in so far as he is not part of the same line of development as us, is liable to identify with some other group or have different conceptions of what it is to be good, of what the self is, of the place of the self within society, of what the substructure of societies are and their role (religions, races, tribes) and of what freedom actually is. (Some Muslims do not recognize as legitimate freedom the state of NOT being a Muslim.)<br><br>Mechanism of self formation and cultural transmission do not operate merely at the societal (read: horizontal) level, but also at the family (read: vertical) one. Thus the ability of a society to shape and integrate an individual, especially in a context in which this society gives a GREAT degree of autonomy to families and the deployment of other culture, will potentially compromise itself through mass migration.<br><br>I would furthermore question the idea according to which liberty is THE best of systems FOR ALL TIME AND ALL PLACES.

They cannot really be ranked.<br><br>In exactly the same way as I believe this to be true for the individual, I believe to obtain for whole societies.

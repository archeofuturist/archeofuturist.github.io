A little too much \/pol\/ taste to be libertarian to me. Libertarianism isn&#039;t inherently an cap or even strictly right leaning. I personally lean only slightly right. I find it easy to validate certain things such as environmental regulation. The government can only take away, but when a profit seeking company does something like pollute, that steps on the property (and often health) rights of individuals or other entities. It&#039;s easy in my mind to validate regulation when the benefits of a specific regulation to society are greater than the net outcome of the free market alternative (i should note that this is an extremely rare occurrence)<br><br>I disagree very strongly with the earlier sentiment that libertarians are against immigration. In fact that goes strongly against neoclassical economic principles of the free market. I would even take it a step farther and say that if you support building a wall and deporting because &quot;babby little bitch boi&quot; needs the state to take care of you by protecting your jobs, you&#039;re worse than a fucking socialist. You cry about lefties wanting 15$\/hr, but what you&#039;re asking for is worse. You want the government to create an artificial deprevation of labor supply in the market to protect YOUR job. You are literally asking for government subsidization of Americana labor so it can compete with cheaper, more effective use of resources labor. But in the process, you denied an entire group of people civil\/ personal liberties to do it. Free markets means free movement of labor to seek the demand. End of story. If course you can use the search principle I talked about in regulation, but I am confident that the free market benefits of free movement of labor outweigh the negatives proposed, by far.<br><br>Also, seriously fuck taxes.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;9k in federal 2016, didn&#039;t even work all year<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;well over 2k to state this year since I bought a vehicle<\/span><br><br>Christ that&#039;s a fuck ton of my money","filename":"FB_IMG_1490104529387","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":937,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491650374892,"time":1491650374,"md5":"nspgGgwbMNvRyc9n0ECBSw==","fsize":60782,"resto":120112269,"id":"oPDY019b","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120120194,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)07:21:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120119947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120119947<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;People are fed the <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;le ebin capitalism<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;commie meme and they fully adapted.

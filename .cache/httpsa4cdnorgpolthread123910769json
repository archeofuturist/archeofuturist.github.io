Minniti explained to the Italian newspaper La Stampa that:<br><br>The Libyan border guard service will be active all along the 5,000km [3,106 mile] long south Libyan border. And in the north, migrant sea traffickers will be dealt with by the Libyan coast guard which was trained by Italian experts, and which will be equipped with 10 motor boats from April 30.<br>The Libyan deal is the latest part of a barrier constructed to protect Europe\u2019s soft southern underbelly \u2013 the Mediterranean. It may not be a physical barrier comparable to Donald Trump\u2019s wall along the US-Mexican border, but it is nearly in place.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-05-03 at 3.11.52 PM","ext":".png","w":1450,"h":1300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":224,"tim":1493817216569,"time":1493817216,"md5":"yD1jeX9hR2z7Hm1M8j4UgA==","fsize":1909542,"resto":0,"id":"qySuEBkD","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-hasnt-even-started-yet-but-europe-already","country_name":"Germany","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":123910877,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)09:14:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"i dont see a wall there, or anything for that matter","time":1493817299,"resto":123910769,"id":"dm6XkDyr","country":"CR","country_name":"Costa Rica"},{"no":123911852,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)09:27:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123910877\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123910877<\/a><br>This.

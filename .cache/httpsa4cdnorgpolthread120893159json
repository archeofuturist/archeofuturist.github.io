I think OP was way too optimistic, I believe that at least 70% of people won&#039;t be able to find work in the near future. Many IT jobs and law related jobs for example can easily be replaced by robots and computers. This is also the main reason why mass immigration from shit countries is so dangerous. Most muslims have below average IQ and have no education. Even if they wanted to contribute to society, there&#039;s simply no way for them to do so. It&#039;s hard enough for highly educated white people to get an OK job these days. So they&#039;re doomed to turn to crime and violence from day one!<br><br>Look at the whole HWNDU saga. There is truth to the stereotype that a lot of people here are unemployed. Instead of using their energy, creativity and talents on a job, they instead hunted Shia across the world. It was pretty funny and cute. It was also pretty impressive when people tracked down ISIS camps and had them bombed. Some people here are clearly very intelligent. But what will happen when these people get more angry and bitter, and decide to use their talents in a more destructive way? Pretty scary thought.","time":1492081739,"resto":120893159,"id":"buntGdt\/","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120899341,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)07:29:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120893717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120893717<\/a><br>How do you intend to do that with no money?","time":1492082972,"resto":120893159,"id":"RGlh1l2W","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

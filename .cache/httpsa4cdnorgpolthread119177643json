They&#039;d go to \/a\/ from \/r\/anime, \/b\/ to see if their bs rumors were true, etc... There was always migration into 4chan, especially since 2007-2008 after the site got popular as the result of &quot;muh anonymous&quot; (for those who don&#039;t know, anonymous hackers don&#039;t come from \/b\/ but people thought they did. It&#039;s the name they adopted). <br><br>What happened as \/pol\/ became more popular and more homogenous in thought, for various reasons including reactionary attitude toward tumblr and some feminist presence in 4chan itself, \/pol\/acks started to spread their ideology outside of the board more and more. \/tv\/, \/a\/ and \/v\/ became more \/pol\/. The various poltiical attitudes in \/a\/ for example resulted to only \/pol\/ mentality. I remembrer arguing against feminists every now and then in \/a\/ 4 years ago. This is far more rarer to see now.<br><br>\/pol\/ then spread to other sites, reddit. Again, there was always migration form reddit to 4chan but also vice verca. As \/pol\/ populated reddit and took advantage of backlash feminism (especially SRS) was facing as a result of their own stupidity, reddit started to become more like \/pol\/. Not fully however but you still had Coontown, Whiterights, and later altright subreddits. Eventually as reddit swallowed up more memes from 4chan like they always did, the various anti-feminist internet blogs and youtube channels brought more people to be into \/pol\/ mentality. This meant bigger waves of migration from reddit to 4chan.<br><br>The election was the biggest effect.<br><br>In short, \/pol\/ went to reddit to convert the liberals there. This was somewhat successful but brought more redditors to 4chan, especially \/pol\/. Bump rate of threads changed just because of the volume of people coming in. It&#039;s understandable why Moot jumped ship but he should have burned it after. <br>Biggest mistake: \/pol\/ took itself too seriously.","time":1491125095,"resto":119177643,"id":"uWRLq4sP","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119183223,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)05:25:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119177744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119177744<\/a><br>theyre manchildren who dont know the meaning of satire. pol is not the same shit as the_donald get it through your heads faggots","time":1491125118,"resto":119177643,"id":"nPD18HgR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119183239,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)05:25:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119178348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119178348<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anyone I don&#039;t like is ShareBlue\u00a9<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A guide to Reddits political views<\/span>","time":1491125129,"resto":119177643,"id":"h7Uk7YGl","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119183251,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)05:25:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119182452\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119182452<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying major of horsefuckers watched old MLP<\/span>","time":1491125146,"resto":119177643,"id":"Qq7viCw9","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119183279,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)05:26:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119183028\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119183028<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119182687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119182687<\/a><br>like the pole says \/mlp\/ didnt start till 2012 and that original from what i know was 90% female viewers compare to to the now 80% male viewers","time":1491125172,"resto":119177643,"id":"BLYGSSU6","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119183280,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)05:26:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119177643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119177643<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119177643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119177643<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119177643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119177643<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119182565#p119182565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119182565<\/a><br><a href=\"http:\/\/boards.4chan.org\/pol\/thread\/119182565119182565\" target=\"_blank\">http:\/\/boards.4chan.org\/pol\/thread\/<wbr>119182565119182565<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119182565#p119182565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119182565<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119182565#p119182565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119182565<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119182565#p119182565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119182565<\/a><br><br>WE ARE SO CLOSe<br><br>help uncuck france","filename":"1486345133178","ext":".png","w":659,"h":715,"tn_w":115,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491125173613,"time":1491125173,"md5":"XbrypyWMaNx51Le9HtKhnQ==","fsize":840468,"resto":119177643,"id":"n6RTfF8m","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119183322,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)05:27:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119183001\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119183001<\/a><br>Side by side I will goose step and you can frolic in the blood of redditers","time":1491125227,"resto":119177643,"id":"qCJt2A96","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119183324,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)05:27:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119178338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119178338<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;autism intensifies<\/span>","time":1491125228,"resto":119177643,"id":"1yuYgmYO","country":"UA","country_name":"Ukraine"},{"no":119183421,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)05:28:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119177744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119177744<\/a><br>Redditors are dumb as bricks and are the source of every useless non-statement on this board and website.

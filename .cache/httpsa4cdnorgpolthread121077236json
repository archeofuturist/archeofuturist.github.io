While on the other hand the Shias believe that unless and until the 12th Mahdi comes, it is not proper for them to destroy non-Muslims and establish Islam. Of course a vast majority of Sunnis and Shias are not going to murder anyone in the name of Islam but that is the actual belief. In Indian history the most zealous,fanatic,ruthless mass murdering Jihadis were Sunnis, while the most educated, cultured, gentle and talented were Shias. Even in Bollywood, most Muslims are Shias and have tolerant and liberal attitudes towards Hindus<br><br>Shias are generally more progressive than Sunnis.. Almost all mainstream Sunni scholars have declared Shias as heretics, infidels and Rafizas (rejectors). Shias believe in the divinity of the Imams which has no relation with actual Islam. The heavy infiltration of Persian culture in Shia Islam has made it more humane unlike Sunnis. Shias are just 15% of global Muslim population while the Sunnis are 85%. Except the Lebanese Hezbollah and the Iranian Ayatollah regime, all the other dangerous Jihadist groups are Sunni and many of them are actively persecuting the Shias.","filename":"770d72eee1473e351934bb394f3e888d","ext":".jpg","w":380,"h":570,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492188917583,"time":1492188917,"md5":"i19M67KZqY7I1dC2Z0lOvg==","fsize":25622,"resto":121077236,"id":"qOL38EsR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121083082,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:57:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121082794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121082794<\/a><br>In addition, The simple answer is that Shia Islam is very peaceful and tolerant when compared to modern day Sunni Islam. Sunni Islam did and perhaps still do have moderate tolerant versions, but the rise of Whabbism has made pretty much made mainstream Sunni Islam, little more than a death cult waiting for the end times. Shia Islam is a lot mystical, and religions that are more mystical tend to be less aggressive in nature. Also, throughout Shia history, there is a culture of tolerance. Christians and Hindus fought with Prophet&#039;s grandson against the tyrant Yazeed, who was backed by most of the muslims at Karabala. Shias acknowledge that and to this day, you have Christians and people of other faiths, who make pilgrimage to Shia Shrines and some have even died defending them from the likes of ISIS and other Whabbi groups. <br><br>Lastly, Shia Islam unlike Whabbi\/Sunni Islam is not insecure about itself. There is a reason, why all the Sunnis are always declaring stuff haram, from birthdays, Xmases to Snowmen, Shias on the other hand don&#039;t mind joining in celebrations of other cultures and faiths. The Iranian president for example wished the Jews their version of happy new year, similarly, Shias take part in Christmas celebrations.","time":1492189065,"resto":121077236,"id":"qOL38EsR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121083258,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:59:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121082421\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121082421<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gets tricked into believing an Arab goat herder received visions from the archangel Gabriel in a cave outside Meccha<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;primary sacred text is littered with proven inaccuracies in trying to articulate established Christian doctrines like the Trinity and how Mary relates to Jesus because Mohammed was a fucking idiot and corresponded with shitty and inaccurate sources<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no critical edition of sacred text<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;promotes sub-cultures in which violence, Salafism and Wahabbism is deeply psychologically compelling<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;promotes a system of absolute monotheism with no basis for justification because Allah cannot vindicate his own righteousness<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;has to resort to &quot;capriciousness&quot; in order to explain why Allah is not constrained by the holiness of his own nature but in doing so creates massive soteriological complications for practitioners<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;h-hey \/pol\/ t-the spirit of the message of Islam i-is pure&quot;<\/span><br><br>fuck your religion, faggot","filename":"50","ext":".jpg","w":840,"h":544,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1492189161903,"time":1492189161,"md5":"eV50ZET1sxtF7vDvbsVAjA==","fsize":91559,"resto":121077236,"id":"HNH8a3NZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121083285,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:59:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121082794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121082794<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121083082\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121083082<\/a><br>t. ali al-tehrani","time":1492189180,"resto":121077236,"id":"Q33V0z1X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

I figured I&#039;d do it as a little experiment to see how free my free speech is at this university. Here are the results.<br><br>As a quick side note, me and a mate slapped the poster together in like 15 minutes, which is why there are spelling mistakes.<br><br>Anyways, as we were putting up the posters, we happened upon the campus Socialists, who had a stall up where they were handing out small fliers about the recent budget cuts against education. When they learned about the posters, they talked at us for about 15 minutes about how we shouldn&#039;t be targeting ANTIFA and how the left wing is still more silenced and oppressed. I&#039;d never really done the whole live debate thing so I left it to my mate to be called an islamophobic fascist.<br><br>I told the socialist who stuck around the longest that if he disagreed with what I had to say, then he should put up his own poster that counters my points and proves me wrong.<br><br>Two days later, this. Right next to all ten of my remaining posters across campus. I&#039;ll never know if it was the guy who was arguing with me who made this poster, but there&#039;s one thing I know with complete certainty.

Imagine if intelligent life evolved somewhere with only 1 gender. You can fuck anyone and have a kid. This species wouldn&#039;t even have a concept of gender at all, since every one of them is the same. There&#039;d be no such thing as being gay. No trannies, no gender inequality to complain about, no people who think 1 million different genders exist, because to them, gender doesn&#039;t exist at all. We were just unfortunate to be stuck with something known as the &quot;female&quot;. Oh well.","filename":"1419248103665","ext":".gif","w":350,"h":197,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491427934449,"time":1491427934,"md5":"Z\/eVB\/HUtQ+8R4hPsU1MvQ==","fsize":1001210,"resto":0,"id":"w3imvsfw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"if-you-think-about-it-the-way-mammals-evolved-and","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119659593,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)17:36:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yeah, it&#039;s pretty unfortunate for our species that half the population is retarded and unable to contribute to society, no matter what race.","time":1491428185,"resto":119659066,"id":"SCbWBNLo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

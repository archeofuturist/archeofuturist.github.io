They decided to change the meaning of the words. When someone says &quot;you can&#039;t be racist against white people,&quot; what they really mean is &quot;white people in North America are not systemically discriminated against on the basis of race.&quot; Which I think is true, but equating that with &quot;you can&#039;t be racist against white people&quot; depends on accepting a specific definition of racism that would have been laughed at 15 years ago.<br><br>Also, the part that becomes logically incoherent is when people arguing about how whites don&#039;t experience racism start saying that &quot;I&quot; can&#039;t be racist against white people. At that point I think they&#039;ve given up the game they were playing about systemic racism because system discrimination isn&#039;t something that &quot;they&quot; can do on their own anyway.

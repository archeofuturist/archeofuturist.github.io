Americans can only be nationalists. Their national ethos is worship of the self, and Trump is a fine specimen of that ethos. Go ahead and ruin your neighbor&#039;s day, his well-being is not important. He takes revenge? Sue the fucker, you&#039;ll win if you can afford a Jew. Being a selfish thug is what it means to be American and before the end, a global order will form for the sole purpose of aborting the USA from the global market and boycott them forever.","filename":"1356033950991","ext":".jpg","w":681,"h":590,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1493404056154,"time":1493404056,"md5":"6n3oOU7b44seJLJfVMKO2g==","fsize":77699,"resto":123220237,"id":"jbeJ022k","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123225941,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:28:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123224635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123224635<\/a><br>Just respond to even one point I make instead of moving the goalposts to &quot;outing me&quot; as something you can dismiss without thinking about.<br><br>Faggot.","time":1493404088,"resto":123220237,"id":"w4I6jR9q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123225990,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:28:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123220237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123220237<\/a><br>he&#039;s just a jew","time":1493404109,"resto":123220237,"id":"EvLZP\/DF","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":123226003,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:28:36","name":"Anonymous","filename":"DEXATI20170428121812","ext":".png","w":719,"h":719,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493404116344,"time":1493404116,"md5":"duNCROgMH\/VGC2AtMVfc0g==","fsize":512587,"resto":123220237,"id":"e+kcWsGj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123226057,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:29:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123220368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123220368<\/a><br>Instead of the non-committal magic middle, he&#039;s everything at once so he is guaranteed to be right?","time":1493404140,"resto":123220237,"id":"mDqcxAJZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123226064,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:29:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123225735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123225735<\/a><br>Oh boy more justifications.<br><br>From Trump&#039;s speech at the RNC:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo.&quot;<\/span><br><br>From another speech:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cWe will no longer surrender this country or its people to the false song of globalism,\u201d<\/span><br><br>From a tweet:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hillary says things can&#039;t change.

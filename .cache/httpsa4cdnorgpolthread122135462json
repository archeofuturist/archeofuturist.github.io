US Treasury bonds were hard to come by, so most people used railroad bonds as they were redeemable nationwide.

But it was all just empty prairie holding the whole thing together. So there was a massive push to try and monetize all that land before the whole ponzi scheme came undone. Leading to mega farms, which crashed the global grain market in the 1873. Value of grain plummeted, the London Banks lost their shirts, and so on. <br><br>As a result, the US Government introduced the first banking regulations as well as shut down global trade with protectionist tariffs. It also created the movement to centralize the banks and put an end to the free fall, directly contributing to the creation of the Federal Reserve 40 years later, following another crash in 1907 that occurred for much the same reason.","time":1492791156,"resto":122135462,"id":"vcLbpGw+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122152285,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)12:16:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122151405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122151405<\/a><br><br>If you broke land laws in the west it was not long before the US Cavalry, Marshal&#039;s or a posse drummed up by the Territorial governor showed up.","time":1492791363,"resto":122135462,"id":"vcLbpGw+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122152443,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)12:17:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122138318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122138318<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;freedom is retarded just give the state absolute control<\/span><br><br>Whats stopping a statist doing the very same thing pictured in OP?

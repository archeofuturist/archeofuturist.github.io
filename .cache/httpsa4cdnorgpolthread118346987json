Considering China and Japan are border buddies China would shit on Japan, Russia would probably aid China, we have world War 3 going with China and Russia fighting EU and USA, North Korea would release holds and invade south Korea, USA would have troops on the ground within a day or so but north Korea could royally fuck south Korea by then, Russia and China sends troops to aid north Korea while USA sends troops to South Korea and EU and china sends troops to Japan. This entire time we are still dealing with ISIS and shit and they probably either side with russia for guns or send bombers absolutely everywhere, either way we have crazy Muslims everywhere, USA probably calls a draft, but it takes six months to a year to train a soldier, meanwhile USA and south Korea can probably hold south Korea but they are going to lose some ground, Russian troops combined with North Korean fortress makes it hard to push back, but we can probably get the citizens to help if we feed them, but with China pouring in troops shit is going down. I have no idea what goes past there but it&#039;s a shit storm and I&#039;m pretty sure the jap-usa-eu forces would win","time":1490524427,"resto":118346987,"id":"9k4+LxpS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118348399,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)06:34:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118346987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118346987<\/a><br>Both of those are US controlled. it would be American army vs. American army.","time":1490524486,"resto":118346987,"id":"CZhtAuPE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118348471,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)06:35:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"Wait a sec are we talking north or south Korea, I assumed north","time":1490524555,"resto":118346987,"id":"9k4+LxpS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118348501,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)06:36:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118346987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118346987<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Who would win a total war between Japan and Worst Korea?<\/span><br>The jews","time":1490524580,"resto":118346987,"id":"uUS2IUJp","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":118348562,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)06:37:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118348471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118348471<\/a><br>jesus christ. maybe try looking at OP&#039;s picture","time":1490524629,"resto":118346987,"id":"hbVzMYtA","country":"KR","country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":118348577,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)06:37:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118348471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118348471<\/a><br>We are talking about South Korea.<br>North Korea doesn&#039;t even have enough food to feed its own soldiers.","time":1490524647,"resto":118346987,"id":"tM4PIoqL","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118348678,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)06:38:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118348501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118348501<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Jews<\/span><br>You mean the Asian Jews, China.","filename":"American and Chinese presidents","ext":".png","w":1022,"h":847,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":103,"tim":1490524727967,"time":1490524727,"md5":"55IpBtqVR3JMEMk7TXBSEw==","fsize":680496,"resto":118346987,"id":"tM4PIoqL","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118348819,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)06:40:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118348678\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118348678<\/a><br>This photo is about 8 years out of date","time":1490524854,"resto":118346987,"id":"FQqcdt6P","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118349156,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)06:45:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118348819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118348819<\/a><br>I don&#039;t think the establishment really changed in the West.<br>We are full of sissy lawyers or &quot;economists&quot;.","time":1490525159,"resto":118346987,"id":"tM4PIoqL","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118349699,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)06:53:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118346987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118346987<\/a><br>Best Korea nukes Japan, war over.","time":1490525631,"resto":118346987,"id":"McLnObpM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

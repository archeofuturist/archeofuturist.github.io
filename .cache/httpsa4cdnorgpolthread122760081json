Of course for his troubles working abroad he was paid in some sort of different money where he could shop in special stores. So he bought some stuff not available for mere soviet mortals: double deck sharp music center that played audio cassettes, VCR that played VHS, etc..","time":1493142737,"resto":122760081,"id":"POU5gwQr","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":122762411,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:55:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"Feels pretty ok to me","time":1493142945,"resto":122760081,"id":"N+L7dsmb","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122763526,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)14:05:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122762411\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122762411<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be sven<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;live in Swedistan<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wake up to mum getting fucked by refugee<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;see dad watching<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;justanormalday.jpg<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;more refugees come in<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they&#039;re darker than usual<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;murder everyone except me with machetes<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but it&#039;s ok because that&#039;s just their culture<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;get kidnapped<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;get drugged and raped in car<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;feelsgoodman.jpg<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;smuggled and raped all the way to Congo<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;paradise<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be sven living in Congo for several months now reaping the fruits of culture at its source<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;get on 4chan with the only computer made accessible by having a nigger orgy with the ruling party<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;get bloody boipucci from all the BBCs<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but it was worth getting on the computer<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;activate proxy because nigger mindset<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wait 32 minutes for 4chan to load<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;see this thread<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;start typing &quot;Feels pretty ok to me&quot;<\/span>","filename":"1488258853168","ext":".jpg","w":330,"h":319,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1493143513869,"time":1493143513,"md5":"VAhuhkpVXxy3pbvwainA9A==","fsize":43779,"resto":122760081,"id":"s4cToCkX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122764068,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)14:09:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122763526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122763526<\/a><br>kek<br><br>Include me in the screencap","filename":"1489746844442","ext":".jpg","w":125,"h":150,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493143787191,"time":1493143787,"md5":"M9NRVTKTAvLXv5P+vu4DFg==","fsize":9159,"resto":122760081,"id":"YHfj\/bWp","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122764896,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)14:16:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s pretty good actually, certainly not as bad as the media makes it out to be.

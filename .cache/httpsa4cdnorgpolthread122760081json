Are there good jobs, safety, access to food and clean water? Do you receive any UN aid? What it&#039;s like to study at college there? Tell anything about everyday life in Kinshasa or somewhere else.","filename":"democratic_republic_of_the_congo_flag_map","ext":".png","w":2048,"h":2019,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":246,"tim":1493141774378,"time":1493141774,"md5":"TS\/dwlI1elrIVRI32IKkmg==","fsize":46848,"resto":0,"id":"Vcr79Ioa","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-does-it-feel-to-live-in-democratic-republic","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122762028,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:52:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122760081\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122760081<\/a><br>I remember when I was a kid in the school in the soviet lithuania all the way back in the 80s one of the parents of one of the kids was sent to Brazzaville to &quot;teach&quot; something.

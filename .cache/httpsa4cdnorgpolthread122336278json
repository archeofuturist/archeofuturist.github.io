It was better than South Africa. Rhodes was a cunt. Ian Smith was a modern hero. It was a literal utopia which the kikes and then, Americans destroyed. What you see in the world today are the fruits that the globalists will continue to reap. And the fuckers that kvetched about it all, fled to western nations excluding South Africa. My heart weeps for this country, as well as Rhodesia... Still today you will befriend black Zimbabweans who will guard you with their lives based on their knowledge of before and after. Many people don&#039;t understand Rhodesia. It was like Afghanistan\/Iraq for white people. We were fighting a communist threat and the Americans were backing us, they did a full 180 and the global community turned on both nations. Then SA turned the Rho. and it was disgusting. The afterthought is what we have today. A quasi communist society in South Africa and a fucking joke of Zimbabwe. <br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/wLIhJOY8Ld0?t=1h24<wbr>m23s<br><br>Welcome to the new world order and Agenda21 + all the DLC you could imagine.","time":1492900469,"resto":122336278,"id":"Z+xCijOR","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":122338647,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)18:38:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122336278\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122336278<\/a><br>Skip to 1:24:23 if the link doesn&#039;t work. <br>Also bumping.

My heart weeps for this country, as well as Rhodesia... Still today you will befriend black Zimbabweans who will guard you with their lives based on their knowledge of before and after. Many people don&#039;t understand Rhodesia. It was like Afghanistan\/Iraq for white people. We were fighting a communist threat and the Americans were backing us, they did a full 180 and the global community turned on both nations. Then SA turned the Rho. and it was disgusting.

I make my living as a successful comedian. My political journey began as a Libertarian, but I became disillusioned after many Libertarian white women did not immediately pursue interracial relationships despite the sexual market clearly indicating the superiority of such a choice. I was drawn to Fascism because I believe it to be the only system capable of implementing the Cuckold State and ensuring all white daughters experience superior BBC.<br><br>My ideology is centered around the idea of The Interracial Breeding Grounds. White women will be forbidden from fraternizing with white men and be made exclusively available for superior black seed. This will be accomplished through the coercion of an authoritarian Fascist government. At this point it should be obvious that such a system is only sustainable for a single generation. Because of this it might be necessary to permit white men and women to reproduce in a controlled way, such as via artificial insemination, in order to reliably procure a steady stream of white women to ensure the eternal existence of The Interracial Breeding Grounds. Alternatively the white race is uniquely evil as evidenced by its history so perhaps the greatest cuck of all would be its ultimate annihilation through BBC. It is these questions and more that I hope to answer by furthering my education on this forum.<br><br>For obvious reasons I&#039;m a strong advocate for open borders and immigration, especially of black and arab men, to white countries.<br><br>I look forward to having fruitful discourse with likeminded individuals on this forum and learning more about Politics.","time":1492903266,"resto":122336278,"id":"lyoz1oq0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122344987,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)19:27:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122343586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122343586<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thank you for the commiserations but if you want to help us.

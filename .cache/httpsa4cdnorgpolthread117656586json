Second, tried making this thread a while ago but only a couple replies. Just got done doing a shit so thought I&#039;d try again:<br><br>I am disgusted by Pope Muhammad Al-Francis and left the Church over a year ago. Orthodoxy and Protestantism don&#039;t cut it, as both agree with accepting refugees like Catholicism. I consider that a moral non-starter, even though Orthodoxy doesn&#039;t speak of it much.<br><br>SSPX addresses Church unity, the abuses of Vatican II, the horrors of the current papacy, and takes a nationalistic stance on immigration\/refugees insofar as it follows older teachings that immigration can be rejected if it harms the common good of a nation (interpretation of this is left up to individuals).<br><br>I&#039;ve been reading Fisheaters.com\/forums, and Trad Catholics seem more redpilled than half of this board. I guess I just want to know if any fellow followers of Christ have walked this path and can provide some guidance. I want to be part of the true Church and worship Christ.<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socie<wbr>ty_of_Saint_Pius_X","filename":"Just Trust Me","ext":".png","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490122774554,"time":1490122774,"md5":"feLjTDiYHKtxq3hH4fKtYA==","fsize":289268,"resto":0,"id":"VQimIeLF","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpilled-roman-catholicism-via-sspx","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

No rage like I\u2019ve felt before. No desperate urge to get out there and scream at the idiots who refused to see this coming.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not even a nod for the glib idiots who say this will not defeat us, that we will never be broken, that cowardice and terror will not get the better of Britain.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Because, as loyal as I am, as patriotic as I am, as much as my whole younger life was about joining the British military and fighting for my country \u2014 I fear we are broken.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But because this is us now. This is our country now. This is what we have become. To this, we have been reduced.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Please, no hashtag, no vigil, no tea lights. I am begging you not to light up Parliament in the colours of the Union.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Because we are not united. We are wrenched asunder. The patriots of the rest of England versus the liberals in this city. The endless tolerance to those who harm us, (while the Home Office tries to shift the focus of public fear to white terror) \u2014 versus the millions like me who face the truth, with worried families and hopeless hearts, who feel the country sinking.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We are taken under the cold water by this heavy right foot in the south, a city of lead, so desperately wedded to the multicultural illusion that it can only fight those who love the country the most, blame those who are most proud to be British, and shout racist at the 52%.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;London is a city so desperate to be seen as tolerant, no news of the injured was released. No clue about who was safe or not. Liberals convince themselves multiculturalism works because we all die together, too. An entire city of monkeys: see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil. Blind. Deaf. And dumb<\/span>","filename":"islam","ext":".jpg","w":636,"h":382,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1490336960702,"time":1490336960,"md5":"uf0r+qTAGXPYISBFQ7Z4mA==","fsize":90246,"resto":0,"id":"wpQqHaIL","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"welcome-to-london","country_name":"Canada","replies":6,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":118052036,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)02:30:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118051984\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118051984<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This place is just like Sweden. Terrified of admitting the truth about the threat we face, about the horrors committed by the migrants we failed to deter \u2014 because to admit that we are sinking, and fast, would be to admit that everything the liberals believe is wrong.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That multiculturalism has not worked. That it is one big fat failure and one big fat lie.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;President Erdogan of Turkey said there is a war being waged between the crescent and the cross. But he is wrong. Because the cross is not strong. We are down on bended knee, a doormat to be trodden on, a joke only funny to those that wish us harm.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The war is between London and the rest of the country. Between the liberals and the right-minded. Between those who think it is more important to tip-toe around the cultures of those who choose to join us, rather than defend our own culture.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How many more times?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And how many more attacks must pass before we acknowledge these are no longer the acts of \u2018extremists\u2019? <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That there is no safe badge with which to hold these people at arm\u2019s length, in the way the liberals casually use the term &#039;far-right&#039; for anyone who has National pride.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;These events are no longer extreme. They are commonplace. Every day occurrences.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;These people are no longer extremists. They are simply more devout. More true to their beliefs. Beliefs which will be supported endlessly across our state broadcaster for the next few months until we buy into the narrative that one religion is not to blame.<\/span>","time":1490337006,"resto":118051984,"id":"wpQqHaIL","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118052059,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)02:30:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"reply to this post or your mother will die in her sleep tonight","time":1490337021,"resto":118051984,"id":"8m5Lqi5A","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118052423,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)02:35:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118052059\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118052059<\/a><br> fuck you!","time":1490337303,"resto":118051984,"id":"wpQqHaIL","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118052544,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)02:36:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118052059\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118052059<\/a><br><br>omg","time":1490337388,"resto":118051984,"id":"LMRIlbD\/","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118052842,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)02:40:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118051984\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118051984<\/a>","filename":"13522","ext":".jpg","w":782,"h":521,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490337607852,"time":1490337607,"md5":"eMPDCoxLVEiyr5idvXyZLA==","fsize":108135,"resto":118051984,"id":"5q1I4fvA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118053227,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)02:44:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118052059\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118052059<\/a><br>Cunt<br><br>Sage","time":1490337893,"resto":118051984,"id":"hz85F\/Or","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Washington is gearing up to launch an offensive on the Islamic State&#039;s stronghold in Raqqa, a mission that could get sidetracked if Russian aircraft fly over the area. U.S. aircraft would have to take steps to avoid them, whether by changing course or aborting the mission. At worst, the Russians could also drop bombs near U.S. targets, forcing Washington to respond by shooting down Russian aircraft -- triggering a much larger flare-up between the two powers. Moscow could try to escalate conflicts elsewhere as well, including in eastern Ukraine, to try to improve its bargaining position with Washington. But this tactic may also run the risk of further souring the prospects of negotiation.<\/span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Of course, the Trump administration&#039;s quick and decisive action in Syria was also designed to send a message to observers beyond the Middle East. As the threat of North Korean nuclearization grows, the move was meant to give Beijing and Pyongyang pause. The White House has already threatened to take unilateral action against North Korea, and the recent attack in Syria gives a glimpse of just how it intends to build up a credible military threat to Pyongyang.<\/span><br><br>t.

Though Washington notified Moscow prior to the attack in order to avoid drawing the Russians into the clash, the Kremlin will use the heightened risk of U.S.-Russia entanglements on the battlefield to try to bring the White House back to the negotiating table. Nevertheless, the current geopolitical climate is hardly conducive to a bargain between the two. In fact, at least in the short term, U.S. President Donald Trump&#039;s administration has an incentive to adopt a harder stance toward Russia in hopes of deflecting the political pressure stemming from an ongoing probe into the Trump team&#039;s ties to Moscow.<\/span>","time":1491695847,"resto":120203654,"id":"XlcvSYw8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120204518,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:58:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120204256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120204256<\/a><br>Show me one, a single one, regime change you fuckers did right.","filename":"1491573321509","ext":".gif","w":200,"h":293,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491695918758,"time":1491695918,"md5":"ktsBgNU3CCTIo9lKMZyHfQ==","fsize":1833972,"resto":120203654,"id":"e\/b6jeij","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120204523,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:58:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120204256\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120204256<\/a><br>Sorry, didn&#039;t mean to reply to you","time":1491695920,"resto":120203654,"id":"XlcvSYw8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120204658,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:59:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120204369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120204369<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Your Chancellor came out in support of us fuccboi<\/span>","filename":"merkel klatschen","ext":".jpg","w":630,"h":472,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491695991917,"time":1491695991,"md5":"zmiRTblV02X8JRqDUrL3sw==","fsize":36778,"resto":120203654,"id":"e\/b6jeij","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120204666,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)19:59:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120204518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120204518<\/a><br>Shitty north korean terrorists are less threatening than less violent north korea with nukes","time":1491695994,"resto":120203654,"id":"itMnNLvT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

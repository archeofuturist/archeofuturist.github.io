The biggest issue with health care is the enormous costs. The number one question people should be asking is &quot;why are the cost so high in the first place?&quot; They don&#039;t have to be, if you understand how the free market works. Do you ever notice that what ever the government gets involved in the costs keep on going up and up and the technology is stagnant? Why? Because its a racket that has zero competition. Look at things we still get in the free market like cell phones, tvs, computers etc. The technology keeps on getting greater and greater and the costs are getting lower and lower. Why? Because this is the only way companies can stay afloat when they&#039;re competing for business in a free market. Before the Government got involved in health care in the mid 60&#039;s, health insurance was cheaper than car insurance. Charity church hospitals where everywhere for the poor. Doctors were just a smidge above middle class. Now look what has happened everywhere not just the USA. Costs are through the roof, charity hospitals have closed down, and there are zero cures for anything. Its a win win for the Government and the Medical Industrial complex. The Government gets the dependency they want and the MIC get the inflated prices they want. Its all bullshit.

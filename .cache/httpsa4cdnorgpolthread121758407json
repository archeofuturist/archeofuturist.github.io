I guarantee you many young men are being redpilled by sites like reddit.","time":1492559305,"resto":121758407,"id":"Lb6TUyHc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121763875,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)19:50:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121758407\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121758407<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gen Z<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;People born after 2000<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Voting in 2016<\/span>","filename":"my disgust","ext":".jpg","w":453,"h":439,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1492559418630,"time":1492559418,"md5":"0IoUTafyPCJg\/26nCdjBFg==","fsize":60609,"resto":121758407,"id":"ueBSyu92","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":121763901,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)19:50:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121762507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121762507<\/a><br>Its okay OP I know we&#039;re fucked, just thought some banter would be nice while looking at such depressing numbers","filename":"Infographic-Gen-Z-Political-Stance-c-2016-The-Center-for-Generational-Kinetics","ext":".jpg","w":4000,"h":4870,"tn_w":102,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492559423092,"time":1492559423,"md5":"DxnGHZtXGVeDfhvQ\/+hcJQ==","fsize":2657456,"resto":121758407,"id":"kgBoScro","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121763990,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)19:51:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121761320\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121761320<\/a><br>You presented facts to argue a point noone made.

Fascism is not racist or anti-Semitic, while Nazism undoubtedly was. Sir Oswald Mosley stated in his writings and speeches that races are different and should be preserved, but he was opposed to the persecution of other races. Mosley opposed the mass immigration of Africans, Asians and Jews into Britain, but he did not hate them. The British Union of Fascists had Jewish members, and Mosley&#039;s post-war Union Movement formed an associate organisation composed of ethnic minorities who supported his policies. The rival &#039;Imperial Fascist League&#039;, led by Arnold Leese, was racist and anti-Semitic, and he attacked Mosley as an alleged &#039;kosher fascist&#039;, falsely claiming that Mosley&#039;s first wife was a &#039;Jewess&#039;. Leese&#039;s IFL ditched the Fasces symbol of Fascism and adopted the Swastika, which the Nazis had copied from the Hindus, and other ancient civilisations. The BUF did briefly change its name to the British Union of Fascists and National Socialists in 1936, but afterwards became known as British Union, after William Joyce was expelled and formed his own tiny party, the National Socialist League. Joyce was hanged for treason after the war, for broadcasting on the radio service of Nazi Germany, and was known as &#039;Lord Haw-Haw&#039; for mocking Britain&#039;s resistance to invasion. Mussolini&#039;s Italian National Fascist Party (PNF) had Jewish members and was not originally racist or anti-Semitic, but in 1938, the Duce regrettably adopted racist laws under the influence of Nazi Germany. The British Union never made the same mistake.","time":1490354727,"resto":118051151,"id":"ecWagjmj","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118071126,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)07:25:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118056040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118056040<\/a><br>I have seen all these and man he is smart.","time":1490354754,"resto":118051151,"id":"CrVJFf3D","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118071225,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)07:27:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"OP here.

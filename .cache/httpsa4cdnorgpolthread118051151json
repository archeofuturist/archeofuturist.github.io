Would be interesting to see how the world would have turned out if he would have become Prime Minister. I suspect England would have never declared war on Germany and neither would have France.<br><br>He&#039;s well spoken, well educated and fought an extraordinarily similar battle in the streets of England to what Hitler and his SA did in Germany. The power of England under his control would have probably created a renaissance that would have surpassed the rest of the world.<br><br>There&#039;s something eerie about watching his old interviews he had years after the war ended and he could more openly talk to the public. Like watching a man who was existing in the wrong timeline. He deserved much more respect than he was given in his life and jeered and treated as a joke when he has always fought for what is best for England and his people. <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HNh<wbr>F28fzN9I","time":1490340231,"resto":118051151,"id":"2C5IqZ7m","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118056232,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)03:26:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118056040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118056040<\/a><br>Comepletely agree.

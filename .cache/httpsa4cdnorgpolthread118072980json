We would have to buy goods (food, milk, bread, veggies, meat, everything) at higher prices, after the government seized the farms and collectivized them, to help the government with its revenue problem. The problem is that the collectivization period will last for 15-20 years, meaning there will be enormous shortages of all of that food for that period. But it doesn&#039;t matter; we&#039;re all equal in our suffering. <br><br>Attacking the Comrade-General Secretary is tantamount to treason, because everyone knows how much he cares about us, how little he cares for the big bankers and the top ten percent of the one percent. He is always fighting for us. But, of course, a man of his stature and age needs some time off. Those three houses are used for him to recoup, so that he can come back after his brief breaks ready to fight the greedy rich and continue the revolution. The rich need to pay their fair share, after all.","filename":"bernie","ext":".png","w":1024,"h":512,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1490356692667,"time":1490356692,"md5":"jf1JnZnYmLFP3j+uAFEnZQ==","fsize":148359,"resto":118072980,"id":"GJD0XST7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118074153,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)08:09:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118072980\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118072980<\/a><br><br>Massive poverty, and breadline.

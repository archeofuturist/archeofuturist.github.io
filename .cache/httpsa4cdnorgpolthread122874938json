I mean, the problem is two fold: Why would someone want to advertise with you, and if someone would want to advertise with you, why not just buy ads on youtube?<br><br>You have to look at it as an opportunity cost. Youtube advertisement is actually really good, it&#039;s very well targeted and I&#039;ve heard that it doesn&#039;t cost the advertisers as much money if the viewer doesn&#039;t watch the whole ad so they save money on fans that aren&#039;t engaged and can maximize their budgets.<br><br>Especially with ads costing so low right now, why would an advertiser want to pay some youtube sheckler more money for what they could already get now with less money? <br><br>The only answer is if they could pay for influencer marketing, which is something you&#039;ll probably see.

This is probably because Coke and Pepsi don&#039;t want some liberal cunt breathing down their necks, the jew has tainted conservative news so much that they&#039;ve convinced Coke that it&#039;s a bad idea to support conservative news.

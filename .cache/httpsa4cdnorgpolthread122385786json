It&#039;s a system which has properties that make it often converge into two parties and that works because of the electoral system where seats are won individually by a candidate for an area, as opposed to some electoral systems in europe where seats are divided up by the total number of votes a party gets overall.<br><br>The UK and Australia have similar electoral systems and effectively have a two party system, but the greater number of seats per state in Australia (12 from each state as opposed to Americas 2) means that it is much more likely that smaller parties or independents will win them. Our politics is still dominated by two parties though.<br><br><br>The only countries that really have two parties are authoritarian states which have fully controlled oppositions.","time":1492927661,"resto":122385786,"id":"7juvWhgX","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122389545,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)02:13:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"All the two party system does is keep the kikes in power","time":1492928010,"resto":122385786,"id":"OPA0y6TE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122390483,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)02:23:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122388880\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122388880<\/a><br>I guess we need more explanation like this. <br><br>Either way, through the forming of cartels every country devolves into a 2-party system.","time":1492928632,"resto":122385786,"id":"R9LK9vbP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

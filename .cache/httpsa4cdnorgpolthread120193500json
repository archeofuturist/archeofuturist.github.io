In a free market with free banking and a naturally DEFLATIONARY currency. As production and automation increases, prices for capital and consumer goods fall. People would need to work less hours to get the money they need to have a comfortable life. Many more people would be working part time, like 2-3 days a week which would only open up slots for more people to work. Also people would be retiring much eariler which also decreases unemployment. As the price of capital goods falls it creates a massive high paying service sector industry that will create countless jobs. There would be no unemployment. Leftists whine that manufacturing jobs will disappear, SO WHAT?

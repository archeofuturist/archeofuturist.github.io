The problem is that we live in a culture that pushes kids to go to college even when they don&#039;t have the means to do so which leads into the higher debt you&#039;re describing. Now before you go &quot;SEE THAT&#039;s WHAT I MEANT&quot; I would you like you to keep this in mind. In America you don&#039;t need a 4 year degree to make a middle class wage. I said before that there are trades that people can go into that would pay them better and I said that you can lessen the cost of college by starting out a 2 year school. changing the culture on culture is the best way to solve the &quot;college debt&quot; situation.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;go redpill yourself<\/span><br>that film is retarded.","filename":"1493118081307","ext":".jpg","w":578,"h":589,"tn_w":122,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493317768313,"time":1493317768,"md5":"8+xfPhIRHMi0fKiI0VrLPA==","fsize":73099,"resto":123052459,"id":"zxp3tC0v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123067834,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)14:30:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123066349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123066349<\/a><br>I said that each previous decade was more prosperous than the present and postwar boom can only explain prosperity in 50s and 60s.

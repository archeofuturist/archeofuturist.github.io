Conditions were terrible, and disease was rampant to the point where spitting was illegal. There was no food or water anywhere.<br>Then my wife took me to some museum built off the remains of a long gone private school for the talented and gifted. All of the students had found their way to a secret crevace and hung themselves, those bodies were left hanging as a display when the museum was opened. <br>So I walked around the museum a bit with my wife, bumping into a cold hanging corpse or two now and then, when some gang of migrants started killing dudes. A team of based stick men come to deal with it. When I tried to get a peak, they told me to fuck off. I try again and they slip a zip tie on my wrists and put me against a wall and told me to wait to be questioned.<br>I met this Cheech looking motherfucker on the wall and we agreed to slip out. We found this neat hole in the wall to hide in to slip the ties. There were like 5 hanged kids in the space, so apparently they took every opportunity possible to kill themselves, but whatever. We got out, back on the broken streets of what used to be France. <br><br>Guys, I&#039;m scared. Is this just a dream, or is this an omen? Is pol gonna be right again? Should I kill myself?","filename":"1491294501596693056955","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491294579986,"time":1491294579,"md5":"YT4CzsdPJ1veR6sLRIN4fA==","fsize":528432,"resto":0,"id":"\/XzYtGnC","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"guys-im-scared","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

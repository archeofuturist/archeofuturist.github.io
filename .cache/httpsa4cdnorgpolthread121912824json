it.<br><br>Why would it do this? Because \u2014 the theory goes \u2014 one of its objectives would be to prevent existential risk \u2014 but it could do that most effectively not merely by preventing existential risk in its present, but by also &quot;reaching back&quot; into its past to punish people who weren&#039;t MIRI-style effective altruists.<br><br>Thus this is not necessarily a straightforward &quot;serve the AI or you will go to hell&quot; \u2014 the AI and the person punished need have no causal interaction, and the punished individual may have died decades or centuries earlier. Instead, the AI could punish a simulation of the person, which it would construct by deduction from first principles. However, to do this accurately would require it be able to gather an incredible amount of data, which would no longer exist, and could not be reconstructed without reversing entropy.<br><br>Technically, the punishment is only theorised to be applied to those who knew the importance of the task in advance but did not help sufficiently. In this respect, merely knowing about the Basilisk \u2014 e.g., reading this article \u2014 opens you up to hypothetical punishment from the hypothetical superintelligence.<br><br>Note that the AI in this setting is (in the utilitarian logic of this theory) not a malicious or evil superintelligence (AM, HAL, SHODAN, Ultron, the Master Control Program, SkyNet, GLaDOS) \u2014 but the Friendly one we get if everything goes right and humans don&#039;t create a bad one. This is because every day the AI doesn&#039;t exist, people die that it could have saved; so punishing you or your future simulation is a moral imperative, to make it more likely you will contribute in the present and help it happen as soon as possible.","time":1492650356,"resto":121912824,"id":"EfvyNJeq","country":"ZA","country_name":"South

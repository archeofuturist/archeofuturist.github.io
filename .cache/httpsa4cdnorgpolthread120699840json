Time is not metric. There&#039;s no point in converting &quot;almost&quot; all your units to round numbers when one very important one isn&#039;t. Imperial works better with time. What is the typical highway speed in Canada? Approximately 100km\/h. But 60 doesn&#039;t evenly divide 100, so 100km\/h is 1 and 2\/3rds of a kilometer per minute. Now what is the typical highway speed in the US? Approximately 60 mph, a mile a minute. When a highway exit sign says your exit is approaching in 2 kilometers, it&#039;s not immediately clear how many minutes away it is (1 minute, 20 seconds). On the other hand, if a highway exit sign says your exit is approaching in 1 and 1\/4 of a mile, it&#039;s immediately obvious that it&#039;s coming up in 1 and 1\/4 of a minute. Easy conversion that doesn&#039;t require any thought.<br><br>2. Humans don&#039;t perceive changes in orders of magnitude. According to the metric system, all humans are roughly 1 meter tall (rounded to the nearest order of magnitude), or roughly 2 meters tall (rounded to the nearest meter). But clearly we see differences in peoples&#039; heights. That&#039;s why we measure in feet and inches, it makes more natural sense. You can visually see the difference between 5 and 6 feet. But if you measure that in meters it&#039;s 1.5 and 1.8 meters. Before you say &quot;b-b-but centimeters!&quot; remember that centimeter is not an SI unit. In meters both people are approximately 2 meters tall, even though there&#039;s a clear visual difference in their height.","time":1491975480,"resto":120699840,"id":"GqdZ1Uin","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

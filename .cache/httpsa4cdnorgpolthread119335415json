To many, this may be too long to read, as your attention span may have already lingered off in another direction. I&#039;ll try to keep these points precise and numbered, with a quick rundown on the topics at hand.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 1) Each generation from baby boomers &amp; up is being bombarded with sexualization.<\/span><br>- From social media to magazines to TV to video games to erotic literature, etc., sex has been proven time &amp; time again to be the #1 interest in matured or maturing human beings. <br>- Every day, we are exposed to some form of sexuality. Whether it be browsing the internet &amp; coming across suggesting pictures or even nude pictures, or even going outside and seeing how slutty women dress.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 2) With the decline of religion (mostly Christianity) in the west, sex has become easier to normalize in society.<\/span><br>- Social media apps such as tinder &amp; even apps like instagram\/snapchat\/etc. promote narcissism in women and the steadily available option to have easy casual sex. <br>- Because society is bombarded with sexual content every day, these social media platforms allow society to give into their degenerate desires.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 3) Contraceptives allow for this moral degeneracy to occur without requiring any social responsibility to procreate<\/span><br>- The contraceptive (condoms, birth control pills, plan B) industry thrives off of over sexualization and social media to exist. Without these 2 factors, contraceptives would not be as profitable.<br>- Contraceptives promote the idea of casual sex by ensuring that the risk of having a baby is significantly lowered, as well as the risk of receiving STIs from sexual encounters.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 4) Sexual Intercourse is losing\/has lost it&#039;s meaning of procreation between 2 consenting human beings who truly love each other<\/span><br>- The more that porn &amp; casual sex is normalized, the less emotional sexual intercourse becomes","filename":"eJwNwtsNwyAMAMBdGACbN842iCCSKqkRuF9Rd29P96jPvNSmDpGxNoD9XJXnrpfwLL3pztyvVsa5dOUbikipx93essAmcsGnkDEYsv8IlpB8NBkpuBgpegvGZ2fIJcKcnH6Nrr4_v_wihw","ext":".jpg","w":410,"h":614,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491230710399,"time":1491230710,"md5":"lyGvqjF05e26eUtJEMcWJQ==","fsize":52329,"resto":0,"id":"HVdBStZv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sexual-degeneracy","country_name":"United States","replies":267,"images":41,"unique_ips":128,"tail_size":50},{"no":119335474,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)10:45:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119335415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119335415<\/a><br>What&#039;s the solution?","time":1491230744,"resto":119335415,"id":"JLd0eg7i","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119335477,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)10:45:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; 4) Continuing on:<\/span><br>- Sex has become a means of selfish pleasure for the individual instead of a unifying intimate bond between two people to encourage the prolonging of the human race.<br>- Women will post suggestive pictures on social media to show off their fertility to get compliments as a mean of narcissistic self-validation. This behavior is very common especially with over sexualization and social media platforms that open their arms to this behavior.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 5) Porn\/Sexualization is used as a weapon to control the masses<\/span><br>- This is the final point I am going to make about sexual degeneracy. (And it happens to be the most essential\/important redpill any man can swallow)<br>- Israeli Forces broadcasted pornography in Palestine while it&#039;s residents were confined to their homes. This was used as an alternative to broadcasting world news, which could anger the masses. Instead of removing all forms of entertainment, they chose to keep TVs within households and broadcast pornography on them. This caused the Palestinians to feel complacent with their current state, and therefore snuffed the potential flame of rebellion. <br>- He who controls the flow of porn, controls the willpower of the human race. Porn is a very powerful tool that has the possibility to become just as addictive as heroin, as the orgasm has very similar effects to the drug in terms of dopamine &amp; serotonin release. <br>- With the rise of sexualization, women become far more disloyal and give into degeneracy easier, which leads to interracial sex with men who tend to have larger penis size (Africans)<br>- With promiscuity on the rise, birth rates begin to decline between people of the same race &amp; begin to rise between people of the opposite race. This is a tool by the globalist elite to cause a multicultural society driven solely by sexual desire as a form of motivation.","filename":"1491185091776","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":1796,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491230745159,"time":1491230745,"md5":"vzx0F2TQ1Nr7pBEEjQx8kA==","fsize":608433,"resto":119335415,"id":"HVdBStZv","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119335589,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)10:46:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119335474\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119335474<\/a><br><br>&quot;Belief in God and holding off on one&#039;s desires, being in a committed relationship.

German scientists recently revealed in a study the more often men between the ages of 21 and 45 used pornography, the less gray matter they had inside their heads. The connections between the brain\u2019s striatum and the PFC, which also controls impulse, social control, suppresses emotions, and controls sexual urges, are worsened the more a person watches pornography.

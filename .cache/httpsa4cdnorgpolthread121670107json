A common passion or interest will, in almost every case, be felt by a majority of the whole; a communication and concert result from the form of government itself; and there is nothing to check the inducements to sacrifice the weaker party or an obnoxious individual. Hence it is that such democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention; have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property; and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths. Theoretic politicians, who have patronized this species of government, have erroneously supposed that by reducing mankind to a perfect equality in their political rights, they would, at the same time, be perfectly equalized and assimilated in their possessions, their opinions, and their passions.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thomas Sowell<\/span><br>Socialism in general has a record of failure so blatant that only an intellectual could ignore or evade it.","filename":"feds","ext":".jpg","w":285,"h":284,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492513006457,"time":1492513006,"md5":"mEe0PVQ\/zF82\/NexHkIlJw==","fsize":26288,"resto":0,"id":"3tj0M2Yf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"read-the-federalist-papers-nigger","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":121670285,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)06:58:35","name":"Anonymous","filename":"hrmm","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492513115070,"time":1492513115,"md5":"ryGCM3ht1y9uwz0DpzWLXg==","fsize":140720,"resto":121670107,"id":"3tj0M2Yf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

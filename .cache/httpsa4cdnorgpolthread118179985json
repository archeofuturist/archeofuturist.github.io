Two of the agents infiltrated via Romania in the North by either a glider or parachute (both accounts are floating around). Their mission as we know it was to rendezvous with three other DGSE agents who flew into the country using fake passports via Sofia International Airport. That\u2019s about as far as they got.<br><br>Enter the Tsonev brothers; Slavi and Vasko. The brothers stumbled upon the French intelligence operatives in the middle of the night. Thinking them for thieves out to steal their crops, the two brothers took off and returned with a third man, a retired police officer. The brothers, armed with two wooden boards, and the officer with a 1950s Makarov pistol, surprised the agents and surrounded their vehicle. In the end two French agents were shot (one in the foot and the other in the leg) and a third suffered a broken nose. The remaining two managed to escape on foot under the cover of darkness. The unharmed villagers confiscated computers, diving equipment, professional cameras, and even a parachute in the vehicle. After receiving medical treatment and a follow on interrogation by police, the three agents were immediately whisked away on a special flight back to Paris courtesy of the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cTeam Leader: Well, Pierre and Jacques were shot in the leg by an old guy with a Makarov, and Francois took a two-by-four to the face. Michel and myself ran away into the woods. And all of our equipment was stolen by two farmers.\u201d<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pic relate the 2 brothers<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;J U S T<\/span><br><br><br>Redpill me on the french army","filename":"91a0431a7dfefa1d38bf81ac3fe1eb2dc3973a36ff6461ae657282ae3bf22b29","ext":".gif","w":748,"h":554,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":185,"tim":1490412874427,"time":1490412874,"md5":"YkzNxULu7sZgU6FIBVb1Ng==","fsize":203489,"resto":0,"id":"UF8XWMUZ","country":"BG","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bulgarian-peasants-take-down-french-intelligence","country_name":"Bulgaria","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118182433,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)23:59:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118179985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118179985<\/a><br>bump","time":1490414396,"resto":118179985,"id":"VJ+RrYAF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118183872,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:13:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118179985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118179985<\/a><br>Bump for interest","time":1490415211,"resto":118179985,"id":"2BHSPKmZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

The biggest difference between Marx and the other socialists such as Proudhon, Owen or Blanqui is shift from more liberal &quot;right to&quot; philosophy to a materialist outlook that the means of production ought to be seized violently. So I dare say Marxism and left anarchism are compatible with Stirner.","time":1492497744,"resto":121646717,"id":"7HonWGkt","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

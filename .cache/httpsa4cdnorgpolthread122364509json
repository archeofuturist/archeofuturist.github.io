Every year afer the first rain, the Newport Beach Wine Society (of which I am a member) gathers at my mansion to watch the island&#039;s natives grovel in the mud as their pathetic straw dwellings are ripped apart by the rising waters. On this island there is also a fish, called a Piranha Giganticus. Coinciding with the first rain, this fish swims into the flooded island and begins to feed on the older and weaker natives of Malderiki. Unable to defend themselves from the killer fish and uttrly helpless, the natives make their way to my mansion in makeshift canoes. At this point, the Newport Beach Wine Society opens a bottle of pre-revolution French Chardonnay, dated no later than 1760, and places wagers on which native will be the first to reach the high ground of my sprawling lawn. Once the fish has fed and returned to the Sea, there are typically a handful of natives left on my lawn, at which point we activate the electric fence and release the crocodiles. Last year, during the crocodile feeding, a tiny speck of native flesh was flung from the lawn up to the balcony where the Newport Beach Wine Society was gathered and landed on my shoe. I retrieved the piece of flesh and placed it in my mouth, washing it down with a glass of Moldovan Pino Griggio.

This is very unlikely. First of all, Congress has repeatedly enacted Homeland Security appropriations bills that instructed the president to \u201cprioritize the identification and removal of aliens convicted of a crime by the severity of that crime.\u201d Second, while it is possible that Trump could ignore this, he has stated that he will indeed continue to prioritize criminals (one Trump advisor has suggested that immigrants arrested for, but not yet convicted of, serious offenses would also be prioritized). Third, Trump\u2019s vague promise to \u201cwork something out\u201d implies at least some unwillingness to go out of his way to deport Dreamers. Fourth, Trump\u2019s unrealistic vow to deport 2 million criminals makes it unlikely he will waste precious resources on low priority, non-criminal cases. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At the other extreme, the Trump administration could continue the current priorities for removal and allow current recipients of DACA to use their EADs until they expire, while not accepting new applications or renewals. This would be the least controversial and most practical decision that would also be consistent with Trump\u2019s campaign promises. <\/span><br><br>Trump is letting DACA sunset on its own, since explicitly revoking it would be far more trouble than its worth and would require resources that he does not currently have. Don&#039;t forget that DACA is NOT a protected status.<br><br>Also, DREAMer organizations are complaining that Trump just says a lot of shit to give them false hope while DHS and ICE do things differently. I think it&#039;s pretty clear that Trump distracts while Kelly and Sessions do whatever they want.","filename":"1492800306007","ext":".png","w":1178,"h":1362,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492915831426,"time":1492915831,"md5":"GunU1N+oHDOCs756ZBflkg==","fsize":354016,"resto":122364509,"id":"uIifcIWt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122368311,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:51:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122364847\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122364847<\/a><br><br>Yes, she could look like Yael Trump","time":1492915869,"resto":122364509,"id":"Fj4jxan5","country":"MT","country_name":"Malta"},{"no":122368337,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:51:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122368113\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122368113<\/a><br>But if I were asleep how could I watch for happenings?","filename":"550747321976","ext":".jpg","w":572,"h":677,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492915884757,"time":1492915884,"md5":"mUgcvpOfGFgMDj6rvsN8HQ==","fsize":144451,"resto":122364509,"id":"QrcsjpVS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122368345,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:51:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122368133\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122368133<\/a>","filename":"1488943485222","ext":".jpg","w":699,"h":485,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1492915888135,"time":1492915888,"md5":"DtZygrhTJu7a5NnLsOneOg==","fsize":70267,"resto":122364509,"id":"htHwWKw5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122368365,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:51:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122367978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122367978<\/a><br>Gutffeld doesn&#039;t want a wall.","time":1492915896,"resto":122364509,"id":"87KrZ06m","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122368380,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:51:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122367862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122367862<\/a><br>Because I&#039;m a filthy phoneposter I can&#039;t filter","time":1492915903,"resto":122364509,"id":"Rm16dWsr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122368388,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:51:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"BAKING","time":1492915906,"resto":122364509,"id":"cUFTx\/8Z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122368391,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:51:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"joanie from happy days is dead","time":1492915907,"resto":122364509,"id":"sqxWTbT\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122368419,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:51:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122364965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122364965<\/a><br>Kat a cute.","filename":"1488685284273","ext":".jpg","w":1242,"h":1241,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492915918721,"time":1492915918,"md5":"8QnnzzHfDGyuzwaSwXUNKA==","fsize":339936,"resto":122364509,"id":"zH5\/1w+T","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122368428,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:52:05","name":"Wonderful Donald","com":"<a href=\"#p122368020\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122368020<\/a>","filename":"You Call That A Shitpost?

I understand there is laws against slander and defamation and he was about to get sued for millions, but the evidence was overwhelming and sincere, and with the way websites were censoring Pizzagate, especially on Reddit, it just draws more attention to the fact that someone wants this buried really really bad. I&#039;ve read the Podesta email transcripts and CLEARLY, he is speaking in a code, he quoted something &quot;playing dominoes on the pizza or the pasta&quot; which was quite obvious he is using normal words as a code for something else, because by itself, the statements do NOT make any sense. <br><br>It seems to me, that Alex Jones is terrified of lawsuit OR possibly even his own life at stake. If you were in Alex Jone&#039;s position, wouldn&#039;t you have just stood your ground and told the establishment to fuck off with their lawyers, isn&#039;t the truth more important than the cheap threat of losing money or even if it cost your life. If there was a shred of credibility on something, I would NOT back down from my statements. I am not sure how the statements involved that particular restaurant, but as a rational man reading those emails, I can 100% ensure you that he was speaking in code.","filename":"hqdefault","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490506961328,"time":1490506961,"md5":"AglONhAJoDqsv3EubFwRLQ==","fsize":134094,"resto":0,"id":"3E4QdOu5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"alex-jones-suddenly-backs-down","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

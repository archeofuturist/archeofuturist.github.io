Known as the \u201cLittle Taiwanese,\u201d he was the only target to slip away, and he remains a fugitive from American justice.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Seven months after the April 2013 indictment and after Interpol issued a red notice for Tokhtakhounov, he appeared near Donald Trump in the VIP section of the Miss Universe pageant in Moscow. Trump had sold the Russian rights for Miss Universe to a billionaire Russian shopping mall developer.<\/span><br>The FBI investigation did not implicate Trump. But Trump Tower was under close watch.

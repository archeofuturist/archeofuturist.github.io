Neat, isn&#039;t it? <br><br>I am finishing a more thorough analysis of this whole raid, the findings are not surprising but the methods will be an interesting read.<br><br>- Fun finding #1: #firekushner hashtag jumped straight from leftist twitter (that used to along with #firenunes, #firebannon, #impeachtrump) and on April 5 gone straight to the &quot;alt right&quot;, being pushed by some Cassandra Fairbanks (who&#039;s that?) then Richard Spencer himself along with the rest of the rest of the &quot;white nationalist&quot; Twitter movement.<br><br>Interestingly while at the same time HuffPo published an article that all but &quot;named the Jew&quot; in so many words. You can see for yourself: search twitter for the hashtag and walk back as far as you can.<br><br>The first pretext was<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; nepotism and incompetence <\/span><br><br>Then it became (when Bannon step down from NSC)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; he wants Bannon out<\/span><br><br>Then the Syrian bombing happened and it became<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Trump is a Kuschner puppet <\/span><br><br>This is just one of the findings, more will come. Interestingly it seems Bannon and Jared patched up things so Breitbart stopped adding fuel to the fire.<br><br>Will follow up on it later, with methods like pic related to prove whatever is happening, unlike raiders wanna make you believe, is not and never been normal on 4chan<br><br>All in all I have a theory that very soon we will see Richard Spencer &quot;alt right&quot; fighting at the same trench with &quot;left leaning libertarians&quot; and very very close to sjw leftists.<br><br>In this very thread there are people part of this very raid. Just pay attention to the linguistic clues.

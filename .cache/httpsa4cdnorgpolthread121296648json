I&#039;ll tell you why. It&#039;s because the Jews make up only 2% of America&#039;s population, and yet, 44% of America&#039;s 50 richest billionaires. This means that Jews are over-represented among the top 50 billionaires in the US by a factor of 22 times (2,200 percent).<br><br>Now how is this possible? The answer is simple: extreme nepotism combined with a complete lack of morals and empathy towards non-Jews.","filename":"148822672","ext":".jpg","w":1162,"h":850,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":182,"tim":1492306915656,"time":1492306915,"md5":"W6Wpx9fXcNLr2DIAUjPtzA==","fsize":288729,"resto":0,"id":"MZtmfbHD","country":"SE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"to-all-you-dimwits-who-doubt-the-jews-money","country_name":"Sweden","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121297047,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)21:44:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121296648\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121296648<\/a><br><br>Makes you think<br><br>After opening a trust company in Reno, Nev., Rothschild &amp; Co. began ushering the massive fortunes of the world\u2019s most wealthy individuals out of typical tax havens, and into the Rothschild run U.S. trusts, which are exempt from the international reporting requirements.<br><br> The Rothschild banking dynasty is a family line that has been accused of pulling the political strings of many different governments through their control of various economic systems throughout the world.<br><br> Historically, there is ample evidence to show that the family has used insider trading to bilk money from both private and public funds.<br><br> During the Battle of Waterloo in the Napoleonic wars, Nathan Rothschild was responsible for one of the oldest cases of \u201cinsider trading,\u201d which led to the Rothschild family robbing a whole nation blind. In 1815 when the battle of Waterloo took place, there were no quick methods of communication like we have today so messengers were used for communication in times of war. The Rothschild\u2019s took advantage of this by having spies on the frontlines of the battle who would return information to the family faster than the messengers used by the military.<br><br> When the British won the war, Nathan Rothschild, was of course, the first to know, and he immediately went to the stock exchange and started selling stocks while putting out the rumor that the French had won the war. This created a panic on the floor of the stock exchange and investors all over England began frantically selling their stocks. With the price of all stocks plummeting Rothschild was able to buy out the whole English market for a fraction of its cost. When word returned that the English had actually been victorious, the value of the market soared, and overnight Nathan Rothschild expanded his family\u2019s wealth, and cemented their position as one of the richest families in the world.","filename":"135432635757547","ext":".png","w":532,"h":543,"tn_w":122,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492307090130,"time":1492307090,"md5":"b1C7Mz3gZ\/dfbNScmJWwUQ==","fsize":305611,"resto":121296648,"id":"icsdvXq4","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]}

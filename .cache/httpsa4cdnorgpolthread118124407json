The kind that is a true believer in the absurd. When will they learn that we see things as they are, not as they would like us to see them? WE DIDN&#039;T EVEN WANT THIS BILL!!!!!! But we&#039;re supposed to blame Trump for it&#039;s failure? We&#039;re happy it failed! The Left will never notice that Trump says he&#039;s excited about Healthcare, and doesn&#039;t say he&#039;s excited about this exact bill in it&#039;s exact form. He talks about how it&#039;s going to be great, but he needs the bill on his desk before he can sign it, and that&#039;s Ryan&#039;s and McConnel&#039;s job. They are the ones who are taking the blame for this fiasco, for introducing and supporting a less bad Obamacare, rather than a real solution. But even after 2018 when some of these &quot;Republicans&quot; are replaced, even after 2020 when Trump wins reelection, the shills still will not believe it.","filename":"1490197834151","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":1020,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490388151015,"time":1490388151,"md5":"eI8gqVW31Df6E2RCviXP5A==","fsize":276531,"resto":118124407,"id":"HDj33t3d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

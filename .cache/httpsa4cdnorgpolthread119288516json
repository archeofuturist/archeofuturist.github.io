Technically, each agency is supposed to create a Scientific Integrity Policy to protect independent research -- but the guidelines are vague, and can be easily undermined.<br><br>That is not enough in an age when the president&#039;s cronies attack anything that could limit their power or politicized agenda. Support the brand-new Scientific Integrity Act in Congress!<br><br>The federal government conducts an enormous amount of essential research, including:<br><br>- Weather predictions and tracking data about climate change<br><br>- Risks posed by approving new drugs and genetically-engineered organisms<br><br>- Public health impacts of toxic chemicals<br><br>This cannot be easily reproduced on the state or private level, where limited resources leaves scientific studies largely up to the whims of giant corporations. Public research must be shielded for the public good.

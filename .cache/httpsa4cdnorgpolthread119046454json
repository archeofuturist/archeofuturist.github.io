For example, Ireland&#039;s average IQ is 92, but Bulgaria&#039;s is 93, Ireland is way more developed now, unless back when the tests were conducted it wasn&#039;t. Or, you can&#039;t compare a 2nd world country which is developed but outdated, to a 3rd world country as well. Arguing with IQ &quot;studies&quot; is just embarrassing.","filename":"1490692195327","ext":".jpg","w":672,"h":499,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":185,"tim":1490958576548,"time":1490958576,"md5":"c2chJiqG4BT3\/UsOWU2Ytg==","fsize":101352,"resto":0,"id":"QTIK0jgg","country":"BG","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"muh-iq","country_name":"Bulgaria","replies":11,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":119046603,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)07:12:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119046454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119046454<\/a><br>Which is why, if you had a high school education, you&#039;d know that in tests, confounding and extraneous variables are accounted for, and controlled.

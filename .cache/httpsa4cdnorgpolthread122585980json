I&#039;m here to tell you the tale of my country&#039;s fall.<br><br>For the sake of anonymity I will not give away the name of my nation. I am here to express that our current government has completely taken over the freedom of speech and the ruling party has systematically destroyed the opposing nationalist party. <br><br>1. With the help of the communists living in the neighboring countries they have run a mass PR operation. The goal of it was to promote atheism and the target demographics were the younger generation that are eager to learn new things naturally.<br><br>2. The neighboring country also helped rigging the election and mainstream media --they sent actual agents to vote on behalf of dead people.<br><br>3. First thing that the ruling party did is change the history in the books that are taught to children in middle school. Our government already provides book for free to them, no one could oppose to the monopoly<br><br>4. Arrested thousands (yes, thousands) of supporters of nationalist party members, supporters and donors.<br><br>5. Enabled SJWs into the government. We literally have a &quot;Ministry of Women and children affairs&quot;. The parliament has &quot;reserved&quot; seat for women<br><br>6. Systematically closed down the private media channel that were exposing the horrible deeds of the ruling party<br><br>7. The COG operated a coup d&#039;etat among the Army. As a result, the border protection army has killed our many invaluable defense personnel including Captains, Majors, Colonels Generals etc<br><br>8. The ruling party has enabled a &quot;high way&quot; for the neighboring country to send\/deliver their goods that passes through my country<br><br>9. Right before the second term election the government forged false charges against the opposition party; almost half of the leaders got arrested. Which has lead to their second term<br><br>10. Atheism, foreign cultural domination, political correctness is the new norm. Religious institutes are being shut down, journalists, columists and authors go missing","filename":"1474329293525","ext":".jpg","w":1436,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":188,"tim":1493040871174,"time":1493040871,"md5":"ffqMp5Z6JzAdI6DPjEl0Gg==","fsize":96163,"resto":0,"id":"oaZRBEi\/","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"my-country-is-slowly-turning-to-communism-im-here","country_name":"Australia","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122586346,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)09:38:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"ctd.<br><br>11.

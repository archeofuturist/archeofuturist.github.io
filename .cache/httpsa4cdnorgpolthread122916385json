Even preferred cuisine such as your overconsumption of maple products is a part of this.<br><br>What you seem to be obsessing over is something like totally unique culture unconnected with Yurop in any way as well as high culture. It would be very difficult to find too many traditions in Canada not influenced in any way by European thought or traditions. Maybe if Canada was isolated for a thousand years and Europe got Islamized you&#039;d have a totally unique culture, but as long as Canada is mostly Western and nations founded by Europeans have around 1.8 billion people in them it is unlikely that Canada&#039;s culture, like Taiwan or Singapore or Japan&#039;s, could be a truly unique culture without similar traditions found elsewhere.<br><br><a href=\"#p122944499\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122944499<\/a><br>Well it was easy for her to be anti-immigration since Germany&#039;s immigrants were largely from other EU countries anyway.

A particular attitude among Canadians is that Canada is like America, but less shit. This isn&#039;t simply a result of rivalry but an attitude pioneered by the Loyalists and encouraged by the British. In Canada today at least a quarter of Canadians can trace their ancestry back to either Loyalists or other Americans that settled Ontario and the Maritime regions during the 1700s before and after the Revolution. During this period Canada effectively became Britain&#039;s testing ground for both the concept of Dominions as well as proper Constitutional Monarchy including wider participation of the common man.

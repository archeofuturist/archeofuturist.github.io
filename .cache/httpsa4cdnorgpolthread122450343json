Christianity adapts to the culture of its followers, and that is both a strength and a weakness. It is a strength because its values can be mostly agreed to the values of the population. It is a weakness because it encourages tolerance, thereby inviting\/accommodating leftists. Just a pro-tip from an atheist to Christians here: stamp out leftists from your ranks.<br><br>The best argument to defend God, against anti-thiests specifically, is to call them out for strawmanning what God actually is. Anyone who asserts that God does not exist is asseting that not one of the indefinite number of interpretations of God is real. Even within the Christian community, every single person has a different interpretation of God. That is an extraordinary claim to make and it is one that requires extraordinary evidence.","time":1492969919,"resto":122450343,"id":"Zl++DKxp","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

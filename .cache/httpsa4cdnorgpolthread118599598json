The island is populated by people living in extreme poverty. Most of the trees on the island have been burnt for charcoal and the soil is sandy and unsuitable for crops. My grandfather ran an ice plant down there with the help of a christian organization. They give people big blocks of ice to use for refrigerating food and to me melted for clean drinking water. On the island there are no paved streets, animals running everywhere and most houses are compounds surrounded by concrete walls topped with broken glass bottles to keep out intruders. When i arrived I was the first white child to be seen in person by many of the children on the island. They chased the truck I was riding in yelling &quot;Blanc, Blanc, Blanc!&quot; and hung around the compound i was staying at begging. I had brought some soccer balls to give they and they accepted these with alot of celebration. One of the boys begged me for my new balance tennis shoe- just one shoe. He was barefoot and dirty, about the same age as me. In the market there were people selling mud cookies- literally cookies made out of mud you could buy for a few gourde to stave off the hunger pangs. The weather was hot and dry. Everywhere there were flies buzzing around. I feel I was a little sheltered from the true horrors of life on the island because of my close association with the christian organization and the only white people on the island. The experience still weighs heavily on me. You cannot see such poverty and be unaffected. Just by experiencing three months of life on this island I invalidated every complaint I&#039;ve ever had about my life. We have it so good in our developed countries and yet so many people are unsatisfied.","filename":"300px-Gonave_Haiti_ne18-8_air_small","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":180,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1490671383971,"time":1490671383,"md5":"GINhIWgEp2JEvG37tjbSBA==","fsize":18017,"resto":118599598,"id":"nZj96TLD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118604392,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)23:23:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118604239\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118604239<\/a><br><br>I&#039;ve been all over Texas but am not familiar with this - do they have names or are just villages in the middle of nowhere?","time":1490671387,"resto":118599598,"id":"GgBvlPYU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118604418,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)23:23:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118604326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118604326<\/a><br>Yeah.

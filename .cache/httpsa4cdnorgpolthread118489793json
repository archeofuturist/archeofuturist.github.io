This is because it presupposes that everything has already been predetermined, including every single thought and every single idea any human being in history has ever had. In such a case there is no true formation of ideas, no real rationalism, only the predetermined results of a grand complex of physical and chemical processes whose outcomes were already more or less set in stone from the moment of the big bang. This means that there is no such thing as &quot;reason&quot;, no such thing as reasonable observation, science and that therefore the means by which we establish determinism do not exist.

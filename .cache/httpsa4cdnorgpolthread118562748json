The cost of living is relatively high as compared to other places in america, but that&#039;s to be expected since the living conditions are generally better. The biggest problem is that since it is such a good place to live, you will bump into a fair amount of ridiculously blue pilled people from time to time. They have very little interaction with blacks, mexicans, muslims, etc. so they have no idea how much crime said groups cause. But again, that depends where you are, some places are better than others, New Hampshire was nearly 50\/50 Trump\/Hillary in the election, so its kind of a coin flip with peoples political beliefs. It&#039;s also fucking beautiful like in the pic you posted","time":1490649657,"resto":118562748,"id":"OqhJJlVo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

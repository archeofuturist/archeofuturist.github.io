Just look at the recent riots in Bielorussia. They are white and doing shit.<br><br>Arabs were at their top when they were following Islam (Islamic Spain, Baghdad, Ottoman Empire -- you can say whatever you want but Islam is a conservative religion such as Christianity) before declining due to tribalism and give-me mentality (look at Lybia, KSA or Egypt -- governments buy peace from population and they are all poor and fat).

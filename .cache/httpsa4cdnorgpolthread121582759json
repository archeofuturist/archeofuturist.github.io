One morning you will turn on your computer and find it unable to connect to the internet (assuming you are a neet with no social circle, which most of you are). Now is the time to share your thoughts on this big game we have been playing, which we call history. Share how you truly feel with your disenfranchised brothers. Are you afraid to die?

Most pretend to have one, which they pretend to enjoy, but most don&#039;t. I can&#039;t say I don&#039;t have enough friends and even some good friends, which I have managed to hold a deep connection, but still I think I&#039;m kind of an outlier and it was partly luck, because most people have pretty weak bonds of friendship. Since my friends are spread I have, quiet a decent amount of time for myself, which I enjoy too. There is a sense of perpetual longing in me for more and for the distant. I can&#039;t tell it with certainty, if my live was really worth it or wasn&#039;t. I believe it was, but in a very subjective way, in which you tend to forget much of the bad things and can barley tell by which standards you made your desicon. The more I thought, about dead the less I seem to fear it and also the older I got. I feel we don&#039;t know enough, about dead to really decide. Sometimes it&#039;s a strange feeling to have something in the world, which you can be sure of and it seems to natural to should make you afraid. I believe Neets have a more decent live and at the time more frighting perspective than others. Many of the neets are undoubtly more happy, than much of the rest of the society. I don&#039;t think there is anything I&#039;m certian, I would have wanted to so differently.","time":1492466892,"resto":121582759,"id":"CLdFVqsI","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121590854,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)18:09:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121583022\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121583022<\/a><br>Fpbp","time":1492466983,"resto":121582759,"id":"4nfn4qDr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121591549,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)18:14:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Everyone here wishes they could have had one night with Best Waifu.<br><br>If their wishes came true, this poor girl would be awfully busy....","filename":"IMG_0505","ext":".jpg","w":225,"h":350,"tn_w":80,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492467290656,"time":1492467290,"md5":"HG94vsugxGw8kKDh29xZUg==","fsize":57501,"resto":121582759,"id":"6piAMJqF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

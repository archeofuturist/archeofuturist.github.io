Around 2012, 3.25 million people received artificially-fluoridated water.[22] 71% of the population in 2002 resided in fluoridated communities.[76] The fluoridation agent used is hydrofluorosilicic acid (HFSA; H2SiF6).[77] In a 2002 public survey, 45% of respondents expressed some concern about fluoridation.[78]<br><br>In 1957, the Department of Health established a Fluorine Consultative Council which recommended fluoridation at 1.0 ppm of public water supplies, then accessed by ~50% of the population.[79] This was felt to be a much cheaper way of improving the quality of children&#039;s teeth than employing more dentists.[80] This led to the Health (Fluoridation of Water Supplies) Act 1960, which mandated compulsory fluoridation by local authorities.[80][81] The statutory instruments made in 1962\u201365 under the 1960 Act were separate for each local authority, setting the level of fluoride in drinking water to 0.8\u20131.0 ppm.[82][83] The current regulations date from 2007, and set the level to 0.6\u20130.8 ppm, with a target value of 0.7 ppm.[84]<br><br>Implementation of fluoridation was held up by preliminary dental surveying and water testing,[85] and a court case, Ryan v. Attorney General.[86] In 1965, the Supreme Court rejected Gladys Ryan&#039;s claim that the Act violated the Constitution of Ireland&#039;s guarantee of the right to bodily integrity.[86][87] By 1965, Greater Dublin&#039;s water was fluoridated; by 1973, other urban centers were.[88] Studies from the late 1970s to mid 1990s showed a higher decrease in (and lower incidence of) dental decay in school children living in areas where water was fluoridated than in areas where water was not fluoridated.<br><br>]","time":1490368693,"resto":118088516,"id":"HAU+auJq","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118090404,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:18:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118088516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118088516<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thom yorke<\/span><br><br>KEK","time":1490368711,"resto":118088516,"id":"39m\/eI0d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118090547,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:20:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118090381\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118090381<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118088516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118088516<\/a><br><br>In Ireland there are people calling to put Lithium in the water, as well as Flouride.<br><br>http:\/\/www.independent.ie\/life\/heal<wbr>th-wellbeing\/health-features\/should<wbr>-we-be-putting-lithium-in-our-water<wbr>-30600464.html","time":1490368804,"resto":118088516,"id":"HAU+auJq","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118090663,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:21:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118088516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118088516<\/a><br>The added flouride in water is actually pretty safe and is good for oral hygiene.

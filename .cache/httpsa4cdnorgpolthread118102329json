When any of their publications are outlawed and labeled \u201cextremist\u201d, Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses comply with the law and remove it from their places of worship and homes. However this does not stop the persecution. Russian authorities consistently plant evidence to falsely accuse them of breaking the law.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Step 2) Ban everyone from teaching the Bible outside their places of worship. Why did Russian authorities take this measure? The teachings of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses are found in the Bible, therefore the study aids they publish are not essential to their faith. As a result, the Russian authorities in their effort to protect the teachings of the Russian Orthodox Church, must resort to suppressing freedom of speech and pass laws banning evangelism outside of church<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Step 3) Ban Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses, by labeling them \u201cextremists\u201d. This will effectively allow Russia to take over all of the Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses\u2019 legally registered and established places of worship throughout the country affecting over 100,000 of their citizens. In doing so Russia would be able to criminally prosecute any members of the faith.

The purpose of the them is to get frequent bumps, moving quickly to the top of the board, distracting from other threads, forcing them down in page number, or otherwise ensuring that serious threads autosage and timeout faster. You can shitpost the threads close to a target thread in rank, and depending on its page number and the time of the last reply, you can tip threads toward being autosaged. Shills and cancer use this technique to attack threads they don&#039;t like.","time":1491217096,"resto":119314695,"id":"snwgHL3E","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119316113,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)07:00:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"Lurk moar<br>SAGE","time":1491217241,"resto":119314695,"id":"\/W5xDgNK","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":119316853,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)07:14:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119314695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119314695<\/a><br>HOW MANY LAYERS OF IRONY IS THAT","time":1491218052,"resto":119314695,"id":"jw2mQ0QB","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]}

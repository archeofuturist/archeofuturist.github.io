This server has been mentioned in connection to investigations.<br><br>* Nobody knew who TeaLeaves was. Some speculated it was L Jean Camp herself which is the closest guess. It turned out to be a colleague of hers. See the info above for the damning proof. <br><br>* Tealeaves has a years-old wordpress account coincidentally named in leetspeak teakettle (t34k3ttl3). That&#039;s him. BTW I don&#039;t believe that FeelTheEmailMistake guy found it the way he says. I think he had to present it in a more eh &quot;public safe&quot; manner if you get my drift. Based on some other posts of his i think this guy is into some seriously heavy shit...and think about the timing of all this.<br><br>* The DNS logs contain + signs -- meaning recursive nameserver-nameserver queries which just doesnt happen. Even if we say the Russian nameservers have some weird setup -- well, the American medical nameservers have the same weird setup. Every damn nameserver has the same weird setup. Terribly unlikely...<br><br>* The guy mentions 6 indicators of forgery... says hes only &#039;reasonably confident&#039; based on the indicator above... but it&#039;s pretty fucking damning all by itself. My suspicion is that another indicator is based on meticulous analysis of TTLS and cache behavior.","filename":"WorldBurn","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490468909251,"time":1490468909,"md5":"kdOYl3238N7GDEwZejU\/yQ==","fsize":44242,"resto":0,"id":"wyUytZpn","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"clinton-crony-forged-dns-logs-for-russia","country_name":"United States","replies":203,"images":45,"unique_ips":83,"tail_size":50},{"no":118258763,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:10:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"still bumping","time":1490469002,"resto":118258574,"id":"kOM89qaG","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":118258821,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:10:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118258574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118258574<\/a><br>Quick Rundown Edition:<br>TEALEAVES EXPOSURE<br><br>http:\/\/i.magaimg.net\/img\/9bc.png<br><br>TEALEAVES DNS LOGS:<br><br>(notice + signs)<br><br>http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20161107<wbr>125853\/http:\/\/gdd.i2p.xyz\/logs\/ns1_<wbr>cdcservices_com.log<br><br>http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20161107<wbr>125853\/http:\/\/gdd.i2p.xyz\/logs\/ns2_<wbr>cdcservices_com.log<br><br>http:\/\/web.archive.org\/web\/20161107<wbr>125853\/http:\/\/gdd.i2p.xyz\/logs\/ns3_<wbr>cdcservices_com.log<br><br>EXPOSURE OF FORGERY<br><br>(one indicator, supposed to be five more)<br><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/6HR8s","time":1490469032,"resto":118258574,"id":"wyUytZpn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118258883,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:11:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;that link<\/span>","filename":"1487526999675","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":250,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490469060591,"time":1490469060,"md5":"FcuFs\/9X7dORteYw2h0o1g==","fsize":36507,"resto":118258574,"id":"REmcJB9C","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118258956,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:11:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Kek no one cares faggot<br><br>Drumpy has achieved nothing","time":1490469091,"resto":118258574,"id":"9RPJYgUF","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118259080,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:12:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118258574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118258574<\/a><br>On nu\/pol\/ reddit comes to you!","time":1490469150,"resto":118258574,"id":"kHVm8V0u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118259158,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:13:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118258574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118258574<\/a><br>bump for interest","time":1490469185,"resto":118258574,"id":"Lwi7cKTs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118259193,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:13:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump, don&#039;t let it slide","time":1490469201,"resto":118258574,"id":"RSIDVbyR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118259211,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)15:13:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Reposting some important anon&#039;s information<br><br><br>That pastebin doesnt have the DNS logs that were forged.<br><br>Anons, we are getting bogged down in too many details.

In the world of DNS experts, there\u2019s no higher authority. Vixie wrote central strands of the DNS code that makes the internet work. After studying the logs, he concluded, \u201cThe parties were communicating in a secretive fashion. The operative word is secretive. This is more akin to what criminal syndicates do if they are putting together a project.\u201d Put differently, the logs suggested that Trump and Alfa had configured something like a digital hotline connecting the two entities, shutting out the rest of the world, and designed to obscure its own existence.

Computer scientists are careful about vouching for evidence that emerges from unknown sources\u2014especially since the logs were pasted in a text file, where they could conceivably have been edited. I asked nine computer scientists\u2014some who agreed to speak on the record, some who asked for anonymity\u2014if the DNS logs that Tea Leaves and his collaborators discovered could be forged or manipulated. They considered it nearly impossible. It would be easy enough to fake one or maybe even a dozen records of DNS lookups. But in the aggregate, the logs contained thousands of records, with nuances and patterns that not even the most skilled programmers would be able to recreate on this scale. \u201cThe data has got the right kind of fuzz growing on it,\u201d Vixie told me. \u201cIt\u2019s the interpacket gap, the spacing between the conversations, the total volume.

Attackers replace the source IP field in the packets they are<br>sending onto the network with addresses that differ from the one assigned to them. The chosen address to<br>replace the original source address depends on the type of attack; however, in all cases, source spoofing<br>makes it very difficult for the receiver of the malicious traffic to make any assertions about the true source.<br>It is up to transport layer protocols (e.g. TCP, UDP) to provide this source verification if necessary.<br><br>One early spoofing attack exploited the rlogin protocol [1] by setting the source IP of the malicious rlogin<br>packets to a known trusted host by the target and guessing the TCP sequence numbers, which were<br>predictable at the time [2]. IP spoofing attacks on TCP-based protocols were largely eliminated by making<br>TCP sequence numbers infeasible for an attacker to predict [3].<br><br>Since UDP has no implicit protection against these attacks, protecting against spoofing is left up to each<br>individual protocol that leverages UDP. In 2008, Dan Kaminsky revealed a major spoofing vulnerability in<br>most DNS implementations that allowed an attacker to preempt a response to a recursive name server by<br>spoofing the source address of the authoritative server it was attempting to query [4]. In a similar manner<br>to TCP, the workaround for this particular vulnerability was randomization (source port in this case) to<br>make a successful attack highly improbable. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;revealed a major spoofing vulnerability in most DNS implementations that allowed an attacker to preempt a response to a recursive name server by spoofing the source address of the authoritative server it was attempting to query<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;revealed a major spoofing vulnerability in most DNS implementations that allowed an attacker to preempt a response to a recursive name server by spoofing the source address of the authoritative server it was attempting to query<\/span>","time":1490488110,"resto":118258574,"id":"mnp\/dhO3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118295500,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)20:28:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118295428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118295428<\/a><br>Another possibility.","time":1490488137,"resto":118258574,"id":"5\/NL6ir5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118295504,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)20:29:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118262054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118262054<\/a><br>They&#039;re already crying because the libshits wanted RyanBama care.

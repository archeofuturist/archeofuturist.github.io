I cook meat on sundays or mondays, specifically fish and fry it then store it in the fridge over the next few days. i cook vegetables every other day as they spoil faster and are easy to cook in a short time. I&#039;ll make fresh rice with this every night, as that takes no time either. I&#039;ll also prep chicken breasts for the week for salads at lunch as well as a fuckload of brown rice to eat after I workout. Seems tedious but its manageable and pretty easy, just find what works best for you.","time":1493449827,"resto":123308023,"id":"pqT61i4K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123308849,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)03:16:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"Use your leftovers in other meals when it gets old. Make omelets, chili, frittata (just go light on the pasta), etc. Basically recipes that you can throw any ingredients in, have it still taste good, and use kitchen staples","time":1493450178,"resto":123308023,"id":"QMuV+Ufk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

There&#039;s good income mobility in the US, meaning the top earners generally don&#039;t stay at the top and the bottom earners don&#039;t stay at the bottom and I think that&#039;s much more important. The focus should be on equal opportunity regardless of where a person starts out in life instead of some enforced equal outcome.<br><br>Socialists like to argue that under capitalism the rich get richer and the poor get poorer; these days, it&#039;s usually a matter of presenting statistics on &quot;income distribution&quot; to show that the top earners&#039; &quot;share of national income&quot; has gone up, while the bottom 10 or 20 percent of income earners have seen their share stay the same or go down. To get to this conclusion you have to assume that the same people are somehow stuck in an economic rut at the bottom of the income scale. Economists Michael Cox and Richard Alm exposed this by citing a University of Michigan study that tracked more than 50,000 Americans for three decades to discern the extent of economic mobility in America. they found that very few people are &quot;stuck&quot; at the bottom of the economic ladder; most rise quickly. Among their findings:<br><br>-More than three-fourths of families in the bottom fifth of income distribution in 1975 had made their way up to the two highest income quintiles in 1991.<br><br>-The poorest families made the largest gains. Those who started in the bottom 20 percent in 1975 had an inflation-adjusted gain in annual income of 27,745 by 1991; those who started in the top 20 percent in 1975 also improved, but only by 4,354<br><br>-Less than 1 percent of the sample population remained in the bottom 20 percent during the 1975-1991 period<br><br>-More than half of the families who were in the bottom 20 percent in 1975 made it to a higher bracket within four years","time":1490554882,"resto":118389289,"id":"5O6XJZK6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118398574,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)15:01:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118398243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118398243<\/a><br>How is it excessive to ensure your children, your offspring, have the very best they can get?

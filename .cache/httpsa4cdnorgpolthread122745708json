Monopoly is made by acquisition \u2014 Google buying AdMob and DoubleClick, Facebook buying Instagram and WhatsApp, Amazon buying, to name just a few, Audible, Twitch, Zappos and Alexa. At a minimum, these companies should not be allowed to acquire other major firms, like Spotify or Snapchat.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The second alternative is to regulate a company like Google as a public utility, requiring it to license out patents, for a nominal fee, for its search algorithms, advertising exchanges and other key innovations.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The third alternative is to remove the \u201csafe harbor\u201d clause in the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act, which allows companies like Facebook and Google\u2019s YouTube to free ride on the content produced by others. The reason there are 40,000 Islamic State videos on YouTube, many with ads that yield revenue for those who posted them, is that YouTube does not have to take responsibility for the content on its network. Facebook, Google and Twitter claim that policing their networks would be too onerous. But that\u2019s preposterous: They already police their networks for pornography, and quite well.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Removing the safe harbor provision would also force social networks to pay for the content posted on their sites. A simple example: One million downloads of a song on iTunes would yield the performer and his record label about $900,000. One million streams of that same song on YouTube would earn them about $900.<\/span>","filename":"blacked merchant","ext":".jpg","w":354,"h":504,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493134566126,"time":1493134566,"md5":"yhLBGPHTizq9fjoBf7u9CA==","fsize":47948,"resto":122745708,"id":"LFEwE9pp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122746176,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)11:36:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122745874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122745874<\/a><br>Makes you feel a bit better about retirement even knowing there won&#039;t be soc sec.","filename":"1486784725534","ext":".png","w":670,"h":398,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":74,"tim":1493134566070,"time":1493134566,"md5":"7REVlq03fEBVKSvPYIHhbw==","fsize":147601,"resto":122745708,"id":"jdgKRwnd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122746183,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)11:36:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122746050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122746050<\/a><br>Soon.

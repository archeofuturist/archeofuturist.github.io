You can&#039;t go back. Once you learn certain things about how the world operates, you notice them everywhere. You could stop coming to \/pol\/, try to ignore it. Find ways to distract yourself. You can learn to interact with people and not cause a scene, but you can never be truly open with someone unless you know you can trust them. Revealing your power level to the wrong person can still ruin your life. <br>Soon you&#039;l take the black pill, and realize there&#039;s no saving it, western civilization is probably doomed, and you may see it&#039;s collapse in your lifetime.

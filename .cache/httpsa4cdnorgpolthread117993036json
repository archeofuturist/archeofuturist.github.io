Will one of you ask this for me?<br><br>Dr. Peterson, many of us who belong in what you would refer to as the &quot;alt-right&quot;, can not envision a future for Western civilization and values unless we return to a more nativist, traditionalist society. I understand you have denounced the emergence and revival of the far-right as being too patriarchal to maintain civilization(at least without causing great and unnecessary suffering) for a comfortable extended period. A moderate, centrist, or reserved approach will undoubtedly result in the displacement of respective natives in each of the Western nations by a conglomeration of openly aggressive and domineering people. This is self evident in the comparison of birth rates and the fiscal shackles applied on the natives by the state, whilst the &quot;replacements&quot; have freedom to maneuver, unbound by tremendous financial burden. <br><br>Simply sorting ourselves out as individuals will not guarantee our children to have the opportunities for prosperity and liberty that we take for granted today. What is the option for people who prefer for strong tradition and values to remain intrinsically tied into our national societal structures, if our governing bodies and political opponents will not allow so?

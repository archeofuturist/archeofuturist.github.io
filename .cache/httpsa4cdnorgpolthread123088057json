And I say this as a formerly-devout Christian. The Pope is the one cucking the black guy (from a theological perspective). And this is coming from a man who hates the Cuckolic Church and is immensely proud of his Protestant ancestors for telling them to fuck off.<br><br><br>Consider the following, in words you can understand:<br>Christianity&#039;s message is, on the surface, something akin to Justin Trudeau&#039;s (fake) quote: &quot;If you kill your enemies, they win.&quot; And you&#039;d be right, in a strictly theological sense, because:<br><br>Christianity is about love, mercy, forgiveness.<br>Killing\/harming another is the antithesis of this.<br>Therefore, by turning the other cheek, even in the face of death, you&#039;re going out as a Christian.<br>Your murderer, on the other hand, is turning away from God by committing a mortal sin.<br>You&#039;re going to Heaven as a martyr, who embraced Christ&#039;s message until the very end<br>Your murderer is going to Hell to be punished for his\/her sins<br><br>Remember, Jesus went to his death like a man instead of running or even fighting. He died doing exactly as he preached, while his murderers were exposed as hypocrites. Jesus correctly judged them for being corrupt and doing other than what they (the Jews) preached, and they despised him for it. <br><br>I know it takes critical thinking skills above that of an animal (where power can only come from aggression), but the black dude in the pic is really getting cucked by the Pope. Because God sees all this, and will reward the Pope accordingly. So the Pope is winning salvation, and the mudslime gets nothing in God&#039;s eyes.<br><br>Do you understand now, Pekka, that there are somethings more subtle and powerful than &quot;might makes right&quot;? Do you get the point of Christianity, at all?","time":1493328344,"resto":123088057,"id":"WKoynMV9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123092114,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)17:34:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123089208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123089208<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/passag<wbr>e\/?search=John+13<br>I see this picture <a href=\"#p123088057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123088057<\/a> all the time.

This really made my almonds activate. What if \/pol\/ claims SC:R? <br><br>You can start an open \/pol\/ channel very easily in Bnet, the 1v1 savagery in the game btfos all the snowflake &quot;team&quot; moba players who need participation awards for being &quot;healers&quot;. In fact, SC:R is going to be a massive spotlight on the &quot;skills&quot; of the snowflake moba generation as Worst Korea ascends to rape them once again.<br><br>I think SC:R is \/ourgame\/ and I think it may quickly become an enclave as Blizzard won&#039;t pay to moderate it as the salty spic wishes. The servers will be f2p, original at patch 1.18 is f2p already, and SC:R will use the same servers\/channels. The only difference is that it will be HD-4K and f2p isn&#039;t. Bottomline, they can&#039;t hide behind the hipsters at Blizzard since they won&#039;t be there.<br><br>https:\/\/us.battle.net\/forums\/en\/sta<wbr>rcraft\/topic\/20753836391","filename":"non gosu fgt btfo","ext":".png","w":1116,"h":590,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":132,"tim":1491495931464,"time":1491495931,"md5":"k3Iq2z89JIdtuafPFaXaqQ==","fsize":495262,"resto":0,"id":"pVHHTa3S","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"starcraft-remastered-is-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":7,"unique_ips":9},{"no":119759374,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)12:27:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119759103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119759103<\/a><br>WHAT DO YOU ASK OF ME?","filename":"fenix","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491496066062,"time":1491496066,"md5":"H4qczxOR4VemuuWutXxlnQ==","fsize":33894,"resto":119759103,"id":"mzOHzbLO","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119759542,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)12:29:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119759374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119759374<\/a><br>I accidentally your shields","filename":"1488339472231","ext":".gif","w":320,"h":269,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":105,"tim":1491496141035,"time":1491496141,"md5":"lWqFCLuD5FkRe4H2pMvLig==","fsize":845356,"resto":119759103,"id":"pVHHTa3S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119759679,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)12:30:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Generation Z are \/ourguys\/.","time":1491496206,"resto":119759103,"id":"t3LatP1L","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119759863,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)12:31:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"Many of the libcucks accuse Arcturus of basically being the Trump of SC.","filename":"ArcturusMengsk_SC2-HotS_Art1","ext":".jpg","w":1390,"h":3129,"tn_w":55,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491496300038,"time":1491496300,"md5":"AL5ph6Vpo7EsIG4j0+qZcw==","fsize":1196645,"resto":119759103,"id":"pVHHTa3S","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119760283,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)12:35:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119759374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119759374<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What would you ask of me.<\/span>","time":1491496513,"resto":119759103,"id":"B\/zGQA1U","country":"UA","country_name":"Ukraine"},{"no":119760433,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)12:36:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119759374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119759374<\/a><br>ADDITIONAL PYLONS","time":1491496595,"resto":119759103,"id":"rE8eIimL","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119760795,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)12:39:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119759103\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119759103<\/a><br>Good.

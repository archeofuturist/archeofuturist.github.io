So listen to me.<br><br>In the next 2 minutes, I&#039;m going to red pill the shit out of you about China. I&#039;m gonna open your eyes. I&#039;m gonna give you a motherfucking epiphany.<br><br>On my previous thread, some dummy posted that China has a history of never being occupied.<br><br>WRONG.<br><br>The last dynasty in Chinese history was the Qing Dynasty. It lasted about 300 years. The rulers of the Qing Dynasty were not Chinese. The rulers were a &quot;barbarian&quot; race called the Manchus. This dynasty successfully lasted for 300 years. China was OCCUPIED and ruled by a foreign race for 300 years.<br><br>Why? Why did the Chinese kowtow to the barbarians for 300 years?<br><br>Answer: Because of the alternative. Because Chinese people are deathly afraid of shit hitting the fan, because every single time shit hits the fan in the Middle Kingdom, tens of millions of Chinese people die of slaughter or hunger. Therefore, the Chinese people are inherently willing to tolerate bullshit from their authoritarian government in order to stave off the inevitable disaster that is the Chinese dynastic change.<br><br>Right now, the same thing is happening. China is on the verge of collapse, but Chinese people are tolerating their bullshit government because they&#039;re so terrified of the inevitable. But, trust me, there WILL be a dynastic change. It&#039;s absolutely inevitable. It&#039;s the nature of China to collapse, again and again and again. China has had 83 dynasties in its history. No. Make that 84, including the PRC.<br><br>China is a DOMINO, just waiting to fall and trigger a chain reaction of nonstop ass fucking.<br><br>This is the future. Be prepared.","filename":"Xi_jinping_Brazil_2013","ext":".png","w":519,"h":704,"tn_w":184,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491200368318,"time":1491200368,"md5":"I+vmoLU9mnKRGYtsbbc89w==","fsize":819186,"resto":0,"id":"n7eulglz","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"china","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":0,"unique_ips":9},{"no":119299355,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)02:20:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"this post makes me sleepy","time":1491200430,"resto":119299281,"id":"J0yUUY\/8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119299382,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)02:20:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119299281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119299281<\/a><br>Bullshit, China is fine.","time":1491200459,"resto":119299281,"id":"n4BV0KaR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119299426,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)02:21:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119299355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119299355<\/a><br>HEEEEEEEEEEY!!!<br><br>WAAAAAKE UUUUUUPPPP!!!!","time":1491200497,"resto":119299281,"id":"n7eulglz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119299441,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)02:21:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"good","time":1491200519,"resto":119299281,"id":"InPtMa5J","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119299664,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)02:25:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119299281\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119299281<\/a><br>China is also becoming more and more individualistic, as the time goes by.<br>New cultural phenomenon of &quot;work until you die to get into university, then proceed to fuck around&quot; is literally #1 problem in China, maybe after the housing bubble.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; t.

Former Burlington College president Jane O&#039;Meara Sanders, the wife of 2016 presidential candidate and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).<br><br>The investigation appears to stem from a January 2016 complaint filed by Vermont Republican Party vice chair Brady Toensing on behalf of Catholic parishioner Wendy Wilton, a conservative activist and Rutland City treasurer. Toensing alleged that O&#039;Meara Sanders committed federal loan fraud by inflating the number of fundraising commitments she had secured to buy the 32-acre North Avenue campus from the Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington. When those donations failed to materialize, the college defaulted on its loans \u2014 costing the church, which financed a portion of the sale, between $1.6 million and $2 million.","time":1493837374,"resto":123944959,"id":"Bi1AU6\/9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

The article basically says Diane Feinstein, democratic senator from California, told a crowd at an anti-Trump rally in Cali that she believes Trump is going to resign because, well, reasons that she believes. The article alludes that she has secret inside info from being on the Senate Judiciary Committee. Article also says Michael Moore agrees with her (okay???)<br><br>This is what I don&#039;t get...<br><br>Do liberals not realize what happens if they get Trump out of office? They&#039;re crying and shouting about Trump is anti-LGBTQ, anti-abortion, and pro-Christianity (especially the religion influencing government policy). Trump has shown no evidence of this, and has even shown he believes the contrary, while Pence has an established track record for pushing against the LGBTQ community, against abortion, pro-Christian, etc.<br><br>Liberals are trying to push the old dog out of the chicken coop in favor of having the wolf enter and think they&#039;ll be better off.<br><br>Also, Pence is a neo-con and will continue the status quo of the previous presidencies but liberals definitely aren&#039;t taking that into account. <br><br>Do liberals think they&#039;ll be able to force out Pence if they get rid of Trump? Because Pence is going to bring a world of hurt based off of his beliefs and past policies.<br><br>This is gonna be good.","filename":"1489719681625","ext":".png","w":765,"h":765,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490185120176,"time":1490185120,"md5":"LxaXkyc7mvzt+VQqKN\/Gog==","fsize":179259,"resto":0,"id":"eTdbliH\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"liberals-trying-to-dump-trump-for-pencewhy","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":117752660,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)08:20:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117752522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117752522<\/a><br>The one thing they cannot stand te thought of is Trump doing an ok job.

Examples are any form of socialism, absolute monarchy, dictatorship.<br>By contrast individualism is linked to laissez faire, where people are responsible for themselves. That mean they create rules they want to live by and pay consequences, if they fail.<br>Right now societies live under unprecedented amount of rules imposed on common people.

Learn some education, please. What you see in your stupid country are the gipsies sold by your Turks, moron. Learn history.<br><br>The research was published in the Journal of Human Genetics. A mutation in a gene called OCA2 came into being nearly 8,000 years ago. It can be definitively traced back to an ancestor from the Black Sea. Dr. Hans Eiberg claims that before this time, every human being had brown eyes.<br><br>\u201cA genetic mutation affecting the OCA2 gene in our chromosomes resulted in the creation of a \u2018switch,\u2019 which literally \u2018turned off\u2019 the ability to produce brown eyes,\u201d Eiberg said.<br><br>When blue-eyed peoples from Jordan, Denmark and Turkey were examined, their genetic difference was traced back to the maternal lineage according to Eiberg\u2019s team.<br><br>The brown melanin pigment is still dominant. However, following the last Ice Age, Europeans developed this rare mutation that differentiated them from the rest of the human race.<br><br>Ninety-five percent of Europeans in Scandinavian countries have blue eyes. They are also found to have a greater range of hair and skin color. Comparatively, Europe has a wider variety of hair color and skin pigment than is found in any other continent in the world.<br><br>\u201cThe question really is, \u2018Why did we go from having nobody on Earth with blue eyes 10,000 years ago to having 20 or 40 percent of Europeans having blue eyes now?\u201d<br><br>\u201cThis gene does something good for people.

According to published data the C allele of the Tat polymorphism is widespread in all Uralic-speaking populations studied so far, except that it is absent or extremely rare among modern Hungarian-speaking populations [nm in Romania] (Zerjal et al., 1997; Lahermo et al., 1999; Rootsi et al., 2000; Semino et al., 2000a, 2000b; Tambets et al., 2001, 2004). This rarity could be due to extensive gene flow into the Hungarian-speaking population before their arrival in modern Hungary, or in the eventful centuries afterwards. <br><br>Two of the skeletons that were anthropologically Caucasoid-Mongoloid hybrids carried the Y-DNA haplogroup N3 (later ramed N1c) while one of them carried the Caucasoid mtDNA haplogroup H. This, along with the evidence from modern-day Hungarians, shows that the Magyar invaders had intermarried with local European tribes, greatly watering down Mongoloid genetic and physical traits among those who continued to speak the Hungarian language.<br><br>&quot;Our data suggest that the Tat C allele, which is widespread in Uralic-speaking populations, was substantially present in the ancient Magyar population when they crossed the Carpathians and settled in the Carpathian Basin. This contrast, despite the relative linguistic stability, may be attributed to a combination of the and of the effects of a number of substantial post-Magyar immigrations and incursions. <br><br>As with other Europeans, the Y chromosomes are characterized by early lineages derived from Paleolithic inhabitants, and by a minor impact of Neolithic and post-Neolithic migratory episodes","filename":"gene3","ext":".jpg","w":403,"h":296,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1490973656191,"time":1490973656,"md5":"uxWvzaMQvMaVf5aMZtFtmg==","fsize":17203,"resto":119054545,"id":"uDVuaAET","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":119065258,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)11:22:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119054745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119054745<\/a><br>...and, thread\/.

With his men suffering from dysentery, and continuous bombardment from the plateau, Eugene, aware that a decisive victory alone could extricate his army, decided to attack the relief force. On the morning of 16 August 40,000 Imperial troops marched through the fog, caught the Turks unawares, and routed Halil Pasha&#039;s army; a week later Belgrade surrendered, effectively bringing an end to the war.

It was dedicated to the victory in the Dacian Wars (now Romania). <br><br><br> The Roman army was ambushed and defeated at the First Battle of Tapae by Diurpaneus who was subsequently renamed Decebalus (Dacian for &quot;the Brave&quot;) and who, as a consequence, was chosen to be the new king. Fuscus was killed and the legions lost their standards, adding to the humiliation.[6] In 88, the Roman offensive continued, and the Roman army, this time under the command of Tettius Julianus defeated the Dacians at the outlying Dacian fortress of Sarmizegetusa, also at Tapae, near the current village of Bucova. <br><br>The conclusion of the Dacian Wars marked a triumph for Rome and its armies. Trajan announced 123 days of celebrations throughout the Empire. Dacia&#039;s rich gold mines were secured and it is estimated that Dacia then contributed 700 million Denarii per annum to the Roman economy, providing finance for Rome&#039;s future campaigns and assisting with the rapid expansion of Roman towns throughout Europe.[5]:8 The remains of the mining activities are still visible, especially at Ro\u0219ia Montan\u0103. Legions XIII Gemina and V Macedonica were permanently posted in Dacia. The conquered half (southern) of Dacia was annexed, becoming a province while the northern part remained free but never formed a state.<br><br>The two wars were notable victories in Rome&#039;s extensive expansionist campaigns, gaining Trajan the people&#039;s admiration and support. The conclusion of the Dacian Wars marked the beginning of a period of sustained growth and relative peace in Rome. Trajan began extensive building projects and was so prolific in claiming credit that he was given the nickname Ivy.[5]:8 Trajan became an honorable civil leader, improving Rome&#039;s civic infrastructure, thereby paving the way for internal growth and reinforcement of the Empire as a whole.<br><br>http:\/\/www.nationalgeographic.com\/t<wbr>rajan-column\/article.html<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Traja<wbr>n%27s_Dacian_Wars","filename":"trajann","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1537,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490976992088,"time":1490976992,"md5":"yitbkcjeuRGmz++\/+Vfxiw==","fsize":526519,"resto":119054545,"id":"uDVuaAET","country":"RO","m_img":1,"country_name":"Romania"},{"no":119070581,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)12:21:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119057253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119057253<\/a><br>Underrated","time":1490977266,"resto":119054545,"id":"oN7KPlYm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119070939,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)12:24:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"No problem.

An explanation is that the human sound is carried by the wind which means that our language makes\/is the connection between the nature and the humans.<br><br>After some research we found out that the only language the sounds from the nature are written and read the same as they are heard in the nature, prooves that here, on this land was born the first articulated language, the first fonetic language. If we are open minded, we can understand that the Verb means movement, dynamics, life and from each verb, a whole family of words was born.<br><br>Thus, the verb TO BE ( a fi), translated in 90 languages, makes us see that in romanian language only, the root of the word is kept. In the rest of the languages, word families are just word puzzles. For example:<br><br>a fi - fiu- fiica - fiinta<br>to be- son- daughter - being<br>sein - sohn-tochter - wesen<br><br>The same for the verb &quot;to ask&quot;- &quot; a cere&quot;<br>a cere- cerere- cerinta- cersetor- cercetare<br>ask- request- demand- beggar- research<br>Fragen- Anfrage- Nachfrage- Bettler- Forschung<br>Here is another special situation- the root is &quot;cer&quot; from &quot;a cere&quot;(to ask). Cer is in romanian language also a noun, &quot;the sky&quot;. That makes us understand the connection between human mind and the infinite sky- anything we will think or want from the sky, we will get because the Earth is part of the Sky. In hindi, the word &quot;cer&quot;(sky) is translated as &quot;akasa&quot; ( like the romanian &quot;acasa&quot; which means &quot;at home&quot;). That can be explained. The people from our land, Tracia, gave the information to the hindi people that &quot;the sky is at home&quot; because we came from the sky and the hindis called their sky- &quot;akasa&quot;. See when Ghilgames says he is going west, to the home of his ancestors.<br><br>Further research on the topic: Mircea Eliade did, and Coulianu.

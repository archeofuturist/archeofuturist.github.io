You have young people wasting precious hours on this shit when they should be devoting their time to STEM topics or otherwise working for pay, and it&#039;s all so some teachers&#039; union can create an artificial need for employment.<br><br>I hope one day the traditional model of education is disbanded entirely, from the buildings to the fluff subjects to the bureaucracy. Just put the content online and make people do it from home. The savings in energy alone would be immense when you no longer need to transport millions of people to a physical location. Also without the fluff topics, you could potentially graduate people from high school and university two years earlier than now.","time":1490125717,"resto":117660545,"id":"y+iV2p9t","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117661761,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)15:50:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117661612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117661612<\/a><br>I know that feel, leaf","time":1490125800,"resto":117660545,"id":"28ycibeg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117662231,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)15:54:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117661761\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117661761<\/a><br>You should quit then, not even kidding.

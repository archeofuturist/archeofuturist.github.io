the street. the truth is that there&#039;s more demand for a certain type of adoption than there is supply of kids, and that&#039;s for healthy, white infants. parents looking to adopt often end up going outside america to countries like china and russia because there aren&#039;t enough desirable adoptees in america. the kids that end up in orphanages are the ones no one wants, including fags. they&#039;re older kids (like toddlers to teens), kids with diseases or mental retardation, or nigger spawn.","time":1490058911,"resto":117558208,"id":"+e1PQvai","country":"US","country_name":"United

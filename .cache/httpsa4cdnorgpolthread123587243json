Like I said contracting is at a low right now and really isnt as hot as it used to be. Lots of low intensity stuff in north africa due to oil iraq\/syria is a little too hot for PMCs. You have some guys backing the saudis in yemen and the usual private &quot;security&quot; teams globally but it is nowhere near the oldschool blackwater videos.<br><a href=\"#p123588419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123588419<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why? Tons of nations are in a state of war, and wherever there is war, there is a profit to be made. <\/span><br>If your country is at war it is either poor or rich, if its rich your military has a 99% chance of holding its own against rebels or other aggressors. If it is poor (syria) your military is most likely in a shit position and going to collapse regardless of how many PMCs are added (Libya). You lose a guerilla battle as soon as you add foreign PMC boots on the ground, the international community and your own citizens will grow suspicious. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And those that want to make a profit require men to do the task.<\/span><br>Unless your country is 4chan you probably have people reproducing and creating more men who are part of your country. Its not rocket appliances.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If other nations\/organizations hire American PMCs, will the US government consider them hostiles?<\/span><br>Not really but most of these stick to American interests. There would be domestic pressure on logistics, financial and other stateside services required to support the guys on the ground if something nasty came up. Rarely have PMCs acted against established interests (executive outcomes, american citizens in rhodesia,etc) and every time they have faced some major issues.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kAu<wbr>JbaBNrsM","time":1493620832,"resto":123587243,"id":"chrnG4B5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123589369,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:44:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why is it mainly westerners that join PMC outfits?

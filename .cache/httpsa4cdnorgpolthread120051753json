Trump would be personally blamed for any deaths out of Syria in the future, and everyone and their mother would continue to double down on attempts to oust and disable every aspect of his administration on the back of him being a traitor to American interests and now basic human rights. In that way, he had no choice but to strike somehow. Even so, he did mitigate the damage as much as would be reasonably possible.<br><br>Now, though, it seems like the entire Western world is praising him for the move. The Russian narrative appears to be broken, and for the first time in months he actually has the media supporting him.<br><br>What matters now is what he does next. If he pushes for major escalation and US military involvement in Syria, that would be a bad move. He&#039;d gain more mainstream support but distance himself from his core constituency, none of whom want the US involved in another overseas war, and obviously increased tensions with Russia would be a major negative. On the other hand, if he manages a balancing act of not directly engaging Syria yet purportedly being against them, he could theoretically make gains in every political realm.<br><br>The issue is to &quot;attack&quot; Assad enough that the media and foreign powers support him, but not enough that ISIS makes any gains.","time":1491611465,"resto":120051753,"id":"W6QFjn0n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120055888,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)20:41:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120052348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120052348<\/a><br>Ok hotpockets calm down its not good for a man your size to get so worked up","time":1491612061,"resto":120051753,"id":"G3NQ1jBv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120056526,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)20:45:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120051753\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120051753<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;CRASHING THIS TRAIN!!<\/span>","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":58,"tim":1491612339576,"time":1491612339,"md5":"KtmyO9o20rc+VPKcNoBIyg==","fsize":200694,"resto":120051753,"id":"7s2C4Io2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120056663,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)20:46:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120051753\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120051753<\/a><br><br>777 kek dimension chess.","time":1491612394,"resto":120051753,"id":"w8UDDXu0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120056673,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)20:46:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120054529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120054529<\/a><br>lol such gymnastics","time":1491612397,"resto":120051753,"id":"9MVWyzc5","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120056977,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)20:48:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120053773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120053773<\/a><br>That&#039;s sounds actually appealing","time":1491612535,"resto":120051753,"id":"jOY66lKo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120057435,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)20:52:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Setting the chess pieces in place for a checkmate.","filename":"1491067610011","ext":".jpg","w":980,"h":1028,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491612734630,"time":1491612734,"md5":"BR7sR5rQdR4kmDSw6yGGwQ==","fsize":236644,"resto":120051753,"id":"gisZsF\/A","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120057604,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)20:53:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120056977\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120056977<\/a><br>I know what the goyim want","filename":"1475490382373","ext":".jpg","w":778,"h":682,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":109,"tim":1491612812860,"time":1491612812,"md5":"110IQIMhNVQvN8Js7NiO\/w==","fsize":138851,"resto":120051753,"id":"i912FYLK","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120057683,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)20:54:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120056673\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120056673<\/a><br>Literally basic politics.

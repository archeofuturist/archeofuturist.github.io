On Tuesday, Lambda Legal joined the suit, which seeks damages for breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and the intentional and negligent infliction of emotional distress. Zawadski and Gaspari aren\u2019t suing the funeral home for engaging in anti-gay discrimination because Mississippi does not protect LGBTQ people from refusal of service. Indeed, the state\u2019s notorious HB 1523 actually protects businesses\u2019 right to turn away LGBTQ customers\u2014though the courts have put that law on hold for now.<br><br>Initially, the nearby Picayune Funeral Home seemed like a perfect choice, and Gaspari paid the company $1,795 to transport and cremate Huskey\u2019s body once he passed. But when Huskey died and the nursing home contacted the funeral home to pick up his body, it refused to do so. The funeral home had discovered that Huskey\u2019s next-of-kin was his husband, and realizing Huskey was gay, informed the nursing home that it did not \u201cdeal with their kind.\u201d","filename":"urn","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493761337888,"time":1493761337,"md5":"V1p5v7PgCP\/FWUdDGSQAxQ==","fsize":71251,"resto":0,"id":"W5xv9RYu","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"man-sues-antigay-mississippi-funeral-home-for","country_name":"United States","replies":15,"images":1,"omitted_posts":10,"omitted_images":1},{"no":123826000,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:57:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123825610\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123825610<\/a><br>The issue is more specifically if refusing to serve LGBT people can be justified by sincerely held religious beliefs, or if such laws are unfairly preferential to Christians, which the Supreme Court here has as of yet refused to rule on.","time":1493762234,"resto":123823900,"id":"W5xv9RYu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123826069,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:57:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123823900\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123823900<\/a><br>Why would they cremate him when he&#039;s already a flammer","time":1493762265,"resto":123823900,"id":"MSbFCL0E","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123826127,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:58:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123825563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123825563<\/a><br>Religious rights should be subserviant to equality rights since religion is by definition chosen but you don&#039;t choose your sex\/race\/ethnicity\/sexuality...","time":1493762295,"resto":123823900,"id":"huuocRIA","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":123826148,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:58:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123826000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123826000<\/a><br>you should be able to refuse whoever you want for whatever reason. private business is not the federal government.","time":1493762300,"resto":123823900,"id":"rpGzKg6F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123826276,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:59:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123826127\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123826127<\/a><br>religious freedom is in the constitution, gay freedom isn&#039;t, it&#039;s a made up right. we cannot accept that behaving unnaturally is a human right.","time":1493762354,"resto":123823900,"id":"rpGzKg6F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123821602,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:24:20","name":"Jesus of Nazareth","sub":"Last turns of risk continued!","com":"will update with last turns so go for broke you broke bitches","filename":"IMG_3163","ext":".jpg","w":589,"h":483,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":205,"tim":1493760260891,"time":1493760260,"md5":"uCp6NSKzso+ED3wRzDy1JQ==","fsize":89990,"resto":0,"id":"IYeJonar","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"last-turns-of-risk-continued","trip":"!!xjtXCsL1lr+","country_name":"United States","replies":44,"images":10,"omitted_posts":39,"omitted_images":10},{"no":123826050,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:57:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123825856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123825856<\/a><br>posting more like this, maybe you&#039;ll find your favorite","filename":"1492378020742","ext":".png","w":5500,"h":2632,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":59,"tim":1493762253958,"time":1493762253,"md5":"WQmYg0hVNXvVkajCRetHaQ==","fsize":968940,"resto":123821602,"id":"QlomqCz6","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123826114,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:58:08","name":"Risk OP","com":"<a href=\"#p123825904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123825904<\/a><br>I&#039;ve started a medieval risk thread:<br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123825731#p123825731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123825731<\/a>","time":1493762288,"resto":123821602,"id":"2EMJ6Chk","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":123826117,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:58:08","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1470468449432","ext":".png","w":4266,"h":2612,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":76,"tim":1493762288505,"time":1493762288,"md5":"J2Idtxr+sARr8WVmGu820g==","fsize":962860,"resto":123821602,"id":"QlomqCz6","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123826199,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:58:44","name":"Alien Invasion (+19)","com":"<a href=\"#p123826050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123826050<\/a><br>This.

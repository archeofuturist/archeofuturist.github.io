I am the weird guy that nobody wants to talk to because my interests include firearms, working on vehicles, outdoorsy stuff, not being a bitch and pursuing intellectual and spiritual wellbeing instead of material excess and shit. I have a couple leads on jobs there and more than enough cash to float me a few months while I look and crash in my brother&#039;s spare room.

Ivins alone, and likely had involvement from actors within the US government in order to scare people and allow the PATRIOT act to be rammed through congress)). I almost never talk conspiracy theories with women I&#039;m interested in (occasionally, I&#039;ll argue something stupid like chemtrails or 9\/11 being an inside job just to piss people off, I&#039;m a convincing enough debater that I can generally raise points others can&#039;t respond to and in effect win the argument). I did date a girl for a while who was with me on JFK so we did talk about that a bit.

The other anon is correct in that they don&#039;t often act directly.

They are of course useful idiots, disposable. If things go belly up they&#039;ll ditch them and leave them to their fate. In fact most Jews themselves occupy this space as well.

Maintaining relationships with people who are culturally dissimilar to yourself is harder than maintaining relationships with those who are the same as you.<br><br>Consider a friendship with a Muslim. They aren&#039;t going anywhere on Fridays, specially not the pub. Special dietary requirements mean going out for dinner is a curry. Their patriarchal culture means they can&#039;t hang out with women and they&#039;re excluded from the Western dating game except for when it&#039;s a relationship that doesn&#039;t go anywhere.

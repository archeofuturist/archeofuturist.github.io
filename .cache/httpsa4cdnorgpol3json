Ban phones at the dinner table and make sure you ALWAYS eat dinner together. Don&#039;t start trying to raise them right at 7 years old. Start when they are 1. Don&#039;t let people tell you they are &quot;just a baby&quot; because that bullshit makes shitty people. Children will push boundaries, that&#039;s what they do. Don&#039;t be cruel and NEVER use the &quot;cause I said so&quot;. Always have the actual reason you say no. As they grow up give them as much responsibility as they are willing to take on and allow them more and more freedom. If you treat them like mini adults they will act like it. When they fuck up take those freedoms away and slowly return them. Never give in on punishments (early ungrounding, etc.) and always stick to your word. If you say you will do something, do it. If you say you will punish them for something, do it. Remember that you are the example. Intelligence is genetic but personality can be influenced by environment. Provide love and structure, and above all lead by example.

Even in ultra-developed metropolises like Rome. I mean, I can&#039;t solidly speak for every single person in the ancient world but as a rule, people did move around, they did socialise, they slept at nightfall and woke up at sunrise to work. Married at age 14-16 and usually a father a year into that marriage. People didn&#039;t have time nor the capability to spend their minutes and hours as they do now, which is all vanity. Life was also very short for most. 3 out of 5 children wouldn&#039;t live to adulthood and a near majority of women would die in childbirth. <br><br>I think you&#039;ve made a really philosophical argument in relation to the modern world. But I don&#039;t think its comparable to Rome since Rome suffered all the problems of a pre-modern state. Extremely high infant mortality, disease, lack of medicine, constant famines, war, etc and had nothing comparable to a modern day McDonalds, and their markets would look pretty shoddy even compared to a modern rundown supermarket. Food selection was something else drastically different.<br><br>On a bigger scale, I&#039;ve heard people make a somewhat similar argument in regards to the Pax Romana, having claimed it contributed to the Fall of Rome by ridding it of its former military dominated culture but like I said that&#039;s on a bigger scale and not so much individual laziness like you described.<br><br> I don&#039;t think life needs to be as difficult as it was for the first humans to walk the earth, but I agree we&#039;re turning into lazy fucks.","time":1492784397,"resto":122120516,"id":"G+AiPV1b","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122140282,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)10:22:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122131449\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122131449<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;America is the &quot;feet of clay mixed with iron&quot; in the Bible prophecy of Daniel.<\/span><br><br>No, that was the original Rome. <br><br>The statue\/Rome was then struck by &quot;a rock not cut out by human hands&quot; that smashed the statue and then &quot;became a huge mountain and filled the whole earth.&quot; Dan 2:34-35.<br><br>The rock &quot;not cut out by human hands&quot; was Jesus and\/or Kephas\/Petros\/Peter.

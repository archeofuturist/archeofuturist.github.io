It involves our beloved founders who were active participants in liberalism, so sit tight and pop some popcorn.<br>It all began five hundred years ago--to the year, actually--with the Protestant revolt. The new doctrine of private interpretation was enshrined in a new religion which took the Scriptures of the Church and reinterpreted them according to each and every person&#039;s intellect. Not much different than taking someone else&#039;s work and interpreting their work for them. This principle, in practice, split Europe from its historical patrimony and cut off huge swaths of her from the Church. Princes, caring little for religion, saw opportunities to loot Church wealth and property. Oh, Reformation indeed!<br>Theology aside, the principle of private judgement was burning in the hearts and minds of men all over Western Europe. This theological principle soon became a philosophical principle, and Protestants sick of the &quot;constraints&quot; of Christianity began setting their mental axes to philosophy. Humanism was born, and further was developed into secular humanism as the Greeks fled West to escape Mahometan persecution, bringing with them their pagan texts which previously had been interpreted in a Christian light--now were unleashed in their pagan interpretation. This was Renaissance.","time":1490679838,"resto":118611144,"id":"2E4kHeVR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118617274,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:44:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118611144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118611144<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118617224\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118617224<\/a><br><br>Those revolutionaries whose fathers thumbed their nose at the Church, and they who tended to the iconoclasm of Christian philosophy set to realize their philosophies in the socio-political realm. After all, Patriarchy is representative of God, and who better symbolizes this authority than the King? Enter the French Revolutionaries and classical liberalism. Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9, they said. Overthrow of altar and of throne.<br>This wonderful time was called the Enlightenment. These men were so enlightened, they set their axes to the seven day week, murdered the clergy and Catholic faithful, looted the churches (much like their Protestant ancestors), enthroned a prostitute on the altar of the Paris cathedral and founded the Cult of Reason! These enlightened individuals were the bloody result of that wonderful, God-given philosophy of classical liberalism which put the rights of man over the rights of God.<br>No longer would God have any representative over the people. The State would be indifferent! Truth is relegated to a subjective, personal phantasm that probably doesn&#039;t exist, except to the State, that is, whose only truth is itself and power.<br>I hope you can see how classical liberalism was just one of several movements in history that has led to the absolutely depraved, moonbat liberalism we have today.

Most men want sex more often than most women, but the average difference isn&#039;t so great that a compromise can&#039;t be made, in my opinion. Of course there are many medical reasons and psychological reasons that both a man and a woman might not want to have sex at some time but the partner should put the health of the other person and the relationship over the fulfillment of their own sexual gratification if something is wrong. Relationships are about learning to give and take in a trusting and honest way that benefits both parties as positively as possible.","time":1490679353,"resto":118587180,"id":"9zhOSRwr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118617219,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:43:56","name":"MerkelEstHitler","com":"Those are some big tiddies","time":1490679836,"resto":118587180,"id":"M87sZtMY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118615212,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:21:17","name":"Anonymous","sub":"ITT we agree with liberals but for all the wrong reasons","com":"I&#039;ll start: abortion is good because half a million african american ba ies are killed every year","filename":"1490226601520","ext":".png","w":418,"h":359,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":214,"tim":1490678477402,"time":1490678477,"md5":"2riZbnsAkwomXtiE3hwIkg==","fsize":13507,"resto":0,"id":"isZB06Gu","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"itt-we-agree-with-liberals-but-for-all-the-wrong","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":2,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":2},{"no":118615967,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:29:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118615212\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118615212<\/a><br><br>Not sure if bluepilled troll thread or redpilled troll thread<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Gr8 Poe&#039;s law m8<\/span>","filename":"thumbs_up","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":845,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490678990541,"time":1490678990,"md5":"ItDytZkZumux09IYGWzRhA==","fsize":73727,"resto":118615212,"id":"NUJDKKGF","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118616090,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:31:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118615967\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118615967<\/a><br>the ones you&#039;re not sure about are the best ones Desu<br><br>have you seen that Boston Antifa Youtube channel? that stuff is pure gold","time":1490679070,"resto":118615212,"id":"isZB06Gu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118616784,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)01:38:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118616090\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118616090<\/a><br><br>Nah I haven&#039;t.

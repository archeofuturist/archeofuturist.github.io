Russia you guys are alright in my books so hopefully our two countries don&#039;t oppose each other on a battlefield .

Australia we probably will be on the same side no doubt so yea. Iran and North Korea you guys will probably fight us if you decide to join in. I dunno whoever else I guess wants to fight on either side. start building those bomb shelters. Also if the draft is enacted how will the west cope? I&#039;m guessing millions of snowflake deserters and conscientious objectors.

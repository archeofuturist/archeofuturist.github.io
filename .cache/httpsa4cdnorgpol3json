It&#039;s a little old, but there is a clear amount of disparity among those who got arrested. I&#039;m sure the statistics haven&#039;t changed much, as there hasn&#039;t been any radical shift within the cultures of the three main groups. Regardless, I ask if anyone can bring up the reason why these statistics are racist for showing that blacks, although only 13% of the population, make up the most crime. The answer to that really is the difference in poverty put in place by black victim culture as they like to enjoy their welfare, but that&#039;s not my main argument anyhow. <br><br>I bring this up in light of Jontron being removed from Yooka-Laylee, a game that I&#039;ll most likely be pirating now instead of purchasing. Not like any of us pay for videogames anyhow. It makes me question why a company will remove someone because they use evidence to back up their opinion, but instead of offering any counterargument they remove him from the game. It&#039;s pretty wacky how Tim Allen hasn&#039;t been removed from Toy Story 4 after he called working in Hollywood as a Republican these days is like being in 30s Germany, but I suppose that&#039;s because he&#039;s been in 3 previous Toy Story&#039;s as opposed to Jontron being a mostly random

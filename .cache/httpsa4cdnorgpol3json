There is absolutely no reason a person cannot believe in both. God is a multi dimensional being. Who are you to say how he works.<br><br>Personally I find the notion of evolving insanely complex things by chance stupid. When things mutate too vastly different, they are born infertile or are born too early and stillborn. Because nature knew it fucked up. If mutation is good and encouraged, why is it treated by nature as a horrible wrong. I don&#039;t think evolution is false, I just think how it works should be questioned.<br><br>One (stupid) argument that life could not have come from the sea was the fact ancient fish would of had to of evolved a random hole in their face that was a indention and did not create a hole through the skull. (This would form a nose every modern animal has) <br><br>It would have had no advantage and would have actually created drag and slowed them down. Then they found a fish fossil. With a random hole indention in the middle of it&#039;s fucking face.<br><br> It had to have a reason for that hole that did not function as a nose, so it could in the future be a very advantageous body part. If it was uselessit would have never continued on. I think god nudges things to get past the useless crap phases and toward useful adaptations.

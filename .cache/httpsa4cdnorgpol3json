The entire discipline pivots around getting satori during your strike, and mutating into a thrust or feint, possibly another guard or a roverso. You learn on the longsword, then every weapon you pick up for the rest of your life works the same way (hand to hand too). It&#039;s better than Shaolin, it is better than Jeet kun do. These two martial arts are 2 of 4 Post Enlightenment martial arts in the entire world, and you cannot learn them without reading translations of ancient manuscripts and working on a professional basis in an international setting. Some of the manuscripts are still being translated, the entire community is still researching, rediscovering and refining these martial arts.<br><br>HEMA is the actual IRL renaissance of martial arts today.

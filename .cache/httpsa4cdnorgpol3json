For example, all cats are notorious hunters due to their instinctual traits and genetics, but I&#039;ve rarely heard of cats being moody and grumpy among other family members (cats). Whenever they drink the tap water, all will be fine but then after that they will usually tend to become grumpy. <br><br>The times that I&#039;ve forgotten to fill their water bowl up and it has rained, they will drink the rain water and then tend to be a tad more docile among their other family members. I have 3 cats, 4 generations apart from one another.","time":1490597017,"resto":118477790,"id":"Js2uZcfV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118478334,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)01:45:53","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Conservative ballots","com":"When will I receive my Conservative party of Canada ballot, and how will it come to me?","filename":"IMG_7307","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490593553553,"time":1490593553,"md5":"AyDIkuB7u2Xs6W\/DR6EF+w==","fsize":54458,"resto":0,"id":"VNtZAhVn","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"conservative-ballots","country_name":"Canada","replies":13,"images":7,"omitted_posts":8,"omitted_images":4},{"no":118482332,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)02:32:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118481931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118481931<\/a><br>Vote for Bernier for muh guns and libertarianism.<br><br>It seems like Provinces never do well under NDP leadership","time":1490596343,"resto":118478334,"id":"VNtZAhVn","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118482539,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)02:34:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118478437\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118478437<\/a><br>Same I&#039;m voting for Maxime and no one else <br><br>Also all this talk of weed by 2018 but maxime has already gon on record that he&#039;s for the decriminalization of weed","filename":"IMG_1710","ext":".jpg","w":3264,"h":2448,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490596480293,"time":1490596480,"md5":"fFeh+PEeke8Jq7W97c3fQw==","fsize":1227032,"resto":118478334,"id":"JRUco4Ex","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118482756,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)02:37:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118482332\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118482332<\/a><br><br>But I&#039;m left-wing on economics so I&#039;ll wait out for the soldier guy since both parties are equally shit on social issues.","time":1490596630,"resto":118478334,"id":"Bs\/rJQR8","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118483118,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)02:41:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118479984\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118479984<\/a><br>It&#039;s very simple dumbass, I will NEVER vote for a woman, and there are plenty others like me.

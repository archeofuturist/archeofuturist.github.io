So what do we know about April 26th? <br><br>-The US govt will be conducting what they&#039;re calling &quot;Operation Gotham Shield&quot; although I don&#039;t know much about that yet.<br>-Donald Trump promises &quot;big&quot; announcement on tax reform on April 26.<br>-It&#039;s Melanias birthday.<br>-It&#039;s a new moon, a supermoon in fact. <br>-Apparently there is some symbolism in masonic numerology having to do with 163 being the 38th prime number, But that&#039;s a stretch.<br>-April 25 is &quot;Highest Probability&quot; day for North Korean nuclear test. <br>-April 26 is a big day in North Korea, something having to do with &quot;April Revolution&quot;, I&#039;m not up to speed on that either.<br>-ASEAN summit<br><br>Anything else?

It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"21B7AAC7-8358-4B60-9EB8-334E01F21000","ext":".jpg","w":914,"h":570,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":155,"tim":1492952005436,"time":1492952005,"md5":"b82KQP2LQ1D7qnNsR5OqLw==","fsize":95737,"resto":0,"id":"IDKO1yIr","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":14,"images":2,"omitted_posts":9,"omitted_images":0},{"no":122422916,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)09:21:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122422444\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122422444<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Religion: a pursuit or interest to which someone ascribes supreme importance.<\/span><br><br>Granted it is a tertiary definition but Christianity wouldn&#039;t even agree with the primary two definitions.

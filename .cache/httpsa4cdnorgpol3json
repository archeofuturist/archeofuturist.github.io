Radiation inside the buildings is too high even for robots and humans would collapse in seconds. <br><br>Marine life is dying in pacific, you can google &quot;pacific die-offs&quot;. MSM is covering it up to avoid global panic. Tokyo isn&#039;t safe for 2020 olympics either. I would not be suprised if they were cancelled because by 2020 Japan is really fucked. People have radiation sickness symptoms and birth defects have gone trough roof. <br><br>Just remember my words if you don&#039;t believe me now. Fukushima will lead to major panic in the future when MSM cannot cover it up anymore. It&#039;s much worse than Chernobyl, reactor 3 had MOX-fuel made from plutonium, thats why it exploded critically, it wasn&#039;t hydrogen explosion. It has been estimated that by now Fukushima has released over hundred times more radioactive fallout into ocean than Chernobyl did into atmosphere.<br><br>America isn&#039;t safe either.

According to Giuseppe Sergi, the Mediterranean race was the &quot;greatest race of the world&quot; and was singularly responsible for the most accomplished civilisations of ancient times, including those of Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, Greece, Phoenicia, Carthage, and Rome. The Mediterranean race was also a major influence to the outside world in the modern era: Portugal established the first global empire in history, during the 16th century, followed contemporary by Spain, setting both nations in the highest dominion of political and economics powers in Europe.<br><br>C. G. Seligman also stated that &quot;it must, I think, be recognised that the Mediterranean race has actually more achievements to its credit than any other race, since it is responsible for by far the greater part of Mediterranean civilisation, certainly before 1000 BC (and probably much later), and so shaped not only the Aegean cultures, but those of Western as well as the greater part of Eastern Mediterranean lands, while the culture of their near relatives, the Hamitic pre-dynastic Egyptians, formed the basis of that of Egypt.&quot;<br><br>The Nazis explained this away by claiming that the elite warriors of the aristocracy of Ancient Greece, of Ancient Rome, and of the Spanish Empire and Portuguese Empire were Nordic Aryans who had migrated south. However, they did admit that those of the Mediterranean race in general and notably such geniuses of the Mediterranean race as Dante Alighieri, Michelangelo, Andrea Palladio, Galileo Galilei, Enrico Fermi and Leonardo da Vinci tended to be more creative than Nordics.","filename":"w","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":657,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":164,"tim":1490214887595,"time":1490214887,"md5":"evjkl+d+V1SuhuaY4p85Gw==","fsize":197515,"resto":0,"id":"0R4+v82C","country":"PT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-fact-that-the-mediterranean-race-is","country_name":"Portugal","replies":31,"images":7,"omitted_posts":26,"omitted_images":5},{"no":117828702,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:23:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"TFW &quot;The Master Race&quot; ruined the Roman Empire and essentially condemned Europe to the Dark Ages.<br><br>It took the Italians to unfuck Europe via the Renaissance, lol.","time":1490217792,"resto":117821061,"id":"wR16cd2r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117828824,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:23:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117821061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117821061<\/a><br>The only ones who have a reason to claim their superiority are Italians and French, im not sure how spain and portugal are related to them.","time":1490217838,"resto":117821061,"id":"+v1kfXnP","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":117829026,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:25:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117828824\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117828824<\/a><br>Anglos* <br>Anglos &gt; germans &gt; the rest of euros","time":1490217910,"resto":117821061,"id":"w1M5pvLX","country":"EG","country_name":"Egypt"},{"no":117829284,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:26:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117828824\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117828824<\/a><br>No one wants to claim any kind of superiority, but when a country with one million of people like Portugal in XVI century, discovered and conquered almost half of the world. meh","time":1490218012,"resto":117821061,"id":"0gcL2C1t","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":117829681,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:29:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117821061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117821061<\/a><br>The Mediterraneans showed the path, the Nordics followed the light.","time":1490218170,"resto":117821061,"id":"9MIo48nc","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117829175,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:26:10","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Post your smartphone somalis here","com":"Post your shoops here.","filename":"walking somali","ext":".png","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490217970392,"time":1490217970,"md5":"0VgXCAHrWKGDOK1cjUnPwg==","fsize":637430,"resto":0,"id":"eN8PWygm","country":"EE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"post-your-smartphone-somalis-here","country_name":"Estonia","replies":7,"images":5,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":1},{"no":117829535,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:28:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117829175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117829175<\/a>","filename":"best","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":2510,"tn_w":29,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490218111645,"time":1490218111,"md5":"IUOUIenUnqGc3f+wEIChig==","fsize":500066,"resto":117829175,"id":"XdVyX8N+","country":"IL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Israel"},{"no":117829561,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:28:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117829175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117829175<\/a>","filename":"Untitled-2","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490218126682,"time":1490218126,"md5":"1WZs6ArZLFChVprEscS47g==","fsize":1176460,"resto":117829175,"id":"gnFraY7e","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117829613,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:29:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117829298\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117829298<\/a><br>nice added touches kek","time":1490218145,"resto":117829175,"id":"XrF9Yp3Z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117829680,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:29:29","name":"Anonymous","filename":"stupid_bitch","ext":".png","w":769,"h":1000,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490218169644,"time":1490218169,"md5":"Pj3s7og\/f+7BVmbj1BJP6Q==","fsize":2259687,"resto":117829175,"id":"5kVzfwFU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117829711,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:29:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117829535\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117829535<\/a><br>noice compilation, kikebro","time":1490218181,"resto":117829175,"id":"eN8PWygm","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117829675,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:29:27","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Communism general","com":"Hello Comrades.

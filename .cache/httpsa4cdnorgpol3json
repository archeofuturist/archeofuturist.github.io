When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1480606481750","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491264276445,"time":1491264276,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"6KLUsVHB","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":282,"images":148,"omitted_posts":277,"omitted_images":146,"tail_size":50},{"no":119435712,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:27:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119401959\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119401959<\/a>","filename":"1487280460176","ext":".png","w":640,"h":656,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491283640208,"time":1491283640,"md5":"CLXpclPRDZvgDLB393gylw==","fsize":121284,"resto":119401959,"id":"gEaX1l\/x","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119435749,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:27:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119435654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119435654<\/a><br>Can tell you what happened we probably dumped Agent Orange oops","time":1491283662,"resto":119401959,"id":"0BphTS6y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119435818,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:28:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119435627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119435627<\/a><br>Maybe in the fantasy world it keeps trying and failing to create.

For example conservatives follow the base instinct of kin selection, where they give preference to those who are most genetically similar to them (which gives rise to racism and xenophobia). Liberals are more intellectually enlightened and realize that race and ethnicity are social constructs, and that we&#039;re all part of the same human species and that we should all share equally with each other and not give preference to those more genetically similar to us:<br><br>Even though past studies show that women are more liberal than men, and blacks are more liberal than whites, the effect of childhood intelligence on adult political ideology is twice as large as the effect of either sex or race. So it appears that, as the Hypothesis predicts, more intelligent individuals are more likely to espouse the value of liberalism than less intelligent individuals, possibly because liberalism is evolutionarily novel and conservatism is evolutionarily familiar.","filename":"1488689709430","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":1483,"tn_w":215,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491280725663,"time":1491280725,"md5":"cRYYLXCEpTYLrNnqmhvXCg==","fsize":60038,"resto":0,"id":"\/qLGLaGh","country":"IN","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"numerous-scientific-studies-have-shown-that","country_name":"India","replies":32,"images":6,"omitted_posts":27,"omitted_images":5},{"no":119433758,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:03:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119431630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119431630<\/a><br>what I want to know, if racialism is so bad why would it be a human trait, and in extreme cases it becomes a phobia of the other aka xenophobia, so why would it be a human trait?<br><br>I&#039;m a racist, but I don&#039;t hate niggers.

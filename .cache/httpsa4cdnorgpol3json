Syrian President Assad \u2013 who has been fighting for his life for several years, and is only lately feeling safer \u2013 suddenly decided to commit suicide-by-Trump. Because the best way to make that happen is to commit a war crime against your own people in exactly the way that would force President Trump to respond or else suffer humiliation at the hands of the mainstream media.<br><br>And how about those pictures coming in about the tragedy.

It\u2019s too \u201con-the-nose,\u201d as Hollywood script-writers sometimes say, meaning a little too perfect to be natural. This has the look of a manufactured event.<br><br>My guess is that President Trump knows this smells fishy, but he has to talk tough anyway. However, keep in mind that he has made a brand out of not discussing military options. He likes to keep people guessing. He reminded us of that again yesterday, in case we forgot.<br><br>So how does a Master Persuader respond to a fake war crime?<br><br>He does it with a fake response, if he\u2019s smart. <br><br>Watch now as the world tries to guess where Trump is moving military assets, and what he might do to respond. The longer he drags things out, the less power the story will have on the public. We\u2019ll be wondering for weeks when those bombs will start hitting Damascus, and Trump will continue to remind us that he doesn\u2019t talk about military options.<br><br>Then he waits for something bad to happen to Assad\u2019s family, or his generals, in the normal course of chaos over there. When that happens on its own, the media will wonder if it was Trump sending a strong message to Assad in a measured way. Confirmation bias will do the rest.<br><br>There is also a non-zero chance that Putin just asked Assad to frame one of his less-effective Syrian generals for going rogue with chemical weapons, and executing him just to calm things down.<br><br>I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll ever know what\u2019s going on over there.

The Deep State is more than just Obama&#039;s holdovers and the 7th Floor Group, it includes all the PNAC\/Neocons\/ZOG, Neoliberals and others who have been burrowing into the establishment for AT LEAST the last 30 years, and all hope is lost short of armed revolution. <br><br>God how I wish it were 1, but given that McCain met with the rebels last month...

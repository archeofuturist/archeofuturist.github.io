I did not want more refugees. Hispanics to get to change the rules because they refuse to learn the language. Women to get appointed a position just because they have vaginas. To limit my social media because someone&#039;s feelings can get hurt. And I dont even have guns, but they should not be taken away. I did not want Trump to win, I wanted Hillary to lose.","filename":"2024","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":919,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":119,"tim":1492008120197,"time":1492008120,"md5":"07PpJiEhZFm\/afWbRt\/ong==","fsize":207625,"resto":120759103,"id":"CMGZRJeT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120762529,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:42:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120761857\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120761857<\/a><br>sure thing kushner","time":1492008170,"resto":120759103,"id":"2UeeTtNZ","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120762688,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:44:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120761931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120761931<\/a><br>Video&#039;s right there you dumb fuck","time":1492008240,"resto":120759103,"id":"Qm7\/HwkP","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120758662,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:04:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is anybody else done supporting Trump because he became a neocon a few days ago?","filename":"3d0bd7e19d395a62e5da5b9e5fcc739a9409a4f259fdbbe35480ccd97dcb4060","ext":".png","w":616,"h":683,"tn_w":225,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492005887106,"time":1492005887,"md5":"jFZ7NSGl2AhhDDNf1t8PqA==","fsize":388590,"resto":0,"id":"vPoLxzIG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-anybody-else-done-supporting-trump-because-he","country_name":"United States","replies":85,"images":29,"omitted_posts":80,"omitted_images":26},{"no":120762379,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:41:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120762045\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120762045<\/a><br>This by far<br><br>He can and will be accountable for his actions regardless if they are good or bad.","time":1492008094,"resto":120758662,"id":"avS2StDD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120762389,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:41:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120758662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120758662<\/a><br>Supporting any politician - *instead of the policies we elect them to enact* - is idol worship.<br><br>Politicians are our employees, and it&#039;s up to us to manage them...or &quot;You&#039;re fired.&quot;<br><br>Supporting Trump - and not the policies we elected him to enact for us - is as dangerous as &quot;I&#039;m With Her.&quot; It&#039;s as ludicrous as being the CEO of a business and saying &quot;Even though he&#039;s not doing what I told him to do, I support Abe in accounting.&quot;<br><br>There has clearly been a coup, a takeover of the US gov&#039;t by globalists and the Deep State.

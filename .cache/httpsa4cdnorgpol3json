The first part is near Sather Tower where he flies the ISIS flag, and many Cal students wouldn&#039;t know what an ISIS flag looks like unless if they follow foreign affairs closely. You can see in the video that there are a lot of business and engineering-type students walking past, who have no interest in politics or time for political debates. They have that expression that I remember well of seeing what appears to be a nut and staring straight past him like he&#039;s a leper. Every rational Cal student develops this poker face after a semester or two in Berkeley.<br>The second part is at Sproul Plaza, on the Mario Savio Steps, which is a designated political rant space. It is right next to Telegraph Ave, so all the freaks walk by that spot, many of whom aren&#039;t Cal students. Those who are Cal students are the ones majoring in the more liberal-activist studies that you imagine when you visualize a &quot;Berzerkely&quot; student.

It just won&#039;t be on the previous terms in the 1930s and 40s when it was genuinely that. In reality I think the kikes are starting to lose too much ground to the Chinese on one hand and to the Gulf state Arabs on the other hand. Chinese are getting too rich and too powerful and the Arabs are now too rich and have what&#039;ll soon be the largest religion to manipulate into doing their will. They want to get back to the &#039;good old days&#039; of their peak power in the 19th Century while Europe was nationalist and conquering or genociding every other race. Kikes have been at their richest and most powerful when whites have been to feed off as a the host. It&#039;s always been the fucked up thing behind it all, as much as they hate us, they need us because they&#039;ve never had it better than when they were leeching off us at our peak, other races just don&#039;t cut it if they want to be the elite behind the scenes. <br><br>They want those days back and to deal with their enemies on both sides so they have no choice but make whites go back to their old ways again, only this time on their terms with more control over them so they can&#039;t revolt and turn on their masters again like 1933. They&#039;ll let us go full ethno-nationalist again and start having race wars with their enemies and less profitable host races but it&#039;ll be a carefully controlled ideology to consider them as equals standing up for their own version of ethno-nationalism and not an enemy. Any hint of anti-Semitism will be purged at the first sign. They&#039;ll use whites to destroy Islam and the overthrow the Arab elites now surpassing the elite kikes and use that as an example to put the Chinese off starting a fight. <br><br>We&#039;ll get our way again, but it&#039;s going to come at the price of our freedom.

People who are broke, in major debt, whatever have a problem with either not knowing how or not being able to plan for the future and build up cash. Workers can make up mad cash though. Take welding for example. You can make what doctors make with half the schooling years, and if you get higher into management and oversight then you can exceed white collars pretty damn well. You can literally make more than most doctors save maybe surgeons just by watching paint dry and pushing your nail into the coating. It depends on what you do with that money after earning it. Smart people who turn rich know to put it into things like real estate and to diversify their portfolio. Those who don&#039;t know tend to spend it on the now and immediate wants, squandering it all.<br><br>It&#039;s just like the idiots who happen to win lotteries. What do they do? They spend it all on boats, planes and big houses then can&#039;t keep paying them off a year after so they have to be repossessed. A smart person puts it aside to build interest and make more money so you can live off the interest alone after retiring.","filename":"GALOSENGEN","ext":".gif","w":400,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493580573504,"time":1493580573,"md5":"Lv0oBYeATvJQNQZGTK6iwg==","fsize":1004569,"resto":123508411,"id":"\/dIf5JSj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123505734,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)14:15:48","name":"Anonymous","sub":"POORS ...

Our client is a Chinese developer that is getting investment from other Chinese billionaires. It&#039;s mostly a scam to get money out of foreign countries (mostly China) and into the US. None of us are convinced that this project will make any money for our client, but we don&#039;t care, because we are getting paid regardless.

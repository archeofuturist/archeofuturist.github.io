They provide an outlet for the jihadis to go and fight a brutal dictator that we have never liked anyway. Radical Islam is going to continue to war with the US as they have over the last few decades, but when ISIS took the title for top jihadis, they gained ground, something al queda never did in any real way. This let the would be jihadis of the world have hope that they could actually win and form their caliphate. This attracts jihadis form the ME and the world to go fight in Syria and Iraq. However with the collapse of IS Mosul under way, and the Russian and Iranian support, ISIS was starting to look like a losing situation. So some tough words and some cruise missiles, we can bolster IS in Syria, and keep our enemies hope alive so they keep fighting killing each other, and dying in a land far from our shores. The longer they do this the better. <br><br>Now there are drawbacks to this theory, the first is if fighting spreads to the rest of the ME, that would effect the oil and our standard of living. Second is gas, or wmd. If that gets in the wrong hands it could be used on the US, and thirdly, ISIS could bring significantly more fighters to the US. I don&#039;t think we have had more attacks since ISIS became the top dog of the beheaders, but that could change, particularly if they thought they had no hope of starting their caliphate in the me.","time":1491627542,"resto":120058099,"id":"WamASyZQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120089411,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)00:59:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"GO GO TRUMP!

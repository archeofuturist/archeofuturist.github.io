Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039;

there&#039;s no unemployment in N. Korea. Everyone works MULTIPLE jobs and everything they&#039;re &quot;paid&quot;, is so heavily taxed. Their &quot;income tax&quot; rate is roughly 87% and everything they buy is so heavily regulated, on top of being government manufactured and mandated. Literally everything they earn goes back to Kim, whether through income tax or through the purchases they make. There&#039;s no private business in NK. If there&#039;s anything even close, it&#039;s someone trying to sell small personal possessions, handmade items or food (fruits, veggies, etc.) and they do it from a tiny, lightweight, easy to collapse and fold table they can run with. Personally selling or buying ANYTHING from anyone w\/o Kim approval, is punishable by public execution. <br><br>Additionally, someone mentioned food rationing and implied that 100% of what&#039;s rationed by the regime, is distributed equally amongs the civilians. This is absolutely, 100% incorrect. The regime collects EVERYTHING and food as an example, is distributed in weekly bundles but each family is only provided a very small portion of the whole. Imagine it like this... Kim collects 100%, keeps 50%, then distributes that remaining 50% amongst the civilians. This goes for everything he controls. Food, clothes, shoes, undergarments, TV&#039;s\/radio&#039;s, cell phones, DVD&#039;s, CD&#039;s, computers, lightbulbs, haircuts, etc. You shop through him for every basic need and for anything else to may WANT, you have to formally apply for and receive approvals for purchase in advance, for the rest. He either distributes it directly (food, electric, Internet, etc.) or makes you buy it yourself in HIS gov&#039;t shops\/stores... and then, he&#039;ll charge a mint for it, making it virtually impossible to buy for the majority. He justifies the astronomical costs by ensuring there&#039;s a lack of &quot;supply&quot; of what he provides. He never meets the &quot;demand&quot;.","time":1493741887,"resto":123768382,"id":"5VHezTYx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123783973,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)12:24:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123769176\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123769176<\/a><br>will i ever have gf","time":1493742259,"resto":123768382,"id":"PseVyZPo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123784094,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)12:25:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123783314\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123783314<\/a><br>very interesting, thanks for the insight.","time":1493742314,"resto":123768382,"id":"edyUGHBZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123784406,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)12:28:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123769176\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123769176<\/a><br>will rapists and pedophiles get capital punishment in the future?","filename":"sun_moon","ext":".jpg","w":466,"h":587,"tn_w":99,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493742484122,"time":1493742484,"md5":"kDPtU9R+GnR8tIlDC0Be9w==","fsize":59331,"resto":123768382,"id":"eZYgErnW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123784508,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)12:29:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123783314\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123783314<\/a><br>To note one more thing on &quot;unemployment&quot; in NK, they assign you jobs, hence no unemployment. You go to school until what we&#039;d consider 8th grade in the US. Then you get assigned a job. 98% of N. Koreans, men and women have a military post\/assignment. It&#039;s not optional. You&#039;re in the &quot;military&quot;, unless you&#039;re too young, too old, or physically\/mentally incapable of service. Too young is ok, but when you&#039;re too old or mentally\/physically disabled, you&#039;re literally starved out of society anyway. This is the truth. They literally cut the allotted percentage for each person in a household, if someone is deemed too old, sick or disabled. They also cut off medical assistance and treatment. <br><br>This is actually how many families starve. The family cares for their old, sick or disabled and they&#039;ll share their smaller household food bundled distributions, with them since their portions provided are meant to starve out the incapable. It&#039;s one thing to die or starve because you&#039;re too fucking lazy to work on your own when you can work, but instead choose to milk benefits from a system. It&#039;s another thing when the system controls everything right down to all of your food and money, then decides to starve you out.","time":1493742542,"resto":123768382,"id":"5VHezTYx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123779532,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:41:09","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Presidential election, second round debate","com":"Presidential election, second round debate<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Macron threatened to leave the stage after 30 minutes if he noticed that he was punching ball at Marine Le Pen.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.lalibre.be\/actu\/internat<wbr>ional\/emmanuel-macron-menace-de-qui<wbr>tter-prematurement-le-debat-si-mari<wbr>ne-le-pen-va-trop-loin-5908948fcd70<wbr>2b5fbe55dcf5<br><br>MACRON BTFO !!!!!!!!!!","filename":"907265C1CazOXgAAzyu8","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":549,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":225,"tim":1493739669626,"time":1493739669,"md5":"ml\/JD1g4vvJ1wIwTDITuoQ==","fsize":65926,"resto":0,"id":"Cu40wkWb","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"presidential-election-second-round-debate","country_name":"France","replies":33,"images":5,"omitted_posts":28,"omitted_images":5},{"no":123783494,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)12:19:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123782539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123782539<\/a><br><br>Good, nuke Israel.<br><br>I don&#039;t see how the Islamization of the West helps the Jew though, aside from shuffling millions of Muslims out of the land that the Jews want to steal.

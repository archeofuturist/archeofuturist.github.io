Lame.<br><br>Many of those cultures, especially like the Basque and Gaelic, tell stories of their race arriving in that land (where a more mystical race was already living) in boats from the sea. Atlantis was most likely on the Mid Atlantic Ridge, and just by looking at the currents it seems obvious that many survivors of the flood would have washed over to Western Europe. There are also random cultures in the Americas or on islands who share similar stories and sometimes end up having Aryan features- they could have easily been other Atlanteans who were washed out to sea ending up in random spots. Oh and of course, Egypt (whose people say that they were the Atlanteans) is right at the end of the Mediterranean where you can easily imagine strong currents pushing survivors. The Egyptians have plenty of cultural connections to Celtic history and the two groups literally share a ton of genes- I can&#039;t remember and would have to dig but I think I read some large percentage like 70% of British men share an Egyptian pharaoh ancestor? All of the things that Plato tell about Atlantis line up perfectly with the Mid Atlantic ridge. You can even see in the Odyssey that Odysseus is very clearly traveling the Atlantic and encountering lost survivors of Atlantis. Some historians have speculated that Odysseus traveled to or even came from Britain. <br><br>And it would explain why the first blue eyes we can find come from a swarthy blue eyed hunter gatherer in Spain.","time":1490900243,"resto":118945141,"id":"wbF1bivV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118953043,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:57:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118952364\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118952364<\/a><br>You think wyoming has a high density of people?

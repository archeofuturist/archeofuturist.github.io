The preservation of a culture depends on all the people that are involved in that culture - a never ending cycle that perpetuates itself to infinity (in this case, old people getting looked after by their offspring, given that the later have been looked after by the old people - hence the cycle). <br><br>Sadly, society nowadays is hellbent on throwing all the old ones into care houses, thinking that by doing that, they are compassionate or whatnot. In the end, it&#039;s just another egoistical thing we, humans, do - we take them from their homes, we pay a little more for that extra care in that house filled with other old people, all for what? So we can feel better at the end of the day - it&#039;s not even done for them, it&#039;s done for us.","filename":"mitropolitul-balan-casa-verde-sept-1940a","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":416,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1492000943461,"time":1492000943,"md5":"IgyClRDtYeYcf\/lu5jwk0w==","fsize":114709,"resto":120731049,"id":"JHyitMFb","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":120751074,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)08:43:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120737707\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120737707<\/a><br>Time to change and grow the fuck up faggot.","time":1492001017,"resto":120731049,"id":"ENRd82BP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120738870,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)06:01:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;learn in school and history books that Hitler refused to use chemical weapons during the war because he experienced the brutality of those weapons first hand during WWI.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Trump administration mentions this<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;leftists suddenly claim that Hitler used chemical weapons because he used a chemical to kill Jews.<\/span><br><br>Are these the alternate facts that they were talking about?

I supported Trump, because I saw authoritarian nationalist streaks that broke with the neoliberal\/neocon agenda.

Ba&#039;athism has clearly defined and undisputed ideological roots in European fascism. <br><br>and as far as the DPRK, I&#039;ve personally been a huge admirer of Chosun for years, the DPRK government maintains friendly relationships with various ultra-nationalist and anti-Semitic groups, including one that I&#039;m a member of. <br><br>Just because you see them as communist doesn&#039;t mean they are. You gotta provide some proof to back up your claim that it&#039;s a communist state. They have dropped Marxism-Leninism in favor of Juche Thought\/Kimilsungism in the 1970s, and removed the word communism (Korean: \uacf5\uc0b0\uc8fc\uc758, gongsanjuui) from their constitution in 2009. They moved portraits of Marx and Lenin sometime around 2011 or 2012 from the public squares. The works of Karl Marx or Friedrich Engels are not accessible to the public, they are forbidden reading because it is &quot;foreign thought&quot; that would pollute the minds of Koreans (which is true, communism is a mental virus). They have even called out the Jewish powers inside the US.<br><br>For me a communist state would be one that would be interested in an international proletarian revolution against the bourgeoisie and international worker&#039;s solidarity. That&#039;s not at all what Chosun promotes as an ideology, Korea is a strong collectivist, organicist, ethno-nationalist, military-first state that borrows a lot from German romantic nationalism and Japanese fascism.<br><br>https:\/\/www.counter-currents.com\/20<wbr>10\/11\/the-last-racialists-b-r-myers<wbr>-the-cleanest-race-how-north-korean<wbr>s-see-themselves-and-why-it-matters<wbr>\/","time":1492245805,"resto":121185300,"id":"HiJq0iN5","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121168707,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:22:31","name":"Anonymous","sub":"redpill me on the chair force","com":"i&#039;m leaving for lackland on tuesday. anything that my recruiter or the internet didn&#039;t tell me that i should know?","filename":"air","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":320,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492230151454,"time":1492230151,"md5":"PhAcbGmj0+kuiXG5nTrAcw==","fsize":32816,"resto":0,"id":"PLPQSETr","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpill-me-on-the-chair-force","country_name":"United States","replies":140,"images":11,"omitted_posts":135,"omitted_images":11,"tail_size":50},{"no":121189013,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)04:36:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121188742\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121188742<\/a><br>She&#039;ll cheat on you and have really good healthcare while she spends the money you make.","time":1492245369,"resto":121168707,"id":"CL6TDjNe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121189122,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)04:37:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121188502\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121188502<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If I get married before I go in, will that affect living conditions\/dorms etc?

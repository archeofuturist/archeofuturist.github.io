In school, that shit was as common as the weather. And at best, a month didn&#039;t go by unless there was some kind of special event or program dedicated to talking about discrimination and addressing their after effects.<br><br>But now, especially in the past ten years, there&#039;s a growing number of the very racists these movements were trying to upend. Increasing numbers. And these days, whenever you try to talk about discrimination, talk about prejudices, about intolerances, hate-crimes, etc. it seems they are either met with, or result in, the creation of more bigots.<br><br>Does anyone else find that baffling? It seems like the goal is simple enough: bring attention to cultural prejudices and educate people on it. Boom. Done. But somehow, it appears that it ushered more bigots as time goes by, and widened whatever gaps there were between groups of people in the first place. Doesn&#039;t make any sense.","filename":"youdontsay2","ext":".png","w":3072,"h":2048,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492581476253,"time":1492581476,"md5":"urhRkWcgfoT7lhT1TMuNlQ==","fsize":291946,"resto":0,"id":"qDqmtJSY","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-does-it-seem-like-theres-more-racists-and","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0},{"no":121810936,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:59:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Because a lot of the methods they use tend to be hostile and personal attacks on whoever they&#039;re trying to bring these issues up with. And those &quot;anti-racist&quot; movements have a bad habit of being filled with people who are just there to express their own prejudices, or because it&#039;s fashionable, all in an echo chamber that constantly reinforces this behavior, and make them think what they&#039;re doing is the right thing (a problem that exists with literally all social movements in the history of man). Nor do they fully take into account how they&#039;re audience will react to their message, and seem to believe that as long as that message, and their cause, is right, they shouldn&#039;t worry about putting effort into how it&#039;s communicated. Even though how you communicate this to people is what makes the biggest difference. And as a result, they end up making other people feel personally attacked by their message (keyword: FEEL), which only concludes in turning them to side with the very movements you&#039;re trying to fight.<br><br>Which sucks. Because racism and discrimination is still a huge problem in this country. But the groups trying to tackle those social issues have become very corrupt and unstable.","time":1492581540,"resto":121810807,"id":"QrpY\/qeY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121811328,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)02:02:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121810936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121810936<\/a><br>\/thread","time":1492581763,"resto":121810807,"id":"rtZrb2vY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121813996,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)02:32:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121810807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121810807<\/a><br>More diversity=more racism<br><br>Its really hard to hate something you have never come into contact with, thats why some of the most pozzed and liberal areas in america are those that are without any significant minorities.","time":1492583545,"resto":121810807,"id":"QMD3wb4t","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":121814397,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)02:37:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121810807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121810807<\/a><br>Racism is basic pattern recognition<br>You can&#039;t kill an instinct<br>And you also can&#039;t kill an idea<br>Doesn&#039;t matter how much brainwashing you use<br>You can&#039;t change reality.","time":1492583848,"resto":121810807,"id":"fNVZqmiK","country":"BO","country_name":"Bolivia"},{"no":121814896,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)02:43:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121810807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121810807<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why does it seem like there&#039;s more racists and bigots nowadays?<\/span><br>Because there&#039;s more (((diversity)))<br><br>&quot;Racism&quot; is (((their))) label for a realistic outlook on probabilities.","time":1492584220,"resto":121810807,"id":"W0VEI6vL","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121787824,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:38:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw Spencer at auburn was anticlimactic as fuck<\/span><br>why is \/pol\/ always wrong?","filename":"1489719126070","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":343,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":214,"tim":1492569531814,"time":1492569531,"md5":"uet1BWgS5FWr7fU83sSm+w==","fsize":33791,"resto":0,"id":"PZPP6Fue","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"tfw-spencer-at-auburn-was-anticlimactic-as-fuck","country_name":"United States","replies":111,"images":20,"omitted_posts":106,"omitted_images":19,"tail_size":50},{"no":121812381,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)02:13:30","name":"Dr. Adam H.

You can&#039;t just ignore it nor simply shout things like &quot;fallacy fallacy!&quot; when someone calls you out on a fallacy.

That means your conclusion does not follow from your premises. &quot;b-but you haven&#039;t proved me wrong,&quot; isn&#039;t a valid argument either and is only an attempt to shift burden of proof. A fallacy fallacy is also only committed when it&#039;s concluded that the conclusion of an argument is false just because the argument is invalid, which is fallacious. Obviously, the conclusion can still be right by accident. One does not commit a fallacy fallacy simply by citing how your argument is fallacious. Fallacies are not simply meaningless words you can nullify with some canned, banal comeback, like &quot;not an argument.&quot;<br><br>This shit is important for the conception of rational thought, and without it, you&#039;re all just a bunch of babbling idiots.","filename":"d0810c8d3a052045dfa55f5e7776822a[1]","ext":".png","w":3820,"h":2436,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":159,"tim":1492065874156,"time":1492065874,"md5":"0IEMjToFIEXfpV9ed3aCKg==","fsize":815218,"resto":0,"id":"MfEcK8ML","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-people-need-to-learn-to-recognize-fallacies","country_name":"United States","replies":107,"images":20,"omitted_posts":102,"omitted_images":19,"tail_size":50},{"no":120891988,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)05:46:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120879606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120879606<\/a><br>Indeed.

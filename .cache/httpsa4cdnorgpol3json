Some people have the false impression that Judaism calls for the destruction of modern Germanic peoples, and I argue this is untrue.<br><br>Germamia is identified in Talmudic prophecy (Megillah 6a-b) as a force that prevented the Romans&#039; expansion, as Teutons so did in the 2nd century. Their mention is not negative. <br><br>Retrospective commentaries have painted Germamia to be &#039;Germania&#039;, or Germany.<br><br>Rashi, a post-Talmudic medieval commentator living in 11th c. France states that &quot;Germamia&quot; is the name of a kingdom that is from Edom. Much later in the 18th century, R. Jacob Emden in his comments on Rashi suggested that Germamia refers to Germania.<br><br>The Amalekite connection is made with the idea that &#039;Aryans&#039; are Indo-Iranian-connected, and that miscegenation occurred under Sennacherib in 500 BC to make the Amalekites more mobile, but it is a point of fact that Germaniya prevented the spread of Roman anti-Semitism.<br><br>If Rashi was correct that Germamia is Edomite, then that would make sense that they are geographically-designated Amalekite (being of modern Jordan). Edom also consisted of Canaan, reinforcing the idea that Amalekites are a terrible force that will always deny Judaism.<br><br>I would like to ask your thoughts on this matter, \/pol\/, as it has wide-ranging impacts on politics today.<br><br>Interestingly, those Rabbis who apparently claim Germanic peoples to be of the Amalekite race - which is necessarily opposed to Judaism, according to the Talmud - may have a self-fulfilling prophecy in that Germany indeed has diametric opposition to Jews despite an historical relationship between their groups (Yiddish is Germanic).<br><br>Why isn&#039;t Egypt included in these dialogs more? Is it disingenuous power-seeking that groups Germans in as Amalekites, is it a self-fulfilling prophecy that attributes all enemies to Israel as Amalekites, or does the Talmud actually observe goodness in Teutonic peoples for their thwarting the Romans?","filename":"o013","ext":".jpg","w":870,"h":1236,"tn_w":175,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492478613225,"time":1492478613,"md5":"Kp5R5Vf5m6ItgkDcJ90otg==","fsize":191324,"resto":0,"id":"uhhbLvoS","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"talmudic-prophecy-and-germamia","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":2},{"no":121615674,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)21:24:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121615534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121615534<\/a><br>I meant THIS PIC related.","filename":"1492471486426","ext":".png","w":1793,"h":412,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":28,"tim":1492478683351,"time":1492478683,"md5":"8UsSrr8Ow0\/KT0vS6DMQBA==","fsize":212139,"resto":121615534,"id":"uhhbLvoS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121616309,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)21:30:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121615534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121615534<\/a><br>It is understood to those that know that genetics and memetics are hand in hand.

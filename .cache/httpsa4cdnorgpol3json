So there&#039;s that.<br>And as some anons have noted it is a decent deterrent. <br>However, there&#039;s more costs involved and its plainly just too peaceful for some crimes.<br>I believe it has a place in the penalty system, but it should not be the worst sentence. Because the only bad thing about it is the time leading up to the execution, after that its done pretty fast and the person never lives long enough to remember any pain(if any).<br>I&#039;m a firm believer of that a person should be penalized by the severity of their actions.<br>Let&#039;s say one person does a planned attack and takes out ten people, how would one death be able to make up for the mourning and loss of the victim&#039;s spouses, family, friends. It doesn&#039;t, it makes a nice headline but that&#039;s it, its like they pay back a part but die with the rest of the debt. <br> So in my opinion, if a person is beyond reform, they should be put through as much as a hell at at least of burden to society.

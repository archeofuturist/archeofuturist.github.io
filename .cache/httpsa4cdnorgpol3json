Even most Normie&#039;s were against it. If I remember correctly, UK polling showed 60% against the war, and the Stop The War March remains the largest protest march recorded in UK history.<br>None of that made the slightest difference. The corporate media spilled the government line and censored as much of the descent as they could. They only reported dissent when it was impossible to ignore, e.g. when Robin Cook (RIP) resigned. The very small number of journalists who broke ranks were hauled over the coals. Andrew Gilligan was one of the UK&#039;s best known journalists: He&#039;s now consigned to the periphery. His employer, the BBC, was then neutered.<br>Take this as a cautionary tale. Any and all attempts to dissuade the US from getting the war it now wants will be utterly futile. It doesn&#039;t matter how much &#039;truth&#039; you might uncover, because &#039;truth&#039; is meaningless. It&#039;s their narrative that counts, and mainstream history will record their narrative.<br>Final thought: Don&#039;t mistake me for a pacifist. The narrative is designed to conceal a deeper truth; one that has little relationship to the &#039;truth&#039;. These wars are not fought FOR energy, or FOR land, or FOR $. Those are merely variables in a geostrategic equation. They are &#039;unit&#039; classes in an RTS. The only true objective is to defeat one&#039;s competitors, for that is what they inevitably are. Life really is as predatory as the Theory of Evolution says it is, but the fragile masses must be spared that reality for the good of society.<br>My contempt for the PTB lies in my conviction that they&#039;re playing the game badly. China is the final boss, and to defeat China, one needs Russia on one&#039;s side. The West has decided that the best way to get Russia on its side is to subdue it and make it the West&#039;s vassal. That strategy is doomed to fail.","time":1492969934,"resto":122441218,"id":"lTDrzir+","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122456168,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)13:57:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122441530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122441530<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no build up<\/span><br>you sure you weren&#039;t a tadpole when GW2 happened?

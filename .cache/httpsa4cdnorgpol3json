You must be confusing me with someone else. I support President Assad and the Arab identity of Syria (its an Arab country with a Baathist ideology) but kurds are a part of the Syrian people and have rights in the country like every other Syrian.<br><br>Im against Kurdish nationalism like PKK and YPG, its a foreign funded nationalism aimed at dividing Syria. <br><br>Im not a fan of Erdogan, but Assad will protect the Kurds against him if they are Syrians , if they start saying theyre PKK, Rojava or YPG he wont care if Erdogan attacks them. This is why the best option for the kurds to ally with President Assad.","time":1490757801,"resto":118715471,"id":"GulAxrpy","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118740615,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)23:26:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118738375\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118738375<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118739872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118739872<\/a><br>Please lurk more.","filename":"962640238","ext":".jpg","w":5184,"h":3456,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490757972741,"time":1490757972,"md5":"bOJp3KuXcWWtx7XJqZDcbQ==","fsize":2206341,"resto":118715471,"id":"K53x26W+","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118740916,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)23:29:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118740326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118740326<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kurds<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rights<\/span>","time":1490758158,"resto":118715471,"id":"QGzwL\/k4","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118728611,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)21:33:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"What&#039;s his name again?","filename":"schneiderdan__130807143845","ext":".png","w":1338,"h":1398,"tn_w":239,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490751200400,"time":1490751200,"md5":"ir8uIKoQZBPUiEanW5Hx8A==","fsize":2242086,"resto":0,"id":"58B67Wpa","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"whats-his-name-again","country_name":"United States","replies":196,"images":63,"omitted_posts":191,"omitted_images":63,"tail_size":50},{"no":118740675,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)23:26:56","name":"Anonymous","filename":"12","ext":".webm","w":300,"h":184,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":76,"tim":1490758016292,"time":1490758016,"md5":"Z+TzJ9xFTR89aJ2Gjtc8yQ==","fsize":1600622,"resto":118728611,"id":"h5nj5Vzs","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118740779,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)23:27:50","name":"Anonymous","filename":"46363","ext":".webm","w":480,"h":205,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":53,"tim":1490758070728,"time":1490758070,"md5":"u48IBUizi8uRKqcSdJ+PhQ==","fsize":3000109,"resto":118728611,"id":"h5nj5Vzs","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118740845,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)23:28:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118738164\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118738164<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Stop with the anti-semitism.<\/span><br>You make me laugh.","time":1490758116,"resto":118728611,"id":"t9TOyhOn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118740854,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)23:28:43","name":"Anonymous","filename":"2353252","ext":".webm","w":320,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490758123131,"time":1490758123,"md5":"8rguaM4I0rxN5CgSVKfCjw==","fsize":3002190,"resto":118728611,"id":"h5nj5Vzs","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118740913,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)23:29:16","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1367394468873","ext":".webm","w":266,"h":270,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490758156392,"time":1490758156,"md5":"gKV+ubtcu5seINjZ596JVw==","fsize":794748,"resto":118728611,"id":"h5nj5Vzs","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118736561,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)22:46:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Was he \/ourguy\/?","filename":"carlin","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490755592962,"time":1490755592,"md5":"t4JTOqBnn9Pi0Y5Ww3Obww==","fsize":29888,"resto":0,"id":"2weY6ZEf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"was-he-ourguy","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":0,"omitted_posts":5,"omitted_images":0},{"no":118739341,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)23:13:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118736561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118736561<\/a><br>i bet if Carlin lived today he would be a lot further right.","time":1490757204,"resto":118736561,"id":"ihVvRVXi","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118739515,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)23:15:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118736561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118736561<\/a><br>He was literally \/pol\/ incarnate until nu-\/pol\/ from reddit came over and took this board.","time":1490757304,"resto":118736561,"id":"hKUXfI+8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118739599,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)23:15:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118736561\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118736561<\/a><br>for gun control as far as i can tell, i say mind control tool, like all mainstream media","time":1490757358,"resto":118736561,"id":"dgMJ2e9+","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118739914,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)23:19:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fuck no (((he))) isn&#039;t.

That it is just a huge hoax. At first I thought this was absurd. In school we were always taught about the 6 million\u2122 and how Hitler hated them for no reason and the Jews didn&#039;t do nothing and all those 1000 nations that kicked out the Jews since 4000 B.C just used Jews as a scapegoat for their problems.<br> <br>They always say the number 6,000,000\u2122 over and over again 6,000,000\u2122 this, 6,000,000\u2122 that. Apparently this number was being used way before WW2 started and the Jews were always claiming 6,000,000\u2122 of them were being killed. What is with the Jewish obsession of the number 6? Must be a (((coincidence))).<br> <br>I first started questioning this Jewish mythology when I first learned about Palestine. The Jews over there are killing babies and drinking their blood over Satanic rituals. I remember Jesus said something about the Jews being the Synagogue of Satan Then I see all these Jews killing thousands of Palestinians and stealing their land. They were doing exactly what Hitler claimed they said. This wasn&#039;t blaming them, the Jews were outright in the open in broad daylight committing their crimes<br> <br>Hitler said the Jews were trying to steal all of Germany&#039;s land and money. Then I found out about the Jewish November Revolution where Jews tried to invade Germany and turn it into a (((Communist))) dictatorship. The entire attack was by 100% Jews who attacked Germany. So much for being hated for no reason.<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Germa<wbr>n_Revolution_of_1918%E2%80%9319<br> <br>I thought the Jews didn&#039;t do anything and they are hated for no reason.

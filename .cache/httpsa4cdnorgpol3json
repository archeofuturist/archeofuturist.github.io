There is a controversy about the proper spelling of the word &quot;doxing&quot;; some write it with a double x, but that is a mistake.<br><br>The digraph &quot;xx&quot; is pronounced like j in Spanish or the &quot;ch&quot; in German &quot;ach&quot;. It is used with computers a replacement for the letter exx, which has a single stroke going down to the right and two parallel strokes going down to the left, because computers generally can&#039;t handle that letter. The exx is derived from the Greek letter chi, and pronounced like it; but since that Greek letter looks like our &quot;x&quot;, it had to be modified with an added parallel stroke when it was introduced into English.<br><br>Thus, we usually have to write the name of the oil company as &quot;Exxon&quot;, though its proper spelling is &quot;e exx o n&quot;. (Don&#039;t make the mistake of pronouncing &quot;Exxon&quot; like &quot;exon&quot;; you will appear unsophisticated.)<br><br>The exx also gives us an unambiguous way to phonetically spell the exclamation of disgust, &quot;yexx&quot; or &quot;ixx&quot;.<br><br>Since the word &quot;doxing&quot; is derived from &quot;docs&quot;, it should be written with a single &quot;x&quot;, as it is pronounced.","time":1493678428,"resto":123621058,"id":"QJrLrEXB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123685044,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:41:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123679100\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123679100<\/a><br>I like how cf moans about the &quot;alt-right blaming everything on da joos instead of being introspective&quot;, yet they&#039;re just as desperate to label everyone that disagrees with them a faggot<br>What a waste of time","time":1493678469,"resto":123621058,"id":"Nzk1omK5","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123685510,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:44:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123680091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123680091<\/a><br>Go back to 8kike, useful idiot","time":1493678675,"resto":123621058,"id":"JWOOvbvi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123667646,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)16:26:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hello \/pol\/<br><br>I&#039;ve been visiting \/leftpol\/ for a few weeks now and found out interesting things.<br><br>Many on here believe that communism is super duper big government that supports SJWs.<br><br>In reality, none of it is true. <br><br>I&#039;ve found numerous threads about liberal hate thread.

San Francisco dermatologist Andrea Hui says balding millennials are coming to her more than ever, asking her for everything from natural supplements like Nutrafol to more invasive procedures like PRP, which involves injecting your own plasma into your scalp. New York City stylist Angelo David has seen a \u201ctremendous\u201d number of young and balding clients too: \u201cThe new hair extension story is no longer short to long but thin to thick,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople want full and voluminous hair.\u201d One of his most recent clients, in fact, was a college student just shy of her 20th birthday who had severe hair loss. \u201cShe was devastated,\u201d he says, spending roughly $4000 on a customized, couture wig to cover up the issue.<br><br>One big reason for the follicle freakout? High stress, say both Hui and David. Indeed, millennials are more stressed out that any other generation, according to research from the American Psychological Association. And that stress can lead to hair loss, research shows. There\u2019s a condition called telogen effluvium, which happens when \u201csignificant stress pushes large numbers of hair follicles into a resting phase\u201d and then hair falls out, and one called alopecia areata, in which your immune system attacks the hair follicles, which can be exacerbated by stress. There\u2019s also a disorder called trichotillomania, in which stressed-out people feel an irresistible urge to pull their hair out.","filename":"1492763413132s","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":250,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493676414790,"time":1493676414,"md5":"lb828YT4AxrxrHU6BFMmOA==","fsize":8195,"resto":0,"id":"XDYYUblI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-the-actual-fuck-is-going-on-is-it-the-gay","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":4,"omitted_posts":9,"omitted_images":3},{"no":123684589,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:37:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123680658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123680658<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What do you mean I have to actually put forth effort?

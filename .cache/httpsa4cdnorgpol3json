They hired MDE because Nick (who was the one who actually negotiated the deal for the group) convinced AS and Mike Lazzo (who supported the show 100%) that they could make the show and do it super cheap. <br><br>Everything went to hell for Sam because of a perfect storm of behind the scenes bullshit and SJW terrorism against AS:<br><br>1. The Mary Sue and other SJW mafia websites started attacking AS because they didn&#039;t have any talentless SJW cows working at the network. They bullies the Rick and Morty creators into adding women writers (derailing the show in the process) but Lazzo refused to hire SJW cows to make their own shows, siting that he would not be bullied to put unfunny women on the air for quota. <br><br>2. Adult Swim cut ties with Brad Gelman, who did a series of specials on the network that got shit ratings. After not being able to get Adult Swim to approve any additional sketches, he tried to exploit the SJW mafia attack on the network to get them to hire his talentless wife, with her re-pitching HIS REJECTED COMEDY SPECIALS, with the eye of getting them greenlighted via affirmative action. Lazzo told him to get loss, so he goes public before AS could announce they were severing ties, by claiming that he was &quot;quitting&quot; AS because of sexism and the hiring of Sam Hyde, who&#039;s hiring pissed him off even moreso given how he was now unemployed. <br><br>3. The Buzzfeed writer who joined up with Gelman to shit all over AS for giving Sam a show on Adult Swim<br><br>4. Eric Andre, who hated MDE for their politics and created such a shit storm that both Andre and MDE got hit with a gag order by AS to keep them from bad mouthing each other. <br><br>5. Tim Heidecker. How did AS pay for MDE World Peace? By cutting the guest star budget for Heidecker&#039;s newest show &quot;Decker Declassified&quot;.

is the weakest (((ideology)))","com":"Fascism is for submissives looking for a strong man father figure. Those who follow fascists are by definition followers and weaklings.<br><br>Look up the etymology. Fascism comes from the term &#039;fasces&#039;; a bundle of sticks wrapped around (one could say in rapture to) an axe handle with a projecting axe blade.<br><br>This is the core metaphor that defines fascism. The metaphor being that the many must give their will power up to the one (usually a strong man leader).<br><br>This ideology is by definition about weak people looking to give up their own power or direction (and most often giving up their own rights and freedoms in the process). To usurp themselves, to be submissive... and ergo the whole ideology is one of weakness. Fascists are the most submissive and weak people in my opinion.<br><br>You know I&#039;m fine with people who want to be strong, who want to be an authority; but being a leader is about genuinely giving others help in exploring their own individual strengths, it&#039;s not about claiming the authority of a collective of submissives as if that makes you strong. It doesn&#039;t; it makes for the weakest ideology and followers possible. Fascism is the most deflationary, it poses the biggest lie, and is hence comprised of the biggest losers.<br><br>A human should be a human beyond all states; and hence able to inhabit all states. Fascism is nihilistic to individual authority and hence is nothing but a fragile empty shell that looks tough but ultimately hides deep weakness and as my title suggests; fascism contains some of the most submissive and damaged people possible. People in need of a genuine strength; but looking in the wrong place.","filename":"Willow-Sticks","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492732381942,"time":1492732381,"md5":"Ed0V0N8UwxqibWOyaHixBQ==","fsize":5860,"resto":0,"id":"4jJxrhJu","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fascism-is-the-weakest-ideology","country_name":"Germany","replies":65,"images":15,"omitted_posts":60,"omitted_images":15},{"no":122077393,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:39:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122065477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122065477<\/a><br>All of \/pol\/ must look into the following:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ETTORE<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OVAZZA<\/span>","filename":"IMG_1871","ext":".jpg","w":780,"h":496,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":79,"tim":1492738784513,"time":1492738784,"md5":"H5kQ2\/GXQ5SQN88aM6YDLQ==","fsize":78701,"resto":122065477,"id":"zaK5z1Kr","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122077403,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:39:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;fascism enhances and encourages the corruption of men<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;democracy rewards and sustains stupidity<\/span><br><br>somebody help me","filename":"16864431_1889767484597446_4265720019544681395_n","ext":".jpg","w":448,"h":359,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1492738793999,"time":1492738793,"md5":"5bWmgFYEe7k9ReiQNzKu4A==","fsize":15976,"resto":122065477,"id":"3kzvpygi","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":122077483,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:40:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122077403\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122077403<\/a><br>Fascism creates Israel the ME&#039;s only democracy...","time":1492738841,"resto":122065477,"id":"zaK5z1Kr","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122077665,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:42:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122065823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122065823<\/a><br>AntiFa are not fascists.

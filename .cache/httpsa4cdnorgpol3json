There&#039;s no greater Joy on earth than having children and trying your fucking hardest to make their lives better than your own. All that other shit you think you have to do before children means nothing. Its all just shallow wants. I pity all of you fools who think not having children will make you feel more fulfilled. I guarantee you on your death bed you will regret not having kids as you die your lonely empty deaths.","time":1492372734,"resto":121392601,"id":"RWSnh8+9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121404816,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)15:59:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121404241\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121404241<\/a><br><br>You learn more from going out and making mistakes than staying home and reading a load of old books.","time":1492372760,"resto":121392601,"id":"lLvqWDCs","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121401706,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)15:35:08","name":"Anonymous","sub":"We arent conservative","com":"We&#039;re all just disenfranchised classical liberals who hate Islam<br><br>Prove me wrong.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Protip<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You cant<\/span>","filename":"AESTETIC","ext":".png","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492371308170,"time":1492371308,"md5":"L9HGT0idUvq0Nd7KQp\/Ahw==","fsize":611049,"resto":0,"id":"+\/1Aczke","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-arent-conservative","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":2,"omitted_posts":7,"omitted_images":0},{"no":121404367,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)15:55:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"I just want to know what&#039;s true and real","time":1492372558,"resto":121401706,"id":"S95Xg\/pC","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121404454,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)15:56:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121401706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121401706<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;me<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ever having been even remotely liberal<\/span><br>not socially, not fiscally, just no<br><br>kys","time":1492372594,"resto":121401706,"id":"NBbBQZaz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121404639,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)15:58:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121404454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121404454<\/a><br>classical liberal is like founding fathers type stuff my dude.","time":1492372687,"resto":121401706,"id":"HRJrZdq8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121404710,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)15:58:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121401706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121401706<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We&#039;re all just disenfranchised classical liberals who hate Islam<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Prove me wrong.<\/span><br><br><br>We could do this.<br><br>People make a poll and monkeypoll or whateaver the side is called, where people give scores between 1 and 10 to questions of the political compass.<br><br>Then someone go to political compass and answer the questions with the best voted answer.<br><br>but no one will answer the monkey poll questions, so the answer will never be found","time":1492372712,"resto":121401706,"id":"4acWftpB","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":121404812,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)15:59:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121401706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121401706<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s a shitskin collectivist thinks \/pol\/ is a hivemind episode<\/span>","time":1492372760,"resto":121401706,"id":"j4AM+Qkv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121390929,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)14:10:58","name":"Anonymous","sub":"My sister wants to convert to Islam","com":"She&#039;s at college so I have limited contact with her, but apparently she is in love with an Iranian.

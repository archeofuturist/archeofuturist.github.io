My dad&#039;s family is from Damascus, and his mother left the country when she was young, apparently they had lots of trouble with Muslims while they were there, and my grandfather is a Maronite Catholic from Lebanon, so naturally because of all the sectarian divides in Lebanon he never liked Muslims. My dad picked this up from the. My mom is against Islam but mostly only because of my fathers rants and the beliefs she has adopted from anti-Islam propaganda.<\/span><br>I kind of face a similar problem. Neither of my parents are super religious, and they don&#039;t really practice Islam, except for not eating pork, fasting during Ramadan, and occasionally going to friday prayer or praying and making dua&#039;a when they need something from Allah. My dad is a marxist but comes from a hardliner family and he supports &quot;political islam&quot; and identifies as muslim. My mom is one of those stereotypical &quot;muh persian pride&quot; type southern california diaspora but also identifies as a muslim, and despite saying she has no problems with arabs I know she still holds some prejudice towards them, and since I am more than likely going to end up marrying an arab speaking Sunni, this could cause problems. But at the end of the day she just wants me to be happy and she would accept me marrying an arab sunni girl.","filename":"Imam_Khamenei","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":225,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":56,"tim":1491789520271,"time":1491789520,"md5":"5hvzK2uEF\/+GPncpLoVcpA==","fsize":127547,"resto":120340498,"id":"2GDWlUD2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120374351,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:59:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120358405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120358405<\/a><br>do you know what the word aryan means, you fucking moron? by definition they are indo-aryan. try opening a book instead of shitposting on this retarded board","time":1491789559,"resto":120340498,"id":"gwkqNyfK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120374111,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:57:08","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Humble water-filter salesman","com":"How did it end up that this guy is the only one making sense anymore?","filename":"1487729535282","ext":".jpg","w":980,"h":490,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491789428949,"time":1491789428,"md5":"7eu+Aq5BDaF7AcYUec63vw==","fsize":83760,"resto":0,"id":"yWEbY70j","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"humble-waterfilter-salesman","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":1},{"no":120374277,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:58:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VaN<wbr>tgHiwFeg","time":1491789519,"resto":120374111,"id":"vfJl8G31","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120374354,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:59:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120374277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120374277<\/a>","filename":"bwisrl","ext":".jpg","w":291,"h":173,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":74,"tim":1491789560485,"time":1491789560,"md5":"A0I\/RNdQyR83\/kq7nqhhDQ==","fsize":8429,"resto":120374111,"id":"\/szmmfsQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120363213,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)20:27:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"How do we fix this state?","filename":"massachusetts","ext":".jpg","w":417,"h":328,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":196,"tim":1491784058288,"time":1491784058,"md5":"8oA+0cbFCVXhrNtkoPAXng==","fsize":42344,"resto":0,"id":"p3EQ2Gnz","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-we-fix-this-state","country_name":"United States","replies":101,"images":18,"omitted_posts":96,"omitted_images":18,"tail_size":50},{"no":120374109,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:57:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120373911\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120373911<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120373216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120373216<\/a><br>Is Alaska going to be the last state to get culturally enriched?","time":1491789428,"resto":120363213,"id":"kqy8EByM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120374129,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:57:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120371965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120371965<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how to fix<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;import niggers<\/span><br>yeah let&#039;s make one of the last white areas blacked too, at least they&#039;ll be racist whites!","time":1491789437,"resto":120363213,"id":"Vh0j77o0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120374143,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:57:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120363213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120363213<\/a><br>Western part of the state is pretty red desu<br>but they want to make it a sanctuary state so idk it might be fucked","time":1491789448,"resto":120363213,"id":"VPkdBqwF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120374276,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:58:37","name":"The artist formerly known as Mr. Westmount","com":"<a href=\"#p120373735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120373735<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I hate the amount of heroin addicts we have.<\/span><br><br>Like the rest of the US, Bubba Dean Joe...<br><br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/F6pJJM-v6X4","filename":"15043949_204283990024333_4280738640579002368_n","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491789517388,"time":1491789517,"md5":"fSfN0u+CvDkYWukTW57sXQ==","fsize":161965,"resto":120363213,"id":"rsAB30Rs","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120374348,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:59:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120373579\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120373579<\/a><br>I&#039;d love to end up on some antifa shitlist for being a \/pol\/itician but I just don&#039;t have the time.

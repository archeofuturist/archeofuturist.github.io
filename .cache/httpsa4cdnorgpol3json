A study published in the British Journal of Cancer, conducted by the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at Complutense University in Madrid, determined that Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other cannabinoids inhibit tumour growth. They were responsible for the first clinical study aimed at assessing cannabinoid antitumoral action. Cannabinoid delivery was safe and was achieved with zero psychoactive effects. THC was found to decrease tumour cells in two out of the nine patients.<br><br><br>2. A study published in The Journal of Neuroscience examined the biochemical events in both acute neuronal damage and in slowly progressive, neurodegenerative diseases. They conducted a magnetic resonance imaging study that looked at THC (the main active compound in marijuana) and found that it reduced neuronal injury in rats. The results of this study provide evidence that the cannabinoid system can serve to protect the brain against neurodegeneration.<br><br>3. A study published in The Journal of Pharmacology And Experimental Therapeutics already acknowledged the fact that cannabinoids have been shown to possess antitumor properties. This study examined the effect of cannabidiol (CBD, non-psychoactive cannabinoid compound)on human glioma cell lines. The addition of cannabidiol led to a dramatic drop in the viability of glioma cells Glioma is the word used to describe brain tumour. The study concluded that cannabidiol was able to produce a significant antitumor activity.<br><br>4. A study published in the journal Molecular Cancer Therapeutics outlines how brain tumours are highly resistant to current anticancer treatments, which makes it crucial to find new therapeutic strategies aimed at improving the poor prognosis of patients suffering from this disease. This study also demonstrated the reversal of tumour activity in Glioblastoma multiforme.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;http:\/\/www.collective-evolution.co<wbr>m\/2013\/08\/23\/20-medical-studies-tha<wbr>t-prove-cannabis-can-cure-cancer\/<\/span>","filename":"pepeSunlight","ext":".png","w":1269,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492750796280,"time":1492750796,"md5":"sBLcocXC6EeO64ibfS8Mmw==","fsize":1079549,"resto":122096007,"id":"hjBCnwF0","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122099384,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:06:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122098448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122098448<\/a><br>probably yeah","filename":"moonrock","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492751196772,"time":1492751196,"md5":"81Zv2xIs2lNM6oHR1Uw3bg==","fsize":285508,"resto":122096007,"id":"0m2hryxE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122100083,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:13:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122098749\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122098749<\/a><br>hurr smoke up broo 420 weed man haha it&#039;ll cure the cancer you don&#039;t have broo no negative side effects haha weeeed<br><br>get a grip.<br>https:\/\/pastebin com\/iPfkVAim","filename":"image","ext":".png","w":498,"h":377,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1492751626217,"time":1492751626,"md5":"\/Pm6BcZVUdlMcioGUnZjVw==","fsize":262476,"resto":122096007,"id":"jna+N68d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122074352,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:13:05","name":"Anonymous","sub":"White House has prepared charges to seek the arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange","com":"http:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2017\/04\/20\/polit<wbr>ics\/julian-assange-wikileaks-us-cha<wbr>rges\/index.html<br><br>US authorities have prepared charges to seek the arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, US officials familiar with the matter tell CNN.<br><br>The Justice Department investigation of Assange and WikiLeaks dates to at least 2010, when the site first gained wide attention for posting thousands of files stolen by the former US Army intelligence analyst now known as Chelsea Manning.<br><br>Prosecutors have struggled with whether the First Amendment precluded the prosecution of Assange, but now believe they have found a way to move forward.","filename":"170111111603-05-trump-presser-screengrab-0111-large-169","ext":".jpg","w":460,"h":259,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492737185622,"time":1492737185,"md5":"gysxmdh4j6e\/QnqR7tkclQ==","fsize":33096,"resto":0,"id":"s\/xFbLZE","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"white-house-has-prepared-charges-to-seek-the","country_name":"Canada","replies":191,"images":46,"omitted_posts":186,"omitted_images":45,"tail_size":50},{"no":122099902,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:11:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122099768\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122099768<\/a><br>4chan used to be a liberal lefty shithole.

They develop their own games. They play more together, so they can better develop psychosocial competencies.\u201d<br><br>According to Seifert, these competencies include understanding and liking oneself, having empathy for others, thinking creatively and critically, and being able to solve problems and overcome mistakes. And the sooner children learn such life skills, the better, according to Aktion Jugendschutz.<br><br>The toy-free kindergarten is not a new idea in Germany. It grew out of an addiction study group in the Bavarian district of Weilheim-Schongau that started meeting in the 1980s. The group included people who had worked directly with adult addicts and determined that, for many, habit-forming behavior had roots in childhood. To prevent these potential seeds of addiction from ever being planted, the researchers ultimately decided to create a project for kitas and kindergartens, which in Germany typically serve children ages 3 to 6, and remove the things children sometimes use to distract themselves from their negative feelings: toys.<br><br>The rules of the toy-free kindergarten are simple: For a period of three months, all the toys are removed, leaving only furniture and things like blankets and pillows. The teachers meet with the children and the parents before the toy-free time starts so they know what to expect, but once the project begins the teachers observe, rather than direct, the children\u2019s play. They let the children learn how to deal with their own boredom and frustration.","filename":"germantoys","ext":".jpg","w":1700,"h":1262,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":185,"tim":1490759808236,"time":1490759808,"md5":"KBwl92K5AP8MvA40+0G+Mg==","fsize":248446,"resto":0,"id":"R6djto\/F","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"germany-starts-toyfree-kindergartens","country_name":"United States","replies":141,"images":45,"omitted_posts":136,"omitted_images":44,"tail_size":50},{"no":118751754,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:24:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"No this is good.

the photographer in that shoot and having to be all like &quot;damn, Theresa May, you fuckin&#039; fine, all sexy with your tight body and horrific androgynous monster face. I would totally have sex with you, both my MP and me.&quot; when all he really wants to do is fuck another 16 year old in his dressing room. Like seriously imagine having to be the photographer and not only sit in that chair while Theresa May flaunts her disgusting body in front of you, the favorable lighting barely concealing her stretchmarks and leathery skin, and just sit there, take after take, hour after hour, while she perfected that dance. Not only having to tolerate her monstrous fucking visage but her haughty attitude as everyone on the studio tells her she&#039;s STILL GOT IT and DAMN, THERESA MAY LOOKS LIKE *THAT*?? because they&#039;re not the ones who have to sit there and watch her mannish fucking gremlin face contort into types of grimaces you didn&#039;t even know existed before that day. You&#039;ve been fucking nothing but a healthy diet of blondes and supermodels and later alleged rape victims for your ENTIRE CAREER coming straight out of the boonies in Austria. You&#039;ve never even seen anything this fucking disgusting before, and now you swear you can taste the sweat that&#039;s breaking out on her dimpled stomach as she sucks it in to writhe it suggestively at you, smugly assured that you are enjoying the opportunity to get paid to sit there and revel in her &quot;conservative (for that is what she calls herself)&quot; beauty, the beauty she worked so hard for with personal trainers in the previous months. And then the director calls for another take, and you know you could kill every single person in this room before the studio security could put you down, but you sit there and endure, because you&#039;re the fucking photographer. You&#039;re not going to lose your future political career over this. Just bear it. Hide your face and bear it.","filename":"3-2-1200x786","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":786,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1490765105433,"time":1490765105,"md5":"d9NpUIoknzfn2\/RQRDNGsw==","fsize":369924,"resto":118746608,"id":"JCr2E8nS","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118751877,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:26:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118746608\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118746608<\/a><br>I like her demeanor, plus she actually gets things done","time":1490765173,"resto":118746608,"id":"CVm5uw1G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118751956,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:27:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118751794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118751794<\/a><br>I bet she was hot back in the day though","time":1490765221,"resto":118746608,"id":"V9I\/pJJ3","country":"UY","country_name":"Uruguay"},{"no":118752103,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:28:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118751956\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118751956<\/a><br>Not really","filename":"Theresa May smug","ext":".jpg","w":306,"h":516,"tn_w":74,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490765309201,"time":1490765309,"md5":"M5BIzQCrZtBICotycJwR0Q==","fsize":32649,"resto":118746608,"id":"fH0OqtLH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

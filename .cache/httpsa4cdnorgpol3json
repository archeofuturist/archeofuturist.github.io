This is really just because people are not exposed to many different theologies and philosophies. <br>&quot;God&quot; does not have to be defined as some anthropomorphic entity. &quot;God&quot; could be defined as simply being the entirety of existence as we know it; this belief in particular is called &quot;pantheism&quot; (which I recommend you look into, it&#039;s fairly interesting).<br><br>There is also a point of view that kind of walks between theism and atheism called ignosticism (similar to, but not the same as agnosticism).<br>Ignosticism is where one comes to the conclusion that there is no point in discussing or pondering the existence of a divine without being able to come up with a solid definition for it. If we cannot all agree upon a single definition for &quot;god&quot;, then how can we possibly begin to argue for its existence?","time":1492266162,"resto":121211319,"id":"L8Brb1de","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121214927,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)10:27:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121213930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121213930<\/a><br>Sure it was. How about a refinement of the strawman into a sound argument: Atheism is logically invalid, because it&#039;s core concept is fallacious. Premise P is proof of God, and conclusion C is there is a God, and P =&gt; C. Agreed? Atheism is saying not P, therefore not C, a logical fallacy in formal logic (denying the antecedent)","time":1492266450,"resto":121211319,"id":"4GydLjZZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121215048,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)10:28:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"That commandment was for men, not for God","time":1492266522,"resto":121211319,"id":"0GcwfVby","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121215045,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)10:28:40","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Indian sand mafia","com":"India&#039;s building boom has spawned a &quot;sand mafia&quot; that is plundering the environment and even killing those who get in its way - but some people refuse to be intimidated.<br>---<br><br>tldr<br><br>People are diving for sand in open sewers.","filename":"Untitled","ext":".jpg","w":2560,"h":1440,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492266520929,"time":1492266520,"md5":"8lSr0pGMzkj2xU8EpB4F2A==","fsize":454432,"resto":0,"id":"xwSVSEh2","country":"NO","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"indian-sand-mafia","country_name":"Norway","replies":0,"images":0}]}]}

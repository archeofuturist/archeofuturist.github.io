Besides that I think one of the arguments of course is the gutenberg book print and the better distribution of knowledge and consequently the lax copyright laws in the netherlands at the time. Not meant as a joke. <br><br>I suppose you might even argue that the latin alphabet is superior to chinese moon runes because it&#039;s easier to learn yet is able to display most of sounds a human can make. It being more compact would make an advantage in book printing as well I guess, because instead of hundreds of signs you only need 26 as an absolut minimum.","time":1491362595,"resto":119553217,"id":"JzkOg8Yz","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119560041,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:23:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119556510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119556510<\/a>","filename":"1466265676088","ext":".jpg","w":2343,"h":3000,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491362597427,"time":1491362597,"md5":"D6Cxe0gPDYqDC4OgutdEfQ==","fsize":1797195,"resto":119553217,"id":"WMTjBRHX","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119560332,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:25:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119560035\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119560035<\/a><br><br>I don&#039;t even know what you&#039;re arguing anymore, Hans.","time":1491362749,"resto":119553217,"id":"Q7bpHH9E","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119560679,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:29:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Apparently the enemy tastes better than rice","filename":"eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwOi8vaS40Y2RuLm9yZy9wb2wvMTQ5MTMwMzk2MDE4Ni5qcGcifQ","ext":".jpg","w":234,"h":550,"tn_w":53,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491362949647,"time":1491362949,"md5":"rybbWPNRaMK7Lozp9FmNBA==","fsize":29800,"resto":119553217,"id":"WMTjBRHX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119558195,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:06:09","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/pol\/ #realtalk","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;You think weed makes you cool and avant garde but the truth is it smells like shit and turns you into a retard.<\/span>","filename":"mega milk","ext":".png","w":349,"h":342,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":244,"tim":1491361569834,"time":1491361569,"md5":"ba9hWLs8aGR1x5Pb9YfMSg==","fsize":279921,"resto":0,"id":"3O3NaQL\/","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-realtalk","country_name":"Canada","replies":21,"images":7,"omitted_posts":16,"omitted_images":6},{"no":119560131,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)23:23:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119559912\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119559912<\/a><br>I usually smoke about once a weak..

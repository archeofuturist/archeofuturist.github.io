Historically, German neo-Nazis have promoted an ultra-masculine and extreme right-wing image, preferring short hair, violent imagery and combat gear \u2014 in keeping with the white power skinhead or casual subcultures \u2014 while rejecting most modern pop culture. Recently this has begun to change, with young &quot;nipsters&quot; embracing causes such as animal rights and environmentalism alongside historically far right positions, including anti-immigration views. Nipsters, rather than rejecting modern pop culture, seek instead to hijack it to promote neo-Nazi ideals.[1] This has also been seen in the New Right and National Anarchism movements.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rolling Stone magazine profiled Patrick Schroeder, one of the founders of the nipster movement, who said he desires to &quot;give the German National Socialist movement a friendlier, hipper face&quot;. Schroeder says that neo-Nazis who can &quot;live within the mainstream&quot;, such as nipsters, are &quot;the future of the movement&quot;.[1] Social networking websites like Tumblr frequently host nipster content, and at least one vegan neo-Nazi cooking show, called Balaclava K\u00fcche, exists.[2] A video showing a young neo-Nazi dancing to the Harlem Shake gained over 17,000 views on YouTube between 2013 and 2014.[1] There are neo-Nazi hip-hop and reggae bands such as MaKss Damage and Mr. Bond.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nipst<wbr>er","filename":"1491200911316","ext":".jpg","w":1374,"h":1425,"tn_w":241,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493805329157,"time":1493805329,"md5":"KbkqD2JxTQDkIt0vwnp2Gg==","fsize":400688,"resto":0,"id":"pU2J5Y9x","country":"EE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-pol-actually-just-a-bunch-of-hipster-neonazis","country_name":"Estonia","replies":13,"images":7,"omitted_posts":8,"omitted_images":5},{"no":123897367,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)06:11:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

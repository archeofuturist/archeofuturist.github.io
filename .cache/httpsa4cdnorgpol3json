Visiting America for the first time, as soon as I got of the plane there was this indescribable smell, I call it the America smell. This country literally stinks, I swear to god. Maybe it&#039;s just New York or rather Jew York, I&#039;ve never seen so many Jews and I&#039;ve been to Antwerp. Also shit is twice expensive at the cheapest places, sometimes tenfold. Also my Belgian guide was giving me lots of grief for wearing a hat, scolding me and shitmagashTwo people sitting next to me decided to buy the hat because of it. Guide be saying people are gonna wanna fight me and spit on me. I discovered the reality is that New Yorkers have better manners, nobody batted an eye and even had some positive reactions.","filename":"IMG_20170414_112016","ext":".jpg","w":1944,"h":2592,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492319745733,"time":1492319745,"md5":"qLzav5G18v7wpG+D\/1zXrA==","fsize":1235769,"resto":0,"id":"UatUKTCj","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"eurofag-here-visiting-america-for-the-first-time","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":3,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":1},{"no":121321738,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)01:20:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121321541\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121321541<\/a><br>How&#039;s that butthurt?","time":1492320058,"resto":121321170,"id":"UatUKTCj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121321969,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)01:23:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121321738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121321738<\/a>","filename":"howaboutno-meme-generator-ohhh-good-one-a24a8f","ext":".jpg","w":510,"h":510,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492320182014,"time":1492320182,"md5":"uBnZXPPLMOr9WHhUkw5pEA==","fsize":32810,"resto":121321170,"id":"bySBK6Kd","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121322128,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)01:24:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121321969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121321969<\/a><br>What are you an american on proxy?","time":1492320276,"resto":121321170,"id":"UatUKTCj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121322241,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)01:25:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121322128\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121322128<\/a>","filename":"hqdefault (2)","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492320342045,"time":1492320342,"md5":"2inMVEivrNGTJT2zUlLSCw==","fsize":28524,"resto":121321170,"id":"bySBK6Kd","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121322611,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)01:29:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121321170\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121321170<\/a><br>What kind of hat?

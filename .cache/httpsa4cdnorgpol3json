I agree that chronic pain treatment is problematic, but yea since I have literally had multiple friends suicide or try to suicide due to unmanaged pain and there was nothing subjective about their pain, the CT\/MRI and colonoscooy and surgeries all show scar tissue and the causes of pain. I guess my point is that doctors aren&#039;t being helped much by the policy pushed and I would imagine there are many others like me who have a healthy fear of opiates and thus just use them for things like after a surgery, while in the hospital, etc. Even then now doctors are being stingy with medication doses because they are told everyone becomes an addict and street heroin is cheaper. <br><br>Do you know how insulting it is for doctors to now assume every patient is an eventual heroin addict?

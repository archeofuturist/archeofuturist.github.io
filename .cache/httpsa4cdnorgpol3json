I even got the Quran I was reading verified by Muslims at my University.<br><br>The Quran, was mostly &quot;Follow Allah, verily he knows what is best (for man), and he is surely most gracious, most merciful&quot;. I feel like that exact line was repeated atleast 1000 times.<br><br>There was good advice in there, and surprisingly, wise views on what an objectively &quot;good&quot; person is.<br><br>HOWEVER, the Quran was not without violence, and controversy.<br><br>In Surah At TauBah, in the first few verses, it says to &quot;After the holy months (on the Islamic calendar), make your duty, to kill O&#039; Mushrikin (the sinners and disbelievers), seek them and kill them, unless they repent (turn to Islam)&quot;.<br><br>Now, the Surah does not specify WHO the disbelievers are, which leads me to believe that it means ALL non Muslims, which begs the question; How do you Muslims justify that? What does it mean?","filename":"image","ext":".png","w":1024,"h":1024,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491350706221,"time":1491350706,"md5":"KW1RjoNq0kvG9B6KSdSUoQ==","fsize":48762,"resto":0,"id":"+YfHpLtZ","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"muslims-of-pol-i-know-you-exist-and-im-calling-to","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":170,"images":35,"omitted_posts":165,"omitted_images":33,"tail_size":50},{"no":119555470,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:42:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119555078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119555078<\/a><br>death to lying shit skins","filename":"o5zWtoi","ext":".png","w":714,"h":845,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491360153454,"time":1491360153,"md5":"Q4wPNq7gjsUCZ0qK68+T+g==","fsize":588800,"resto":119538151,"id":"vU\/u7ONd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119555510,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:42:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119553008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119553008<\/a><br>&quot;study&quot; what study..you mean a chart? you made that in excel","time":1491360170,"resto":119538151,"id":"zBsaBgNu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119555568,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:43:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119555078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119555078<\/a><br>why do you reject jesus&#039; divinity","time":1491360201,"resto":119538151,"id":"zBsaBgNu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119555608,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:43:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119552208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119552208<\/a><br>Fuck the pedo pigshit prophet and his god.","filename":"seizuremoham","ext":".gif","w":923,"h":923,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491360227781,"time":1491360227,"md5":"nOGMDrIn85RvY7bYrHgpug==","fsize":715494,"resto":119538151,"id":"DNCfcVt2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119555651,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:44:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119538151\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119538151<\/a><br>Nice Pepsi Ad Achmed <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FGD<wbr>xNYhhZvU<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FGD<wbr>xNYhhZvU<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FGD<wbr>xNYhhZvU<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FGD<wbr>xNYhhZvU","time":1491360256,"resto":119538151,"id":"EXeeFMv9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119546184,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:21:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spare 50 cents? <\/span><br>What do you do when a beggar begs you for change?","filename":"7f675d6e6077bdb2f2e4b7f64a707a7e[1]","ext":".jpg","w":373,"h":500,"tn_w":186,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491355298895,"time":1491355298,"md5":"W7W+1r\/Ik4b7qq9HJ9lkow==","fsize":38101,"resto":0,"id":"pIIy0g8Z","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"spare-50-cents","country_name":"United States","replies":127,"images":21,"omitted_posts":122,"omitted_images":21,"tail_size":50},{"no":119554637,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:35:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119551134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119551134<\/a><br>you are a good person, i wish i could be up for chatting like that.","filename":"deez niggaz mane","ext":".png","w":250,"h":346,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491359726704,"time":1491359726,"md5":"MeOeW8N4MsT6LvT0dkLr6w==","fsize":126256,"resto":119546184,"id":"MvJxM69n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119554718,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:36:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119546184\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119546184<\/a><br>Why don&#039;t you, get a job?","filename":"whydontyougetajob","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":441,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1491359773729,"time":1491359773,"md5":"+dOXkLFsf0O78wyWE1ugkg==","fsize":37542,"resto":119546184,"id":"1Aq1ZsA+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119555028,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:38:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119553047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119553047<\/a><br>I want to try this. <br><br>If i say, &quot;hey, im homeless too&quot; would that work? that might be my trick to get them to fuck off","time":1491359937,"resto":119546184,"id":"MvJxM69n","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119555469,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)22:42:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119546184\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119546184<\/a><br>I like to ask them for money before they get a chance to ask me.

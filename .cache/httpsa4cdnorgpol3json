The Ayatollahs tried to enforce strict moral codes through police and it backfired with the new generation. Because people hate oppression everywhere in the world, and the natural reaction is to turn opposite. So now young Iranians take on as much liberal western values as they can because it&#039;s the cool thing to do and American cultural shit is in huge demand there. A lot of youth try to imitate the lifestyles you see in music videos etc and it&#039;s bizarre as shit - they are just trying to do everything the opposite of what the Authority says. The exact same will happen if you try to wipe out degeneracy through government oppression, it will only take a generation or two. Ayatollahs used to be respected before they had power of the government, because they weren&#039;t oppressing anyone. They didn&#039;t have the power to. They had to persuade people. That&#039;s how you take out degeneracy. You have to be involved in the arts and cinema to convince people of proper behavior, whatever that might be. Currently this area is dominated by left wing liberals","time":1492847621,"resto":122240140,"id":"lVp2A1d3","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122252954,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:00:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122244297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122244297<\/a><br>Which one?","time":1492848028,"resto":122240140,"id":"xsyN9qzy","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122253077,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:02:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122240296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122240296<\/a>","filename":"fpbp","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":670,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1492848154680,"time":1492848154,"md5":"qgNMgv0HrOYnTzX+6RSGuQ==","fsize":162761,"resto":122240140,"id":"WA3X\/yVe","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":122253414,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:08:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Political views doesnt effect your iq score (And if it does, its almost non-exist).","time":1492848492,"resto":122240140,"id":"u\/6zp6P3","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":122253809,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:14:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122253414\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122253414<\/a><br>not an argument","time":1492848842,"resto":122240140,"id":"lVp2A1d3","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122253489,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:09:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"Does \/pol\/ approve of this music video? <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LmV<wbr>AaID4H7w","filename":"hurts-beautiful-ones","ext":".jpg","w":615,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":208,"tim":1492848556190,"time":1492848556,"md5":"AeuMO06Zxhep3ihiPVuh5g==","fsize":36571,"resto":0,"id":"jGTvaoEs","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"does-pol-approve-of-this-music-video","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":122253621,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:11:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"not relevant to \/pol\/ at all","time":1492848688,"resto":122253489,"id":"BqWC43G4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122253808,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:14:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122253489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122253489<\/a><br><br>go away tranny larper","time":1492848841,"resto":122253489,"id":"yr4SJXYn","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122251061,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)03:32:21","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Nazis watch out!","com":"Phoenix John Brown Gun Club - Range Day<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/CywFbSdMVx0","filename":"IMG_0102","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":562,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492846341926,"time":1492846341,"md5":"AFZEB\/49R9JV1ALQaYod9A==","fsize":247727,"resto":0,"id":"2oO96EqM","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nazis-watch-out","country_name":"United States","replies":50,"images":13,"omitted_posts":45,"omitted_images":12},{"no":122253719,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:12:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"I cant tell the difference but arent they fake weapons?

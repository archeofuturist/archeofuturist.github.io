The resulting multi-lens system provides an opportunity to help correct aberration, a condition where lenses fail to bring all wavelengths of color to a single focal point, which in turn may facilitate higher quality imaging from smaller devices, researchers added.<br><br>The researchers developed the 3D lenses by blasting a light-sensitive material onto a glass substrate with a femtosecond laser, which has pulse durations shorter than 100 femtoseconds. The material then absorbed two photons that exposed it and crosslinked polymers within the material. The unexposed material was washed using a solvent, leaving the hardened, crosslinked polymer that will then serve as the optical element.<br><br>The resulting lens\u2019 diameter measures about 120 millionths of a meter, which makes it easily as small as a grain of table salt. The lenses can go from wide to narrow and may provide low to high image resolutions. Each of the lenses has a specific line of sight \u2013 clear at the center, blurry at the sides \u2013 capped by a curvature at the end. This mechanism mimics how the fovea, the small depression in the middle of the retina, collects light, and how the brain connects images from both eyes to come up with a single, distinct picture.","filename":"bre1","ext":".jpg","w":1084,"h":626,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":144,"tim":1490498345935,"time":1490498345,"md5":"XC6zDkcjKPwFMqlYjpudRQ==","fsize":72220,"resto":0,"id":"5bQNx5UM","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-over-niggers-the-jews-won","country_name":"United States","replies":128,"images":30,"omitted_posts":123,"omitted_images":30,"tail_size":50},{"no":118330969,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)02:43:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118330290\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118330290<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118330290\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118330290<\/a><br>i agree swedebro. i have saved this meme and will propagate it in the future. however in this particular care i have posted the names of the experts aka scientists who have created this monster here:<a href=\"#p118320643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118320643<\/a>","time":1490510603,"resto":118312846,"id":"5bQNx5UM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118332830,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:08:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118315298\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118315298<\/a><br>Lol this sounds like fake news and you like the cardboard cut out excuse for a shill trying to fit in.

And these are only the 19 the author was able to observe in a short time period \u2014 it can\u2019t be ruled out that there were many more, which quickly deflates the portrait of a shady Russian backchannel.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The white paper included DNS look-up data, but not nearly enough to reproduce the results. Rather than the 19 IP addresses we expected to see, the data only included three, and the DNS look-ups were not for the same time period that the paper described. Tea Leaves published a different set of data on the dark web, which we also looked at, but this set of data only included a total of four IP addresses. When we pressed Tea Leaves for the complete set of data so we could attempt to reproduce the analysis, he gave us a new, more comprehensive set of data, but still that included a total of only eight IP addresses, and it was missing an IP address belonging to a VPN service in Utah that accounted for a significant portion of the DNS look-ups described in the paper.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What percentage of DNS look-ups for Trump\u2019s email server could Tea Leaves and his colleagues observe, out of all DNS look-ups for that server on the whole internet? How can they be sure that the majority of DNS look-ups for Trump\u2019s email server originated from Alfa Bank, when much of the data they collected didn\u2019t even include DNS look-ups from IPs described in their own paper? What\u2019s their margin of error? None of the analysis that we (and other journalists) obtained answered these questions.<\/span>","time":1490514734,"resto":118320822,"id":"BAh\/ZFrg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118336477,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:57:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Tactical bump of awesome justaficanoliotudiousnesstitude","filename":"1465663577163","ext":".png","w":240,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1490515041333,"time":1490515041,"md5":"Cog5U8Tf0qQF25Ai8rgq6w==","fsize":31353,"resto":118320822,"id":"g1xRr+46","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":118336501,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:57:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118334653\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118334653<\/a><br>meant for<br><a href=\"#p118323406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118323406<\/a>","filename":"1484943730259","ext":".png","w":658,"h":901,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490515060795,"time":1490515060,"md5":"qZ+pH6HjL+T0chH\/E3\/m1g==","fsize":76789,"resto":118320822,"id":"EHWco5zW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118336580,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:58:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Can you fucking summarize this in the OP?<br><br>I can&#039;t be fucked reading through this shit","time":1490515127,"resto":118320822,"id":"eEfTVMAd","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118336576,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:58:46","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Antifa","filename":"17553810_1834040596847488_5825303313008126026_n","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":394,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490515126036,"time":1490515126,"md5":"Vz2bJzTjnON81A94+6xYYA==","fsize":36241,"resto":0,"id":"+GQm4Yib","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"antifa","country_name":"Australia","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118336570,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:58:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tfw face when i fell for the Trump meme.<\/span><br>Now this country is FUCKED for 8 years partially because of me.","filename":"1489623644876","ext":".jpg","w":349,"h":394,"tn_w":221,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490515119079,"time":1490515119,"md5":"C6xxGV9jLJGaHoDdbcWkgg==","fsize":43377,"resto":0,"id":"J8mD+lQ8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"tfw-face-when-i-fell-for-the-trump-meme","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118333913,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:21:55","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Why is the first lady so degenerate?","filename":"Melania-Trump-Nude-1","ext":".jpg","w":980,"h":490,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490512915154,"time":1490512915,"md5":"VdY8A8GCaRjI\/nanJuq51w==","fsize":81313,"resto":0,"id":"hLoovzme","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-is-the-first-lady-so-degenerate","country_name":"Canada","replies":21,"images":1,"omitted_posts":16,"omitted_images":1},{"no":118336359,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:55:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"bcoz Russian","time":1490514921,"resto":118333913,"id":"NuALifWk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118336393,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:56:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118333913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118333913<\/a><br>She followed our golden rule &quot;tits or gtfo&quot;.

Impression Products is a small business with about 25 employees. It specializes in buying used printer cartridges and remanufacturing them. In 2012, Lexmark decided to add Impression to an already existing lawsuit against other remanufacturers. While the other defendants eventually settled, Image has stuck it out and the case has made it to the highest court in the land.<br><br>You can read the full, technical details of the case here but the simple version goes like this: Since the \u201890s Lexmark has used what\u2019s called a \u201cshrink-wrap license\u201d with its cartridges. It offers a \u201cprebate\u201d to consumers by knocking off 20% of the price in exchange for their agreement to never resell or reuse the cartridge. The consumer agrees to this the second they open the package. Essentially, Lexmark believes that those cartridges belong to them, not the consumer reselling them because the consumer didn\u2019t have the right to sell them in the first place.<br><br>25 years ago, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears patent cases, carved an exception out of the patent exhaustion principle allowing patentees to set post-sale restrictions so long as these are otherwise legal and \u201cclearly communicated.\u201d In a separate case, the Federal Circuit concluded that when a patented item is sold abroad, the patentee\u2019s U.S. rights are not exhausted at all. The Federal Circuit upheld both of these precedents when it ruled against Impression Products earlier this year. The Supreme Court has never ruled on either of them.<br><br>http:\/\/www.scotusblog.com\/2017\/03\/a<wbr>rgument-analysis-justices-skeptical<wbr>-categorical-exhaustion-patent-righ<wbr>ts\/","filename":"printerink","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":450,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490503197854,"time":1490503197,"md5":"Kap9854Z3o8WFSNkOH723w==","fsize":70064,"resto":0,"id":"U5CtO5Kj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"supreme-court-printer-cartridge-case-could-be-the","country_name":"United States","replies":134,"images":10,"omitted_posts":129,"omitted_images":10,"tail_size":50},{"no":118335723,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:46:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118335605\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118335605<\/a><br><br>Gotcha, thanks.","time":1490514387,"resto":118320433,"id":"kf36DIt1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118336037,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)03:50:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118335130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118335130<\/a><br>I think my brother gave me one at one point but I never got around to playing with it.

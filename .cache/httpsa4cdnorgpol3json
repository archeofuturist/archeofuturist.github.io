Taxes on the roughly top 5% of income-earners under current law would considerably drop.<br>Insurance premiums would rise initially relative to current law, but would be reduced in the future moderately: &quot;Starting in 2020, the increase in average premiums from repealing the individual mandate penalties would be more than offset by the combination of several factors that would decrease those premiums: grants to states from the Patient and State Stability Fund (which CBO and JCT expect to largely be used by states to limit the costs to insurers of enrollees with very high claims); the elimination of the requirement for insurers to offer plans covering certain percentages of the cost of covered benefits; and a younger mix of enrollees. By 2026, average premiums for single policyholders in the nongroup market under the legislation would be roughly 10 percent lower than under current law...&quot;<br>Premium changes would vary significantly by age: &quot;Under the legislation, insurers would be allowed to generally charge five times more for older enrollees than younger ones rather than three times more as under current law, substantially reducing premiums for young adults and substantially raising premiums for older people.&quot; This would lead to a mix of younger enrollees, one of the reasons for the lower overall premiums over the longer-term.<br>Under both current law and the AHCA, CBO assumes the health exchange marketplaces would remain stable (i.e., no &quot;death spiral&quot;).[14]<br>Social Security expenditures would decrease due to earlier mortality: &quot;CBO also estimates that outlays for Social Security benefits would decrease by about $3 billion over the 2017-2026 period.&quot;","time":1490150391,"resto":117701106,"id":"uRZMV7W8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117708625,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)22:43:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117702351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117702351<\/a><br>His little stunt where he ran around looking for the house bill as if senators are even involved in the process of drafting house bills.... that made him look like a moron. <br>There is a big problem that the Rand wing don&#039;t seem to factor.

Who calls himself a Muslim in the city, with a probability of 90% supports jihad, considers Turks and Arabs as brothers, hates atheists and Christians. Secular Islam is a myth.

Thinking about another opinion you disagree with, and looking at it objectively. Try to think about things from others perspectives, and to why you feel and think the way you do. Is it because of impressions from those around you? Facts you deem to be accurate? A moral \/ emotional reason? If you put yourself and your feelings to the heart of your thoughts and perspectives, you start to notice patterns and behaviors of thinking and feeling within yourself.

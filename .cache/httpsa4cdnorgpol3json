I think one of the things you will discover is the tightrope of aspirations to something higher which drives people to acquire their security and success, and the drives of a more primal nature, which drive men to pleasure at all costs. For me being with them, I could give reign to a primal side, it was truly fun, but that path didn&#039;t appeal to my own sense of honor, or my hopes and dreams of making something of this life. I&#039;ve found a mix of the two in fellow soldiers in the Army, in many cases, same with the obnoxious drunks at the marina&#039;s with their pricey boats. I&#039;ve found that the people in those conditions are primal without the other drives, whereas the boring stone cold career guy is definitely not fun to be with, but is the opposite of this strange spectrum. I find myself being of the more interesting personalities, and it disappoints me to be with either ends of this range.

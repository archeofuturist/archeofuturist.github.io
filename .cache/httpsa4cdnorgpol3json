This general is for the discussion of Marxism-Leninism, the ideology of revolutionary socialism and communism.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490691026553,"time":1490691026,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"7MRWzGD+","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":71,"images":25,"omitted_posts":66,"omitted_images":22},{"no":118642796,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:14:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;I want to believe<\/span><br>Not an argument, \/pol\/ is not your personal blog<br><br><a href=\"#p118637276\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118637276<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;read\/watch, I wont tell you why and what it is, because I don&#039;t actually have arguments or points to make and its just the same old dead beaten worthless commie bullshit and just want attention for my failed ideology<\/span><br>No, Not an argument<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;according to this wittness opinions talking about circumstantial evidence<\/span><br>Not an argument by communist standards<br><br><a href=\"#p118638925\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118638925<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Im not presenting any argument, math or documents in my disinfographic but swear my armchair speculation debunks actually evident facts and this is not a dead beaten horse Im feigning ignorance over again to give my failed ideology attention<\/span><br>Not an argument<br><br><a href=\"#p118639440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118639440<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;come on give this dead beaten failed ideology attention<\/span><br>No, Not an argument<br><br><a href=\"#p118639440\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118639440<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;my arbitrary failed ideology labels matter<\/span><br>No, Not an argument","time":1490703267,"resto":118629725,"id":"F1HT63h1","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118642821,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)08:14:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118629725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118629725<\/a><br>If communism becomes the dominant ideology, it will doom humanity, and here&#039;s why:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;society becomes dominated by the low-tier plebs<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all they want is candy and circuses<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;human population continues to soar out of control<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all the resources are devoted to helping poor retards get free shit and breed more<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;space exploration neglected because 20 billion niggers don&#039;t give a shit about space<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;human race stays on Earth and eats all the resources until we reach the fuel threshold and go extinct<\/span><br><br>The only way to preserve humanity is to have a government that is a totalitarian, technocratic, dictatorship that favors the elites and opposes egalitarianism.

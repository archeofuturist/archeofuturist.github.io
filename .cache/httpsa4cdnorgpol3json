Taking a moment away from housework to bitch about teenagers. <br><br>We&#039;re currently undergoing a huge administrative change in our school. Some of the changes are good, some are very bad. But part of the shift is that our scores are terrible. We&#039;re in the bottom 1\/3 of schools in the state, our literacy scores are abysmal, and many of our sophomores (15-16) still haven&#039;t mastered Algebra. <br><br>Here&#039;s the thing, though. Instead of a radical shift in how we teach, the types of students we accept, or a simple reallocation of funding, the new admin has decided to ramp up the services we provide and hold teachers even more accountable than we already are..<br><br>As a teacher of 8 years who doesn&#039;t even break $60k, I work like a dog to educate my classes, advise clubs, mentor kids, and perform all the duties or extra duties of my profession. It&#039;s my passion project, I suppose.<br><br>But consistently and without fail, I receive weaker and weaker students, year after year. I keep my bar set high and rarely alter the level of my content, but I have had to reteach very basic skills students should have by their teen years. Things like writing an essay longer than 1 page, long division, graphing, reading for pleasure, handling money, or even academic discourse are all skills lost on modern American youths.<br><br>I sound like a grandpa, I know. &quot;Kids were always this way,&quot; you&#039;ll say. But this feels so different to me. This can&#039;t be the same thing as when I was in school. It just can&#039;t. My teachers complained, but it was on a whole different level.<br><br>The other week, we had a boy fall from the bleachers and nearly crack his back. He was carried out on a stretcher. And what was his first concern? He had to post the story on Snapchat. He was more scared of his PHONE breaking than him being injured. I watched as he was being carried out. The boy was crying for his friends to toss him his phone so he could take pictures of his accident and &quot;snap&quot; it.","filename":"1355832499066","ext":".jpg","w":556,"h":501,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":225,"tim":1491918376093,"time":1491918376,"md5":"LmfxdA1w+k+gSuNF37QsbQ==","fsize":74769,"resto":0,"id":"9CTe\/Px8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"american-public-school-teacher-on-spring-break","country_name":"United States","replies":85,"images":7,"omitted_posts":80,"omitted_images":7},{"no":120606405,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:52:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120599262\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120599262<\/a><br>I&#039;m right there with you.

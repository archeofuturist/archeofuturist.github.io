Seriously each episode following the boy wizard and his pals from Hogwarts Academy as they fight assorted villains has been indistinguishable from the others. Aside from the gloomy imagery, the series\u2019 only consistency has been its lack of excitement and ineffective use of special effects, all to make magic unmagical, to make action seem inert.<br><br>Perhaps the die was cast when Rowling vetoed the idea of Spielberg directing the series; she made sure the series would never be mistaken for a work of art that meant anything to anybody?just ridiculously profitable cross-promotion for her books. The Harry Potter series might be anti-Christian (or not), but it\u2019s certainly the anti-James Bond series in its refusal of wonder, beauty and excitement. No one wants to face that fact. Now, thankfully, they no longer have to.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a-at least the books were good though<\/span><br><br>&quot;No!&quot; The writing is dreadful; the book was terrible. As I read, I noticed that every time a character went for a walk, the author wrote instead that the character &quot;stretched his legs.&quot;<br><br>I began marking on the back of an envelope every time that phrase was repeated. I stopped only after I had marked the envelope several dozen times. I was incredulous. Rowling&#039;s mind is so governed by cliches and dead metaphors that she has no other style of writing. Later I read a lavish, loving review of Harry Potter by the same Stephen King. He wrote something to the effect of, &quot;If these kids are reading Harry Potter at 11 or 12, then when they get older they will go on to read Stephen King.&quot; And he was quite right. He was not being ironic. When you read &quot;Harry Potter&quot; you are, in fact, trained to read Stephen King.<br><br>Posting without picture so you fag will actually read the text and not just rage because Tolkien is rated shit-tier","time":1491465117,"resto":119710145,"id":"K2t1HEkc","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119719562,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)03:54:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119719401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119719401<\/a><br>Copy pasta","time":1491465291,"resto":119710145,"id":"wzLm74W8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119720003,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:03:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;anon<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;patrician taste in fiction, initial d, 2hu, lotr, 40k and way more<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;leftists<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;HP, SW and AAA shit for geek points, all the same shit<\/span><br>I think the fundamental difference is that we think EVERYTHING can be fun, or yield an opportunity for fun.","filename":"IMG_4119","ext":".jpg","w":597,"h":832,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491465784629,"time":1491465784,"md5":"NOautZu5\/nIdfxJ1PL1zIA==","fsize":378568,"resto":119710145,"id":"N5qYCI\/5","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119720556,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:12:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;fictional series is excellent for self-inserting <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;produces high-octane autism <\/span><br><br>every time<br>[spoiler]her politics really reveals why she never added any depth to Slytherin beyond embarrassingly cartoonish evil and nazi parallels[\/spoiler]","time":1491466368,"resto":119710145,"id":"Pkee7msx","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119720584,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:13:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"secret alt-right mail service when?","filename":"Trystero","ext":".png","w":395,"h":217,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1491466392950,"time":1491466392,"md5":"UaUnUgAfojNq1PFBNtWoTA==","fsize":30062,"resto":119710145,"id":"vGKhRxik","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119684973,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)21:18:44","name":"Anonymous","sub":"ALEX JONES IS GOING TO JAIL","com":"Alex Jones may be facing charges for threatening Adam Schiff!<br><br>http:\/\/www.newsweek.com\/alex-jones-<wbr>threat-congressman-may-be-felony-57<wbr>9730","filename":"SCHIFFED","ext":".png","w":1425,"h":807,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":141,"tim":1491441524534,"time":1491441524,"md5":"DustaPXrSLkKlosGWRbU2A==","fsize":656664,"resto":0,"id":"FmRzCbzO","country":"PE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"alex-jones-is-going-to-jail","country_name":"Peru","replies":224,"images":66,"omitted_posts":219,"omitted_images":66,"tail_size":50},{"no":119719893,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:00:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119685327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119685327<\/a>","filename":"kekhard","ext":".gif","w":320,"h":180,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491465657507,"time":1491465657,"md5":"5CnBDVT0q24AX04v0RpWWg==","fsize":3827562,"resto":119684973,"id":"6AatRKSg","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":119720033,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:03:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119684973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119684973<\/a><br>Good fuck Alarmist Jones","time":1491465825,"resto":119684973,"id":"cDh2LxHt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119720159,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:06:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119685092\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119685092<\/a><br>THE GLOVES ARE OFF","time":1491465982,"resto":119684973,"id":"ng\/9XwBa","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119720318,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:08:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119684973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119684973<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; #SyrianGasSmellsFishy<\/span><br>MEME WAR HARD MODE : STOP WW3<br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119715946#p119715946\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119715946<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119715946#p119715946\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119715946<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119715946#p119715946\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119715946<\/a><br>MEME WAR HARD MODE : STOP WW3","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491466122678,"time":1491466122,"md5":"Rq1XP9c2RqVidziI6lduEw==","fsize":71882,"resto":119684973,"id":"QB1ISmUK","country":"RU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119720582,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:13:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119684973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119684973<\/a><br><br>Legitimate fighting words. <br><br>This is just MSM trying to further injure Alex&#039;s public image for those who don&#039;t know him.

The United States would win the sea and the air but on land there would be a stalemate because China could not invade the U.S. and the U.S. wouldn&#039;t want to lose a whole shitload of men in the invasion because then public favor for the war would turn to shit. Korea would likely be steamrolled because there just isnt enough men to guard in effectively against a chinese invasion. The war would likely drag on for years with the U.S. bombing China. No one would use Nuclear weapons unless they were backed into a corner, but in the event of nuclear strike there would be revenge strikes which would kill quite a lot of the world.","filename":"1460503277458","ext":".webm","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491283458123,"time":1491283458,"md5":"bhR\/XdejPKSWlDJvWjakLw==","fsize":3096906,"resto":0,"id":"Uvr3JZE5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"world-war-3","country_name":"United States","replies":175,"images":25,"omitted_posts":170,"omitted_images":25,"tail_size":50},{"no":119451059,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)05:11:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119435458\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119435458<\/a><br>Considering fraccing is expensive as hell, and we keep building infrastructure to support it, expect a bombshell to drop about OPEC nations that will jack the price.<br><br>It&#039;s an investment for expected instability in the kingdom of Saud.

At both the series, put on by the US Naval War College and the SAASS, one of the presentations involved a directed Kessler cascade that would either be initiated as a last-ditch defense against a large launch, or a prophylactic preemption of one as a demonstration. Kesslerization was examined as both the result of a mass release of swarms of semi-smart &#039;debris&#039; and the intentional destruction of specific objects in favorable paths.<br><br>The idea was that a sufficiently devastating cloud would last for years, and would create basic &#039;windows&#039; over launch sites that would make placement of less indiscriminate SBI and land\/air\/sea-based capabilities much simpler and hard to overcome.

They were showing all these clips of rabid niggers attacking whites, and it eventually came to the footage of the Reginald Denny attack. If there&#039;s ever another riot like that, I&#039;m not talking Baltimore or weak shit like that, but a scenario where people are getting killed and police have given up, I&#039;m going hunting. I&#039;m going to get my gun, body armor, BoB, etc and go to the no-go zone and shoot every brown person I see. That shit pissed me off so much. I need to hear some nigger justice stories to calm down.<br>Was anyone here in LA when the riots happened? I saw one greentext a while back about an anon who&#039;s father was an ex-marine sniper an they shot nigs with pellet guns, does anyone had stories like that?

From this data, you can plausibly argue that 1% of black people in the US commit a serious enough crime every year. That&#039;s fucking dangerous. Just imagine a high school with 1000 students, where half of them are black. This means that every year you&#039;ll have 5 being detained for some serious crime. Throughout my whole school life, my schools had 0 people in such cases - fucking 0.<br><br>Then look at the 8% figure. Let&#039;s drop the number to 5% for those complaining people are being arrested for possessing weed or some shit. This means that 5% of black people are truly socially deviant and potentially dangerous.<br><br>He ends by claiming 91% of murders are against other blacks. However, he forgets to mention that even liberals like him actively keep away from most blacks just by virtue of where they choose to live.<br><br>I find it amazing that he believes those figures, which are much lower for other groups, are actually an argument against trying to keep away from blacks.","time":1493620520,"resto":123586233,"id":"QPPGiJBP","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":123588823,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:36:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123587838\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123587838<\/a><br>MUST SECURE","time":1493620605,"resto":123586233,"id":"SJuiM9+k","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":123588830,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:36:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123586654\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123586654<\/a><br>apparently you will if there&#039;s a baboon riot","time":1493620610,"resto":123586233,"id":"DQgsCF1S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123589276,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)02:42:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123586233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123586233<\/a><br>anon you gotta understand, vigilante justice doesn&#039;t really work, you&#039;ll either end up arrested, or if you DO manage to cap a nog or two, they&#039;ll just be turned into martyrs<br><br>you gotta go about it in a more subtle way, like I do<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;homeless nig asks me for change<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tell him I&#039;ll give him change if he yells &quot;Gas the kikes&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;slowly over time, drop redpills here and there<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he eventually goes full 1488<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rinse and repeat for all the homeless I see on my daily walks<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they pass on the redpills throughout their own bum networks further converting more people<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;ll eventually have my own personal Wehrmacht<\/span><br>On the day of the rope, they&#039;ll be the first frontline.","filename":"59c","ext":".jpg","w":599,"h":600,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493620978223,"time":1493620978,"md5":"Rmk+HhlByKgatPVdmVTpvA==","fsize":37435,"resto":123586233,"id":"z\/9WttTk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

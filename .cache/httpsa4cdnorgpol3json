I&#039;m 5&#039;4.5 and this being pol, we shouldn&#039;t give short men like me a false sense of hope. Here is the bitter harsh truth, height is the most attractive trait a man can possess. Height screams strength and confidence, which I bet you all agree, are real panty wetters.<br><br>It is far more important than being muscular, or having a good face or a good personality. And if you&#039;re under a certain height like me, no amount of lifting or game can make you Alpha.<br><br>I think we all know that Alpha Males are the fittest and strongest people in prehistoric society. Being tall gives you automatic strength and speed gains because you have much longer muscles, a larger range of attack and can take longer steps for running. Tall men have a much larger potential muscle mass, can strike a predator or an enemy before they can even come close to hit them and can run faster and longer for hunting prey.<br><br>If you&#039;re tall, congratulations, nature has gifted you default Alpha Male status. Getting women will be much easier and even other men will respect you more. But if you&#039;re short, you&#039;re out of luck, you are a default Beta. Getting women is hell of a lot harder and other men have much less respect for you. Life is in hard mode if you&#039;re a short man.<br><br>Most politicians, businessmen and celebrities are taller than average.Being taller on average means that you have more sexual partners, financial success and just general, overall happiness and satisfaction with life..<br><br>I have lifted for such a long time, and not to brag, most people tell me that I have one of the most shredded bodies they&#039;ve seen. I take pretty good care of my skin and hairstyle and people have told me that I have an above average face. I try to wear nice clothes that fit well and make me look taller.

Science is a way of being, not a debate tactic. &quot;I won&#039;t accept any argument lacking scientific evidence but I will expect others to accept my own arguments without proof just because I said there is some proof somewhere&quot; is intellectually dishonest. Appealing to unnamed studies is your attempt to give your post some authority and to set it apart from others, but until you actually provide sources, you&#039;re just doing the same thing everyone else is doing, and thus have no business calling others out. Put simply, if you really were so science-minded, you would have built your argument atop a rock-solid foundation of papers and essays from the get-go, instead of arrogantly asserting your superiority while hiding away the studies that make you think you&#039;re superior so that they can&#039;t be attacked or discussed.","time":1490113752,"resto":117631472,"id":"FA2tBZfa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117640409,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)12:29:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Will you expose your children to the jewish-escapism box?","filename":"hqdefault[1]","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490113752081,"time":1490113752,"md5":"ueQIQjFLUQbMdWPj1SIcMQ==","fsize":22098,"resto":0,"id":"EtQMSmmU","country":"SA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"will-you-expose-your-children-to-the","country_name":"Saudi Arabia","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":117633924,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)11:26:01","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Why are shill memes so fucking awful?","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;can&#039;t even do pepe&#039;s eyes correctly<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;literally in denial of reality<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;live out their fantasyland through their echo chamber that reeks of cheese fondue and taint<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;paid to be a sore loser<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh right side of history<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh fuck drumpfy<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh cognitive dissonance<\/span>","filename":"Untitled","ext":".png","w":575,"h":467,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":203,"tim":1490109961914,"time":1490109961,"md5":"8ws0zWhKaU2kvxyATvcegw==","fsize":455976,"resto":0,"id":"QOQdQFCg","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-are-shill-memes-so-fucking-awful","country_name":"United States","replies":63,"images":32,"omitted_posts":58,"omitted_images":32},{"no":117639636,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)12:21:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Not so rare","filename":"1482375705951","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":740,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1490113281548,"time":1490113281,"md5":"ebLY5YiGNUJaJQFW37m3ag==","fsize":149087,"resto":117633924,"id":"S4EgeZtB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117639712,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)12:22:02","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1480652967818","ext":".jpg","w":1049,"h":750,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1490113322500,"time":1490113322,"md5":"nhNjTaUezOCbHVavtMpFmA==","fsize":205556,"resto":117633924,"id":"S4EgeZtB","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117640010,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)12:25:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"In case people were looking for Gary memes","filename":"1479858250699","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490113507392,"time":1490113507,"md5":"3\/9UBU82OYZgyNM0plEDvw==","fsize":47571,"resto":117633924,"id":"S4EgeZtB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117640076,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)12:25:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117637909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117637909<\/a><br>I always liked this one.","time":1490113554,"resto":117633924,"id":"OR83NmqO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117640407,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)12:29:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117633924\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117633924<\/a><br>because I would say around 80 percent of them are ironically made by people here to mock shills, and shills unironically repost them thinking they are quality organic memes","time":1490113751,"resto":117633924,"id":"zaV\/lWHB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117635781,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)11:42:31","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Going to school in the ghetto as an intelligent white male","com":"I&#039;m beyond sick of whites literally ignoring black crime, and the flaws in their culture. I went to school in a ghetto fucking shit hole. I was the Only white guy in multiple classes. They fit every fucking stereotype you could imagine. They all sold\/smoked pot, were loud as shit, rude, violent, ate\/drank everything stereotypical. It was fucking awful. Anytime a teacher would even attempt to discipline one of them, they&#039;d scream &quot;racism&quot; and get away with whatever they&#039;d want. Shit, they&#039;d literally be playing their shitty mumble rap out loud on their phones in class, and the teachers would not do a fucking thing. It was like being stuck in a monkey exhibit. I also developed health issues involving blood pressure from being in that environment for years. I had a few black friends who were really cool guys, and weren&#039;t what I&#039;d call niggers, but holy shit do 95% fit the fucking profile.

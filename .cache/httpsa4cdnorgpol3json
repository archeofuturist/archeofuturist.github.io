It&#039;s so random and cool - it&#039;s like the show was designed for us Redditors, see? My mom says I have an unhealthy obsession with the show, but she just doesn&#039;t understand how funny it. I wish I could live in the Rick and Morty world and be their friends. Everything would be really and cool and funny if I did. Rick and Morty are so funny and I&#039;m so awesome that it would make perfect sense, but it&#039;d be even better if Bernie Sanders appeared. It&#039;d be so awesome I&#039;d turn up the TV in the common room of my dorm up all the way so everyone could hear the greatness of Bernie Sanders, Ron Paul, bacon, weed, atheism, The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy, Sweden, Bill Nye, 90s cartoons, cats, and fucking loving science.<br><br>I run the Rick and Morty Club at my school - we come together, browse Reddit, make some Deadpool memes and watch Rick and Morty. We don&#039;t talk to each other but there&#039;s a cute girl there I&#039;m gonna try and ask out. I&#039;m a nice guy and I dress well (fedora + trench coat + brown-stained underwear + well-trimmed beard lightly seasoned with dust and corn syrup) so I just know I&#039;ve got a good chance with her. I&#039;ve already messaged her on Facebook, I just haven&#039;t got a response yet.<br><br>Anyway, back to the topic at hand: Rick and Morty! My favorite character is Rick because his style of humor perfectly reflects that of Reddit. I bet if I asked him &quot;When does the narwhal bacon?&quot;, he&#039;d know EXACTLY what I was talking about. Also, did you notice he looks like Bernie Sanders if you squint a bit and use your imagination? This can&#039;t be a coincidence; MLG Illuminati confirmed. Yeah, that&#039;s right, I look at montage parodies too. What good Redditor doesn&#039;t? Lenny face, Illuminati, and Doge are so funny. If I met Rick and Morty I&#039;d be sure to show them all those funny and awesome memes and more!<br><br>Yours baconly, Atheist92","time":1493604726,"resto":123562495,"id":"PYyovCUA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123562972,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:12:46","name":"Anonymous","filename":"43304f50db309e64262b3e191df6f60b","ext":".jpg","w":430,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1493604766423,"time":1493604766,"md5":"dkF6exuZG1NgLbSPOVDSvQ==","fsize":21054,"resto":123562495,"id":"i0SHNzuU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123563154,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:14:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.liveleak.com\/view?i=2ea<wbr>_1374111571","time":1493604852,"resto":123562495,"id":"i0SHNzuU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123563202,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)22:14:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Dumping.","filename":"1492427121993","ext":".webm","w":272,"h":480,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493604876634,"time":1493604876,"md5":"0YgnCtQGBxcHlalg7hEbZQ==","fsize":3088164,"resto":123562495,"id":"RFgHT672","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123552306,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)20:40:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"FOR YOUR LISTENING PLEASURE<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;CPD Dispatch Stream:<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.broadcastify.com\/listen\/<wbr>feed\/763\/web<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Same feed with ambient music:<\/span><br>http:\/\/youarelistening.to\/chicago<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;For Ambiance:<\/span><br>https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/sithdemonic\/<wbr>sets\/newwaveretro<br><br>Zone-6 (isolated scanner of worst area)<br>http:\/\/www.broadcastify.com\/listen\/<wbr>feed\/13262<br><br>#### #### #### #### #### #### #### ####<br><br>BACK THE BLUE<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Get Behind the Vest donation drive:<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.getbehindthevest.org\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Chicago cops aren&#039;t even issued fucking armor by their shithole city.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;The Chicago Police Department Memorial Fund (ALSO GET SOME SWEET SWEET MERCH):<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.cpdmemorial.org\/<br><br><br>#### #### #### #### #### #### #### ####<br><br>CHICAGO&#039;S K\/D RATIO:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Shootings ScoreboardS:<\/span><br>http:\/\/heyjackass.com<br>http:\/\/crime.chicagotribune.com\/chi<wbr>cago\/shootings\/<br>http:\/\/crime.chicagotribune.com\/chi<wbr>cago\/homicides\/<br>http:\/\/homicides.suntimes.com\/<br><br>#### #### #### #### #### #### #### ####<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Chicago Racial Demographics:<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.radicalcartography.net\/i<wbr>ndex.html?chicagodots<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Chiraq Gangland Map:<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.wbez.org\/shows\/wbez-new<wbr>s\/in-chicago-gangs-abound-but-where<wbr>-are-they\/0d956c2e-171a-483a-8666-f<wbr>5228d98812d<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Police Codes:<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.bearcat1.com\/radioil.htm<wbr><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Chicago Police Dept.

Pretty much all of the Christian sources I&#039;ve listened to over the years are of the Meek and Mild ChristCuck variety as that&#039;s what seems to be insanely popular in America right now. However, that&#039;s such a disservice as we know that virtues such as Honesty, Morality, Loyalty, Respect, and Family are fundamental pillars to NatSoc and Christianity heavily emphasizes such teachings but is often glossed over for more feminine, &quot;safe&quot; teachings in order to appeal to larger audiences.<br><br>I&#039;m tired of the Cucks that unemotionally beat around the bush, clergy that are clearly extorting their crowd for profit and care only for numbers, and pastors that try to sound profound pulling messages and sermons out of passages just because. All of the required reading and prominent traditional Alt-Right material has been fine up until this point and probably still will be for some time, but I wonder if there&#039;s anyone, or even an entire church, that fills this specific nich\u00e9 yet?

In most of China, most married men only have one wife, only a minority have several rights, but the first woman he married is the Proper Wife, he can&#039;t pick another woman to to replace the status the first wife has. The first son that man is also the proper heir, he can&#039;t pick and choose no matter how man children he has.<br><br>The Emperor of China has never been a party to such restrictions, he can have many wives and many concubines and he can pick as the next Emperor any among them, this is rarely done by talent but rather, whose mother was his favourite at the time, and this he can change upon death bed. This created a LOT of chaos and a Deadly Decadent Court, women were out to kill each other to be the favourite - because if their son wasn&#039;t the next Emperor, they could be chosen to be entombed with him alive (or burnt), or the mother of the next Emperor could have them all killed, tortured to death in horrible ways - look up the fate of &quot;Lady Qi&quot;, who was made into a &#039;human pig&#039; by Empress Dowager Lu, this followed Lu&#039;s murder of Qi&#039;s fourteen year old son, in spite of Lu&#039;s Emperor son&#039;s attempt to protect his half brother. Emperor Gaozu, whose favour Lu and Qi had fought for, was horrible as well, while on the run from his enemies earlier in life, he kept trying to lighten the load by abandoning the two children he had with Lu - he carries no bonds of love as a father and husband because he had so many wives and so many children.<br>http:\/\/www.chinaknowledge.de\/Histor<wbr>y\/Han\/personslvhou.html","time":1490160873,"resto":117723276,"id":"F6WXQaRM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117727610,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:54:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117725860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117725860<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;only a minority<\/span><br>have several \/wives\/ I meant, typo!<br><br>With zero checks on their power, Emperors lose themselves in drink and women, some would seize girls by force in order to have thousands in their harems that they then forget, girls in harems would starve to death.<br><br>Governments have to govern AROUND these sorts of emperors, and their cruel mothers as well.

The Final Girl that gets to be the mother of the emperor is not going to be gracious in their victory.<br><br>England was spared all of this excess because of Christianity that placed limits on the divine rights of kings, that moral limits on everyone.

I wouldn&#039;t say he should be removed from history - nobody is perfect, case example, Wu Zetian again, relatively speaking, after she consolidated her powers, she was fair to those that criticize her and actually took their advice, but coming to power, she, like Empress Dowager Lu, cruelly dispensed of her former rivals, the &#039;human pig&#039; thing agian, and like Empress Dowager Lu, her cruelty to her rivals sickened her own son.

I&#039;m tired of people telling me, if I get plastic surgery, all my problems will be gone. If I stop complaining, the problems will go away. I&#039;m tired of the hatred Koreans feel for themselves and one another. I&#039;m tired of this toxicity. Korean culture isn&#039;t a culture, it&#039;s a death sentence. I&#039;m moving to Japan because at least Japanese people have their own culture. Korea has plastic, and that&#039;s it. Plastic can&#039;t bring you true happiness. Plastic may get you a promotion, but only undeservedly. Plastic can&#039;t replace friendship and love. Everything is fake, fake, fake! I want real! I want reality! I want people who genuinely love and care and enjoy being with me, without an ounce of competition. I&#039;m tired of feeling a heavy weight on my shoulders. I&#039;m letting it go. I&#039;m moving to Japan and never looking back.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This struck me so hard I actually saved it to my computer, no joke. Also have it memorized. Apparently she&#039;s having a great time in Japan. She said that even though she&#039;s a foreigner, people genuinely welcome her, even if they can say ignorant things. Another thing: &quot;The young children walk by my house every day with pure smiles on their face.

It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201d<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now, Trump is on the witness list in a Florida court battle over how federal prosecutors handled allegations that Epstein, 64, sexually abused more than 40 minor girls, most of them between the ages of 13 and 17. The lawsuit questions why Trump\u2019s nominee for labor secretary, former Miami U.S. attorney Alexander Acosta, whose confirmation hearing is scheduled to begin Wednesday, cut a non-prosecution deal with Epstein a decade ago rather than pursuing a federal indictment that Acosta\u2019s staff had advocated.<\/span><br>Prosecutors in Acosta\u2019s Miami office who had joined the FBI in the investigation concluded, according to documents produced by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, that Epstein, working through several female assistants, \u201cwould recruit underage females to travel to his home in Palm Beach to engage in lewd conduct in exchange for money. ... Some went there as much as 100 times or more. Some of the women\u2019s conduct was limited to performing a topless or nude massage while Mr. Epstein masturbated himself. For other women, the conduct escalated to full sexual intercourse.\u201d<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the 2011 letter explaining his decision in the Epstein case, Acosta said he backed off from pressing charges after \u201ca year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors\u201d by \u201can army of legal superstars\u201d who represented Epstein, including Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz; Kenneth Starr, who as independent counsel led the investigation that brought about President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment; and some of the nation\u2019s most prominent defense attorneys, such as Roy Black, Gerald Lefcourt and Jay Lefkowitz.<\/span>","filename":"pizzagate ramsay","ext":".png","w":1764,"h":1440,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":204,"tim":1490146878270,"time":1490146878,"md5":"vDYdGfr27McHwaqN33FoVA==","fsize":2552507,"resto":0,"id":"IzeoanzV","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pzzagate-is-back-in-the-news","country_name":"United States","replies":116,"images":46,"omitted_posts":111,"omitted_images":44,"tail_size":50},{"no":117722765,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:00:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"He calls everybody terrific or amazing or great guy when they are not on his shit list at the moment.

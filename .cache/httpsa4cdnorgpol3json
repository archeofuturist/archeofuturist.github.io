The Lefty loons would most likely stay back in Europe to get raped by hordes of shitskins. <br><br>Europeans are more likely to have children in America as there&#039;s more room to start families in. This could raise the white birth rate higher which will keep America from becoming Brazil 2.0.

Incompetent Brits did everything in their power to prove them right, including shooting a load of unarmed protesters in 1972.<br><br>Generally the IRA made at least some efforts to reduce civilian casualties, targeting the army and police and usually giving warnings by phone when they were going to cause some serious property damage. More importantly though, the IRA had an aim. They wanted Britain out of Northern Ireland because they thought the ethnically Irish (mostly Catholic but this was never actually about protestants vs Catholics, it was &quot;your ancestors stole land from my ancestors&quot;) community in Northern Ireland would be mistreated forever by Britain.<br><br>That meant it was actually possible to make a deal. Northern Ireland was completely re-organised in 1998 to protect the rights of the minority and since then the conflict has come off the boil. Infamously in 1998 a faction within the IRA tried to derail the peace process by setting off a huge car bomb in Omagh, killing 30 people. It&#039;s not clear whether they tried to warn the police to evacuate the area beforehand, but whatever happened it blew up and killed those people. This was universally seen as utterly repugnant.<br><br>Our real problem is that, while you can negotiate with people who want to change a political arrangement and eventually come to some sort of understanding, it&#039;s hard to see how you negotiate with Islamic fundamentalists. The British community in Northern Ireland could make some concessions to the Irish community and get on with it because the wishes of the Republican movement were at least somewhat tolerable to them. That&#039;s not the case with Islamic fundamentalists. They want things that are just unacceptable. Sharia instead of common law is not an option.

Apparently AI scientists or whatever also use it, but I hate it. I can&#039;t deny that it makes learning to program easy, though.<\/span><br> - Pros: easy to learn, from your first &quot;Hello world&quot; program to advanced programming concepts. Can be used for any level project, although it&#039;s less popular in professional application (but more popular in more scientific-oriented applications).<br> - Cons: I absolutely despise its syntax. It&#039;s also relatively different to &quot;normal&quot; C-style languages; if you grasp programming concepts well learning a new syntax should be easy, but will still take some getting used to.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Javascript: the obvious (and practically only) choice for web development. However, I&#039;d advise learning the language first; once you can program well, you could start building websites, because really that&#039;s two different skills.<\/span><br> - Pros: insanely popular right now, useful for web development, heck you can make an entire website (including serverside and even database) in javascript using something like the MEAN stack.<br> - Cons: it&#039;s a very forgiving language; the original vision was that it would be used for 10-line scripts embedded in HTML website pages. Of course it&#039;s evolved a lot since then, but things like dynamic loose typing make it easy to screw up if you&#039;re attempting a larger project.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;C#: It&#039;s like Java but better. I&#039;m sure you know what java is.<\/span><br> - Pros: Out of these three languages, it&#039;s the most non-meme one. It&#039;s developed by a large organisation, has a lot of features, proper object orientation, etc. etc. In my opinion, it&#039;s the best &quot;traditional&quot; language out there. Also unlike Java it&#039;s actually well-designed for the most part so if you try to learn to program in C#, you&#039;ll actually learn to program, not learn how to deal with Java&#039;s shittier aspects.","time":1490221761,"resto":117828398,"id":"psWVD+rG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117827506,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)17:15:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"The only problem with interracial relationships are the ones that don&#039;t end in a long-lasting &quot;till death do us part&quot; marriage.<br><br>That&#039;s the problem with white women getting blacked, not that they&#039;re having sex with black men, but that black men don&#039;t settle down get married and stay married for the rest of their life with ANY woman, black OR white. <br><br>The issue has never truly been about race, it&#039;s been about the degradation of marriage.","filename":"IMG_5083","ext":".jpg","w":362,"h":362,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490217344344,"time":1490217344,"md5":"zR6NUaE5cEQ9X15cPy\/ffQ==","fsize":44012,"resto":0,"id":"c78fw5IG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-only-problem-with-interracial-relationships","country_name":"United States","replies":28,"images":8,"omitted_posts":23,"omitted_images":6},{"no":117837045,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:16:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117831198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117831198<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117832261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117832261<\/a><br><br>the fact that she is with a niggers proves she is worthless<br><br>you will never have a girl of any value because the act of going with a nigger erases her value<br><br>Theres a reason porn stars want 3 times as much to fuck niggers, because they know people lose interest in them afterwards <br><br>p.s the reason we dont say it to your face is because the government is keeping you monkeys as pets, not because you are some tough guy","time":1490220966,"resto":117827506,"id":"NS9geHWa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117837162,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:16:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117828423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117828423<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Implying there are not black people smarter then you...<\/span>","time":1490221010,"resto":117827506,"id":"GOEFyLc0","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":117838126,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:23:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117837162\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117837162<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying regression to the mean isnt a genuine phenomenon <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying regression to the mean doesnt render that point moot<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying there are actually any significant number of niggers smarter than me anyway<\/span><br><br>If you discount halfies and quadroons\/other mixes its unlikely ill ever run into a nigger smarter than I am in any regard","time":1490221396,"resto":117827506,"id":"NS9geHWa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117838920,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:28:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117838126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117838126<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hubris<\/span>","time":1490221716,"resto":117827506,"id":"c78fw5IG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117839020,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)18:29:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117827506\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117827506<\/a><br>Sorry, you&#039;re still a mongrel","time":1490221757,"resto":117827506,"id":"ZHzkSxCR","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"}]}]}

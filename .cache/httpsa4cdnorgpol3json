Over the last 10 years I have had the pleasure of seeing the private parts of many, many people. What I&#039;m about to tell you may come as a bit of a surprise.<br><br>I&#039;d estimate that as many as 4 out of 100 people have messed up junk. You might have a guy named John with all the male secondary sex characteristics (beard, baldness deep voice etc.) but if you have to catheterize &#039;him&#039; you might find that there isn&#039;t a dick. You might see a little nub with no balls, a prehensile labia, some malformed balls with a strange peehole mound. <br><br>It really is a crap shoot and all I&#039;m saying is I had to change my viewpoint on gender as a strictly binary concept.<br><br>I know about x and y chromosomes, and yes humans come out somewhere along a male\/female continuum, but I get how IDENTIFYING as some gender you don&#039;t appear to be can at times be a completely rational thing considering the mess that happens in some people&#039;s pants due to how the hormones were dealt. I can&#039;t think trans sexual people are strictly insane moonbats with &#039;body dysphoria&#039; anymore after seeing what I&#039;ve seen. I have no reason to think that gayness is strictly a bad habit or kink either, it likely is a result of such odd distribution of hormones during development as with the trannies.<br><br>There are 2 sexes, but I have to face up to the reality that gender, as a social identifier is kind of an arbitrary label. Politically, things like this make arguments about gay marriages, insurance funded transition operations and bathroom designations more difficult than they appear.<br><br>That being said, everything SJW&#039;s rant about is concerning 56 genders, fanciful pronouns and otherkin is obviously complete bullshit.

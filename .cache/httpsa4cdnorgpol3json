The esoteric teachings were given to a select few and taught how to experience the divine message as Christ had done. It was a way of becoming closer to and personally experience God. Later, the Gnostics adapted some of these. There is nothing sinister about this. It is history. You cannot blind yourself to the esoteric half as this is closer to the original teachings.

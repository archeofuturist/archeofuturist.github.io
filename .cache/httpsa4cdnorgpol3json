Study the small Orthodox Jewish communities in Suburban New York right outside the city, their use of loopholes in laws and how the American legal system mirrors a lot of the same principles in Talmudic Law. Jews are more likely to do business and cooperate with other Jews, hire jews over non-jews, and so when they become powerful this has sort of a snowball effect. Part of Jewish culture is putting knowledge on a pedestal and worshiping it among all else. This cultural importance on education is also a key factor in the success of Jews. <br><br>What \/pol\/ doesn&#039;t understand is that the key to the success of the Jewish People is actually double-think. They carry this massive chip on their shoulders about it wherever they go and are unable to acknowledge their success, since doing so conflicts with the values of equality they preach. Example:<br><br>My parents and I will be talking about Judaism, so I&#039;ll bring up the question: &quot;why do you guys think Jews are successful?&quot; Neither of them deny it, they believe they are superior, and my mother will point to her head, and say &quot;it&#039;s our minds.&quot; So mockingly I scowled at her and said &quot;are you suggesting that we&#039;re superior to other groups of people? Isn&#039;t that prejudiced? Isn&#039;t that what the Nazis believed about themselves?&quot; I&#039;ve never seen them squirm like they did then.<br><br>I do believe that the deep state exists, and that a significant portion of those people are likely Jewish. Jews are incredibly influential, they are the CEO&#039;s of the majority of media companies, disproportionately over-represented in the world of finance, engineering, political science.

To increase the ever-expanding definition of sexual assault, likely to use it increase its scope as a weapon against exclusively straight men. In each of the articles, the issue of stealthing is presently almost exclusively as one of men committing it against women - hardly no consideration of how a woman might sabatoge a condom in order to commit paternity fraud, much less any consideration of how might &quot;forget&quot; to take her birth control in order to secure child support payments for the next 18 years.","filename":"i said no","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":250,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1493337224065,"time":1493337224,"md5":"VJijxhEF1EzvGyytlm5FHA==","fsize":25818,"resto":0,"id":"gEpFJQw1","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"stealthing-a-new-weaponization-of-sexual-assault","country_name":"United States","replies":112,"images":28,"omitted_posts":107,"omitted_images":28,"tail_size":50},{"no":123126981,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)21:53:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123125595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123125595<\/a><br>Same lad, you circumcised?","time":1493344410,"resto":123112463,"id":"2NKYh8i3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123127226,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)21:55:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123121513\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123121513<\/a><br>Niggers, mudshits and spics don&#039;t give a shit.","time":1493344525,"resto":123112463,"id":"DccxrGfT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123127400,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)21:56:51","name":"k\u1e5b\u1e63\u1e47a","com":"<a href=\"#p123127226\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123127226<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Niggers, mudshits and spics don&#039;t give a shit.<\/span>","filename":"jew is bastard","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":533,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493344611469,"time":1493344611,"md5":"O3tV3+6x\/3EhzgOJKo5akA==","fsize":238695,"resto":123112463,"id":"ffDNauv6","country":"GB","trip":"!!8ulOY0Lj8qr","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123128195,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)22:03:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123126926\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123126926<\/a><br>Yep, they think we&#039;re all stupid and don&#039;t understand what they&#039;re doing.<br><br>Heavy-handed propaganda is heavy-handed propaganda.<br><br>Step one: find the first article about &quot;stealthing&quot; in the mainstream media.<br><br>The earliest I see is from 4\/24...","time":1493344989,"resto":123112463,"id":"Wk8AJnWk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123129435,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)22:14:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123112463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123112463<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bustle<\/span><br>REEEEE!

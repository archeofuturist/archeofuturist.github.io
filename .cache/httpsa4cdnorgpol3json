Emigrants from the former Communist world are welcome, as well as any posters who happen to live in Communist countries today (like China, Laos, Vietnam, Cuba, and North Korea). Honorable mentions go out to countries like Finland, which narrowly avoided being absorbed into the Soviet Union, and Greece, which fought a brutal Communist civil war and managed to remain free. <br><br>Please try to be respectful. All of our countries went through hard times, and all of us now share a bond that can never be broken because of it.

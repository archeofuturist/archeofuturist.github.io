Only advice I really can give is that there needs to be real boundaries in the relationship for anything to work. When this girl would go into an episode, which could start from literally any stimuli, she would become extremely unreasonable to the point where I needed to leave the scene in order to cool down and continue hanging out. She became belligerent too many times and I ultimately ended the relationship. I had become her therapeutic crutch and when we tried to become &quot;friends&quot; a month after the breakup she very clearly had an agenda to restart the relationship. I had to eventually move out of State to separate myself and gain independence back, but I still deal with near harassment on the phone. Loved the girl, too.<br><br>My answer to the OP is to think carefully about the type of bond you start with this woman. A familial type bond early in the relationship could be devastating because you&#039;re making her problems your problems.

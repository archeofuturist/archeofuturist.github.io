How did you become a fucking nazi? A bunch of real Nazis whispered poison in your ears while becoming your only community, your only \u201cfriends\u201d.

The \u201clol only normies care about hurting others attitude\u201d + the general nerd male resentment of these communities. Its prime fertile ground for actual Nazis to grow.

R9K\u2019s \u201cwho wont woman fuck me\u201d bs \u201canything goes and anyone who gets mad is just a normie\u201d vs endless outbursts of anger at everything. Pol here becomes less of an isolated phenomenon and more of a natural end point for all these circles crashing into one another.

It\u2019s called There Are No Forests On Flat Earth. The name makes it sounds like stupid click-bait, but it\u2019s actually nothing like that. It\u2019s one of the most thought-provoking videos I\u2019ve seen, and I\u2019ve seen a lot of them.<br><br>I recommend watching the video. It was originally made by a Russian guy whose Youtube channel is titled Ljudin R\u0263si (\u041b\u044e\u0434\u0438\u043d P\u0263c\u0438), but his English isn\u2019t that good so (an American?) woman by the name of Rhonda dubbed the video to make it more understandable.<br><br>The video basically suggests there were giant trees ranging from 6 to 60 kilometres tall around the Earth in ancient times. As far fetched as it might sound, the video does provide some evidence to this claim. Fairly convincing evidence, but certainly not absolute proof. The main example used is Devil\u2019s Tower from Wyoming, USA. It\u2019s a flat topped mountain that looks like a giant tree stump.<br><br>It\u2019s of course easy to dismiss this as a co-incidence, but the Russian Youtuber shows pictures of several mountains that resemble tree stumps from around the world, and other mountains that look like trees that have been destroyed in a more brutal manner. I suggest you take a look at the video yourself to make sure whether you agree or not.<br><br>The idea that trees taller than Mount Everest have existed on Earth in ancient times is obviously outrageous, and outrageous claims require outrageous proofs, but the fact is that these odd-looking mountains exist is in itself a valid point of interest. Even if you don\u2019t buy the Russian\u2019s assertion of giant trees, you should not discard the attention he is bringing to these mysterious landmarks.","filename":"giant prehistoric tree","ext":".jpg","w":259,"h":194,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492098163479,"time":1492098163,"md5":"9bNQFlFGY0ByRea5S4jeYg==","fsize":7634,"resto":120915295,"id":"NyHtFy1s","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120923129,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)11:42:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120922228\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120922228<\/a><br>To my knowledge there&#039;s no consensus, just a long series of connecting bits of evidence like repeating pictograms or matching stoneworking techniques.

Devil\u2019s Tower appears to consist of hexagonal pillars.<br><br>The video shows several other curious hexagonal stone structures from around the world. These are supposedly natural formations. The video points out that such shapes occur in nature, such as in honeycomb and snowflakes. Some turtle shells also have hexagonal patterns. One thing that bothers me though, in regard to the Russian video\u2019s claims is that normal trees don\u2019t seem to have these hexagonal shapes, so why do these curious sites from around the world have them if they are all remnants of the giant trees? The giant trees could naturally have different properties compared to normal trees. The video calls the giant trees silicon trees, but I\u2019m not sure whether it means that the trees were originally made of silicon, or they\u2019ve been turned to silicon by some sort of ancient bio-weapon?<br><br>Even if the hexagonal rock pillars don\u2019t have anything to do with trees, it does not detract from the fact that the existence of the pillars is quite a conundrum. According to modern science they\u2019ve been formed by lava and volcanic activity 50-60 million years ago. I\u2019d like to know how they know that. Was a scientist there then recording the event? Have volcanoes managed to form these even hexagonal shapes in the last few centuries since we\u2019ve had natural philosophers and scientists? Or are they just talking out of their asses?<br><br>Even if the Giant Tree-theory sounds far-fetched, it\u2019s still a more reasonable explanation than the one modern science gives us. There is actual physical evidence to support the Giant Tree-theory; the tree stump-looking mountains. I am very unconvinced of anything modern science says happened tens of thousands or millions of years ago. They weren\u2019t there. They\u2019re just guessing at best.","filename":"towerhexagon","ext":".jpg","w":238,"h":301,"tn_w":98,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492098260298,"time":1492098260,"md5":"XOrxflmdswBEVIPyVdPavA==","fsize":23813,"resto":120915295,"id":"NyHtFy1s","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120906526,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)08:56:11","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Cop slams and beat black pedestrian after alleged jaywalking","filename":"IMG_20170413_085047","ext":".png","w":1080,"h":1182,"tn_w":228,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492088171835,"time":1492088171,"md5":"ZX2afyIcUeVnn\/nKmY0O\/Q==","fsize":290077,"resto":0,"id":"mUn6O0ih","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cop-slams-and-beat-black-pedestrian-after-alleged","country_name":"United States","replies":153,"images":29,"omitted_posts":148,"omitted_images":29,"tail_size":50},{"no":120922284,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)11:35:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120911042\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120911042<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;land of the free<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have laws<\/span><br><br>WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW","time":1492097759,"resto":120906526,"id":"hgMeQtb1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120922558,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)11:38:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120914042\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120914042<\/a><br>Yeah i never understood this meme.<br>They have to make sommething up because they have incredibly unrefined palates.<br>Not drenched in store-brand BBQ sauce?

She predicted Donald Trump would become President and would use her Twitter account to relay what she claimed were messages from God that only enlightened human beings would be able to understand, one of them being that the past present and future are not sequences of events one after another but are actually all happening at the same time. Another was that there is an infinite number of universes in which every detail can be infinitely different. Also, she tried to kill herself in 2012 and claimed that she succeeded but that successfully killing yourself will only result in your consciousness being shifted into another universe in which you become another &quot;you&quot; who survived your own suicide attempt, but are still in the same life situation that you experienced before your attempt. Since then Tila claims to have developed a special relationship with God by which she can receive messages to share with the public. Interestingly, she does not claim to be God himself, but tells her fans to follow Jesus so as to dissuade a personality cult. She consistently criticizes (((Them))) in her videos and also claims that she has the power to alter our universe with her mind. Most importantly, she is now claiming the return of Jesus is imminent with the coming of a third world war.<br><br>Two videos for the intrigued:<br><br>&quot;A Recap on World War 3!

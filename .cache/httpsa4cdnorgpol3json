Our aim is to demonstrate the capabilities of modern computer vision and graphics technology, and convey it in an approachable and fun way. We want to emphasize that computer-generated videos have been part in feature-film movies for over 30 years. Virtually every high-end movie production contains a significant percentage of synthetically-generated content (from Lord of the Rings to Benjamin Button). These results are hard to distinguish from reality and it often goes unnoticed that the content is not real. The novelty and contribution of our work is that we can edit pre-recorded videos in real-time on a commodity PC. Please also note that our efforts include the detection of edits in video footage in order to verify a clip\u2019s authenticity. For additional information, we refer to our project website (see above). Hopefully, you enjoyed watching our video, and we hope to provide a positive takeaway :)<\/span>","time":1493048671,"resto":122591131,"id":"H7EHwhJI","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122593111,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)10:47:37","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Confederate States of America","com":"Confederacy Thread<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 inbred, redneck, etc.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 Traitors <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 Jewish Yankee Shills Shilling <\/span><br><br>Seriously why do Shills say Lincoln would have got rid of blacks he set them free and no politician would get rid of all of those votes.","filename":"1430958277664","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493045257481,"time":1493045257,"md5":"9LoDiUiopoYkt7Rm83Do8A==","fsize":172650,"resto":0,"id":"52ba8Av5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"confederate-states-of-america","country_name":"United States","replies":27,"images":16,"omitted_posts":22,"omitted_images":12},{"no":122598402,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)11:36:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122595985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122595985<\/a><br>The next civil war won&#039;t be North vs. South, it will be Rural Vs.

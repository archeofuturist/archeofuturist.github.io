Then, when we extended our search to other less controversial subjects, we found out that even subjects such as &quot;computing&quot;, get censored into showing &quot;people&quot; instead of &quot;men&quot;, while the search for &quot;women&quot; still gives gendered results. <br>We wanted to make sure it wasn&#039;t just about the GamerGate incident, so we tried mixing it with war, army and military subjects. While this time we did happen to have SOME men-gendered results (only when using quotation marks, mind you), it was an extremely low amount of results compared to a pushed narrative of &quot;people&quot; that were influential. Google even goes out of its way to give results that aren&#039;t even related to war so that they can plug &quot;people&quot; instead of &quot;men&quot; in the page results.<br>Let me share with you some pictures of our experiments, which we tried using the usual search method normies would use when researching a subject (typing words directly), trying to add quotation marks to make sure the word is in the title, and even going for an advanced search excluding the words &quot;people&quot; and &quot;women&quot;, but still getting the same retarded results.<br>How do you feel about the fact that your gender is officially now non-existent, and &quot;people&quot; fought in the world wars, not &quot;men&quot;, as SJWs effectively re-write history and eliminate toxic masculinity from it? I would talk about how this forces a narrative down people&#039;s throat, muh 1984, muh Farenheit 451, muh dystopian future, but you all know the drill and how dangerous censorship is, so well fuck it, no point in circle-jerking.","filename":"6e5138a20d37dd47f943cfa00a42956c771f81ae50aa655a491ed3a258154c7b","ext":".png","w":976,"h":1659,"tn_w":147,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493684487154,"time":1493684487,"md5":"A4WCssHBau9puGOLcoOgMA==","fsize":198854,"resto":0,"id":"Ge7DG9o0","country":"MK","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"google-now-censors-menrelated-searches","country_name":"Macedonia","replies":43,"images":11,"omitted_posts":38,"omitted_images":9},{"no":123706065,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)21:35:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

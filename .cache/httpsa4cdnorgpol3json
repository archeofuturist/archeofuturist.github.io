It is known in occult circles as the black sun, the inner trauma that binds us to karmic cycles. The wound in Christ&#039;s side. This is the result of denial of self love, which is projected onto the external world, often resulting from a reaction to being position of subjugation to an oppressor and reflecting the others nature outwards. It might sound like hippy washy bullshit, but love is syntropy and homeostasis, which naturally arises OUT of chaos. You don&#039;t realize this because you are like a fish immersed in water, unconscious of the ocean. You, consciousness, arises out of the same chaotic fluctuations into which cyclically it perishes, however it&#039;s very arising suggests a momentum toward increased complexity as a consequence of increased entropy, an increase in the wavelength of the wave, within the universal system. This appears to happen in a fractal fashion as above so below.<br><br>My understanding is that there is an infinite mathematical set that consists of all self perpetuating patterns which give rise to stable coherent geometries with stable levels of entropy, enough novelty and redundancy to continue generation of a logarithmic growth pattern and also enough entropy to allow for robustness in adapting to fluctuation in the incoming data stream.<br>There is also however, an infinite set of patterns that are inherently self limiting and create vicious cycles of karmic annihilation. Whatever entity we may refer to as &quot;God&quot; must operationally consists of, by definition being of being the monad or source of all, of both these sets.<br>Entropy or ignorance is the operative function of God&#039;s primary creation algorithm.","filename":"16716324_10211921979782491_6736664086106300029_o","ext":".jpg","w":1364,"h":736,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":134,"tim":1490848185885,"time":1490848185,"md5":"LFYpPlDlKqwGl6tYs5w4JQ==","fsize":202888,"resto":0,"id":"GzvyunUJ","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-message-to-the-biological-intelligence-of-the","country_name":"United States","replies":52,"images":21,"omitted_posts":47,"omitted_images":16},{"no":118893621,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)02:30:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118893260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118893260<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118893539\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118893539<\/a><br><br>Give this one a Try.<br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/vF3lIg9cHJ8","filename":"universe","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490855405074,"time":1490855405,"md5":"rD5VlIFexnXsMbVDbaFJng==","fsize":680470,"resto":118882621,"id":"M050aKdk","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118894101,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)02:36:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118893187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118893187<\/a><br><br> Yaldabaoth the Chief Archon known as the Demiurge is represented by the Planet Saturn and the Black Cube. <br> <br> He is El.","filename":"img_4909-3","ext":".png","w":407,"h":476,"tn_w":106,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490855813582,"time":1490855813,"md5":"OMBRmS\/yZzaNN66vfvHHiQ==","fsize":163441,"resto":118882621,"id":"t4rjX6fk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118894248,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)02:39:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118893439\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118893439<\/a><br>Looks like the insert for every single Mastodon LP","time":1490855942,"resto":118882621,"id":"93JUoQuU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118894349,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)02:40:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118892800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118892800<\/a><br>Crap.

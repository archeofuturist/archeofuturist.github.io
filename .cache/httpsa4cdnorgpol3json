First a little background on myself. I was an atheist from most of my life, 6 to 28 years old, I&#039;m 31 the end of this year. I&#039;ve had a bit of a rocky life, raped and molested at age 6 and the reason why I abandoned God. Started using drugs hard at age 11. Incarcerated from 14- 18 and homeless off and on from 18 to 25. I should also point out that i have an 8th grade education and an IQ above 140. <br><br>When i was 28 I decided I would start a religion for profit, after all hope sells. Well I was sitting in my room one night thinking of ways to start my skeem when I came up with a theory I have on mars. Mars is roughly 1\/3 smaller than earth and is made of the of the same material and formed around the same time. Mars being 1\/3 smaller than earth it&quot;s molten iron core cooled 1\/3 faster, rendering the planet uninhabitable. I then theorized that the former inhabitants of mars were able to travel space to earth, bringing with them the value of gold and silver. These 2 elements are vital to intergalactic space travel as they would be needed in massive amounts to produce the massive electrical systems needed to travel the stars. <br><br>It was at this point my life changed, sitting there in my room trying to come up with a religion to scam people out of money, God came to me. Not in a vision or with a voice but a simple tap on my head followed by what I can only discrib as waves through my whole body, or like if buckets of water had been dumped on me. I just knew, God is real, and Jesus Christ was the physical manifestation of God on earth. There was something else that came with this knowledge as well, the true meaning of the Holy Trinity, and foresight to the things that are to come. The synagogues of Satan will be formed soon, it&#039;ll be formed when the Vatican, the state of Israel, and the Saudi kingdom will come together to form what they will call the Church of God. After the synagogues of Satan is formed the antichrist will reveal himself.","filename":"3faiths","ext":".jpg","w":1926,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":38,"tim":1493280618028,"time":1493280618,"md5":"BEc17e7II9MMqmXf+SIB4A==","fsize":208592,"resto":123012508,"id":"xIYyBTg1","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123012864,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)04:11:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123012767\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123012767<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mars is roughly 1\/3 smaller than earth and is made of the of the same material and formed around the same time.

He was against the jewry and communism. He wanted t remove the Jews from Europe&#039;s trade system and politics. He never was a racist and also considered that to be strong a race needs to be proud of its culture, history and civilization, that way those nations would get along together. He would not have invaded other nations if they shared the same ideology, he also wanted peace with Brits because he believe they shared so much with the German people that they should have been their allies. Of course he did use violence at some moment during his ascension to power or during is ruling of the German empire, but you have to take into consideration that it was a revolution and most revolution during the human history required violence to happen.

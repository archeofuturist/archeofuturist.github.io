The bible spoke heavily against the falsehood of religious leaders, because even in Jesus&#039; time there were pharisees using religion as a way to lord themselves over the people, rather than spread the message of God as it was written. There has always been an issue with people using religion as an excuse to lord themselves other others, so that much really can&#039;t be helped unless we slipped into a worldline where religion didn&#039;t exist.

In both books, Jesus Christ and the prophet Mohammad are said to be the final example to follow for that religion. Again, if you follow those examples TO THE LETTER, dotting every I and crossing every T to the best that is humanly possible, one path will lead to peace and understanding, the other has you slaughtering those who&#039;s faith isn&#039;t as &#039;pure&#039; as yours.

For the same reason whites don&#039;t hate Asian doctors or whatever. Whites hate Jews because, taken as a group, they are a bunch of scheming, deceitful greedy fucks who purposefully seek to corrode, corrupt and destroy their civilization from within and forcefully replace them (the white natives) with easier-to-ensalve subhuman savages and mongrels. They are amoral genocidal parasites that abuse our hospitality and purposefully work towards our destruction or our enslavement (whichever is more expedient) so that they may rule uncontested over a rubbish parody of the society they have destroyed. They poison our minds, they desecrate our values and time-proven traditions, they mock and deface our heritage; and not even because they seek to replace all those things with a &quot;better&quot; alternative. Nay, they are hypocrites: all those things they destroy within white civilization they uphold among themselves. They are worse than cancer, and since they have attempted these subversive tactics so many times throughout history, and never stopped doing those things despite being treated very mercifully (all things considered), I&#039;m forced to admit that they&#039;re irredeemable and fundamentally incompatible with our way of life and should be expediently thrown out of our societies.

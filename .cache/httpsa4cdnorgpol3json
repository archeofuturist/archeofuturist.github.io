Something can be said to be irrational if it helps neither cause. It can be said to be rational if it helps just the individual, just society, or both. <br><br>Similarly, if a person&#039;s beliefs are hinged too strongly to utilitarian beliefs, to the extent that it punishes the individual performing it in exchange for the &quot;greater good,&quot; I don&#039;t consider it rational.

This general is for the discussion of Marxism-Leninism, the ideology of revolutionary socialism and communism.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492617891084,"time":1492617891,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"TtxFNonm","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":25,"images":19,"omitted_posts":20,"omitted_images":17},{"no":121862491,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:32:28","name":"Communist","com":"<a href=\"#p121861991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121861991<\/a>","filename":"Screenshot_1","ext":".png","w":493,"h":488,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1492619548436,"time":1492619548,"md5":"fyeZOypa5kn9VrUP2ogmnA==","fsize":151339,"resto":121859528,"id":"No2wwzyI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121862979,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:36:41","name":"Sage","com":"<a href=\"#p121862491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121862491<\/a>","filename":"1491476502785","ext":".png","w":700,"h":629,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":112,"tim":1492619801686,"time":1492619801,"md5":"LRoqnX1fedKkpXFpj2HqKw==","fsize":149535,"resto":121859528,"id":"6zRnr\/n9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121863014,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:36:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121862193\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121862193<\/a><br>read first on the list<br>i lol&#039;d","filename":"1486489037431","ext":".png","w":300,"h":600,"tn_w":62,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492619812310,"time":1492619812,"md5":"7JQazIMRhCjGM9mItWFZ7w==","fsize":108491,"resto":121859528,"id":"WVV55MJO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121863158,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:38:10","name":"Sage","com":"<a href=\"#p121862447\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121862447<\/a>","filename":"1491476750324","ext":".jpg","w":644,"h":598,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":116,"tim":1492619890215,"time":1492619890,"md5":"8BgHRWlPwBTsWJCD\/IwH4g==","fsize":29950,"resto":121859528,"id":"6zRnr\/n9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121863888,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:44:25","name":"Anonymous","filename":"34b7ab174e78d102e080da5f5bcbc18c6949997145d2a825f975b5468f3f53f9 (1)","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492620265302,"time":1492620265,"md5":"sUCwNqgXS5SEGZU+mLe5fA==","fsize":148416,"resto":121859528,"id":"ePItR67l","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121856163,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:32:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"HES FUCKING OUTTA HERE","filename":"bill_oreilly8","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":412,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492615977168,"time":1492615977,"md5":"nDMoQHfFcTl9RFVe92wC5A==","fsize":230605,"resto":0,"id":"K6V2BQky","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hes-fucking-outta-here","country_name":"United States","replies":38,"images":7,"omitted_posts":33,"omitted_images":7},{"no":121862948,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:36:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121857489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121857489<\/a><br>Why does O&#039;Reilly need to go?

I have used a variety of other methods to calculate the other numbers; to be very brief, always remember that Macron&#039;s base is FRAGILE (1\/3 of voters could change minds) and is attracted to Melenchon&#039;s base, where as Fillon has stalled because of Penelopegate, and there is no reason to vote for Hamon as Melenchon becomes the candidate for the Left. <br><br>2nd Round will be 51.43% for Le Pen and 48.51% for Melenchon. Polls after the first round will show roughly a 54\/46 race, favouring Melenchon. <br><br>The crucial moment will come when Fillon ENDORSES Le Pen (or several prominent members of his party). Why would he\/they do that, you ask? Because they support Le Pen AGAINST the commie Melenchon (he wants 100% tax on rich). ALSO, they will have a parliamentary majority, and want to get shit done. THEY CAN GET SHIT DONE WITH LE PEN, BUT NOT WITH MELENCHON. This is crucial to remember.<br><br>This will be the FINAL BLOW. Currently (((polls))) predict the abstention rates of Fillon supporters in a 2nd round Le Pen\/Melenchon to be approximately 50%. (i.e. 50% do not vote at all). Fillon\/his party&#039;s endorsement of Le Pen will reduce this rate to approximately 30%, which results in the 51.43% victory I described above. So, add all these factors in and Le Pen will Make France Great Again. I&#039;m waiting, \/pol\/. Shortly, you will see that I was right.","filename":"Capture","ext":".png","w":401,"h":407,"tn_w":246,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492606689153,"time":1492606689,"md5":"bQ0kHM1zqVkIR2UL9YXz1Q==","fsize":216583,"resto":0,"id":"3SzxQ8AO","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"le-pen-will-win-guaranteed-2","country_name":"Australia","replies":268,"images":57,"omitted_posts":263,"omitted_images":55,"tail_size":50},{"no":121863756,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:43:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121840937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121840937<\/a><br><br>BUMP THIS","time":1492620187,"resto":121840937,"id":"vS5PABGR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121863765,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:43:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"i&#039;ve changed my mind. france deserves melenchon.","time":1492620195,"resto":121840937,"id":"LtajIleC","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121863788,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:43:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121858393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121858393<\/a><br>Mais mdr, les boulets qui pensent qu&#039;\u00e0 la DGFIP on prend les d\u00e9lations.

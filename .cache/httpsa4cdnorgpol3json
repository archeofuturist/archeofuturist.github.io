This video by Storm Clouds Gathering is a good analysis of the geo-political background to the situation [1] https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=K20<wbr>fm2166WM<br><br>First, it is important to know the basic alliances. Countries that support the Syrian government are Russia, China, Iran<br>and Iraq. The anti-Assad axis (countries pushing for regime change in Syria) are: United States, France, UK, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Turkey and Israel. An important reason for this geo-political conflict is control<br>of oil and gas resources in the region. In 2009 Qatar proposed a natural gas pipeline which would have passed through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Turkey and into Europe [2]. However, Assad rejected this. Instead in 2011, he formed a pact with Iraq, Iran and Syria to run a pipeline eastward, cutting Qatar and Saudi Arabia out of the arrangement. This gives a strategic advantage to the Shia faction and the Sunnis resent this. It also gives Russia an economic advantage over the US in oil and gas trading.","filename":"ZionistsForTrump","ext":".png","w":1032,"h":263,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":63,"tim":1492829035697,"time":1492829035,"md5":"GZXIhwadaNVhrQ3mkRzv3Q==","fsize":107467,"resto":0,"id":"UWcF2bQY","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"world-war-iii-real-motives-behind-trumps-missile","country_name":"United

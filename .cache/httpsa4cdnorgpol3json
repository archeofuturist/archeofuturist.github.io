They key word is voluntary. Forcibly extracting wealth from taxpayers to pay for someone else&#039;s medical issues is immoral, especially when you are financing other people&#039;s bad decisions in most cases. I have a soft spot for people who are born with incurable diseases and such, but we both know that isn&#039;t the majority of sob story cases. Frankly their family&#039;s should bare the responsibility for bringing them into the world whenever remotely possible. It&#039;s wrong to take money from people at gunpoint to finance other people&#039;s bad decisions.","time":1491198213,"resto":119283556,"id":"axVDrX17","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119284097,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)23:19:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Remember Jazz, the tranny kid with a TV show?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;in the trailer two of the doctors say pretty disturbing things and you see Jazz is visibly upset.

I say, we fix it! You might be asking yourself &quot;why the fuck does husband normie want to bring back chivalry, and asking pol to join his little crusade&quot; well, to answer that, look up the Ten Commandments of chivalry, as you can see, it says to go to war with any infidel, which, I thought you guys would love! Since, as you may all ready know, a infidel is someone who doesn&#039;t believe in your religion! Great huh? I say we try and trick people into getting on our side, since, most people assume chivalry is about being polite, we can use that as a start to get people to start agreeing we need to teach the next generation to live by chivalry! Since let&#039;s face it: our children are getting worse and worse, if we don&#039;t do something soon, we will have rude kids on this lovely site! The ones who have 9gag book marked, who have a Tumblr account, the ones who are absolute trash! So, who is with me to start the movement to I get back chivalry? I say we start the hashtag Chivalry is not dead, and say stuff like the current generation needs manners and the like.

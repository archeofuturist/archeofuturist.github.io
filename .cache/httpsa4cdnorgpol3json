We need to have a talk. It is clear to me now that we possess special powers. We have somehow managed to awaken an old Egyptian god to fight for us in this hour of need. We fought against the darkness and brought light to the world. I used to think that Kek was just a stupid fucking meme but after looking back at all of the shit that went down during the election I&#039;m seriously beginning to think there&#039;s something going on. The probability of everything happening like it did is astronomical without the influence of some sort of divine force or interruption. I&#039;m seriously beginning to think we have a God on our side. <br><br>I can&#039;t all just be coincidence.<br><br>And yet, I see no organized attempt to harvest this energy. Whether it really is a God or just the sheer amount of people we are able to mobilize towards a common goal, we have powers no one could have ever predicted. <br><br>FOR FUCKS SAKE WE GOT TRUMP ELECTED!<br><br>And yet... I see no organized attempt to harvest this energy. No cohesive effort to continue the fight. Just because we elected Trump and got Brexit through does not mean we can stop now. We need to fight now harder than ever to save Europe. We&#039;ve lost the last three elections in Europe, and I&#039;m beginning to think we&#039;ll lose France too if we don&#039;t get off our asses and do something about it.<br><br>So I&#039;m looking for some dedicated people to help me organize something to connect everyone on \/pol\/. Whether that be a discord server or whatever doesn&#039;t matter. But we need some form of organization and a command structure if we are going to harvest this energy and use our clear influence on the real world.<br><br>Look at what we did as a band of disorganized shitposters. Imagine what we could do as an organized, autistic, and unusually powerful army.","filename":"Muahahaoflore+used+roll+1+0000001+1000000+muahahaoflore+rolls+0+962+477+_dddfb4659a3f3d46ef65d9c4180ee0cf","ext":".png","w":326,"h":326,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491354562628,"time":1491354562,"md5":"+qtff7S\/6hLrgwQmA+Nmww==","fsize":62406,"resto":0,"id":"f5ZAfds\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-it-possible","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0},{"no":119545149,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:11:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1491354680,"resto":119544936,"id":"qdeD2G7l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119545272,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:12:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Go back to plebbit.

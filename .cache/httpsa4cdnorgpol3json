She&#039;s questioning the idea that transwomen experience the same kind of experiences that CISwomen do, rather than rejecting them altogether. I mean, you just have to read this extract from the statement she released on her Facebook page to understand that:<br><br>&quot;I said, in an interview, that trans women are trans women, that they are people who, having been born male, benefited from the privileges that the world affords men, and that we should not say that the experience of women born female is the same as the experience of trans women.<br><br>This upset many people, and I consider their concerns to be valid. I realize that I occupy this strange position of being a \u2018voice\u2019 for gender rights and so there is an automatic import to my words.<br><br>I think the impulse to say that trans women are women just like women born female are women comes from a need to make trans issues mainstream. Because by making them mainstream, we might reduce the many oppressions they experience.<br><br>But it feels disingenuous to me. The intent is a good one but the strategy feels untrue. Diversity does not have to mean division.<br><br>Because we can oppose violence against trans women while also acknowledging differences. Because we should be able to acknowledge differences while also being supportive. <br><br>Because we do not have to insist, in the name of being supportive, that everything is the same. Because we run the risk of reducing gender to a single, essentialist thing.<br><br>Perhaps I should have said trans women are trans women and cis women are cis women and all are women. Except that &#039;cis&#039; is not an organic part of my vocabulary.&quot;","filename":"4804694+_b0e6e620392e7a8a676b2ab79bbe0bd4","ext":".jpg","w":612,"h":519,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":106,"tim":1490371142676,"time":1490371142,"md5":"J+KxoLBPzTBKisg8dbfRYQ==","fsize":46364,"resto":118092675,"id":"wfANlbRt","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118088202,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)10:56:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Inshallah my white man, why haven&#039;t you converted to Islam yet?<\/span>","filename":"Chaddam Bin Laden","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":960,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490367375344,"time":1490367375,"md5":"TENzerNq\/zWKe53k13DGVQ==","fsize":57989,"resto":0,"id":"aJEo2OZw","country":"IS","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"inshallah-my-white-man-why-havent-you-converted","country_name":"Iceland","replies":84,"images":14,"omitted_posts":79,"omitted_images":13},{"no":118093997,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:54:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118092720\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118092720<\/a><br><br>If you had the choice between never having children or converting to Islam so you can reproductive.

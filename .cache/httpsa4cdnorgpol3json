In the beginning of 66, Nero married Statilia Messalina. Later that year or in 67 he married Sporus, who was said to bear a remarkable resemblance to Poppaea.[3]<br><br>Nero had Sporus castrated,[a] and during their marriage, Nero had Sporus appear in public as his wife wearing the regalia that was customary for Roman empresses. He then took Sporus to Greece and back to Rome, making Calvia Crispinilla serve as &quot;mistress of wardrobe&quot; to Sporus, epitropeia ten peri estheta.[7] Nero had earlier married another freedman, Pythagoras, who had played the role of Nero&#039;s husband; now Sporus played the role of Nero&#039;s wife. Among other forms of address, Sporus was termed &quot;Lady&quot;, &quot;Empress&quot;, and &quot;Mistress&quot;.[7] Suetonius quotes one Roman who lived around this time who remarked that the world would have been better off if Nero&#039;s father Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus had married someone more like the castrated boy.[1]<br><br>Suetonius places his account of the Nero\u2013Sporus relationship in his scandalous accounts of Nero&#039;s sexual aberrations, between his raping a vestal virgin and committing incest with his mother.[3] Some think that Nero used his marriage to Sporus to assuage the feelings of guilt he felt for kicking his pregnant wife Poppaea to death.[8] Dio Cassius, in a more detailed account, writes that Sporus bore an uncanny resemblance to Sabina and that Nero called Sporus by her name.[4]<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Augus<wbr>tus<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Augustus died in AD 14 at the age of 75.

Just over 100 families with adopted children of white, black, and mixed racial ancestry are being studied in an ongoing analysis of the effects of being raised by white adopting parents of middle or higher social status.123 This famous transracial adoption study by psychologists Sandra Scarr and Richard Weinberg is the most comprehensive attempt yet to separate the effects of genes and of family environment on the cognitive development of American blacks and whites. The first reports (when the children were about 7 years old) indicated that the black and interracial children had IQs of about 106, well above the national black average or the black average in Minnesota, where the samples were drawn. This result pointed to a considerable impact of the home setting on intelligence. However, a racial and adoptive ordering on IQ existed even in the first follow-up: The mean IQs were 117 for the biological children of white parents, 112 for the white adoptive children, 109 for the adopted children with one black and one white or Asian parent, and 97 for the adopted children with two black parents.124 Altogether, the data were important and interesting but not decisive regarding the source of the B\/W difference. They could most easily have been squared with a theory that the B\/W difference has both genetic and environmental elements in it, but, with considerable straining, could perhaps have been stretched to argue for no genetic influence at all.","time":1493003475,"resto":122508765,"id":"bJ\/Umbp+","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122534022,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)23:11:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122533283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122533283<\/a><br>(contd from <a href=\"#p122533957\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122533957<\/a> )<br>A follow-up a decade later, with the children in adolescence, does not favor the no-genetics case.125 The new ordering of IQ means was 109 for the biological children of white parents, 106 for the white adoptive children, 99 for the adopted children with one black parent, and 89 for the adopted children with two black parents.126 The mean of 89 for adopted children with two black parents was slightly above the national black mean but not above the black mean for the North Central United States. The bottom line is that the gap between the adopted children with two black parents and the adopted children with two white parents was seventeen points, in line with the B\/W difference customarily observed. Whatever the environmental impact may have been, it cannot have been large.<br>Scarr and Weinberg continue to argue that the results are consistent with some form of mixed gene and environmental source of the B\/W difference, which seems to us the most plausible conclusion.127 But whatever the final consensus about the data may be, the debate over the Minnesota transracial adoption study has shifted from an argument about whether the environment explains all or just some of the B\/W difference to an argument about whether it explains more than a trivial part of the difference.<br>Several smaller studies bearing on racial ancestry and IQ were well summarized almost two decades ago by Loehlin, Lindzey, and Spuhler.129 They found the balance of evidence tipped toward some sort of mixed gene-environment explanation of the B\/W difference without saying how much of the difference is genetic and how much environmental.130 This also echoes the results of Snyderman and Rothman\u2019s survey of contemporary specialists.","time":1493003503,"resto":122508765,"id":"bJ\/Umbp+","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122534306,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)23:14:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

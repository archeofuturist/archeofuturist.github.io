They had the same faults. Some were deluded, others tapped into disinformation, and many grossly misinterpreted what they saw. Their logic often failed when attempting to draw conclusions from incomplete information. For instance, in seeing that our reality was generated by a tyrannical intelligence who ruled through law, ritual, and regulation, some ignorant Gnostics concluded that rebelling against all law, including morality, was the key to freedom, so they became deviant libertines. It\u2019s from this kind of erroneous rebellious thinking that Satanic\/Luciferian streams diverged off the main Gnostic river. Like any higher knowledge, Gnosticism leads to a higher form of dualism between those who wield it responsibly and those who abuse it.

Thus all Gnostics were criticized and persecuted for seemingly making up whatever they wanted, that there was no internal consistency among them. In contrast, the dogma of the Church was set in stone and provided utter dependability for the uncertain of faith, thus making it the word of God on the grounds that God speaks consistently. But this defense of Church dogma over its immutability is a logical fallacy. A fixed Lie is worse than an evolving view of Truth. This same fallacy persists today among secular skeptics and religious fundamentalists who react like antibodies against foreign ideas emanating from the spiritual, metaphysical, and esoteric fields. To them it\u2019s all New Age bunk. They fall for the oldest trick in the book, which is to play one lie off another, to expose the faults of one thing to justify swallowing the faults of another. True intelligence is transcending such binary thinking and discerning what false dichotomies attempt to conceal.","time":1492105386,"resto":120926273,"id":"itGcgeD2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120937010,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)13:44:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120936695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120936695<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Frankly, the most significant argument for historical Jesus is that Jews didn&#039;t straight out kill him in NT.

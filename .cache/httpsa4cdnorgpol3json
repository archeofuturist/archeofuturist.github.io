ENOUGH OF THESE MUSLIM SCUMBAGS<br><br>After they gave notice in February 2015, Alabi says he bent over backwards to accommodate the Egyptian-born couple in booking acceptable times to show their apartment to prospective new tenants. At first, Madkour tried to argue that the landlord couldn\u2019t show the unit when his wife was home. Alabi explained that with 24 hours notice, the law gave him the authority to enter even if she was there.<br><br>They called the police, claiming that his shovelling snow outside their apartment was harassment. The officers confirmed that Alabi was legally allowed to show their unit when they were there. That\u2019s when they suddenly raised the religion issue, he says, and told him he couldn\u2019t enter during their prayer times. He agreed.<br><br>That still wasn\u2019t enough, Alabi says.<br><br>In addition to the 24-hour notice, and the prayer times, they also wanted him to text in advance. But when he texted them, they didn\u2019t reply - so he stopped.<br><br>And then there was the issue of removing his shoes. At the tribunal, the couple said they prayed in their bedroom and the floor had to remain clean. Yet Alabi claims the couple never had a problem before when he wore his shoes to make repairs in the apartment. And he wasn\u2019t wearing outside shoes, but the shoes he wore in his own home. He\u2019d come around to their apartment wearing rubbers over them and then take them off at the door. For that, he was accused of being racist.","filename":"(((macleans)))","ext":".jpg","w":501,"h":676,"tn_w":185,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493908772548,"time":1493908772,"md5":"7Y8q4\/CiU0AnLCo7xS07NA==","fsize":37112,"resto":0,"id":"v5pTvSH0","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"canada-is-a-muslim-country","country_name":"Canada","replies":7,"images":4,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":1},{"no":124066821,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:49:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"We need a happening to red pill some of these cucks.

The key resistance stands in the 113-114 zone. The press will try to manipulate the people to save the EU. That is the agenda of the press in Europe, so they will cheer Macron and do their best to destroy Le Pen and in doing so, they are condemning the EU to utter failure. All they can see is keep the EU together even if that leads to internal civil war within Europe. The only thing holding the EU together is France and Germany.&quot;<br><br>The elite want Macron to win but this will be the nail in the coffin for the EU. Brussels will assume they defeated the \u201cpopulist\u201d simply if Le Pen loses. However, the mainstream parties all lost already. Macron will simply mean that Brussels will not reform and that suggests that we are looking at the collapse of the Euro moving forward into 2018. <br><br>https:\/\/www.armstrongeconomics.com\/<wbr>international-news\/politics\/the-eur<wbr>o-french-elections\/<br><br>EU might be screwed anyway you look at it, the question is if european globalism will fade with it.","filename":"1490468909251","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493909524010,"time":1493909524,"md5":"kdOYl3238N7GDEwZejU\/yQ==","fsize":44242,"resto":0,"id":"2iL46q9i","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"eu-in-turmoil-regardless-of-le-pen-or-macron","country_name":"Sweden","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":124067775,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:58:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"I agree, OP is not a fag.<br>The question is when the EU will fall.<br>With Le Pen, it will fall quicker and with less lasting damage.","time":1493909938,"resto":124067091,"id":"Mo7XK42K","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124061254,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)09:47:11","name":"Anonymous","sub":"French election","com":"Whose more likely to win?<br>Macron or Pepe le pen?<br><br>My odds are with le pen","filename":"IMG_0441","ext":".jpg","w":225,"h":225,"tn_w":225,"tn_h":225,"tim":1493905631133,"time":1493905631,"md5":"E5DneruIi3uYDaqlhnaSQw==","fsize":23423,"resto":0,"id":"+wbz7gVu","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"french-election","country_name":"Sweden","replies":15,"images":4,"omitted_posts":10,"omitted_images":4},{"no":124065315,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:34:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124061710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124061710<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124063575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124063575<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124061984\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124061984<\/a><br>I&#039;m starting to think she acted vindictive on purpose last night...<br>Knowing she would certainly be defeated on the 2nd turn, she must have another plan for the post-election and the attacks during the debate must serves against macron in the future.<br>I hope so, otherwise she is absolutly dumb and unpersuasive.","time":1493908440,"resto":124061254,"id":"+ZdocnhY","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":124065452,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:35:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124061339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124061339<\/a><br>you&#039;re doing it wrong<br><br>this is how you get gets<br><br>Le Pen will win!","filename":"1487808359556","ext":".png","w":463,"h":425,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":114,"tim":1493908520257,"time":1493908520,"md5":"78ss4otXkAsVRVubR2yq2w==","fsize":18288,"resto":124061254,"id":"\/EqfTOGN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124066085,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:41:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124061710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124061710<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124061984\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124061984<\/a><br>You guys are retarded, she tried to put Macron down on purpose so that his voters would abstain, not flock to her.","time":1493908910,"resto":124061254,"id":"+3EGJVSB","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":124066662,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:47:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124061254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124061254<\/a><br>Whos name was mentioned the most before the campaign even started?<br>kek cant miss","time":1493909268,"resto":124061254,"id":"S9HG\/MPh","country":"BA","country_name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"no":124067771,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:58:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124066662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124066662<\/a><br>who missed those digits...","time":1493909935,"resto":124061254,"id":"+ZdocnhY","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]}]}

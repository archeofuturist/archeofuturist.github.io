Well here it comes.<br>It is, in fact, not SJW driven, atleast not at its core. It all begun in 2007 where EA did a study of why the untapped populous of females flocked to mirrors edge, but not to other titles with comparatively strong female protagonists.<br>Huge questionares where sent out, and the only stat that differed for mirrors edge was that, indeed, females rated her appearance as way uglier than the other ones, and that they could relate more to her than the others.<br>After this the study was performed again and again on new games and it was found that there was a direct correlation with facial structure to engagement of females. This study quickly leaked to all other big names in gaming including the company i work for.<br>So, simply put:<br><br>Females cannot and will not feel empathy or engagement for women that they see as competition.<br><br>That&#039;s why games like mirrors edge, assassins-creed(with ugly sidecharacters) and Horizon Zero Dawn are HUGE with females.<br>Its 100% market driven, and if you actually play these games you will also find that these characters RARELY are degenerate sluts, which would be the case if this was SJW driven. In most of these games the females openly reject brown males while in some cases hinting at attraction at the normal white guy (because guess what the vast majority of females loathe anyone that isn&#039;t white, just look at dating studies).<br>It is however also a success with SJW&#039;s because they think its more of a &quot;realistic&quot; female being represented. <br><br>So, don&#039;t worry guys, we will keep on putting hot chicks as antagonists and protagonists in games aimed for guys.<br><br>If anyone has any other questions about the inside of modern gaming feel free to ask.","filename":"A[1]","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492771843401,"time":1492771843,"md5":"gsbk4gtSag0ySHsEL0+V+A==","fsize":664485,"resto":0,"id":"RKf04JPt","country":"SE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-know-the-trend-of-ugly-female-protagonists","country_name":"Sweden","replies":19,"images":3,"omitted_posts":14,"omitted_images":3},{"no":122124612,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)07:11:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Interesting, you may be a cuck but you really came through on this one Sweden.

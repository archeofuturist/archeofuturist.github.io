Here, we found evidence that biased perceptions of young Black men\u2019s physical size may play a role in this process. The results of 7 studies showed that people have a bias to perceive young Black men as bigger (taller, heavier, more muscular) and more physically threatening (stronger, more capable of harm) than young White men. Both bottom-up cues of racial prototypicality and top-down information about race supported these misperceptions. Furthermore, this racial bias persisted even among a target sample from whom upper-body strength was controlled (suggesting that racial differences in formidability judgments are a product of bias rather than accuracy). Biased formidability judgments in turn promoted participants\u2019 justifications of hypothetical use of force against Black suspects of crime. Thus, perceivers appear to integrate multiple pieces of information to ultimately conclude that young Black men are more physically threatening than young White men, believing that they must therefore be controlled using more aggressive measures. <br><br>(http:\/\/psycnet.apa.org\/?&amp;fa=main.d<wbr>oiLanding&amp;doi=10.1037\/pspi0000092)<br><br>When will you swallow the institutionalized racism redpill?","filename":"blaximusmaximus","ext":".jpg","w":317,"h":315,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":248,"tim":1492996939788,"time":1492996939,"md5":"FaoZHtwTRtMvl5djabzxVg==","fsize":36533,"resto":0,"id":"PMAOVdQz","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"study-shows-blacks-perceived-as-more-imposing","country_name":"Australia","replies":27,"images":11,"omitted_posts":22,"omitted_images":10},{"no":122525306,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)21:56:04","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1448270792679","ext":".png","w":1531,"h":841,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1492998964289,"time":1492998964,"md5":"pMp94BGeLEl8CmxFB57Ohg==","fsize":119519,"resto":122521383,"id":"aV4a7y6h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122525472,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)21:57:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"hey op just wondering on whether or not you plan to get back to me","filename":"1452130897844","ext":".png","w":4179,"h":6889,"tn_w":75,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492999043168,"time":1492999043,"md5":"ld6OfrUR+G3nOPFjsWOBEg==","fsize":2403098,"resto":122521383,"id":"aV4a7y6h","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122525532,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)21:57:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122522478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122522478<\/a><br>In the US obesity rates are higher in the black community and blacks on average are shorter than whites.

At the Push of a Button, Narrative Strategies and the Image of Deep Brain Stimulation<br>* O. Hayes<br>Check for full text accessPurchase$31.50Get Full Text Elsewhere<br>Abstract<br>Mainstream media about deep brain stimulation (DBS), a therapy applied to Parkinson\u2019s disease among others, reflect cultural representations of the brain, of disease, and of healing. Science communication, especially in health issues, presents major challenges. Through a qualitative analysis of German-speaking print media, we trace the public image of DBS. The aim of this chapter is to highlight narrative strategies, to stress downsides of seemingly intuitive explanations, and to outline alternatives. In particular, notions of time and immediacy, mechanistic views, and symbolic moments in the narration support a simplistic wish for a therapy that will bring an instantaneous change from unrestrained disease to complete cure \u201cat the push of a button.\u201d This chapter demonstrates how shortcuts in the representation of DBS create misleading gaps that lay people cannot fill without resorting to cultural imagery. These overlapping representations are sustained by the general fascination regarding neuro-sciences.<br>Keywords<br>* Deep brain stimulation (DBS)mediarepresentationParkinson\u2019s<wbr>medicinenarrative","time":1493031314,"resto":122537685,"id":"tslDFI9X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122573298,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)06:55:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"What&#039;s with people referencing BuzzFeed in this thread?","time":1493031329,"resto":122537685,"id":"p0uDzjeM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122573517,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)06:58:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122537685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122537685<\/a><br>Destroy him.

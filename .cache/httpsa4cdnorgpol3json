Autists are Nature&#039;s way of correcting the greatest ill of humankind - oversocialization (see Uncle Ted&#039;s manifesto)<br>Now - the problem of getting autists to breed... but much like homosexuals, autists can be created or &quot;switched on&quot;, especially by the right societal conditions, and more will appear as the population increases and socialism puts more unnatural pressure on the natural human being.<br>Neanderthals may have been Hyperboreans - the Ubermenschen that Blavatsky, Hitler and many others sought. They hoped to build the Hyperborean empire once again via its remnants. Its remnants - Neanderthal DNA.<br>Nazis and Autists are a match made in Heaven, LITERALLY!","filename":"fucked-up-evolution_o_1828579","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":417,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":144,"tim":1491772271816,"time":1491772271,"md5":"iP3RGtEmhxhx1WuuuAcbCw==","fsize":120626,"resto":0,"id":"GfFMifCW","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"autists-are-descendants-of-neanderthals","country_name":"United States","replies":158,"images":21,"omitted_posts":153,"omitted_images":20,"tail_size":50},{"no":120362869,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)20:24:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120355458\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120355458<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Unable to change routine<\/span><br><br>Autism confirmed<br><br>Also, Kanzi the Bonobo&#039;s son may have the Bonobo version of autism","time":1491783886,"resto":120337610,"id":"Iz6Hj54Q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120363157,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)20:27:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120362454\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120362454<\/a><br>Once again, you demonstrate your black and white thinking.

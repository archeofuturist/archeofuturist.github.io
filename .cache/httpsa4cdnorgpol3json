Daily reminder that sea levels around the world were about 400 feet lower just before the end of the last Ice Age.<br><br>Near the end of the last Ice Age about 12,800 years ago, a giant comet that had entered the Solar System from deep space thousands of years earlier, broke into multiple fragments. Some of these fragments struck Earth, causing a global cataclysm unseen since the extinction of the dinosaurs. At least eight of the fragments hit the North American ice cap, while further fragments hit the Northern European ice cap. The impacts, from comet fragments a mile wide approaching at more than 60,000 miles an hour, generated huge amounts of heat which instantly liquidised millions of square kilometres of ice, destabilising Earth&#039;s crust and causing the global flood that is remembered in myths all around the world.<br><br>A second series of impacts, equally devastasting, causing further cataclysmic flooding, occurred about 11,600 years ago, the exact date that Plato gives for the destruction and submergence of Atlantis. The evidence for all of this shows beyond reasonable doubt that a civilisation at least as technologically advanced as 19th-century England at the onset of the Industrial Revolution (if not more technologically advanced) that flourished during the last Ice Age was destroyed in the global cataclysms between about 12,800 years ago and about 11,600 years ago.<br><br>A distant memory and a warning to the future - for the comet that wrought such destruction in remote antiquity may not be done with us yet.","filename":"iceagemap","ext":".png","w":853,"h":440,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":128,"tim":1493127842998,"time":1493127842,"md5":"cs0+u5uti9vK6vqtSQSaoQ==","fsize":557051,"resto":0,"id":"MT5xsBCS","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-red-parts-of-this-map-used-to-be-land-daily","country_name":"Australia","replies":37,"images":7,"omitted_posts":32,"omitted_images":5},{"no":122740061,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:39:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122739931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122739931<\/a><br><br>Huh?

The Ancient Greeks had a cyclical conception of human history that was similar to the cyclical conception of human history that the Hindus had (and STILL have). The Ancient Greeks had a Golden Age (equivalent to Satya Yuga in Hinduism), a Silver Age (equivalent to Treta Yuga in Hinduism), a Bronze Age (equivalent to Dwapara Yuga in Hinduism) and an Iron Age (equivalent to Kali Yuga in Hinduism). I call the model of human history that is currently dominant among historians &#039;the linear-progressive model of human history&#039;. The linear-progressive model of human history basically says that the further back in human history you go, the more primitive that humans, their cultures and their technology becomes. The linear-progressive model of human history embraced by modern historians and modern anthropologists actually has its roots in Judaeo-Christian beliefs, ironically enough. Virtually EVERY pre-Abrahamic culture WORLDWIDE embraced a conception of human history that was CYCLICAL, with civilisations rising and falling one after the other over VAST periods of time and humans being EXTREMELY OLD. Take the Puranas (a collection of ancient Indian writings), for example. The Puranas describe human lineages going back over a BILLION YEARS into the past and we have PHYSICAL EVIDENCE (in the form of fossils and artifacts) that confirms this.","time":1493131271,"resto":122734952,"id":"MT5xsBCS","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122740707,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:45:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122739715\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122739715<\/a><br><br>Bullshit.

It is about having a bond with your fellow countrymen, a bond that is based on your common heritage, be it linguistical, cultural, or genetic. <br><br>It is a natural part of human behaviour to organize, to form groups. And it&#039;s not always done with good intention, in fact, wicked people are the best at it (look at Jews, Free Masons, and the likes). Strong nationalism ensures that everyone within the nation belongs to a group by birtright, and it gives some degree of protection against those who would combine their efforts to subjugate others. Look at today&#039;s Western world, nationalism is all but destroyed, people are alienated from each other, and the individuals are easy prey for for those groups that seek to exploit them. This is why the globalist elite forces multiculturalism and immigration, it exactly the withering of nationalism and the alienation of people that servest their interests the best.<br><br>Tl;DR nationalism is good because it&#039;s an expression of kinship, and it helps people to resist harmful influence and exploitation by other groups or individuals. One might argue that nationalism can be replaced by other identities, such as class conciousness, but these intended replacements are always artificial, and are destined to fail, while nationalism has its roots in our most basic instincts.","time":1493131682,"resto":122739731,"id":"Hu2j9ea9","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":122741307,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:51:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122739731\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122739731<\/a><br>nah. just swastika worshiping shit martini stirrers performing running of the bulls, but on the scale of weapons of the mass destruction.

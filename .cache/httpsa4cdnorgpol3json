However I still believe that it would be best to have such a system of aristocratic power but without heredity of the power, since it is very possible for a bloodline to become fucked up, or at least to have an incompetent king (thinking about Louis XVI here, he almost didn&#039;t care about the power and was a shitty king because of it). For such a sort of feudal aristocracy that would generally be, de facto, hereditary, with people in power making their own children the fittest to rule through education, but a system that would still allow for people to be replaced if they no longer are the fittest rulers, such a system would be better in my opinion.","time":1490910081,"resto":118963635,"id":"B4Y9b5Ay","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118973321,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)17:45:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"(First born) monarchies allow God (if He exists) to influence the politics of a country.

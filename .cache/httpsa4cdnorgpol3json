Further afield, however, the disproportionate number of Jews involved in Bolshevism, and Marxism generally, was so widely recognized among diplomatic political, and intelligence circles, it would seem a strange anomaly indeed if a gentile had managed to crawl to the top of the Bolshevik regime, purge the Jewish influence, and establish an iron rule. Hence Stalin has been regarded, especially among those critical of Jewish influence in politics, economics and culture, as a secret Jew or as a Gentile lackey for a \u201cJewish troika\u201d continuing to secretly run the USSR after the ousting of transparently Jewish Bolsheviks such as Trotsky, Kamenev and Zinoviev. The suspicion that the USSR had continued under \u201cJewish rule\u201d was maintained among anti-Semitic circles right up until the implosion of the Soviet Union.","filename":"David-Axelrod","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":300,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492715623081,"time":1492715623,"md5":"Uyn7EeBIA9xP5b9Fb8CDBg==","fsize":58179,"resto":121979249,"id":"o9nq4Eo0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122028653,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)15:14:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121991084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121991084<\/a><br>Right.

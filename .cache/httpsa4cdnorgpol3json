There are over 300 fallacies. Every argument will cover at least one. If you think you&#039;ve defeated an argument by playing &#039;spot the fallacy&#039; you&#039;re wrong. A fallacy weakens an argument, it does not end it. This is literally Debate 101. I advise you to read some books on the subject to better understand the purpose of fallacies and how they&#039;re relevant.<br><br>As it is, OP is a stupid argument. Free Education is great, if the education was specifically something that was useful. Getting a free pass to study Gender Studies, Social Engineering or Social Politics or some shit isn&#039;t useful. A better use of the funds would be giving people education in simple things like learning how to cook a proper meal, basic DIY, how to use a computer safely and efficiently and so on and so forth.<br><br>A military is important and a military does not end just because you have X amount of something. Those need to be updated eventually. Russia is building a 90,000-100,000 displacement aircraft carrier, that&#039;s big. They&#039;ve not stopped, the USA shouldn&#039;t either. People don&#039;t understand that a strong military is a deterrent, people don&#039;t understand that attacking a country with that military because said country is acting up, will make other countries less likely to act up-- they don&#039;t want the same happening to them. You also forget the military keeps millions of people in a job. The MIC brings a lot of money to the USA and sadly not supporting the MIC will lead to a massive economic crash in the USA. Eisenhower tried to warn America about it; but he wasn&#039;t listened to.

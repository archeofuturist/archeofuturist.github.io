Invading North Korea first is actually the wrong move. <br><br>If something goes wrong, it is your guys who are shamed on the world&#039;s stage. China is still very much a paper tiger. They wouldn&#039;t want to be put into a position where they lost significant manpower or military assets. It looks bad. <br><br>Let America do all of the heavy lifting, they are a known commodity. And if anything does happen to the American forces, you can go &quot;Ra Ra stupid Americans!&quot; and bring out the old captured American trophies from the first war and stir up some nationalistic fervor.<br><br>Then you go in, eliminate the buffer state, and start putting the screws to SK. This puts the conflict into overdrive. That&#039;s the inevitable outcome here. China would never willingly bequeath NK to SK. They need that land. Either under their banner or any other. Right now that country (NK) is surviving by dint of the meager amount of trading that China does with them, and other illicit means. In practice though, the threat that China will intervene means that a war with NK would naturally drag China in because they don&#039;t want the Americans literally right there. <br><br>However if they (NK) do acquire a nuclear payload, that they can wield in any direction they feel like, well, they no longer need you. And they can start demanding further tribute, and attempt to negotiate better deals. Nobody wants this. <br><br>Blame the Jews, whatever, I don&#039;t particularly care. I do know though that a North Korea in possession of nuclear weapons creates a massive amount of disharmony in the region. <br><br>Let&#039;s say the war is delayed, alright? What do you think SK and Japan&#039;s response is going to be? They&#039;ll want to start their own nuclear programs, or demand that America put nuclear weapons on them\/nearby 24\/7. Again, escalating the issue, because China doesn&#039;t want any of that but the US will comply with the request because it allows for a faster response. The problem must be stopped now.","time":1492181064,"resto":121061901,"id":"OebwTfIF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121067575,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:44:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121066367\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121066367<\/a><br>Invade North Korea<br>Chain of command is broken<br>Rogue general disappears with enriched uranium<br>Rogue general sells uranium to some crazy rich Emir from Qatar<br>Uranium is shipped in New York disguised as dumbbell or something<br>Nuclear bomb is assembled in New York house basement by North Koreans nuclear scientists refugees paid by crazy Qatari Emir.<br>Explosion.","time":1492181069,"resto":121061901,"id":"q0a\/J7XO","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121065117,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:21:10","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Shitskin showing Norwegian bitch who&#039;s BOSS","com":"Norwegian blonde-white bitch who was beated and raped by a shitskin, gets interviewed and tells how is her life going<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She has a higher education and used to have a full-time job<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The beating and rape took place in her own living room<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The shitskin was never caught.

As Professor BR Myers points out in the cleanest race, the DPRK has never been a socialist. or communist state. It put on a huge act to get support from the Soviet Union &amp; China after it&#039;s independence, but in reality, DPRK is closer ideologically to the 3rd reich, or Imperial Japan than it is to the soviet union. An Ultra-conservative ethnic nationalist state, against any kind of race mixing, totally opposed to liberalism, extremely conservative views on age, sexuality, gender, family, &quot;LGBT&quot;, etc.. Stories about &quot;Starving North Korea&quot; are rooted largely in fiction. Child Malnutrition rates in North Korea are around 14% - Average child malnutrition in the world is around 30% (With many countries, eg, India, reaching as high as 50% - Which North Korea did not come close to even in the worst years of the 1990&#039;s famine, which has been over for more than a decade now).<br><br>Stories regarding the cult of personality\/lack of information are also greatly exaggerated.

The majority of those people are regular criminals - Rapists, human traffickers, pedophiles, etc..Most political prisoners in the country are from the elite classes. The myth of &quot;3 generations of imprisonment&quot; is a deliberate conflation of the Gulag system with the Songbun caste system.

Nearly all western thought since the last war, certainly all &quot;progressive&quot; thought, has assumed tacitly that human beings desire nothing beyond ease, security, and avoidance of pain. In such a view of life there is no room, for instance, for patriotism and the military virtues. The Socialist who finds his children playing with soldiers is usually upset, but he is never able to think of a substitute for the tin soldiers; tin pacifists somehow won\u2019t do. Hitler, because in his own joyless mind he feels it with exceptional strength, knows that human beings don\u2019t only want comfort, safety, short working-hours, hygiene, birth-control and, in general, common sense; they also, at least intermittently, want struggle and self-sacrifice, not to mention drums, flag and loyalty-parades. However they may be as economic theories, Fascism and Nazism are psychologically far sounder than any hedonistic conception of life. The same is probably true of Stalin\u2019s militarised version of Socialism. All three of the great dictators have enhanced their power by imposing intolerable burdens on their peoples. Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a grudging way, have said to people &quot;I offer you a good time,&quot; Hitler has said to them &quot;I offer you struggle, danger and death,&quot; and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his feet. <br><br>--George Orwell","filename":"3706","ext":".jpg","w":179,"h":266,"tn_w":168,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492177945713,"time":1492177945,"md5":"bI3OesaMOlURs6dBpYDtKw==","fsize":19264,"resto":0,"id":"zN5Hzpx8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"thoughts-on-this-quote","country_name":"United States","replies":23,"images":4,"omitted_posts":18,"omitted_images":2},{"no":121067282,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:41:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121066789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121066789<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iran%<wbr>E2%80%93Contra_affair<br><br>CIA sells cocaine and arms to Iran to fund the Contras 1985-1987 <br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Iran%<wbr>E2%80%93Iraq_War<br><br>Iran Iraq war 1980-1988<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Unite<wbr>d_States_support_for_Iraq_during_th<wbr>e_Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_war<br><br>United states funds Iraq during Iran\/Iraq War<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Opera<wbr>tion_Cyclone<br><br>CIA sponsors Mujahadeen<br><br>http:\/\/www.michaelparenti.org\/afgha<wbr>nistan_story_untold.html<br><br>Mujahadeen sell herion<br><br>These are all facts","time":1492180910,"resto":121062088,"id":"wWLplAsa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121067393,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:42:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121067282\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121067282<\/a><br>Yes, I&#039;m on the same page as you.<br><br>I&#039;m asking if your name is Eric you pseudobong.","time":1492180971,"resto":121062088,"id":"tS0lmMaX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121067406,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:42:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121066543\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121066543<\/a><br>Orwell was an anarcho-communist, and fought for the anarcho-syndicalist FAI in Spain.

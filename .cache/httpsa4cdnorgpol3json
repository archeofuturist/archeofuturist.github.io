Greeks had it all figured out 3000 yrs ago","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;When Pandora opened her box, as the Ancient Greek myth goes, all manner of evil was released into the world - ending the Golden Age of man and forsaking them to a life of death and rebirth. Being the first woman created by the gods, she was sent as a punishment. However, Pandora was not always despised as the bringer of evil.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Over the years, Pandora went from a revered goddess to the root of all evil, later to be conflated with other religions and immortalized in art and myth.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The earliest written myth of Pandora comes from Hesiod in \u201cWorks and Days\u201d, as well as his \u201cTheogony\u201d to a lesser extent. It is in these works that we see the first version of her as an ill-fated human that brought evil into the world. As the myth goes, she was the first woman created by the gods, Hephaestus and Athena at the request of Zeus. Zeus requested that she be made as a punishment to be unleashed on mankind, due to the transgressions of Prometheus, who had stolen fire from the gods and given it to man. Hephaestus molded her from the earth, just as man was created, but all of the gods gave her unique and seductive gifts<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When Pandora was delivered to mankind, she brought with her a pithos (an ancient Greek vessel), later misconstrued as a box, which contained disease, pain, and various other evils that were released to the world. However, once the box was opened and Pandora saw all the evils fly out of it, she attempted to replace the lid, leaving one thing behind - hope. Thus, ended the Golden Age of man and the Silver Age began, in which man was not subjected to death. With the introduction of women came birth, leading to the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth.<\/span><br><br>http :\/\/www.ancient-origins.net\/myths-le<wbr>gends\/pandora-tale-good-girl-gone-b<wbr>ad-007773?nopaging=1","filename":"pandora","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":630,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":131,"tim":1490425136842,"time":1490425136,"md5":"GRutcnxw7iRYoL+Yt1ULkw==","fsize":51133,"resto":0,"id":"eEKySBL7","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dude-the-greeks-had-it-all-figured-out-3000-yrs","country_name":"United States","replies":254,"images":23,"omitted_posts":249,"omitted_images":23,"tail_size":50},{"no":118225429,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)09:45:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118198125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118198125<\/a><br>I&#039;m not seeing it elsewhere so I&#039;ll go ahead and say it: There was a reason hope was in that pithos with the ailments that plague mankind: hope is the distraction that prevents us from getting shit done. <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Instead of planning, we dream. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Instead of seizing the day to better our lives, we do so to waste them because &quot;it&#039;ll all work out&quot;.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Instead of &quot;doing&quot;, we &quot;hope&quot;.<\/span><br>And that is why we will lose.

Why don&#039;t you pay any attention to the substantive portion of the post pointing to an archive of the works of Julius Evola? But sense I am a nice Guy I looked up the passage:<br><br>&quot;From time to time SS doctors visited the crematorium, above all Hauptsturmfu&quot;hrer Kitt and Obersturmfu&quot;rher Weber. During their visits it was just like working in a slaughterhouse. Like cattle dealers they felt the thighs and calves of men and women who werestill alive and selected what they called the best pieces before the victims were executed. After their execution the chosen bodies were laid on a table. The doctors proceeded to cut pieces of still warm flesh from thighs and calves and threw them into waiting receptacles. The muscles of those who had been shot were still working and contracting, making the bucket jump about. At first we thought the Nazis planned to use human flesh for plastic operations on wounded soldiers. Only later we learned that those buckets of living flesh were taken to the Institute of Hygiene at Rajsko where it was used in the laboratories for the growing of bacterial cultures.\u201d<br><br>-Mu&quot;ller, Filip.

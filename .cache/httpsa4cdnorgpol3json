When Russia was communist, America had to push extremely anti-communist narrative. Now when Russia is capitalist and nationalist (as nationalist as a multiethnical empire can be) US is pushing left-wing ideology. The USSR is gone, but the elites need to keep American public opinion in antagonistic towards Russia. <br>In the end is not about ideology, as USSR after 20s and expulsion of Trotsky was never really left-wing and US never really opposed communism (see Nixon and Sino-American relations during Nixon and Kissinger, allowing Pol Pot to reign in Cambodia etc.). It was about the spheres of influence, not communism\/capitalism. Basically the same Great Game of British Empire vs Russian Empire 2.0. Only now USA vs USSR\/Russian Federation.<br><br>Ideologies are used by the American ruling class to create and maintain the image of &quot;the enemy&quot;, to manufacture consent. This is needed to make American public opinion belligerent and make Americans ready to go to war, when needed.

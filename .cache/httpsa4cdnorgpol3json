The situation must get (much) worse before it can get better. The relatively recent awakening of a significant portion of the white US population to ideas of nationalism, the &quot;alt-right,&quot; and, of course, \/pol\/ itself becoming a (small) real world political force of its own is the first step along that path.<br><br>The problem with both liberal and conservative whites in the US is that civic nationalism was instrumental in allowing the various peoples of Europe to live here in peace and collectively understand themselves to be ethnically &quot;white&quot; (a pan-European identity) and nationally &quot;American.&quot; With the 1965 Immigration Act that shifted the vast majority of immigrants from Europe to the third world, civic nationalism has become poison. While Germans, Austrians, French, English and Swedes have cultural differences and some ancient animosities, there is no comparison to those minute differences and those differences between a German and an Indian or a Frenchman and a Sudanese.<br><br>The only vaccine to multiracial\/multicultural civic nationalism is direct contact with large numbers of non-whites. For example, a 95% white school will view the 5% of minorities very favorably (minorities are on their best behavior around whites when they are the clear &quot;token&quot; minority). A 40% white school where whites are the plurality but not outright majority will churn out much more racially aware kids.","time":1491881192,"resto":120526928,"id":"6E9wXP3S","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120545421,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)23:27:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120541002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120541002<\/a><br>underrated.<br><br>my sides. rofl","filename":"mememagic","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491881262194,"time":1491881262,"md5":"Kmr5mowDDVbPq5JxW+xZmw==","fsize":83353,"resto":120526928,"id":"gITn84f9","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120545441,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)23:27:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120527851\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120527851<\/a><br>Brazil is telling it straight right there.

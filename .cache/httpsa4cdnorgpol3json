Previously, Western Civilization enforced monogamy through various legal, religious and social pressures. As these restrictions have been removed, we are regressing back to the jungle in which women have multiple sexual partners with a small subset of the male population. In primitive societies this results in the harem. In such an arrangement the top 20% of the males sexually monopolize 80% of the females. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; We have seen such behavior for years in the inner city in which women have multiple \u201cbaby daddies\u201d. If you should visit a city such as Detroit, you will have a hard time finding a woman who has multiple children from the same father. What is interesting about these arrangements is that the biological fathers tend to be a small subset of the male population within the city. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We find that 80% of these women share the 20% of the men in an unofficial polygamous arrangement. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; The problem with such a polygamous arrangement is that 80% of the men are left out of the sexual marketplace. And such men tend to be violent and unlikely to be productive members of society. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This is the situation that you can find in most primitive countries in Africa.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Oez<wbr>icH0pZmk<br><br>Western Society Has Become Sexually Like Africa","filename":"1462109470138","ext":".jpg","w":281,"h":351,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491313749229,"time":1491313749,"md5":"euNFuorilN8m1pDKW6eQew==","fsize":15778,"resto":0,"id":"xLcUrcVT","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"modern-liberated-woman-claims-to-have-fucked-over","country_name":"United States","replies":228,"images":53,"omitted_posts":223,"omitted_images":52,"tail_size":50},{"no":119519973,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:36:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119518395\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119518395<\/a>","filename":"meme","ext":".jpg","w":460,"h":345,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491341760766,"time":1491341760,"md5":"22Q7cuHPbv+frwZ2dMByqA==","fsize":57232,"resto":119470578,"id":"xLcUrcVT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119521439,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:47:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119516986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119516986<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Virgins are so sad.<\/span><br><a href=\"#p119516986\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119516986<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tiny shriveled cock<\/span><br><br><br>So much man-shaming.","time":1491342479,"resto":119470578,"id":"xLcUrcVT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119522142,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:53:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119471309\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119471309<\/a><br>Nathan Drake ate one too many cheeseburgers","filename":"Obese Nathan","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491342806664,"time":1491342806,"md5":"9IhkD0rv8Oc4H\/tesy8SCg==","fsize":126518,"resto":119470578,"id":"V5is5FlM","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119522167,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:53:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119516926\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119516926<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now I am curious to see how her vagina looks<\/span><br><br>Not me, man.","filename":"1491332883522","ext":".jpg","w":560,"h":541,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1491342816876,"time":1491342816,"md5":"aofIl3q+iBCIzNJF7g0zXw==","fsize":47196,"resto":119470578,"id":"xLcUrcVT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119522869,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:59:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"She&#039;s a nonhuman incapable of redemption<br><br>She&#039;s too far gone psychologically, she&#039;s incapable of thought or feeling, she&#039;s just a literal cum dumpster whore and a disgrace to humanity","time":1491343149,"resto":119470578,"id":"xGPJGzO8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119510994,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)16:20:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"Can you believe this satanic whore is a priest in Finland?

Outside of Europe, they are very popular in some South American countries, notably in Argentina and Uruguay. Electronic bidet-integrated toilets, along with functions like toilet seat warmers, are commonly found in Japan.<br>In northern Europe, bidets are rare, although in Finland bidet showers are common.[7] Bidet showers are also common in South-East Asia, South Asia and parts of the Middle East.<br>In 1980, the first &quot;paperless toilet&quot; was launched in Japan by manufacturer Toto,[8] a combination of toilet and bidet which also dries the user after washing. These combination toilet-bidets (washlet) with seat warmers, or attachable bidets are particularly popular in Japan and South Korea, found in approximately 60% of households.[citation needed] They are commonly found in hotels and even some public facilities.

White people are the current day native Americans, we must stop squabbling about whether or not we like their country as a whole because in truth we are all brothers. Americans have niggers and spics in our country, it is not as our founding fathers would have wanted it, and it is not how we want it. Great Britain, France, Sweden, Germany, all of Europe really has problems with Muslims and Africans surging into their country, are they cucks because of it? No, they do not wish this to happen to their country, they are here for that very reason. This is not a time to divide our countries into countries, but a time to rise together under a new defined identity of whiteness. Any who subvert this cause are the enemy, banter is all good and well, but true hatred for another country where white people struggle against leeches is evil. There is a huge problem in this forum of people who are simply angry at their own lives, and therefore have a lot of hatred inside them, this is not conducive to our goals, look at the skinheads, they are laughed at and are in summation, merely white criminals. We must be more than simple oafs who work in factories, our message not of hatred but of love of your people. This is the critical mistake, and it must end. I encourage you to call out this anti-white subversive commentary when you see it, no matter the country. If an American calls a Swede a cuck or if a Swede calls an American a nigger, this cannot stand, A house divided against itself cannot stand. <br><br>This thread is dedicated to the Unity of the White race, feel free to post anything which makes you proud of white achievement or merely discuss your observations on this site.","filename":"1486589874247","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492987188012,"time":1492987188,"md5":"Qj3MKtZcAfvqzN4vzcjkiQ==","fsize":80426,"resto":0,"id":"A9xjq+fq","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"unity-among-whites","trip":"!P6sRzr5956","country_name":"United States","replies":50,"images":7,"omitted_posts":45,"omitted_images":7},{"no":122505434,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)19:12:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122501010\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122501010<\/a><br>There is no &quot;white race&quot; you dumb fuck.

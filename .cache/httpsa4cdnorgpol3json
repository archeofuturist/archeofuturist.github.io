White supremacists and liberal retards and fooling you idiots into thinking you&#039;re all going to be niggers by 2060. Do some research. <br><br>Here are the US census projections for 2060 - <br><br>* White (including Hispanic whites) 2060: 69%<br>* White (not inlcuding Hispanic) 2060: 43%<br>* Black\/African American 2060: 15%<br>* Hispanic\/Latino (includes white Hispanics) 2060: 31%<br>* Asian 2060: 8.2%<br>* Native American (the original people) 2060: 1.5%<br>* Hawaiian\/Pacific Islander 2060: 0.3%<br>* Two+ Races (me) 2060: 6.4%<br><br>About half of the &quot;Hispanics&quot; are going to be White people, including those blonde-haired blue-eyed &quot;Hispanics&quot; from Argentina and people like Ted Cruz. Only 15% will be actually brown, and only 6.4% of the population will be these mysterious brown-hybrids you keep talking about. <br><br>Wikipedia says the majority of Whites (including White Hispanics) will be 73.1% in 2050, down from 77.1% in 2015. Most of the population growth is going to be in big cities like NYC, Miami, LA (etc) and mainlaind and rural America will still be majority-White. <br><br>Also, non-Hispanic Whites will the minority by percentages (still more than double that of Blacks), but their numbers are never mentioned. For all we know there will be 200 mill Whites today and 200 mill Whites in the future, just more Latinos. <br><br>Also these projections can easily change in a number of ways, and as the NY Times said, they&#039;re completely unrealistic as racial categories are changing drastically (quick example, in 1960 I wouldn&#039;t have been White, nor would have the Irish, Italians, Russians, etc). <br><br>I&#039;ve got a lot more info about this but can&#039;t fit it all in. In short, start making more White babies if you&#039;re worried, but stop spreading this White genocide, liberal &quot;we&#039;ll all be brown, HA!&quot; bullshit.

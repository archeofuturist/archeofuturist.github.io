He still thinks Catholicism is the ultimate representation of it (sorry, no). <br><br>Also, he denies the importance of race, which seems counter-intuitive to Logos (natural order), since part of the natural order would be to respect the tribal nature of humans and to see how mixing them all up is a disaster and against life&#039;s plan. <br><br>I honestly think the ultimate way forward is race realism combined with the concept of Logos, but a NEW religion outside of Christianity for white people in particular. Christianity is so cucked at this point; there&#039;s no turning back on it. Most don&#039;t give a damn about it anymore, either, but at least their biological instincts will be activated the more shitskins ruin their communities.","time":1493232250,"resto":122913522,"id":"35NmOp8o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122919486,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:39:24","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Red Bull\u2019s CEO Is Reportedly Launching A Right-Wing News Platform","com":"Name it No Bull.","filename":"mh5380q4jvty","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":2048,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493231964609,"time":1493231964,"md5":"XPjiljuDjqCX8jCv+ZNz3w==","fsize":223415,"resto":0,"id":"rcOxKfrK","country":"NL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"red-bulls-ceo-is-reportedly-launching-a-rightwing","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":7,"images":0,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":0},{"no":122919744,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:41:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;the sugar-filled jew<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;redpilled<\/span><br><br>that&#039;s a sugarpill, anon<br><br>hide sage report","time":1493232085,"resto":122919486,"id":"YO44jjya","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122919878,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:42:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"PREP THE RED BULL<br>RED BULLED","time":1493232152,"resto":122919486,"id":"M8\/tCydc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122920041,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:43:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122919486\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122919486<\/a><br>It&#039;s a jew trick<br>He&#039;ll sway right minded people to go left<br>Fuck the merchants","time":1493232229,"resto":122919486,"id":"hyDCya2p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122920053,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:43:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122919744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122919744<\/a><br>A placebo is still preferable to poison.","time":1493232234,"resto":122919486,"id":"t\/HrZLhG","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122920093,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:44:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122919744\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122919744<\/a><br>Kek<br><br><a href=\"#p122919486\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122919486<\/a><br>Its all good but beware often these so called right wingers turn out to be closet jews, using divide and conquer and infiltration tactics<br><br>Time will tell.","time":1493232250,"resto":122919486,"id":"zT2ott5q","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122919234,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:37:25","name":"Anonymous","sub":"What&#039;s the difference between Erdoganists and G\u00fclenists?","com":"It&#039;s not the start of a joke, I really want to know.

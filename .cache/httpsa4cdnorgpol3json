B is like a with two branches from the top and the bottom that begin to grow out and for some environmental reasons the branches grow back towards each other and then inwards. Contrary to the bold that it might have represented, it displays introvertion, a creative ability to change direction when faced with adversity, shyness of society. It also shows a supportive nature towards others as the branches move inwards to support each other. B is sensitive to feelings and that is observed by the touching of the branches. A temperamental and meditative attitudes are all qualities the letter B holds.<br><br>O: Meaning of O in BOHAF. O is well carved with no pointed edges. It is smooth and closed. It shows deep in thought, well disciplined, down in the dumps and caring. The roundedness of the O with lookout in the middle indicates a peering nature into the outside. This means, lookout for the mysterious and be home-loving and enjoy the things that are close by. It is a traditionalist letter.<br><br>H: Meaning of H in BOHAF. H looks like a ladder. As a ladder, it implies rising from the bottom with effort. H shows inspiration and firmness. The connected of the uprights parts indicate impartiality. The letter H is upright and stable indicating calmness and self-reliance.","time":1490477359,"resto":118265669,"id":"CmY2jXpp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118274756,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)17:29:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118266291\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118266291<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118265669\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118265669<\/a><br>A: Meaning of A in BOHAF. The letter A has two bars connected at a pointed edge and a cross bar holding them together. From an open end to a pointed edge signifies that all energies are trained to a point to achieve the most singularly important goal. The cross bar shows caution. Failure is avoided by stringing all required resources together. A also looks like a Pyramid with the peak as the apex of the Pyramid. Pyramids are iconic. A therefore symbolizes prominence and a desire to be recognized for ones achievements. The cross bar also represents a rung in ladder. To get to the top, one has to first step on the rung. It also means originality, a strong will power and an enterprising ability. The upper-case version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. It shows aspiration, the dominance to be successful, positive attitude, an optimistic world view and egotism.<br><br>F: Meaning of F in BOHAF. The letter F is like the letter E, but without the bottom rung. Even without this rung, F shows remarkable stability on its single leg. It means devotion, loving, uncomplaining, defensive, calm. F stands up straights and exemplifies straightforwardness, accountability and harmoniousness.","time":1490477367,"resto":118265669,"id":"CmY2jXpp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118271520,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)16:59:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Name a more based European leader.

Its up to the reader to complete the presentation in a way that makes sense. is it some sort of short circuit in thought forming-expression? is it just stupidity? Why not be normal enough to present your ideas from beginning to end? Leaving out half of what you want to say, thinking we are stupid if we dont read your mind...is really aggravating.

When they finally marched, they didn&#039;t even fill a N-S short block. &#039;THOUSANDS&#039; may have watched to see what was going on, but I&#039;ll bet less than a thousand marched.

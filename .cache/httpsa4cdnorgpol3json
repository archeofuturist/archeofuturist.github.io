These mass protests aren&#039;t going to do anything against people with APCs and tanks. You need actual hit and run tactics. You need to prepare for war. First things first inventory on what chemicals you have available. What can you get your hands on easily? Car batteries? Cleaning supplies? Oil and Gas? Look around for what is plentiful and we can go from there.","time":1493789970,"resto":123862938,"id":"9HE\/ul5V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123878162,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:43:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123877684\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123877684<\/a><br>Can you trade guns for a shipment of supply?<br>I can rent a truck and go over your border.","time":1493790186,"resto":123862938,"id":"SSI6eY38","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":123878218,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:43:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123869284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123869284<\/a><br>And Podemos in Spain backing Maduro... and profiting from &#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;consulting&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;&#039;: fees.","time":1493790228,"resto":123862938,"id":"ZwelgVWl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123878224,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:43:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123877341\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123877341<\/a><br>You are learning a lot of espa\u00f1ol.<br><br><a href=\"#p123877684\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123877684<\/a><br>Repression only works until a certain point, pass that they have to actually be right and they aren&#039;t.","filename":"venezuela (2)","ext":".jpg","w":630,"h":420,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493790234554,"time":1493790234,"md5":"8bFQkR23dLTXGkZ68UkU+Q==","fsize":46428,"resto":123862938,"id":"xkqMmNCt","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123872237,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)00:40:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"So why do you guys still like Trump.

What happened was he reversed a quarter percentage point cut to mortgage insurance rates that was yet to go into effect. There&#039;s two things to note here:<br>1. It hadn&#039;t even gone into effect yet. So there&#039;s no net increase on first time home buyer costs. They keep paying what they&#039;re paying now.<br><br>2. This isn&#039;t affecting mortgage premiums. It&#039;s about mortgage insurance premiums. Mortgage issuers require mortgage insurance for risky loans: people with low income, people with low credit scores, people asking for loans that represent more than they can reasonably afford. Keeping the cost of mortgage insurance premiums high is a good thing. Hell, if anything they should be increased even more. Maybe then people will think twice before going for the unaffordable mortgage. This reduces the default rate on mortgages.<br><br>So in effect, it&#039;s a commitment not to reduce the idiot insurance. It will remain costly to be an idiot.

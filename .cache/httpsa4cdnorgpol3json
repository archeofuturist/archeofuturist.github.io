Calling somthing a social construct is just saying that it&#039;s somthing we do in society, not a fundamental aspect of nature. It&#039;s literally just a meaningless label outside of academic environments. <br>Our gender is how we perceive ourselves in relation to our society based on our circumstances. If you are male, ie have male bones and hormones and genitals etc, then you are perceived as a man by society and in most cases will perceive yourself as one. Gender dysphoria comes around as a mental condition where someone with a male body perceives themselves as female and it causes distress when their conditions don&#039;t match that and society does not see them as that. So the solution is to change the conditions so that they appear more feminine, i.e. Giving them hormones to develop female secondary sex characteristics and have them adopt womanly behaviors from that society.","filename":"1487324196851","ext":".jpg","w":943,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1490897302022,"time":1490897302,"md5":"barhrazkIEE5PYLVZ4LcDQ==","fsize":126726,"resto":118921753,"id":"CH4+nxlb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118948267,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:14:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"trannies LOL","filename":"1486311933963","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":139,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1490897660861,"time":1490897660,"md5":"VzOxXRGjB85k3TiqgZERsg==","fsize":3223,"resto":118921753,"id":"Px42OZUo","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118939341,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)12:50:08","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Blacks never built any......","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":338,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1490892608690,"time":1490892608,"md5":"fyP2hfWMCQu619fNqaYA0Q==","fsize":54074,"resto":0,"id":"K5FcBi7g","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"blacks-never-built-any","country_name":"United States","replies":88,"images":28,"omitted_posts":83,"omitted_images":25},{"no":118947618,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:08:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118947512\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118947512<\/a><br>They are building more mudhuts","time":1490897292,"resto":118939341,"id":"zQ+sOlBb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118947803,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)14:09:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118939341\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118939341<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The best, biggest thing they managed to build o their own.

Why should the public tax payer pay for the cost of global warming, and not the wealthy oil companies? You are also failing to account for planned obsolescence and the mass advertising industry, which is capitalist propaganda that controls what information a consumer is given.","time":1490365560,"resto":118061624,"id":"PeJTWVNa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118085320,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)10:26:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118084680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118084680<\/a><br><br>Can&#039;t blame you.<br><br>You get defended by tranies and cucks, I get neckbeard virgins.<br><br>Hooray","time":1490365570,"resto":118061624,"id":"Qd7qrkH+","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118085476,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)10:27:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118084764\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118084764<\/a><br>Sounds like communism.","time":1490365665,"resto":118061624,"id":"n6miNXu\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118085564,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)10:28:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118085320\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118085320<\/a><br>praise kek!","time":1490365717,"resto":118061624,"id":"PeJTWVNa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118076820,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)08:45:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Search within your heart, you know it to be true.","filename":"shitstorm maker","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490359513442,"time":1490359513,"md5":"yljgyc2Yi6mRFLrmqlrkWA==","fsize":87016,"resto":0,"id":"i6ZgzWHB","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"search-within-your-heart-you-know-it-to-be-true","country_name":"Israel","replies":160,"images":44,"omitted_posts":155,"omitted_images":42,"tail_size":50},{"no":118084817,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)10:20:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118077319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118077319<\/a><br>Certainly not lawful","time":1490365234,"resto":118076820,"id":"wBzSkZuk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118084903,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)10:21:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118076820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118076820<\/a><br><br>Anti globalist Iran is the real enemy, goy.

I am not well educated on the Kurds but I remember hearing that they were purposely left out of Sykes-Picot lines (getting their own nation after world war 2) and it seems Israel has been helping them and getting close with them the past 30+ years. I always thoughts Kurds were light skinned, like Azeris or some Turks, but then I saw some photos and they were all pretty dark almost gypsy\/Indian looking. Kurds seem to be getting lots of help from the US too.

Alongside spelling it&#039;s the sort of shit that should be taught in primary school. Shitty grammar, therefore, is a failure of the education system and parents. I can understand more expensive and elite schools offering a higher degree of education but spelling and grammar is the bare fucking minimum that ought to be taught in any school.","time":1492921728,"resto":122377831,"id":"3DStDQ9N","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122373093,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:31:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why did Hitler declare war on America after Pearl Harbor?

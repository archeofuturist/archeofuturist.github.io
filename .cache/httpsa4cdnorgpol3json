Every other religion, faith, ideaology, or sci fi nonsense is based on what you do. Christianity real Christianity is based on what he did. Who is he and what did he do? He is Jesus Christ. What did he do he died for you and me. When he was crucified it wasn&#039;t just his physical body that suffered. Imagine every time you&#039;ve been hurt. Think back about to those times and Imagine Jesus taking that pain as well. Jesus cried out forgive them father they know not what they do. It&#039;s awesome. The only way to the father is through the son. Ask to be filled with the Holy Spirit. Pray and ask for guidance. Get a copy of the King James Bible. Read matthew, mark, luke, and john. Strive to live as Jesus did. You will fail miserably. But you are already forgiven. Don&#039;t take it for granted. Also something most Churches don&#039;t even teach what Jesus said. If they did and we strived to follow his words the world would be a better place.

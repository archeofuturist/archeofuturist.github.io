The wings are the most durable and strong part of a plane, what&#039;s least durable is fuselage, nose and the tail which are said to penetrate the pentagon while the most durable parts, which are wings, were vaporized? Also the exit hole in the pentagon&#039;s C structure could never be achieved by the nose and fuselage of the plane since they couldn&#039;t even find engines which are almost indestructible (don&#039;t confuse with being malformed or damaged). This shit is confusing and it&#039;s hard as fuck to find clear explanation to but stating some half assed arguments is retarded. There is too much false media coverage such as those 2 recordings available (which are useless and from around 700s other which were not disclosed by FBI), dumb liquefied theory which cannot exist when you consider reinforced steel beam construction of the pentagon and the pattern and trajectory in which debris has penetrated structure A,B and C or the &quot;official&quot; angle of plane crash (since there were 2 flight path readings, 1 from the black box of alleged plane and after few months the official U.S. military radar reading which came forth with totally different plane route which was more plausible than the &quot;official&quot; one yet undermined the official media narrative and thus got no coverage).","time":1490985671,"resto":119078870,"id":"F4R\/lsa1","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119085040,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)14:43:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119082040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119082040<\/a><br>I saw a Cat front end loader that was clearing snow, back into the wing root of a 747, and it mangled the CAT.

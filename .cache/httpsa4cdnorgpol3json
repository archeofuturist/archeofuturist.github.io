Everything will die: my parents are dying, the people I love are dying, the girl I love will die too, no one will remember me or what I have done given enough time...<br><br>Life is suffering with short intervals of happiness...<br><br>Tfw eve if everything is going &quot;right&quot; you still have a hole in your soul and you know that NOTHING will ever fill it, you cna just numb it for a short period and then go on putting up a mask and resisting the blows of fate...<br><br>To be, or not to be- that is the question: <br>Whether &#039;tis nobler in the mind to suffer 1750<br>The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune <br>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, <br>And by opposing end them. To die- to sleep- <br>No more; and by a sleep to say we end <br>The heartache, and the thousand natural shocks 1755<br>That flesh is heir to. &#039;<br><br>WHAT AM I FIGHTING IN THIS LIFE FOR \/pol\/? WHY? <br><br>I just want to stop suffering....please insult me at least...make me feel something...","filename":"1","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":325,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":162,"tim":1492789989310,"time":1492789989,"md5":"fDATS+ZWJbJTSCZtIfcBbw==","fsize":31185,"resto":0,"id":"jMxcEneL","country":"IT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-live-pol","country_name":"Italy","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":122150098,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)11:55:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122149857\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122149857<\/a><br>Didn&#039;t read this.

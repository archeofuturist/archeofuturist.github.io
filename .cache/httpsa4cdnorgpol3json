Shit like flat earthers or anti-vaxxers or anti gmo&#039;s blow my mind; with so many information available to anyone on their fucking phone, you&#039;d figure people would be less ignorant of things.","time":1491265759,"resto":119385257,"id":"rUIsZvU\/","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119384250,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)17:36:50","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/CPD\/","com":"FOR YOUR LISTENING PLEASURE<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;CPD Dispatch Stream: <\/span><br>http:\/\/www.broadcastify.com\/listen\/<wbr>feed\/763\/web<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Same feed with ambient music:<\/span><br>http:\/\/youarelistening.to\/chicago<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;For Ambiance: <\/span><br>https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/sithdemonic\/<wbr>sets\/newwaveretro<br><br>Zone-6 (isolated scanner of worst area)<br>http:\/\/www.broadcastify.com\/listen\/<wbr>feed\/13262<br><br>#### #### #### #### #### #### #### ####<br><br>BACK THE BLUE<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Get Behind the Vest donation drive: <\/span><br>http:\/\/www.getbehindthevest.org\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Chicago cops aren&#039;t even issued fucking armor by their shithole city. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;The Chicago Police Department Memorial Fund (ALSO GET SOME SWEET SWEET MERCH):<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.cpdmemorial.org\/<br><br>#### #### #### #### #### #### #### ####<br><br>CHICAGO&#039;S K\/D RATIO:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Shootings ScoreboardS:<\/span><br>http:\/\/heyjackass.com<br>http:\/\/crime.chicagotribune.com\/chi<wbr>cago\/shootings\/<br>http:\/\/crime.chicagotribune.com\/chi<wbr>cago\/homicides\/<br>http:\/\/homicides.suntimes.com\/<br><br>#### #### #### #### #### #### #### ####<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Chicago Racial Demographics:<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.radicalcartography.net\/i<wbr>ndex.html?chicagodots<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Chiraq Gangland Map:<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.wbez.org\/shows\/wbez-new<wbr>s\/in-chicago-gangs-abound-but-where<wbr>-are-they\/0d956c2e-171a-483a-8666-f<wbr>5228d98812d<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Police Codes:<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.bearcat1.com\/radioil.htm<wbr><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Chicago Police Dept.

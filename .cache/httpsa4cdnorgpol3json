Basically, I discovered conservatism and right-wing not so long ago, having grown up as a moderate liberal. I have changed a lot of my viewpoints now, but theres one problem: I just don&#039;t believe in god. My family wasn&#039;t very religious, and neither am I.<br>I&#039;d become religious it if only to become less liberal. I understand that Christianity is a pillar that holds the West together, I agree with its morals, and I don&#039;t really have problems with other people&#039;s beliefs. <br>But speaking for myself, I simply never believed, and frankly don&#039;t want to. I would feel like a total faker, a hypocrite and a black sheep among people going to a church or wearing a cross. Not to mention, I don&#039;t really have much faith in orthodox church, which is still recovering from having been banned from people for 70 years and is limited to Russia and a few other slav countries only. A lot of people think of religious people as nuts, too, especially young people.<br>So what should I do, really?

Le Pen runs this debate for the entire two hours - it&#039;s like watching Pence\/Kane again, only better. She gets in two very memorable jabs, one where she calls him out for fucking his teacher and another where she says &quot; a woman will lead France, either me or Mrs. Merkel.&quot; He stutters repeatedly and repeats dumb lines constantly and seems off topic, irritated, and generally full of shit. If you actually understand the policy topics you know that she dismantled him completely on each one. He frequently tries to wave his hands and jedi mind trick and she is ready for it and throws it back at him. This was the strongest debate performance I&#039;ve ever seen and one she needed. She even dangled a line about &quot;let&#039;s hope we don&#039;t find out you have a secret bank account in the Bahamas&quot; because she obviously knows about the big leak of his secret Caribbean bank account that&#039;s about to hit. She&#039;s running against an even stronger propaganda campaign than Trump was so she has to get everything right and get some luck to win and this debate is her getting everything right. If she does not win tonight and France is still holding elections after 5 years of Macron she&#039;ll win then. She absolutely exposed him as a pissant joke and schooled him on every single issue. He called her &quot;stupid&quot; repeatedly and made other derogatory remarks that would get him absolutely fucking shredded by US feminists. The French are watching and she changed a ton of minds today and redpilled a bunch of motherfuckers. Ignore all shills - I understand French politics, understand French, and understand what I saw with my own two eyes.

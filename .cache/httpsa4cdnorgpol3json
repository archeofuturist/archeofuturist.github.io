The numbers:<br><br>Le Pen - 25%<br>Melenchon - 21.7%<br>Macron - 21.0%<br>Fillon - 20.2%<br>Hamon - 5.2%<br><br>Shut up an trust me on that. I will be right. Le Pen historically always overperforms her polls unless there is another credible right wing candidate for her votes to go to. There isn&#039;t. I have used a variety of other methods to calculate the other numbers; to be very brief, always remember that Macron&#039;s base is FRAGILE (1\/3 of voters could change minds) and is attracted to Melenchon&#039;s base, where as Fillon has stalled because of Penelopegate, and there is no reason to vote for Hamon as Melenchon becomes the candidate for the Left. <br><br>2nd Round will be 51.43% for Le Pen and 48.51% for Melenchon. Polls after the first round will show roughly a 54\/46 race, favouring Melenchon. <br><br>The crucial moment will come when Fillon ENDORSES Le Pen (or several prominent members of his party). Why would he\/they do that, you ask? Because they support Le Pen AGAINST the commie Melenchon (he wants 100% tax on rich). ALSO, they will have a parliamentary majority, and want to get shit done. THEY CAN GET SHIT DONE WITH LE PEN, BUT NOT WITH MELENCHON. This is crucial to remember.<br><br>This will be the FINAL BLOW. Currently (((polls))) predict the abstention rates of Fillon supporters in a 2nd round Le Pen\/Melenchon to be approximately 50%. (i.e. 50% do not vote at all). Fillon\/his party&#039;s endorsement of Le Pen will reduce this rate to approximately 30%, which results in the 51.43% victory I described above. So, add all these factors in and Le Pen will Make France Great Again. I&#039;m waiting, \/pol\/. Shortly, you will see that I was right.","filename":"presidentlepen","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492589938472,"time":1492589938,"md5":"df5FUFBiXd\/yCZVKj6QXiw==","fsize":110927,"resto":0,"id":"KxqN++CX","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"le-pen-will-win-guaranteed-i-explain-how","country_name":"Australia","replies":265,"images":59,"omitted_posts":260,"omitted_images":58,"tail_size":50},{"no":121838086,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:24:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121837741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121837741<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are no natural rights retard<\/span><br>not for insects, indeed<br>is why your kind so much yearns on socialism<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;coercition<\/span><br>*coercion, in English<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;won&#039;t coerce shit alone so you need a fucking state<\/span><br>weak.<br>also, a state just is a monopoly on coercion, like any other mafia<br>asking for such a thing only ever amounts to your own ass being coerced<br><br>anyway, vote for your commie shemale<br>I&#039;ll vote with my feet<br>I for one know who&#039;ll get out of it better","time":1492604687,"resto":121821130,"id":"z2Tkgo6d","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121838166,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:25:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121837558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121837558<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying I said otherwise<\/span>","time":1492604747,"resto":121821130,"id":"j91\/CEh5","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121838268,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:26:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"The only good thing that will happen if M\u00e9lenchon becomes president is that France will be so damn fucked that people will hate him and the far left too so the next election can really be the one where the far right win, especially if M\u00e9lenchon change the constitution for giving more power to smaller parties like he says he will<br><br>It&#039;s like Allende before Pinochet","filename":"svp","ext":".png","w":244,"h":315,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492604813845,"time":1492604813,"md5":"Zj2NI9Cj2Xz+2KzX9HwGhQ==","fsize":150044,"resto":121821130,"id":"g3z8xGQD","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121838452,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:29:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121837717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121837717<\/a><br>Nope I live near paris, surrounded by sandniggers.<br>I&#039;m in the perfect place to see EVERYTHING, I see the arabs, the poor french natives in villages, and the rich cucks in paris and bourgoise cities.<br><br>Where do you live again?","time":1492604946,"resto":121821130,"id":"j91\/CEh5","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121838461,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:29:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121837991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121837991<\/a><br>Your argument is based on the fact that Fillon and LR will be willing to fuck themselves, which I find hilarious.

I cant tell if you faggots make me want to go out into the world and preach to people about staying away from anime (staying clean!!) or if I want to Sandy Hook y&#039;alls shit to oblivion. Either way, it would be a huge debt to society. If I could go back in time and kill what ever dumbass created anime I fucking would! That shit has let to nothing but pain and misery for us normal outsiders and rampant autism for you horrible internet dwellers. You should find an alternative to anime, you&#039;d be amazed by how much better your life would be! instead of being locked up in your house, get your greasy ass out for a walk or some form of exercise! You&#039;ll feel much better once you do!!! I for one am in excellent shape and I feel amazing!

For Israeli leaders, the real threat from a nuclear-armed Iran is not the prospect of an insane Iranian leader launching an unprovoked Iranian nuclear attack on Israel that would lead to the annihilation of both countries. What Israeli military leaders really worry about -- but cannot talk about -- is losing their nuclear monopoly. An Iranian nuclear weapons capability would not only end that nuclear monopoly but could also prompt other adversaries, like Saudi Arabia and Egypt, to go nuclear as well. The result would be a precarious nuclear balance in which Israel could not respond to provocations with conventional military strikes on Syria and Lebanon, as it can today. If Iran were to reach the threshold of a nuclear weapons state, Tehran would find it much easier to call on its allies in Syria and Hezbollah to strike Israel, knowing that its nuclear weapons would serve as a deterrent to Israel responding against Iran itself.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Back to Syria. It is the strategic relationship between Iran and the regime of Bashar Assad in Syria that makes it possible for Iran to undermine Israel&#039;s security \u2014 not through a direct attack, which in the thirty years of hostility between Iran and Israel has never occurred, but through its proxies in Lebanon, like Hezbollah, that are sustained, armed and trained by Iran via Syria. The end of the Assad regime would end this dangerous alliance. Israel&#039;s leadership understands well why defeating Assad is now in its interests. Speaking on CNN&#039;s Amanpour show last week, Defense Minister Ehud Barak argued that &quot;the toppling down of Assad will be a major blow to the radical axis, major blow to Iran.... It&#039;s the only kind of outpost of the Iranian influence in the Arab world...and it will weaken dramatically both Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza.&quot;<\/span>","filename":"2017-04-11 00_49_54-WikiLeaks - Hillary Clinton Email Archive","ext":".png","w":707,"h":859,"tn_w":102,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491886540382,"time":1491886540,"md5":"gtHnwPVIIKbHNpw9yqriEQ==","fsize":63412,"resto":120519303,"id":"gu6FfXzn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120555965,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:57:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120522590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120522590<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;internet tough guys exist in 2017<\/span>","time":1491886660,"resto":120519303,"id":"nZPw5Yl2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120556065,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:58:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120522141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120522141<\/a><br>what are you doing here? go back.","time":1491886729,"resto":120519303,"id":"qoEe7Jed","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120555875,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:56:51","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Alright pol I&#039;m white as can be want to find a based waifu.","com":"Which state is the best for a white male to find a based waifu and make a shit ton of white kids to really MAGA.

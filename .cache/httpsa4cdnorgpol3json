I told her that kid is going to look like shit, and it&#039;s not worth it. She won&#039;t listen. She wants to have it.

Without these 2 factors, contraceptives would not be as profitable.<br>- Contraceptives promote the idea of casual sex by ensuring that the risk of having a baby is significantly lowered, as well as the risk of receiving STIs from sexual encounters.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 4) Sexual Intercourse is losing\/has lost it&#039;s meaning of procreation between 2 consenting human beings who truly love each other<\/span><br>- The more that porn &amp; casual sex is normalized, the less emotional sexual intercourse becomes","filename":"eJwNwtsNwyAMAMBdGADzMDLONoggkiqpEbhfVXZvT_c1n3mZzRyqY20A-7mqzN0ulVl6s12kX62Mc9kqNxTVUo-7vXVBII4JKWWXPId_B4EduehCTtEjI_sAHjMyRSZCjPY1unl-vhkieg","ext":".jpg","w":613,"h":614,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491242970078,"time":1491242970,"md5":"sYPnuLrTpkaIe3Y6P5+Pig==","fsize":29912,"resto":0,"id":"wdrCFYsE","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sexual-degeneracy-cont","country_name":"United States","replies":284,"images":66,"omitted_posts":279,"omitted_images":63,"tail_size":50},{"no":119377507,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)16:42:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119376662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119376662<\/a><br><br>the patriarchal society is excellent at providing some things but it sucks with women.<br><br>lets for the sake of argument argue that we put up the patriarchial society again. then what ?<br><br>to many women and men just dont fit into these roles and will sooner or later protest. what do you do with the square jawed women with high sex drive. or the low test men who just cant and wont do what is necessary to sustain such a society.<br><br>when the first femminists came along all that our grandfathers did was laught at them. i can tell you. they would not be laughing if they were alive now.<br><br>if we would to build up a new patriarchial society we owuld need to make sure to include an antidute TO ALL of the modern cysts that are infestinc this society. from filtering out of estrogen hormones out of the ground water to the managment of the development of the males from their early age.

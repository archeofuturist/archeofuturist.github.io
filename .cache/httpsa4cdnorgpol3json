In particular, \/pol\/, the &quot;Politically Incorrect&quot; board, has been a central figure in the outlandish 2016 US election season, as it has often been linked to the alt-right movement and its rhetoric of hate and racism. However, 4chan remains relatively unstudied by the scientific community: little is known about its user base, the content it generates, and how it affects other parts of the Web. In this paper, we start addressing this gap by analyzing \/pol\/ along several axes, using a dataset of over 8M posts we collected over two and a half months. First, we perform a general characterization, showing that \/pol\/ users are well distributed around the world and that 4chan&#039;s unique features encourage fresh discussions. We also analyze content, finding, for instance, that YouTube links and hate speech are predominant on \/pol\/. Overall, our analysis not only provides the first measurement study of \/pol\/, but also insight into online harassment and hate speech trends in social media.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/arxiv.org\/abs\/1610.03452<br>https:\/\/arxiv.org\/pdf\/1610.03452.pd<wbr>f","filename":"11906233_1661938980737600_1330127617_n","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490771465969,"time":1490771465,"md5":"OEuOpn+b3Pn08jwliM9QbQ==","fsize":37964,"resto":0,"id":"udLRojoq","country":"EE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"daily-reminder-that-there-is-a-uni-research-paper","country_name":"Estonia","replies":33,"images":9,"omitted_posts":28,"omitted_images":7},{"no":118762890,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)04:05:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m actually writing a dissertation right now that will in all likelihood mention &quot;Kekistan&quot; as part of a larger thesis on irony","time":1490774712,"resto":118759493,"id":"5Y\/rdla7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118762905,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)04:05:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118762671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118762671<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Redpilling the science professors<\/span>","filename":"what_year_is_it","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490774730062,"time":1490774730,"md5":"MKqXCzLT7ckIAYPgFBu3Ag==","fsize":60271,"resto":118759493,"id":"udLRojoq","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":118762925,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)04:05:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118762671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118762671<\/a><br><br>What the hell is going on...","filename":"SmartSelectImage_2017-03-29-04-05-20","ext":".png","w":684,"h":796,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490774753397,"time":1490774753,"md5":"CXxNqHpcsNK\/fpFLLu03Wg==","fsize":372761,"resto":118759493,"id":"zgdF34Cr","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118762999,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)04:07:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118759710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118759710<\/a><br>oh nigger niggers in my nigger&#039;s niggering niggers","time":1490774824,"resto":118759493,"id":"qG\/Kf8TG","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":118763396,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)04:13:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118762999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118762999<\/a><br>Nice trips.<br><br>I wonder how they interpreted our flag-based banter.","time":1490775180,"resto":118759493,"id":"i4Siv+SD","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118761575,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)03:44:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"When will the US government stop getting away with this shit?

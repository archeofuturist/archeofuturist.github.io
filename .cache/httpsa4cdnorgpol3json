FvD (\/ourguys\/) has won two seats and are now getting more media attention (both positive and negative). It&#039;s even starting to look like there might be an extra seat in it for them, calculations have shown. Meanwhile, we look forward to the upcoming forming of the coalition and we still have the Turkey situation, with Erdogan calling Turks the &#039;new Europeans&#039; who should all have at least 5 children, and calling us Dutch dogs and fascists. A word some huppelkutje named Anne Fleur also used when talking about FvD&#039;s frontman Thierry Baudet, in a prominent Dutch newspaper on Saturday. It&#039;s becoming clear FvD could still use our help (great example is SaneerMeneer&#039;s reaction video below), by refuting these lefties everywhere we can, and spread these refutals everywhere we can.

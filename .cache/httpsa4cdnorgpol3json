I stopped caring about them long before this nonsense happened, simply because I realized I couldn&#039;t rely on them to point me to good fiction. Sure, loads of people love Vernor Vinge, but he didn&#039;t do it for me. I couldn&#039;t finish the book, in fact. The weird thing is, I vastly prefer science fiction from before the mid 80&#039;s. I don&#039;t know why, it&#039;s just something I&#039;ve noticed. Could very well be that time still needs to select the good authors from recent times.<br><br>But I DO care that these awards get some sort of right to speak about what should and should not happen in a genre that I like. I DO care that they tar anyone who speaks out in favour of alternative viewpoints -even if I don&#039;t agree with them, such as the Puppies&#039; emphasis on &quot;fun&quot; fiction- as a literal Nazi white supremacist. All the good stuff we&#039;re already used to from commies.<br><br>And yes, I&#039;ve heard about the Lovecraft Awards. It also irks me, for one particular reason: They still accepted the award. That&#039;s the modern left in a nutshell: Entitled. There was a writer who didn&#039;t like the award because he thought the bust was insulting to Lovecraft himself, so he didn&#039;t accept it.<br><br>But these commie bastards want to have their cake and eat it, too. I don&#039;t even have a particular love for Lovecraft (Howard, though, is my homeboy) but I find that entitlement to be so goddamn insulting. Nobody is forcing these people to accept it. But no, they want the recognition AND to detail how it&#039;s delivered.

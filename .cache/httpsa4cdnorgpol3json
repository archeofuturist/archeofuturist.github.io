The sound of children&#039;s laughter has almost silenced in the west, Islam has the highest birthrate in the world.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isn&#039;t it mysogynistic?<\/span><br>No. 3 women convert to Islam for every male convert. Women realise feminism is a false gospel and only when you find your purpose in life you can be truely happy. Yes Islam commands modesty but so did the west for millenia.

The 4 wives you will have are a bonus.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isn&#039;t it anti-nationalistic?<\/span><br>No. Islam commands us to respect all races and cultures and only cut out the blasphemous and degenerate aspects. That&#039;s why Islam in Indonesia differs greatly from say SA Islam. Obviously like christianity the religion itself hass no boundaries by country but it very well respects nations within. Without Islamic birth rates your race and nation will soon go extinct.","filename":"4ec98fe0f739d52bb37740609a96688e01c59cca32d77484352c5aa14beaad91","ext":".png","w":1437,"h":909,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":158,"tim":1493115042471,"time":1493115042,"md5":"Kry9YCndXBZjVEox6seM+w==","fsize":89757,"resto":0,"id":"3iqdDX6B","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"islam-general-chemo-edition","country_name":"Germany","replies":35,"images":4,"omitted_posts":30,"omitted_images":3},{"no":122723950,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:25:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122718937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122718937<\/a><br>why do muslims mass-murder civilians so much?","time":1493119538,"resto":122718937,"id":"L6c8eWHp","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122723963,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:25:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122723791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122723791<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No shit<\/span><br>How is it there in saudiland?","time":1493119552,"resto":122718937,"id":"jYDXOC1x","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":122724050,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:27:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122723963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122723963<\/a><br>Too warm already. 40+\u00b0C","time":1493119637,"resto":122718937,"id":"fOO5WvIl","country":"SA","country_name":"Saudi Arabia"},{"no":122724139,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:28:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122724050\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122724050<\/a><br>Would like to worship Jesus with me?","time":1493119730,"resto":122718937,"id":"rlsDPxev","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122724148,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:28:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122718937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122718937<\/a><br>Fuck off you goat fucking piece of shit.

It&#039;s like having more trust in a man you know to be evil than in a dangerous wild animal.<br>The jew brings violent savages to our lands to destroy us, that is true. But at least the jew is not a violent savage himself.<br>Jews are not as bad as muslims, which is the reason why it&#039;s the jew using the muslim as a weapon and not the opposite.<br><br>And considering that most so-called white nationalist are not just merely pointing out the jewish shenanigans, but are actively making friends and admiring the barbarians used as tools by the jews is very concerning to me.<br>Kissing muslim ass because they hate jews too will get you nowhere. The enemy of your enemy is not your friend when he thinks you are a kuffar worthy of death.","time":1493119711,"resto":122720522,"id":"5gpjKgVR","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":122724137,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:28:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"What is that guy doing with the stick","time":1493119727,"resto":122720522,"id":"e7BIZNxf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122705588,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)02:54:52","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/Ecclesia\/-Christian Alliance General","com":"For Catholics, Coptics, Anglicans, Orthodox, and Protestants alike, we are all brothers and sisters in Christ.<br><br>Bible:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;KJV<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/versio<wbr>ns\/King-James-Version-KJV-Bible\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Septuagint<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.ecmarsh.com\/lxx\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Vulgata<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.drbo.org\/lvb\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Georgian<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.orthodoxy.ge\/tserili\/bib<wbr>lia_sruli\/sarchevi.php<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Savonic<\/span><br>http:\/\/pomog.org\/bible-church-slavo<wbr>nic\/","filename":"ZwmdQsU","ext":".png","w":678,"h":678,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493103292888,"time":1493103292,"md5":"UJJdNxqX59gD0jboisVNzQ==","fsize":236383,"resto":0,"id":"ItDC4Imt","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ecclesiachristian-alliance-general","country_name":"United States","replies":67,"images":23,"omitted_posts":62,"omitted_images":20},{"no":122723376,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:17:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122723163\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122723163<\/a><br>Catholics can be Christian","time":1493119039,"resto":122705588,"id":"4LpaBg9R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122723407,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:17:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122723269\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122723269<\/a><br>No, we&#039;ll just dump you with the spics.

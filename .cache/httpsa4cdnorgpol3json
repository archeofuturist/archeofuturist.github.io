The only reason this decline in birth-rates is currently an issue is because of the huge influx of non-whites skewing the total population percentages - There are still HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS of European whites.<br><br>Look at South Africa and Rhodesia during white rule (e.g. 1950s). Whites ruled these nations as MINORITIES. The percentage of whites in these countries even got as low as 10-20%, with the black population around 80-90%. This shows whites are capable of ruling at vastly smaller percentages than in the west today.<br><br>Finally, using the UK as an example we will see why whites still have everything to play for.<br><br>In 2011, the entire population of the UK was 63.3 M. If EVERY SINGLE non-white and EVEN every white non-British person were to be deported, there would still be 51.7 M white British living here.

This was when the British Empire was the largest and most powerful Empire in all of human history.

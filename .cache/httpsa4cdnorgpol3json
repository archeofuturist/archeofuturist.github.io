Many answers are easy to figure out with the right attitude. Almost every religion (with the exception of the bullshit ones like Scientology) has some truth, but no religion has all (or even most) truth. If you look at these religions the way a detective might look at differing accounts of the same incident, you&#039;ll start to see patterns, you&#039;ll start to be able to tell the difference between a truth and a lie. You&#039;ll also want to be familiar with science, this will help you dismiss shitty ideas and figure out good ones. Read some philosophy, and even occultism if you&#039;re so inclined. Don&#039;t be afraid to challenge your own preconceived ideas, the process of learning the real truth means you will be throwing away your old ideas, and your new ones, a lot.

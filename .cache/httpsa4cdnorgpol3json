All the teens are Black or Hispanic. In the first three months of 2017, Washington DC has logged over 500 cases of missing teenagers. The DC police department is using social media to alert the public that they need help. Despite the fact DC&#039;s the nation&#039;s capital, the missing teens aren&#039;t receiving much airtime from the news.<\/span><br><br>Even the WaPo is reporting on it<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Black teens are reported missing \u2014 and far too few people notice<\/span><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/nQ3mX<br><br>We need to direct our energy towards this asap lads. Why for some niggers? Them being niggers actually helps our case A LOT.<br><br>We have the following:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kidnapping problem<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sex trafficking - child prostitution problem<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In ONE DAY 14 kids go missing<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In motherfucking DC of all please<\/span><br><br>And the liberals are going CRAZY over this not getting any exposure. Which is where we come in. And what exactly do we get out of this?<br>This is our chance to re-ignite pedogate. These libs and these niggers are angry. They want answers and attention. Even the WaPo!!! is calling for this incident to hit the mainstream. I say we do just that. Amplify this up with our infographs about the pedos in DC. <br><br>Send them to the mothers if we can identity who they are. They will be desperate for answers and will find comfort in the answers we provide. We have the capabilities to exploit this situation and manipulate their grievances into a huge advantage. There will never be a better time than now.<br><br>DC is total damage control right now. We need to somehow expose the mothers to the trafficking problem in DC and the people behind it (our politicians and other insiders). That won&#039;t be hard at all. Then amplify their anger with our meme machines. Give them a platform and snowball this into pedogate. The investigation has come a LONG way since it&#039;s beginnings. Our infographs are well refined and thorough. This shouldn&#039;t be too hard either.","filename":"1488590663654","ext":".jpg","w":593,"h":768,"tn_w":193,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490349626461,"time":1490349626,"md5":"3P5T4yqf2KAxPqxVnVpjtA==","fsize":171170,"resto":0,"id":"rel4XpGW","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"and-far-too-people-notice-edition","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":3},{"no":118066116,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)06:08:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118065622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118065622<\/a><br>We need pizzagate to break close to May 1, just as the &#039;muh Russia&#039; commies are mounting their final offensive and the economy slips into massive recession--which they will try to blame on Trump.<br><br>Pizzagate is our ace in the hole.

Voaters in that post seem to be convinced this information was put on the website PRIOR to the Podesta leaks. Other voaters also noted really weird hidden data\/ non-sensical posts with everything from number sets to weird occult ramblings and really alarming pornographic material. The website itself is an endless rabbit hole of weirdly coded webpages, videos, and occult ramblings. For convenience purposes and from observing that this phrase keeps popping up in this website, we will call these websites Laughing Horse Orifice Headquarters or LHOHQ as that what is repeatedly being used on the sites themselves.<br><br>Upon seeing that post, I decided to research LHOHQ and found something startling.<br><br>In 2007, an anon posted to the AboveTopSecret forums that found a piece of paper taped to a billboard when he was walking with his friends in Milwaukee: http:\/\/www.abovetopsecret.com\/forum<wbr>\/thread286926\/pg1<br><br>The piece of paper had a weird occult symbol and a cipher of letters.

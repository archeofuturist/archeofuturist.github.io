I am the weird guy that nobody wants to talk to because my interests include firearms, working on vehicles, outdoorsy stuff, not being a bitch and pursuing intellectual and spiritual wellbeing instead of material excess and shit.

That said, there&#039;s something all of you don&#039;t quite understand.<br><br>Every time you try to &quot;red pill&quot; a woman about rapefugees by pointing out the fact that they are, in fact, violent rapists, it falls on deaf ears. Why? Women don&#039;t care.<br><br>They don&#039;t care? Nope. This statement probably confuses even the most hardcore of redpilled misogynists, &quot;But women are always going on and on about rape and rape culture!&quot; That&#039;s just an extension of their rape fantasies. You&#039;re probably clued in on female masochism by now but few of you actually realize it seeps into politics. Women use the made-up concept of &quot;rape culture&quot; to talk about their #1 fantasy, rape. It&#039;s like if a guy who you know has a femdom fetish talks about the &quot;epidemic&quot; of women going around kicking guys in the balls and spitting on them. &quot;Yeah OK, Rick. That&#039;s nice, you weird perverted asshole.&quot;<br><br>However, it isn&#039;t subconscious desire to fuck Arab rapists that leads to women&#039;s apathy regarding rapefugees. It&#039;s a lot more subtle. Think about your reaction to hearing about a 12 year old boy who scored with a hot MILF teacher. It&#039;s probably not one of disgust. But you probably condemn male pedophiles all the time. Why? Your sexual fetish has left you in a state of moral ambivalence. Instead of judging with your mind, you judge with your dick. If you had low testosterone, you might view the situation differently.<br><br>Women know importing tens of thousands of inbred rapists is a bad idea on a logical level but seldom do women use logic when making decisions as I&#039;m sure you all know. On the surface they will condemn any rape, but in their heart they don&#039;t give a shit about the victim. They think about the rape and self-insert, to feel warm and cuddly for one quick moment at the thought of being ravaged by a hairy, villainous sultan. It feels good, feels feminine. Then they put down the newspaper.<br><br>And they think, &quot;It will never ACTUALLY happen to me.

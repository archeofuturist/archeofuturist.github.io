Noxious smells<br><br>Another smell-related fear reaction comes from humans smelling anything that is particularly noxious, especially in crowds. Fear and symptoms of illness like vomiting can zip through a crowd like wildfire when enhanced with disgusting chemical smells. A recent example of this came about five years ago when a meterorite smashed into an area in Peru, releasing noxious gas that smelled like sulfur. Thousands of people became physically ill, simply from smelling it \u2014 and then, as fear spread, people were getting ill just from seeing other people getting sick and smelling only a whiff of the gas. The military has long studied the fear-amplification effects of &quot;malodorants.&quot; Probably the fear-sweat pheromone has something to do with this, but it seems that smelling something awful in a crowd can induce fear on its own. The lesson? If you want to create a stampede of freaked-out people, set off a really awful stink bomb in your cafeteria.","time":1490333260,"resto":118038330,"id":"1eBnkYPx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118046723,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:28:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118046158\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118046158<\/a><br>Snitching to police or teachers will get the kid savagely beaten.<br><a href=\"#p118046195\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118046195<\/a><br>They&#039;re niggers not lions.

Infrasound<br><br>Infrasound, or sounds below 20hz, are difficult for humans to hear but can still cause physiological effects and can make windows, doors, and other objects vibrate creepily. Some researchers have blamed infrasounds for hauntings, claiming that people feel &quot;spooky&quot; when exposed to these low-frequency sounds. Still, there is no definitive evidence that infrasound reliably makes people scared, though there are many anecdotal reports (including in scientific journals). Composers have even used the sound in their music to evoke feelings of dread, and the military has studied it as a weapon. So if you want to scare somebody, consider leaving them in a room where your speakers are pumping out a sound file below 20hz. They may feel like they&#039;ve seen a ghost \u2014 or they might just notice weird vibrations.<br><br>watch a scary movie and dose their lockers with the sweat <br><br>2. Sweat<br><br>Smelling the sweat of a terrified person can cause you to become afraid as well. In experiments, researchers found that people inhaling fear-sweat from a nebulizer experienced elevated heart rates and activity in the amygdala and hypothalamus, parts of the brain associated with fear responses. Scientists believe people may be responding to pheromones in the sweat that communicate terror. These experiments were conducted by the military, you can imagine the potential applications for sweat-based crowd dispersal at your next Occupy Wall Street gathering. Just dust a crowd with fear pheromone, and let Scarecrow do the rest.","time":1490333350,"resto":118038330,"id":"1eBnkYPx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118023181,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)22:01:49","name":"Anonymous","sub":"FAMILY TREE THREAD","com":"POST YOUR FAMILY TREE<br><br>also, don&#039;t bully me pls","filename":"FAMILIJA1","ext":".png","w":1600,"h":956,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":149,"tim":1490320909496,"time":1490320909,"md5":"x5Sema49Rvj1XzWo\/0nPOw==","fsize":455593,"resto":0,"id":"j3tWE9JE","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"family-tree-thread","country_name":"Brazil","replies":194,"images":62,"omitted_posts":189,"omitted_images":60,"tail_size":50},{"no":118046059,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:22:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118045844\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118045844<\/a><br>That guy hasn&#039;t even posted his own, he&#039;s probably projecting","time":1490332926,"resto":118023181,"id":"jmKf7NNg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118046081,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:22:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118023181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118023181<\/a>","filename":"MuhLineage","ext":".png","w":1600,"h":960,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1490332938212,"time":1490332938,"md5":"Ug9FQp6S3ZfjwSdOkpiZSQ==","fsize":486937,"resto":118023181,"id":"ryESm3QL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118046118,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:22:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118045844\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118045844<\/a><br>Somewhat acceptable.

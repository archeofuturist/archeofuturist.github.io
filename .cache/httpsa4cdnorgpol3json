Pride is this glamorization of oversexuality, nudity, and sexual excess. The thing that I can see is that someone feeling included is considered the highest good. If someone feels excluded because he likes to get railroaded by 37 dicks, then thats a bad thing. So people make an effort to build up and protect marginalized sexualities. So what happens is that being excluded gets a special cachet, and so you end up with a bunch of stupid people in the oppression Olympics, jerking off about how hard it is to be lgbtqq+, to the point where gay men(who did a lot of the early activism\/had some of the highest stigma to overcome) are considered too privileged. I guess, getting to my point more concretely, I think that sexual identity politics have degenerated to a point that people revolve their identities around the struggle for the acceptance of everything, and the conversation is such that having reservations about polygamy or any other sexual behavior is tantamount to bigotry. It is a form of cultural relativism, the attitude that I see in the lgbt community. I resent not the gays, but the bizarre notions that the trend towards increasing sexual permissiveness means that it is both inevitable and a form of progress(since of course, progressives support things That progress, even if they don&#039;t know what they&#039;re progressing to). Of course, I&#039;m on a college campus, so these events feel much more in your face with flyers and protests and whatnot.","time":1491031373,"resto":119145484,"id":"sjZeRimW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119157944,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)03:23:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119148552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119148552<\/a><br>Then the second generation would be inbred.

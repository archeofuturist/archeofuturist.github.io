As a Christian minority in the Middle East this hits me where it hurts. <br><br>Bush toppled Saddam and created a power vacuum in Iraq which killed millions, with sectarian violence still raging to this day. Obama comes along and campaigns about how he was against the war in Iraq and toppling governments. However, he does the exact same thing to Libya. A once prosperous nation is literally sent into hell by forcibly removing the dictator. Anyone with a half brain would know this was bound to happen with military action against Gaddafi yet Obama did it anyway even after his &quot;I was against the war in Iraq&quot; campaign slogan. There was definitely malicious intent here. Obama also wanted to attack the Syrian government over the &quot;alleged&quot; chemical attacks but did not have the support of the American people.<br><br>Next comes along Trump. He states continuously that he was against the war in Iraq. He also goes further and states that the US cannot be sure of who they are arming in Syria, and that while Assad is a bad guy, he is necessary for stability in the region. This is music to my ears and all other Christian minorities in the Middle East. This might come as surprise but we LOVED Saddam, we LOVE Assad. There is a time and place and a very specific type of society where democracies work... they absolutely do not work in the Middle East. A heavy hand is needed to keep the peace in the Middle East. <br><br>Now this two faced piece of shit Trump says he has &quot;changed his attitude on Assad.&quot; Is this a fucking joke? He just pulled a bait and switch in front of our fucking eyes! What&#039;s worse is he now has the consent of the public to put American soldiers wherever he desires without the consent of the public for &quot;surprise attack&quot; reasons.

You&#039;re always going to have a certain number of people that are just a huge healthcare cost due to illness, etc. In the distant past, they just died, which sucks. In the more recent past, they were a burden on their family and could drag an entire wealthy family down into poverty. These days, we refuse to let them pay and so burden society with their care.<br><br>Under Obamacare, we get the money to cover them by upcharging the young and healthy. This covers the cost, but it fucks over young people economically. They are already getting fucked by student loans, housing prices, immigrant and outsourcing destroying opportunity, etc. At a certain point, you can only pile so much on the young before they just fail to launch, you get no money, and your society collapses.<br><br>A society that chooses to let those fucked by nature continue to be fucked will still function. A society that fucks it&#039;s young to make those fucked by nature a little more comfortable will collapse and die.<br><br>The other variable is the overall cost. Conceivably, if the costs were low enough we could bear it. But that means we need incentives and market forces to drive prices down. But Obamacare drives them up, because there no no competition or accountability, and everything is someone else&#039;s money. So it&#039;s a perfect storm of fucking the youth, and not even fucking them efficiently. We&#039;re screwed. If we can get rid of Obamacare, then a lot of people will suffer. But it won&#039;t also fuck over society&#039;s future.","filename":"1491372293806","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":278,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1491467861086,"time":1491467861,"md5":"fzJkZRUTJbwEzpVt4iY72A==","fsize":476373,"resto":119717356,"id":"5fnj1aEc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119723172,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:58:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119717356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119717356<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;an anime picture<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Leaf <\/span><br>Opinion discarded.

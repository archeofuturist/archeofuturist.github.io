He&#039;s wasting millions and millions of dollars in taxpayer money, and then has the nerve to continue slashing American benefits to pay for some dumb ass, misguided wall. His family has been a cancer on America, and the cancer is growing out of control. His family has no idea what public service is, and that is why they receive so much hate.

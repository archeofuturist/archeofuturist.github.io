And if you can&#039;t achieve these things in your real life, then you are not ready to be a political activist, either anonymously or in reality.

No, because there is simply no such thing as heirarchy of need. Parts are either needed or they aren&#039;t - the machine either works or it doesn&#039;t.

Why should janitors have shitty lives? Poverty is only necessary because the system allows few people to manipulate stupid people into giving them their money. Look at websites, for example.

Anti-theists like to try and disprove religion by using the phrase &#039;fairy tale&#039;, &#039;imaginary sky daddy&#039;, etc. I was guilty of this myself. This is wrong however. Why is the Bible different from a fairy tale? Because it is a historical document and therefore should be treated as one. When analysing the reliability of a historical document we can look at a few aspects of it. <br>1. How soon after the event was it written? In the case of many of the books in the new testament, they are written very soon after the death of Jesus. The epistles of Paul have been dated by some to have been written within a few years of Christs death for example. In the grand scheme of historical documents, this makes it an extraordinary piece. To put that into context, Suetonius wrote about Julius Caesar over 100 years after his death. Most of what we have written about Alexander the great was written many many years after he died. These are rightfully considered reliable documents. <br>2. Would the person who wrote it have reason to lie? Many people like to insist that the writers of the bible were simply lying in order to control people. This is easy to believe if you don&#039;t understand the context that the new testament was written in. Christians were widely persecuted and put to death at the time. If Peter and Paul were lying about what they wrote in the Bible, they would have simply said so before they were put through horrific executions. They did no such thing. This would be seen as a pretty good indication that the writers of these things were not lying in what they said.","time":1492214927,"resto":121095130,"id":"zT6Jd7l2","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121137145,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)20:09:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121134911\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121134911<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Having feminazi degenerate sluts on your facebook<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Letting them influence what could potentially save your soul<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not sending her these articles<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pope Francis calls abortion \u2018horrendous crime\u2019 and \u2018very grave sin\u2019<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/cruxnow.com\/vatican\/2016\/11<wbr>\/20\/pope-francis-calls-abortion-hor<wbr>rendous-crime-grave-sin\/<br><br>Catholic Church will never ordain women priests, says Pope Francis<br><br>http:\/\/www.catholicherald.co.uk\/new<wbr>s\/2016\/11\/01\/catholic-church-never-<wbr>likely-to-ordain-women-says-pope-fr<wbr>ancis\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Francis\u2019 statements affirming traditional-Biblical-natural marriage, as well as his extremely strong remarks back in Argentina, where he declared same-sex \u201cmarriage\u201d a diabolical effort of \u201cthe Father of Lies\u201d to \u201cdestroy God\u2019s plan \u2026 and deceive the children of God.\u201d<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.crisismagazine.com\/2015\/<wbr>pope-francis-prepares-shock-liberal<wbr>s-sex-marriage","filename":"Miro-pope-francis-shocked","ext":".jpg","w":472,"h":318,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":84,"tim":1492214982335,"time":1492214982,"md5":"z45MFioqPLeY21Ml3RPjow==","fsize":36516,"resto":121095130,"id":"DcPWmXke","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121137150,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)20:09:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121131317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121131317<\/a><br>So cancer is part of a loving God&#039;s will?

The Britons who settled in brittany are basically the celtic people of the British Isles who fled the Invasion of the Angles, Jutes and Saxons.","time":1493573361,"resto":123496616,"id":"0gWuVRBq","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":123500853,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)13:29:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123500558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123500558<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mon cul oui, la couronne a essay\u00e9 de nous la mettre pendant des si\u00e8cles et on est toujours la<\/span><br>Tes anc\u00eatres oui, toi tout ce que t&#039;as fait pour le moment c&#039;est voter pour le PS, et l\u00e0-dessus on te l&#039;a mis profond comme jamais.<br><br>Maintenant tu vas voter pour Macron et achever au passage ta r\u00e9gion.

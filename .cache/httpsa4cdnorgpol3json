During that time, over 20 other nations have made marriage equality a reality, including the US, the UK (excluding Northern Ireland), and Canada. New Zealand, Australia\u2019s neighbor, legalized same-sex marriage in 2013. Elsewhere in the region, Taiwan is currently debating marriage equality, and could become the first place in Asia to legalize it.<br><br>For now, the prime minister is committed to the plan of holding a non-binding referendum over the issue, an idea that was floated by the Abbott government. It is a controversial and unpopular move. Critics argue it would be costly and divisive, and are calling instead for parliament to vote on the issue\u2014a study conducted last year found that the marriage equality referendum in Ireland had a \u201chighly detrimental\u201d effect on members of the LGBT community. Nor is there enough parliamentary support for Turnbull to pass a bill in order to hold a referendum, leaving the process all but dead in the water. Turnbull has said that if the plebiscite isn\u2019t held, marriage equality will likely be off the agenda until the next federal election\u2014due in 2019.<br><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/ZUZy7","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-12 at 2.08.15 AM","ext":".png","w":2062,"h":1252,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":151,"tim":1491977541350,"time":1491977541,"md5":"GLmkEDsqAiE+Y9VffnQi1A==","fsize":2587078,"resto":0,"id":"+eZnvUC8","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-wont-australia-vote-on-gay-marriage","country_name":"United States","replies":151,"images":23,"omitted_posts":146,"omitted_images":21,"tail_size":50},{"no":120735666,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:09:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120735543\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120735543<\/a><br>:3","time":1491988183,"resto":120722878,"id":"FAIO1J3j","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120735788,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)05:11:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120735618\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120735618<\/a><br>you don&#039;t have broad-based evidence and neither do I. gays fight mainly for not being treated as second class citizens and you have no argument that denying them marriage doesn&#039;t treat them as such.

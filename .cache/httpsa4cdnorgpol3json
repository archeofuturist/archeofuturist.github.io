Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian.

They also tend to make decisions based on emotion, rather than on rational thinking, way more than Asians.In the course of history there have been various cases where whites dealt with their problems in a way that was \u201cdecent\u201d instead of in the way that was the most effective.<br>Examples of this are:<br>\u2022 In Australia, they wanted to get rid of the aborigines. They could have easily exterminated them, instead they chose to separate abbo children from their people and let them breed with whites over and over until their genes were \u201cerased\u201d.<br>\u2022 In America, they abolished slavery and then instead of sending the slaves back to Africa or exterminating them, the simply freed them.<br>\u2022 Americans gave the Indians reservations, instead of just chasing them away or exterminating them.<br>\u2022 Hitler (arguably) let the English escape at Dunkirk. He also (allegedly) expelled the Jews first instead of just exterminating them from the beginning. <br>This \u201cempathy\u201d might have come from the fact that Europeans used to hunt using animals like wolfs\/dogs and developed agriculture (using animals) earlier than most other races. Therefore the tribes that were more empathetic towards their animals, kept them in better condition and would consequently have more food. So empathy became an instinct for Europeans.<br>I believe \u201cempathy\u201d is a fundamental flaw of the white race and will cause its ultimate demise.

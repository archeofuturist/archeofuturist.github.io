Yeah, that&#039;s three in a row. <br>There&#039;s a reason we&#039;re cucked and it&#039;s mainly because standing there with a strongly worded letter isn&#039;t much good against someone with a loaded gun, things aren&#039;t very equal. You don&#039;t have that problem though as you constantly remind people. Therefore the only logical conclusion is your population (or white America) is just as cucked, if not more so, than Sweden, Germany and Canada.

Welcome to Celt\/pol\/ <br><br>Discuss your culture, traditions and how filthy Anglo-Saxon scum ruined and sullied our lands and stripped us of our native languages and culture. <br><br>Wee bit of history about our peoples: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;From around 750 BC to 12 BC, the Celts were the most powerful people in central and northern Europe. There were many groups (tribes) of Celts, speaking a vaguely common language. The word Celt comes from the Greek word, Keltoi, which means barbarians and is properly pronounced as &quot;Kelt&quot;.<\/span><br><br>A misconception that (((Anglos))) will spam in this thread is that all Celts are just Anglos with a different accent; this couldn&#039;t be further from the truth as almost ALL Celts are ethnically homogeneous excluding mixing from other celtic nations e.g Scotland and Ireland in which admixture between the two is very prominent.<br><br>What nations are Celtic? Contrary to what the Anglo-Saxon savage has taught you, Celtic nations are not exclusive to the British Isles, in fact we are one of the most diverse group of peoples in Western Europe, ranging from Asturias all the way to Breizh. Underneath this text you will find the celtic countries listed to spare confusion.<br><br>- Asturias: Between the regions of Galicia and Cantabria in northern Spain.<br>- Breizh: In Brittany on France\u2019s northwest coast.<br>- Kernow: In the county of Cornwall on England\u2019s west coast.<br>- Galicia: On Spain\u2019s northwest coast.<br>- Eire: Ireland.<br>- Mannin: The Isle of Man.<br>- Alba: Scotland<br>- Cymru: Wales <br><br>Remember brothers, the anglo has raped our women and pillaged our cities and villages for millennia. Never forget the fallen of our peoples who were sent to die across the world because of a bunch of fugly anglo neckbearded generals who used Scots, Welsh and Irishmen alike as cannon-fodder for their brutal wars against other White European countries.","filename":"1424902586261","ext":".jpg","w":434,"h":567,"tn_w":191,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492084065862,"time":1492084065,"md5":"XNrtT\/Zl\/MtmnGECSTEchg==","fsize":43078,"resto":0,"id":"0JXeiQXy","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"celtpol-sons-of-europa-edition","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":299,"images":82,"omitted_posts":294,"omitted_images":80,"tail_size":50},{"no":120918393,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:58:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120918083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120918083<\/a><br>Are you Welsh yourself?<br><br>Would you accept a Lowland Scot or are we too Anglo&#039;d?","time":1492095520,"resto":120900861,"id":"52n4KiVY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120918410,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:58:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120918090\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120918090<\/a><br>They did bring many marvels such as the advanced sewerage system of Rome.

Bunch of fucking nerds with your dipshit teenage beefs probably started with a resentment of woman who won\u2019t speak to you and now you think you have become POI radicalized.<br>So how did it happen? How did you become a fucking nazi? A bunch of real Nazis whispered poison in your ears while becoming your only community, your only \u201cfriends\u201d. And they used multiple levels to make irony and bigotry and fascism more acceptable by drowning it in \u201coh we\u2019re just joking\u201d So you combine all this with capitalizing on isolated nerd dude resentment and even deeper isolation, BAM nazi.<br>You can talk to any former \u201cchan\u201d boy and they can tell you how it went from \u201cshotty shock humor\u201d to \u201cwhite supremacist recruitment\u201d. The \u201clol only normies care about hurting others attitude\u201d + the general nerd male resentment of these communities. Its prime fertile ground for actual Nazis to grow.

And pol, also being its own thing, emans it is rolled back into those communities amplifying your worst aspect then roll it back into pol.<br>So essentially you have an online pressure cooker to turn your typical teenage nerdy bullshit into honest to god fascism. The surrounding of hateful idedas, the detachment from the harm you do?

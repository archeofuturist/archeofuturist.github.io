It was widely used in press and political language to describe either direct competition (such as the White movement) or even internal fractions of the socialist movement, for example social democracy which was called social fascism. Also the Nazi movement in Germany was described as &quot;fascist&quot; until 1939, when the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact was signed, after which Nazi\u2013Soviet relations started to be presented positively in Soviet propaganda.<br>In 1944 British writer George Orwell commented that due to the widespread use in the European press, &quot;the word &#039;Fascism&#039; is almost entirely meaningless&quot; due to its non-specific use detached from its original political associations.[1]<br>After 1941 &quot;fascist&quot; was used in the Soviet Union to describe virtually any anti-Soviet activity or opinion. According to Marxism\u2013Leninism, fascism was the &quot;final phase of crisis of bourgeoisie&quot;, which &quot;in fascism sought refuge&quot; from &quot;inherent contradictions of capitalism&quot;. As result of this approach, it was almost every Western capitalist country that was &quot;fascist&quot;, with the Third Reich being just the &quot;most reactionary&quot; one.[2][3] As result, after 1941 &quot;fascist&quot; was used in Soviet Union to describe virtually any anti-Soviet activity: for example, the international investigation on Katyn massacre was described as &quot;fascist libel&quot;.,[4] the Warsaw Uprising as &quot;illegal and organised by fascists&quot;.[5] Communist S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa described trotskyism, titoism and imperialism as &quot;variants of fascism&quot;.[6]<br><br>http:\/\/www.ozy.com\/flashback\/anna-y<wbr>egorovas-red-sky\/32366<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the torture and taunts of being labeled a \u201cfascist bitch\u201d by her fellow Soviets hurt the most.<\/span>","time":1491454139,"resto":119693323,"id":"PyajJxaD","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119706589,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:49:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119697555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119697555<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Berl<wbr>in_Wall<\/span><br><br>The Berlin Wall was officially referred to as the &quot;Anti-Fascist Protective Wall&quot; (German: Antifaschistischer Schutzwall) by GDR authorities, implying that the NATO countries and West Germany in particular were considered equal to &quot;fascists&quot;[5] by GDR propaganda.","time":1491454188,"resto":119693323,"id":"PyajJxaD","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119707415,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:58:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119706178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119706178<\/a><br>Nice one.","time":1491454713,"resto":119693323,"id":"17uxIOMG","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119703159,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:13:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Memes aside, do Bashar Assad and his men conduct the same kind of torture typically found among Arab leaders?<br><br>I don&#039;t want the U.S. to meddle in another war...but dude&#039;s still an Arab.

Assad is probably not even linked to any torture, he has always been vocally against it, he had a western education. Most likely the men from his father&#039;s old guard are the ones doing the torture. Also torturing is mostly done for al Qaeda and Muslim Brotherhood terrotists. Leaked documents from the government have actually shown how the army suspected a branch of the government was torturing people, and asked them to stop, which makes us speculate its not some common practice within the army.","time":1491454129,"resto":119703159,"id":"FYi8QUx\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119706869,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:52:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119703159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119703159<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;suck at democracy.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;democracy is a universal value or always good<\/span>","time":1491454372,"resto":119703159,"id":"7O4qIdaU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119707051,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:54:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"democracy is shit anyway","time":1491454481,"resto":119703159,"id":"05lCLx8v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119707405,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:58:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119703159\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119703159<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they suck at democracy.<\/span><br><br>Democracy is bullshit, it&#039;s just a smokescreen to pacify people and make them believe they have a say in their nation&#039;s future.","time":1491454709,"resto":119703159,"id":"g3\/b2ZiS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119690351,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)22:11:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;his country didn&#039;t have vikings<\/span><br><br>Look at them and laugh!<br><br>Ahahahahahahahahah!","filename":"1464976805608","ext":".jpg","w":538,"h":482,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":223,"tim":1491444712270,"time":1491444712,"md5":"5EVjZMei0S6jV1YiopIzrQ==","fsize":66022,"resto":0,"id":"lL2WiSBI","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"his-country-didnt-have-vikings","country_name":"Sweden","replies":106,"images":31,"omitted_posts":101,"omitted_images":31,"tail_size":50},{"no":119706305,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:46:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119705773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119705773<\/a>","filename":"1480893666468","ext":".jpg","w":1451,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":41,"tim":1491453995995,"time":1491453995,"md5":"9EUTKhVCa3gu6w3Zs03Adw==","fsize":212158,"resto":119690351,"id":"EzTvfCfs","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119706492,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:48:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119706305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119706305<\/a><br>What a pathetic post.","time":1491454123,"resto":119690351,"id":"lL2WiSBI","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119706516,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:48:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119706305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119706305<\/a><br>really makes you think","time":1491454137,"resto":119690351,"id":"n273G7OP","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119706736,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:51:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119690351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119690351<\/a>","filename":"1491414031644m","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":767,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491454286937,"time":1491454286,"md5":"ZJ3RIfdXRybWJLR3cR6GEQ==","fsize":88677,"resto":119690351,"id":"Mj\/aVDo4","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119707402,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:58:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119706492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119706492<\/a><br>How is it pathetic?","time":1491454708,"resto":119690351,"id":"HPvRS0s8","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119698312,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)23:28:37","name":"Anonymous","sub":"CDC&#039;s Own Statistics Say Vaccines More Lethal Than The Disease For Infants","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;If people weren&#039;t getting vaccinated, those &quot;disease deaths&quot; would be higher. <\/span><br>PER INFECTION VS VACCINATION, NOT PER CAPITA, MORON.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;there is no way to know how many people would die from the diseases they were vaxed against if they weren&#039;t<\/span><br>Epidemiologists can calculate that to the 100,000 or by town or county.

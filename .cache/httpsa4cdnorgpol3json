Trouble is, it&#039;s unsustainable. Even strippers and whores are better off; at least they can save a bunch of dosh while they&#039;re young, and take action to separate their profession from their social lives. But a slut?

These people have never heard of adult animation in their lifes that wasn&#039;t stuff like Family Guy, it was completely alien to them. And they can&#039;t laugh at these shows because they consider these shows stupid. They want a show that isn&#039;t necessarily smart or funny or well-written, but that appears to be to appeal to their surface-level taste. Because these people live for that mindless self-validation. They don&#039;t actually understand what makes for good writing or good comedy, nor have they ever picked a book about physics. They want to pretend they do so and circlejerk themselves, that&#039;s what matters. Rick and Morty is just perfect for its demographic: these same college-age self-important Bernouts who &quot;fucking love science&quot;.

Nevermind the bean-headed, noodle-limbed unexpressive character design, or how the story is non-existent and only comes up when the writers beg you to feel something for these characters so devoid of substance, or how the entire show is a trendy forgettable scenario of the week memefest with just enough sci-fi references to trick kids into thinking they are smart for understanding them, or how the characters have somehow been reduced to even more obnoxious caricatures than before, none of these things matter.

You never figured out how to live in a society bigger than one or two squabbling families. Starting thousands of years ago, everyone else on this planet without exception did - they invented religion, the idea of law, and the ideas of property and respect for the value of human life. This enabled tribes to coalesce into bigger groups and become organized. The rest is history, or rather civilization. But your lot never did this, did they? Abstract thought and problem- solving have never been the black man&#039;s strengths, have they? Did they invent a long-lived and intellectually coherent religion? Nope. Did they ever build a city? Nope. Did they even invent bricks? Nope (the reason there&#039;s no Stonehenge in Africa is because it took more than 20 people to move the slabs of rock - clearly a non-starter in Africa, where assembling more than 20 niggers normally results in a war). Did they till the land? Nope. Did they domesticate an animal for their use? Nope. Did they invent a written language? Nope. Did they invent the wheel? Mainly, nope. Were they curious enough about what lay out across the sea to sail upon it? Nope. And blacks are the only &quot;humans&quot; on this planet of which all this is true. Eskimos are more technically advanced than blacks were, despite the handicap of having no raw materials to work with other than dead fish and snow. Indians managed to domesticate the elephant. Why couldn&#039;t niggers? So why do you fail everywhere even today? Let me offer you jigaboos a hypothesis.

An owner of a company is paid more because he may have risked more of his capital to start the business in which to hire you. He also makes more complex decisions in regards to expansion, investment, innovation, etc. A doctor may get paid by a hospital $100,000 while a nurse gets paid $40,000. The nurse cleans up shit and works 12 hour days. Why does the doctor stay nice and clean and make all that money? Perhaps because based upon the decisions the physician makes, he can guarantee the hospital will get back $150,000-$200,000 in Medicare reimbursement. So he returns the hospital $50,000-$100,000 extra a year on their investment for the physician&#039;s salary.","time":1491157465,"resto":119217922,"id":"f+ER2EaU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119228051,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)14:27:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119227335\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119227335<\/a><br>Lets say a new idea of a product rises from tax money spent on research.If people like and want that production will soon follow","time":1491157641,"resto":119217922,"id":"NB\/qkaP2","country":"CY","country_name":"Cyprus"},{"no":119228134,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)14:28:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119227595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119227595<\/a><br>Tax money spent on research","time":1491157693,"resto":119217922,"id":"NB\/qkaP2","country":"CY","country_name":"Cyprus"},{"no":119228217,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)14:29:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119228051\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119228051<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If people like and want that production will soon follow<\/span><br><br>How will you know who wants what?<br><br>You send out a form &quot;would you like a new iphone??&quot; <br><br>See what they say?","time":1491157746,"resto":119217922,"id":"2wiSW6gE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119227611,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)14:23:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"\/Pol\/ tell me the epic history of the ones who venerate Kek in the times of old.","filename":"choosed by kek","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":944,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":245,"tim":1491157425589,"time":1491157425,"md5":"vPZKrel4BwZLdXYaZDd6Ow==","fsize":85263,"resto":0,"id":"1P4UuNwZ","country":"MX","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-tell-me-the-epic-history-of-the-ones-who","country_name":"Mexico","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":119228219,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)14:29:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119227611\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119227611<\/a><br>Is that Bannon?","time":1491157746,"resto":119227611,"id":"RrEBftzv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119226313,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)14:12:39","name":"Anonymous","sub":"She&#039;s got a point you know.","com":"If they can block Merrick Garland for being appointed in the final year of a presidency, there is no reason why Gorsuch shouldn&#039;t be blocked.","filename":"uviiqqb045py","ext":".jpg","w":987,"h":767,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":194,"tim":1491156759503,"time":1491156759,"md5":"N39ZGvAKLsHlBtkNkHUmuQ==","fsize":82331,"resto":0,"id":"6098xWoX","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"shes-got-a-point-you-know","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":119228216,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)14:29:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1491157745,"resto":119226313,"id":"6098xWoX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

For all intensive purposes I think you are wrong. In an age where false morals are a diamond dozen, true virtues are a blessing in the skies. We often put our false morality on a petal stool like a bunch of pre-Madonnas, but you all seem to be taking something very valuable for granite. So I ask of you to mustard up all the strength you can because it is a doggy dog world out there. Although there is some merit to what you are saying it seems like you have a huge ship on your shoulder. In your argument you seem to throw everything in but the kids Nsync, and even though you are having a feel day with this I am here to bring you back into reality. I have a sick sense when it comes to these types of things. It is almost spooky, because I cannot turn a blonde eye to these glaring flaws in your rhetoric. I have zero taller ants when it comes to people spouting out hate in the name of moral righteousness. You just need to remember what comes around is all around, and when supply and command fails you will be the first to go. Make my words, when you get down to brass stacks it doesn&#039;t take rocket appliances to get two birds stoned at once. It&#039;s clear who makes the pants in this relationship, and sometimes you just have to swallow your prize and accept the facts. You might have to come to this conclusion through denial and error but I swear on my mother&#039;s mating name that when you put the petal to the medal you will pass with flying carpets like it\u2019s a peach of cake.","time":1490430198,"resto":118202407,"id":"A9PXyiH2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118203796,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:25:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118202407\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118202407<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;for all intensive purposes <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;intensive purposes<\/span>","filename":"1482575370444","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":411,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":107,"tim":1490430326887,"time":1490430326,"md5":"cheKhLyTgorMNsBOTuyNbQ==","fsize":29588,"resto":118202407,"id":"e8aWj8Ao","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118203799,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:25:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118202407\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118202407<\/a><br>It&#039;s &quot;for all intents and purposes&quot; you fucking retarded abo.","filename":"16602118_10158226862615029_4019524207262271485_o","ext":".jpg","w":1940,"h":1294,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490430328477,"time":1490430328,"md5":"KTM\/MoiCna7gS9gv2wXTwA==","fsize":215452,"resto":118202407,"id":"u7z2cngS","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118204005,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:28:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"We will send our best fuzzy wuzzy angels to help the war effort.","time":1490430513,"resto":118202407,"id":"TVppQLke","country":"PG","country_name":"Papua New Guinea"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118203910,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:27:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"So, now that pretty much everyone regards him as a useless joke, what&#039;s the rest of the western world going to do when he gets elected for a second term?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;blah blah blah there&#039;s no way, IMPEACHED, REPUBLICANS ARE DONE<\/span><br><br>you know that none of that shit is true, and you know deep down this ride is going all the fucking way.

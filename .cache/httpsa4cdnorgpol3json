These include the idea that rape induces ovulation, (copulation does stimulate the release of an egg in some species), that rapists have more virile sperm, and that rapists possess a special capacity to detect women who are ovulating. They do toss out a couple of conjectures they consider reasonable. The first is that rapists target women who are particularly fertile based on factors such as beauty and age. The second is that women unconsciously \u201cbroadcast cues about their ovulatory status that men are capable of registering and interpreting.\u201d These hypothetical unconscious cues could be physiological (e.g. body odor, subtle changes in skin tone) or behavioral. To their credit, however, the authors admit that there is little evidence to support their conjectures.<\/span>","filename":"Barbara-Palvin-by-Terry-Richardson-1-1","ext":".jpg","w":1050,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":119,"tim":1492881865701,"time":1492881865,"md5":"PedLup8NNxDxYxKff7zjYg==","fsize":89861,"resto":0,"id":"k\/BaP6Bz","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"women-are-twice-as-likely-to-conceive-as-a-result","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":30,"images":5,"omitted_posts":25,"omitted_images":5},{"no":122306714,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:09:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122306346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122306346<\/a><br>when i see those slutty cosplayers<br>all i can think about is how so convenient all this crap is for them<br>they aren&#039;t there for the character<br>it&#039;s just a display of their sexuality<br>they are there to attract beta providers and maybe an alpha to fuck in the bathroom later<br>why do betas fall for that and keep having those attention-whoring sluts in their conventions?<br>can&#039;t they see that this is a scam?","time":1492884577,"resto":122301278,"id":"2Sdk791b","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122306825,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:10:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122306346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122306346<\/a><br><br>Sometimes I wonder if this is all a simulation and the objective is to see which can triumph: men and women&#039;s caveman bullshit, or Man&#039;s logic, reason, evidence, philosophy and technology.<br><br>Seems like we oscillate between the two, each time rising higher from the ashes, but the next fall being that much harder.<br><br>Considering how nearly everything in life is based in sex, we would have to eliminate sexual selection entirely, both male and female, to really become permanently stable.","time":1492884629,"resto":122301278,"id":"OLlivNjU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122306884,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:11:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122306687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122306687<\/a><br>what the fuck are you even talking about?","time":1492884662,"resto":122301278,"id":"2Sdk791b","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122306969,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:11:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s not really hard to figure out.

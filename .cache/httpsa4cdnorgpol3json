Apparently it was the Hebrew word for the area now known as Europe. Obviously there was no &quot;Europe&quot; at that time but the term\/word for that region. So perhaps the term &quot;Ashkenazi&quot; refers to European Caucasian white people that converted or married into the J----- religion(Talmud) which is actually Babylonian Talmudism. The group today claiming to be J--- are actually Khazars that converted to the Babylonian Talmud in ~740AD. All 12 tribes of the TRUE Israelites were never known as j---. The 1 tribe of Judah is not the name of the entire 12 tribes or even the monotheistic religion practiced by those 12 tribes. The 10 northern tribes that were called Israel were taken by the Assyrians and never went back to the Promised Land. They went to the Caucuses Mountains and of course we know who comes from the Caucuses Mountains...white people. The more correct conclusion is that TRUE Israel did NOT have Khazar and Turkic DNA. And that Caucasian, European folks ARE true descendants of TRUE Israel, not these Khazar interlopers masquerading with their Babylonian Talmud,Kabbalah, Zohar.","time":1491689140,"resto":120175689,"id":"\/J9W0pId","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120190914,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:11:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120190142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120190142<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw we are the actual chosen people<\/span>","time":1491689504,"resto":120175689,"id":"TI\/qHkUI","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":120191346,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:15:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120190914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120190914<\/a><br>See<br><a href=\"#p120184177\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120184177<\/a><br><br>Read the essays and let your mind get fellated","time":1491689706,"resto":120175689,"id":"xOjpfW+V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120192382,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:23:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120184177\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120184177<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120191346\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120191346<\/a><br>saved. http:\/\/archive.is\/l4DeI","time":1491690200,"resto":120175689,"id":"TI\/qHkUI","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":120193191,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:29:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120184206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120184206<\/a><br>By definition the term &quot;semitic&quot; means a descendant of &quot;Shem&quot; Noahs&#039; son.

The claim by Khazars who claim to be j--s(in reality Babylon Talmud, Kabbalah ,Zohar) that they are descendants of Shem i.e. &quot;semitic&quot; is suspect.

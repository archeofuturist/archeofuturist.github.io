So, in which areas you think China can contribute to bring Syrian people back to their normal life after so many years of hardships?<br><br>President Assad: Actually, if you talk about what the terrorists have been doing the last six years, it\u2019s destroying everything regarding the infrastructure. In spite of that, the Syrian government is still effective, at least by providing the minimum needs for the Syrian people. But they\u2019ve been destroying everything in every sector with no exception. Adding to that, the Western embargo in Syria has prevented Syria from having even the basic needs for the livelihood of any citizen in Syria. So, in which sector? In every sector. I mean, China can be in every sector with no exception, because we have damage in every sector. But if we talk about now, before this comprehensive reconstruction starts, China now is being involved directly in building many projects, mainly industrial projects, in Syria, and we have many Chinese experts now working in Syria in different projects in order to set up those projects. But of course, when you have more stability, the most important thing is building the destroyed suburbs. This is the most important part of the reconstruction. The second one is the infrastructure; the sanitation system, the electricity, the oil fields, everything, with no exception. The third one: the industrial projects, which could belong to the private sector or the public sector in Syria.","time":1491732926,"resto":120261388,"id":"tvT+wH16","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120269479,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)06:46:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120266437\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120266437<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120266483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120266483<\/a><br>knock knock....","time":1491734787,"resto":120261388,"id":"XDObNGgY","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":120270464,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)06:58:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120269479\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120269479<\/a>","filename":"1490801692681","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":456,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1491735531052,"time":1491735531,"md5":"xGwnqgIWh6jhuI56CpBlPw==","fsize":54368,"resto":120261388,"id":"S5pTCJXL","country":"CN","country_name":"China"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120263324,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)05:24:22","name":"Anonymous","sub":"America&#039;s system doesn&#039;t make sense","com":"The electoral college doesn&#039;t make sense.

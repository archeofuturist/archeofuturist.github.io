Mass media dupe youths into thinking they&#039;re good rebels if they just become hedonists. The hippie movement was similar, and they achieved no real rebellious goals. All they did was exactly what (((they))) wanted them to. Drug use, casual sex and degenerate &quot;&quot;art&quot;&quot; were supposed to change the world, but guess what?

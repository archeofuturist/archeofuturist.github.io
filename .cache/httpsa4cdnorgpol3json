There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, but glory and honor and peace for every one who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek.

For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified. When Gentiles who have not the law do by nature what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness and their conflicting thoughts accuse or perhaps excuse them on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.&quot;<br>And of course, there is James chepter 2.<br>From this, we can see Jesus and the apostles put emphasis on not just believing, but acting on that belief, as james puts it, faith without works is &quot;dead&quot;<br>2\/?","time":1492384234,"resto":121428888,"id":"8HQXbN2v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121435422,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:13:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121433648\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121433648<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121434406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121434406<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121434908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121434908<\/a><br>This is why the church maintains that you need not just faith, but Grace, Faith and Works for salvation, for if you do not have works, then you have &quot;dead&quot; faith, and if you have dead faith, then how can you expect to get into the kingdom of heaven?","time":1492384436,"resto":121428888,"id":"8HQXbN2v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121435472,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:14:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121434406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121434406<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Christ makes clear that you need works with that faith<\/span><br>You do not need works but rather the works are the fruits of the faith.

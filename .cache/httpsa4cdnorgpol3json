They were talking about muh genderism and how getting blue for boys and pink for girls destroyed society somehow.<br><br>Their point wasn&#039;t so bad, they biological sex was a thing but had little to no impact on personality and how you should act in society. Pretty much saying gender is ok when you&#039;re talking about dicks and vaginas but completly arbitrary when you&#039;re talking about liking toy guns or wearing high heels.<br><br>But just after that, they started talking about transgenders and how a man can be born with the brain of a woman.<br><br>Wait what ? You just SAID there&#039;s no real difference beyong genitals and man or woman behaviors are LEARNED and arbitrary. So how can you be born with the &quot;wrong&quot; brain ? By your very definition, transgenders are the WORST genderists because they cling to the traditional gender separation, just picking the opposite one. Transgenders try to look the other gender, assuming there IS a traditionnal look, taste, way of doing things for a gender. If anything, anti-CIS should HATE transgenders because they are the one saying a &quot;woman&quot; should wear a dress, long hairs, make-up etc... and a &quot;man&quot; should have muscles, strong attitude and wear pants.<br><br>Why can&#039;t they see that ?

I&#039;ve had an inkling of a trace of that thought line, but it would have been a long time (if ever) before I could have come to that reasoning as concisely and logically as you did.<br><br>But I have to say, I still don&#039;t buy that entirely. I agree with the logic, and I especially agree with not exclusively looking at it in a purely economic form. But on a grander scale: if liberty is truly the best route for an individual society, and will allow that society to develope to the best of its potential, then what&#039;s preventing liberty from taking those immigrants and making them a valuable asset to society? I would argue that when cultures aren&#039;t forced to intermingle, and they&#039;re allowed to prosper in proximity to each other they would actually gain much from each other, barring gross fundamental differences like say slavery or something. But what&#039;s more important, at least in my eyes, is the concept of pre-post scarcity.<br><br>Whether they&#039;re in your country or not, they&#039;re on the same planet. For the time being, that&#039;s an inescapable fact. They eat food, drink water, consume energy and materials, reproduce and do it all over again. That affects the supply of those goods in our neck of the world eventually. If this is not the case, then do we not have a vested interest helping those societies become more advanced, and having more capability to reduce consumption and possibly contribute to our well being economically? That could be argued from a standpoint of resources and property rights I believe. And if that is the case, then how would isolationism help? Certainly denying individuals liberties of emigration, however much sense it may make to protecting our liberties, is not the best way to help spread the ideas of liberty? <br><br><br>Perhaps I&#039;m missing the finer point and isolationism isn&#039;t what you&#039;re preaching here.

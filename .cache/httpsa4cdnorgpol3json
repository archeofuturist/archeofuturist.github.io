I&#039;m fairly sure the first time it arrive people actually felt the need to believe it but now it is probably just shills shilling shills<br><br>3) Topic Dilution: on \/pol\/ in general (doubles as sliding): in general, wild gooze chases, on \/trumpgen\/, gossip, pitting groups against each other.<br><br>4) Information collection: seen only rarely in here, &quot;let&#039;s make a lions guard for Trump \/ lets make ANTICOM&quot; and &quot;what would you do if Trump is impeached \/ is killed&quot;. Also &quot;let&#039;s access this site \/ app \/ plugin for more info&quot;. Don&#039;t fall for it folks.<br><br>5) Anger Trolling: our bread and butter, just see any post with a Finland flag beside it. Actually, it is our main weapon too so it is all fair games in this matter. Just don&#039;t answer the trolls.<br><br>6) Happened on many boards on 4chan when the happening and GG broke out. I don&#039;t know about \/pol\/ but \/v\/ and \/sp\/, for instance, that&#039;s a given. We are not very susceptible, being an anonymous chan anyway but on reddit, oh boy, I wouldn&#039;t touch that mess with a 100 feet pole covered in insulate and fire retardant. Social media in general, ever worse. Honestly, a mod got recently fired (in the rwss debacle) for politicizing his enforcement of the rules so we are not immune to that either","filename":"redpillvsbluepill","ext":".png","w":707,"h":573,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":202,"tim":1490518508545,"time":1490518508,"md5":"7CDgX8bdmFAET8PhEO23aw==","fsize":32280,"resto":0,"id":"8kDqAjBv","country":"RO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-have-noticed-with-the-influx-of-normies-that-we","country_name":"Romania","replies":110,"images":52,"omitted_posts":105,"omitted_images":47,"tail_size":50},{"no":118353020,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)07:38:23","name":"Anonymous","filename":"jew hypocrite","ext":".png","w":800,"h":792,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":123,"tim":1490528303474,"time":1490528303,"md5":"wguE8IWveJJq6ud+1SuEGw==","fsize":650502,"resto":118340841,"id":"8kDqAjBv","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":118353058,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)07:38:48","name":"Anonymous","filename":"jewry is the mother of marxism","ext":".jpg","w":829,"h":1475,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490528328611,"time":1490528328,"md5":"yTpRHqxDowwCPYOLcwFW2g==","fsize":387482,"resto":118340841,"id":"8kDqAjBv","country":"RO","m_img":1,"country_name":"Romania"},{"no":118353087,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)07:39:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118352529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118352529<\/a><br>Gotta side with the kike here goys, I-I mean guys.

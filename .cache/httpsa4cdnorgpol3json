It splits the child&#039;s group loyalties, and isolates him. No one he grows up around looks like him, not even his parents. Familiarity is an important aspect of being comfortable.<br><br>2. It is often humiliating and one-sided. Your image shows perfectly how it usually works. Asian women go for white men and white women go for black men. Very few white men go for black women and the same is for white women and Asian men. This produces resentment among the black women, the Asian men, and the white men who are aware of it and have a healthy sense of racial preference for their own group. It probably exists to a small extent with white women as well, although there aren&#039;t really enough Asians in most of the country for it to be pronounced, and white women still know they&#039;re valued, especially by black men, for whom they are the holy grail. Black women want to feel valued by their men and asian men by their women. Asian women date outside of their race over 40% of the time and you need only go to Ling Anderson&#039;s youtube channel or \/r\/asianmssculinity to see what kind of psychological havoc is wrought by this. Ling turned gay because it was the only alternative he saw to killing himself over the shame of all of his female family members (in his estimation) favoring white men over people like him.<br>3. It rapidly changes the course of thousands of years of evolution in specific environments, resulting in a physiology that is potentially not particularly well adapted for anywhere. Europeans evolved blue eyes and white skin so they could avoid becoming snowblind when hunting, and absorb more vitamin D through the sun. Black people have dark brown skin because there&#039;s so much sunlight where they&#039;re from, a white person would get skin cancer if they lived like Africans did. On the flipside, Africans are at a high risk of getting rickets if they don&#039;t take vitamin D in low-sunlight areas. There is a chance(so I&#039;ve heard) that a mixed race kid can get shafted on immunities as well.","time":1493408663,"resto":123232847,"id":"73xx+BAu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123234389,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)15:34:18","name":"Anonymous","sub":"NatGlo the new NatSoc?","com":"\/pol\/<br><br>Is National Globalism the new National Socialism?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic very related<\/span>","filename":"National Globalism is the new National Socialism","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":217,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":217,"tim":1493408058937,"time":1493408058,"md5":"sn7NY+3Re\/dTGpUYW+KnRw==","fsize":9506,"resto":0,"id":"1vnO1ggm","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"natglo-the-new-natsoc","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1},{"no":123234498,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)15:35:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;unironically believing kike media<\/span>","time":1493408110,"resto":123234389,"id":"9EXIB2ed","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123234657,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)15:36:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123234498\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123234498<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anytime trump says something that I don&#039;t like means he didn&#039;t say it (even if he did)<\/span><br>Wew lad.","filename":"IMG_1911","ext":".jpg","w":360,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493408188449,"time":1493408188,"md5":"DaXMZvFcQZZUo+MZdGSPPA==","fsize":83760,"resto":123234389,"id":"w75jpIu7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123235194,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)15:40:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123234498\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123234498<\/a><br>if he didn&#039;t say it he would have corrected them on twitter by now<br><br>if trump is globalism now then i am on bored!","time":1493408457,"resto":123234389,"id":"1vnO1ggm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123235378,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)15:42:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123234389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123234389<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i don&#039;t understand politics, i just mindlessly worship goy emperor and call everyone who disagrees with his decisions shill, rather than having an actual argument<\/span>","time":1493408569,"resto":123234389,"id":"5B4uxXTm","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":123235539,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)15:44:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"yeah, and north korea claims to be democratic. what does this have to do with anything?","time":1493408663,"resto":123234389,"id":"qp4\/jC0r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123223090,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:04:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Are Russian pedos?<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/eCkBdziK5RM","filename":"Open_Kids_\u0432_\u0421\u041f\u0431_161221","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493402683172,"time":1493402683,"md5":"j1OcsqvwK33ZzXPRgx\/uXA==","fsize":120232,"resto":0,"id":"lgz44+Yb","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-russian-pedos","country_name":"United States","replies":62,"images":27,"omitted_posts":57,"omitted_images":27},{"no":123235130,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)15:40:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123234710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123234710<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;90% of my videos<\/span><br>I hope they&#039;re legal<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Emule<\/span><br>?<br><br><a href=\"#p123234814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123234814<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123235021\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123235021<\/a><br>Nudity is the other thing.

I am sorry to share it with you, but I really need to get it out of my head in the hope it stops bothering me so much because I don&#039;t want to see certain people in my life in such a bad light and maybe someone here can help. <br><br>As a bit of a background to how I came to these conclusions, you just need to know that I am currently majoring in mathematics and learning about quantum mechanics. As you probably know most forces in the universe can be assigned into two categories. At the most basic level, this becomes the positive and negative which can be restated in many ways, additive and subtractive, light and dark, hot and cold, expansion and contraction or most complexly creative and destructive. <br><br>The spiritual realm primarily focuses on separating creative and destructive forces with the ultimate metaphor annotated in the bible in the form of God and Satan, but Yin and Yang is another common metaphor used. If you look at these things not as necessarily objective reality, but as metaphors for the human condition each of those forces can be used to describe functions of the human condition.<br><br>I began thinking about how one can accurately recognize these forces in the human condition and how can one identify which part of the human condition is creative and which is destructive to strive towards creative rather than destructive endeavors. Is there any kind of mathematical proof that can back this up or is it all just a matter of personal opinion?<br><br>Enter my current study of Quantum Mechanics particularly as it pertains to Atomic and Electromagnetic Forces. As you are probably aware, the positive force of the atom is attributed to the subatomic particle, the proton, while negative force is attributed to the electron. In a simplified way at the quantum level, negative electron motion is associated with electron holes while positive extremes of electron motion are associated with magnetic poles.","filename":"Devil-In-Red-HUGE[1]","ext":".jpg","w":2100,"h":1608,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":191,"tim":1490168328080,"time":1490168328,"md5":"AnqZsVtCkj+\/87cFbGdrzA==","fsize":1930772,"resto":0,"id":"MRTiJngp","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mathematical-proof-for-the-patriarchy","country_name":"United States","replies":55,"images":6,"omitted_posts":50,"omitted_images":4},{"no":117746546,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)06:43:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"That is a troubling realization OP.

However even our early age computers demonstrate that it is not 2 farfetched that there may very well be a psychic system of mind control that has layers upon layers on hyperintellegent coding\/programming for our minds\/subtle energy fields.<br>I really believe that when the narrow minded buffoon truly believes that demons lead him back to his addiction(s) that he has been brainwashed by the psychic system into believing a religion (just as his many fathers before him) and has a manipulation upon his biochemistry that leads him to poor choice. I feel like even the most basic of human emotion(s) that separate us from animals are rooted within this psychic system. So to imagine which part of us is natural and which part of us is another degree of brainwashing is a frivilous endeavor. <br>It is not all 100% bad either. It has fabricated our very sense of sophistication and beauty which may have beneficial purpose. It has wired us to be beings of architectural appreciation and capabilities of comprehending math and sciences. It has a very grey area of how it damages and also enlightens with no real negotiable or understandable reasoning.

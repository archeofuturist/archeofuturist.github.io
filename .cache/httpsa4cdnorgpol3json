Anybody who says it does is a fucking retard. The election destroyed \/pol\/ and got it overrun with two brands of the alt kike shekel. In the earlier stages of the election we laughed at the term alt right when Hillary and the media were pearl clutching over the idea and decided to refer to all Trump supporters as members of the &quot;alt right&quot;. Everyone here thought it was a laughable and pathetic term. Eventually after around the time \/pol\/ made the disastrous decision to create a colony on rebbit things went to shit and we got \/r\/the_donald faggots who brought their entry tier right wing anti PC style of posting to the board. Non of them know what the fuck they&#039;re talking about most of the time and are completely unaware of how politics work and blindly support Trump, along with spur of the moment provocateurs like Milo, Lauren, Gavin, Mike Cernovitch etc. You have this side of the &quot;alt right&quot; that the &quot;alt right&quot; ironically termed the &quot;alt light&quot;. Meanwhile the supposed Alt right is made up of that retarded meme spouter Dick Spencer. Who claims to have &quot;created and coined the term Alt Right&quot; when in reality he created ALTERNATIVE RIGHT which was a generic white nationalist website that convinced nobody. Along with this guy you have the andrew anglin TRS kind of LARPing scumbags who created nothing but white nationalist reddit. A shitty forum, complete with banning, shilling, scamming, and lies. The whole charade is run by Jews and for profit retards who do nothing but steal memes from \/pol\/ and spout memes IRL and LARP like retards. ((())) is the only thing they&#039;re known for. The day 8pol exposed these guys was the day everyone saw the redflags. Or should&#039;ve seen them and those who stayed are retarded rebbit contrarians who wanted something not associated with rebbit and \/r\/The_Donald. The Alt kike is nothing but one big snowjob of an operation. Whether its controlled opposition or populated by retards scamming each other.","filename":"muh meme war","ext":".jpg","w":801,"h":572,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1493641746294,"time":1493641746,"md5":"DfXEYuecbK8UG+502hyY2A==","fsize":110326,"resto":123612722,"id":"tsWqcPd3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123604454,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)06:23:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"Stealthing, is it rape?","filename":"stealthing","ext":".jpg","w":1225,"h":863,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":176,"tim":1493634235029,"time":1493634235,"md5":"7mtMuWRyQfpJKTo7thGpLg==","fsize":151429,"resto":0,"id":"NnAxJK8E","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"stealthing-is-it-rape","country_name":"Australia","replies":87,"images":12,"omitted_posts":82,"omitted_images":12},{"no":123614544,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)08:25:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123613322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123613322<\/a><br>Man, the only point I&#039;m trying to make here is that this method of contraception is playing with fire.

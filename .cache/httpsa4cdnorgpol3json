Do you actually think whites are going to put up a real resistance? Or do you think the vast majority of people are going to be apologists for the other side?<br><br>There has never been a real ethnic conflict in America in modern times, or at least enough to shift demographics. The idea of a restored America is a delusion. I know it&#039;s nice to hang out in \/pol\/ and pretend that massive demographic shifts are going to happen in favor of whites, but it won&#039;t. I may have a shitty attitude about it but it&#039;s fucking true. I say salvage what we can and return to where we came from.<br><a href=\"#p121935242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121935242<\/a><br>Again, in an ideal world they would. But the fact of the matter is that their birth rates are below replacement level and dropping. Non-internal european immigration isn&#039;t going to stop. Sure, nationalists like LePen may win here or there but the current trends aren&#039;t going to stop. There are going to be people replacing the native Europeans no matter what, and it would be much better if it were white americans than arabs and sub saharan africans.","time":1492655341,"resto":121924978,"id":"LMPByk+a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121926017,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)20:52:48","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Balloon Boy was a HOAX by Main Stream media!","com":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/QWhUvm8SunY","filename":"150703151601-rewind-balloon-boy-heavy-metal-nws-orig-00000905-full-169","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492649568735,"time":1492649568,"md5":"wMv2PNZCkZAtlk\/LnfkQTg==","fsize":50711,"resto":0,"id":"sYa+sfGH","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"balloon-boy-was-a-hoax-by-main-stream-media","country_name":"United States","replies":25,"images":2,"omitted_posts":20,"omitted_images":2},{"no":121936804,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:16:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121926017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121926017<\/a><br>Okay, but why?","time":1492654600,"resto":121926017,"id":"5+2bBX\/M","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121937171,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:19:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121936804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121936804<\/a><br>true there is no reason fuck it","filename":"1492603290036","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492654792589,"time":1492654792,"md5":"vJ4w0oodEH+xWmxxFc5vlw==","fsize":517593,"resto":121926017,"id":"HeZ54MvS","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":121937277,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:20:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121935506\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121935506<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121934624\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121934624<\/a><br><br>A large cylinder tank measuring 4 feet and 9 inches tall holds 242 cubic feet of helium gas. <br><br>Video says balloon can hold 907.92 cubic feet.<br><br>Seems a little less than 4 tanks.","time":1492654838,"resto":121926017,"id":"B4c36Tpw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121937707,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:24:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121926017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121926017<\/a><br>dude i saw the video last night an i knew that id see a thread about it","time":1492655058,"resto":121926017,"id":"W9Ezfemv","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":121938286,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:29:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121937277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121937277<\/a><br>thanks for the info<br>now we can cross that one out","time":1492655340,"resto":121926017,"id":"HeZ54MvS","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121937083,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:19:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Well, damn...","filename":"FB_IMG_1492654711761","ext":".jpg","w":582,"h":536,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":230,"tim":1492654747132,"time":1492654747,"md5":"H57cX61cgXYYRwPNu4Qa0g==","fsize":59285,"resto":0,"id":"VPUQzQpG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"well-damn","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1},{"no":121937550,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:23:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"yeah that happens","time":1492654981,"resto":121937083,"id":"7WK1\/uud","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121937771,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:24:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"i dont get it","time":1492655085,"resto":121937083,"id":"1g+W5QFK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121938135,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:27:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121937083\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121937083<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;kafka trap<\/span><br>NOT","time":1492655272,"resto":121937083,"id":"1IBfraXT","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121938256,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:28:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;men<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;caring about their feelings<\/span><br>All this proves is that boys raised by feminism will never turn into men","time":1492655327,"resto":121937083,"id":"zV0WHdCi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121938285,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:29:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121937771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121937771<\/a><br>They cartoonist is showing unequivocally that their point is correct by drawing in an army of strawmen in the last panel that comically prove their point.","filename":"1490234000282","ext":".gif","w":330,"h":294,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":111,"tim":1492655340330,"time":1492655340,"md5":"2ocNTyoAmxbtDC0\/IYk0mA==","fsize":989428,"resto":121937083,"id":"ATTkDolH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121935512,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:05:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;moving from a mostly white state to a state full of violent niggers<\/span><br>That state is Illinois.

You folks don&#039;t seem to understand the difference between gender and sex. I&#039;ll break it down for you! Sex is your parts (usually incorrectly described in binaries). Gender is harder to explain. Like, you pop out of your mom&#039;s womb, doctor slaps your ass and says &quot;it&#039;s a boy\/girl!&quot; and if the doctor says you&#039;re a boy, and you agree then your gender is boy. If the doctor says you&#039;re a boy and you go &quot;nah, I feel more like a girl,&quot; your gender is girl.

Chemical Forces General Ochsner reported to German command in June 1942 that a chemical unit had taken part in the battle.[40] After the battle in mid-May 1942, roughly 3,000 Red Army soldiers and Soviet civilians not evacuated by sea were besieged in a series of caves and tunnels in the nearby Adzhimuskai quarry. After holding out for approximately three months, &quot;poison gas was released into the tunnels, killing all but a few score of the Soviet defenders.&quot;[41] Thousands of those killed around Adzhimushk were documented to have been killed by asphyxiation from gas.[40]","time":1491976715,"resto":120720405,"id":"DM6wNBZo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120697500,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)22:09:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Saw this on U of Calgary Campus","filename":"17918089_624809044389836_685363517_n","ext":".jpg","w":609,"h":960,"tn_w":158,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491962953478,"time":1491962953,"md5":"WewnUn3F1WwXknfQ6b68wQ==","fsize":62643,"resto":0,"id":"Yhdrb7vC","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"saw-this-on-u-of-calgary-campus","country_name":"Canada","replies":127,"images":36,"omitted_posts":122,"omitted_images":33,"tail_size":50},{"no":120721523,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:54:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120721217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120721217<\/a><br>well thats a blast from the past","time":1491976474,"resto":120697500,"id":"+Eik4OqZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120721658,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:56:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120721217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120721217<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;yfw no one will make a RIP Antifa Terrorists rock<\/span>","time":1491976589,"resto":120697500,"id":"7Nm2fpoL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120721675,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:56:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120697599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120697599<\/a>","filename":"IMG_2617","ext":".png","w":656,"h":621,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1491976596450,"time":1491976596,"md5":"Bg011ukTI1\/dMPy5gnarOA==","fsize":436037,"resto":120697500,"id":"7YT2Bv7w","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120721786,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:57:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120697500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120697500<\/a>","filename":"IMG_2614","ext":".jpg","w":717,"h":829,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491976679069,"time":1491976679,"md5":"s4eOKS\/JMcAvXyMaF7\/0Iw==","fsize":152996,"resto":120697500,"id":"7YT2Bv7w","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120721819,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:58:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120721518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120721518<\/a><br>Ye there is a few boulders they allow graffiti on, shitposting boulders really","time":1491976714,"resto":120697500,"id":"0cRDtWqh","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120716797,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:01:12","name":"Anonymous","sub":"redpilled movie suggestion","com":"Hey \/pol\/ here is an old Soviet movie you will like.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NEy<wbr>7fO3Svf0<br><br>Also one of the guys who plays main role looks like m00t.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic related<\/span>","filename":"3","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":350,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491973272366,"time":1491973272,"md5":"CmMIAa3Ekm48p8m962CqZA==","fsize":39850,"resto":0,"id":"O3OfO760","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpilled-movie-suggestion","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":3,"omitted_posts":5,"omitted_images":1},{"no":120719693,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:33:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120716797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120716797<\/a><br>seen it before, a soviet classic","time":1491975182,"resto":120716797,"id":"dvfITBM6","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":120721090,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:48:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120719693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120719693<\/a><br>cheers kiwi m8","time":1491976136,"resto":120716797,"id":"O3OfO760","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120721331,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:52:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120716797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120716797<\/a><br>Dredd 3d is pretty good<br>The only caveat are the digital blood spurts.","filename":"dreddintesifies","ext":".jpg","w":380,"h":380,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491976325976,"time":1491976325,"md5":"PD5UwMit+gLH4AlPM72yUw==","fsize":47295,"resto":120716797,"id":"Cjk4Osed","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120721808,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)01:58:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"The Eternal Jew.

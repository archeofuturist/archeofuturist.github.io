I was a young CIA officer, called by September 11 to serve, and found myself amid generals and sheikhs, writing for presidents\u2014the life I\u2019d dreamed of since childhood. Drained by 18-hour days and fitful sleep, my demons flooded the moments of peace. In the dark, I heard fighting beyond the wall, thought of friends killed and wounded, and remembered my secret. You feel explosions before you hear them, and there was a bomb at the center of my life that no one could see. I was transgender, and feared I would lose my family and friendships. It was before an Executive Order protected transgender employees, and I imagined myself ridiculed or fired if I admitted the truth. I had heard a story about what happened to one CIA officer who had taken that step:<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Once upon a time, an officer with decades of experience lost it; clearly the stress. One day he decided he was now a woman\u2014hilarious I know\u2014and wanted everyone to believe him. Management didn&#039;t know what to do with the transsexual. CIA had only just accepted gays; the officer left the Agency.&quot; When I was a child I knew that trans-people existed, but I knew I couldn\u2019t possibly be one of them. I was going to make history, not be some freak on television. My self-discipline and self-hatred marched in lock-step.

The Abrahamic God of Christianity ultimately affirms the mythos of Judaism with a few beliefs that tweak what once was. With God himself, he is divided into three different forms: God the Father -- the creator of the known universe labeled as Jehovah and the central figure of Judaism; God the Son -- Jesus Christ of Nazareth, the mortal avatar of God come to act as the Messiah and update humanity on what has changed; and God the Holy Spirit, the spiritual manifestation of God within humanity, the general notion of God&#039;s presence within you.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;God the Holy Spirit<\/span><br>This is an interesting case, given that this manifestation of God has a bio-psychological origin. Part of the brain is responsible for the sensation of the spirit within human beings, and it is both stronger and weaker depending on the individual, and often is not present in others. However, despite it not being present in all people, and having a different magnitude across individuals, this development in the brain is for the most part -- universal. It explains the existence of religion and drives toward spirituality across the globe, but it also shows it is easy to mold. God the Holy Spirit is a chemical illusion, much like love, and the sensation of his existence within you can be chalked up to an identical argument of: &quot;What makes this religion different?&quot;<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;God the Son<\/span><br>Jesus of Nazareth was pretty based and is arguably the best out of all the Abrahamic prophets. Even without belief in his god or his divinity, I hold a great amount of respect for who he was and what he stood for. From a historical standpoint, there is absolutely no debate whether or not Jesus existed, but the nature of his existence is what is debated. The sensationalized accounts of his abilities and sorcery can be chalked up to the time. Aside from anti-Jesus propaganda from the Jews and Romans, you have to factor in human capacity of illusions, superhuman feats, and exaggeration\/misunderstanding.<br><br>cont.","time":1490798620,"resto":118786431,"id":"tvimTKh2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118792407,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)10:44:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118792172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118792172<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;P1 makes no sense<\/span><br>what?<br>it&#039;s pretty straight forward<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it&#039;s possible that God exists<\/span><br>don&#039;t most atheists acknowledge that? are you a gnostic atheist?<br>if you&#039;re saying it&#039;s not possible that God exists to refute the first premise, the burden of proof would be on you in this case.","time":1490798649,"resto":118786431,"id":"IEwqgO\/q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118788019,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)09:56:06","name":"Anonymous","sub":"SHOTS FIRED CAPITOL HILL ON LOCKDOWN","com":"https:\/\/www.rt.com\/usa\/382692-capit<wbr>ol-hill-lockdown-gunshots\/","filename":"breaking","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":630,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":131,"tim":1490795766574,"time":1490795766,"md5":"35llP3S\/SlDmYNpdk88qtQ==","fsize":29608,"resto":0,"id":"mJIaFWLy","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"shots-fired-capitol-hill-on-lockdown","country_name":"United States","replies":93,"images":20,"omitted_posts":88,"omitted_images":20},{"no":118791730,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)10:37:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"Check digis for crazy sjw wearing a pussy hat","time":1490798228,"resto":118788019,"id":"llu5LfiS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118791753,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)10:37:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118788019\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118788019<\/a><br>way to over blow it.

And since JFK was, at that time, at loggerheads with Israel over its nuclear arms program, it is critical to recognize how JFK was lured to Dallas and who was in charge of the arrangements that actually facilitated his assassination. And while it is well known that the Dallas leg of JFK&#039;s Texas trip was sponsored by the Citizens Council (CC), the elite business group that ruled Dallas, the little-noticed evidence shows that two of the three key figures who dominated the CC were Jewish \u2014not &quot;WASPs,&quot; as the legend of Dallas would have it. These were the folks who really ran Dallas, not the conservatives affiliated with the John Birch Society, as the old myth suggests. In 1963, one of those Jewish power brokers was an outspokenly pro-Israel liquor wholesaler, Julius Schepps, who held the distribution rights in Dallas for the Bronfman family&#039;s Seagram&#039;s products (both of which are Jewish)<br><br>The means by which the Dallas elite gained control of JFK&#039;s Dallas trip agenda is interesting.

The<br>CC designated a &quot;host committee.&quot; The chairman was Dallas Jewish leader and public relations man, Sam Bloom, the CC&#039;s longtime executive director, and \u2014in retrospect \u2014one of the least known but most pivotal figures in world history.","time":1493590224,"resto":123532858,"id":"d2s77iuG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123535151,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)18:14:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123534695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123534695<\/a><br>The city of Dallas has, unbeknownst to most people (which I can attest to) an immensely powerful Jewish community, but, more importantly, the city (and Texas) had been a major center of fundraising and arms smuggling on behalf of the Zionist cause, going back to the 1940s. Even Jonathan Pollard, the American spy for Israel, said he was inspired to pro-Israel activism by stories he heard (while living in Texas) of gunrunning for the Israeli underground by Jews in Texas. In fact, the official published history of a major Zionist arms smuggling operation, the Sonneborn Institute, reports its agents smuggled aircraft parts out of Texas to Israel. This was happening when a then recently discharged Army Air Corps aircraft mechanic, Jack Ruby, was re-settling in Dallas in 1947, the year prior to Israel&#039;s birth, then Sonneborn&#039;s activities were at a zenith. Ruby bragged of having run arms to Israel and, in 1963, is now known to have part of an arms smuggling operation overseen by an Israeli intelligence officer.

Atheism is in decline worldwide, with the number of atheists falling from 4.5% of the world&#039;s population in 1970 to 2.0% in 2010 and projected to drop to 1.8% by 2020, <br><br>Real surveys and statistics say atheism is on the decline worldwide. Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning. It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian.

Yes, this is quite a common response amongst religious muslims Europe to terrorism. You see,Muslim&#039;s in the west have been purposely trying to distance themselves from mainstream society, creating separate enclaves for their community. Most refuse to integrate into western society since they fear that they might get corrupted by the unbelievers. These enclaves are like mini Arabias. And unemployed Muslim&#039;s who receive welfare, which is probably the majority of Swedish Muslim&#039;s, rarely ever be venture out of these enclaves. They&#039;ve literally created their own little societies. Their only contact with ethnic Swedes or Europeans is at a job or at the welfare office and these interactions only last for a few minutes. Also the Islamic religion teaches Muslim that non believers deserve whatever tragedy that befalls them since they refuse to convert to the one true religion. Muslim&#039;s also have a deep-seated inferiority complex against whites as Allah told them they were superior and better than the kuffirs, yet their countries are shitholes whilst Christian countries are flourishing. So most Muslim&#039;s don&#039;t develop any empathy or solidarity with their European hosts since they still see themselves as Muslim first and don&#039;t identify with swedes and many hate them for being successful . A Swedish Muslim probably sympathise more with Palestinian terrorists they&#039;ve never met than even their own Swedish neighbours. Muslim&#039;s are never going to integrate into European society unless they come from well off secular families. Europeans should have never allowed these enclaves to fester and grow into large suburbs .

support a sandnigger?&quot; and are way too simplistic to understand the big picture. So here&#039;s the basic gestalt about Assad:<br><br>- Only secular leader in the middle east (protect Christian minorities...)<br>- Is directly at war with ISIS<br>- Most of the rebels against him (if not all) are islamists<br>- Is against israel and keep them in check<br>- Never done anything against the west<br><br>Removing him would mean:<br><br>- Another chaos like in Iraq\/Lybia<br>- Islamists taking over<br>- More terrorists and more immigration<br>- Increased Israel and Saudi influence in the area<br>- More dead Americans for nothing<br><br>I memed for Trump during the presidential race and i don&#039;t regret it, better him than shillary. The situation is way too unclear for now to know if he truly betrayed us or if it was another 11D chess move, i still hope it&#039;s the latter. We need to calm the fuck down about this and to be more pragmatic. Reminder that we put principles over politicians and that the results are the only thing that truly matters.","filename":"can&#039;t mossad the

We&#039;re not, we&#039;re terrible brutal beings who climbed to the top of the animal kingdom through lying, rape, and murder. Every person is on this earth because their forefather raped, murdered or lied their way to procreation. So we&#039;re not evolving and we&#039;re not becoming better. We develop a capacity to socialize and be ruled freely instead of being ruled as slaves by agreeing to follow conventions of in-group vs out-group and having laws that were higher than our nature would have allowed. Islam can very easily take over the whole world because it both allows the shadow to emerge while having a strict rule set and in-group dynamic that isn&#039;t in the West.","time":1490196197,"resto":117762274,"id":"3UPekxde","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117772618,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:26:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117763661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117763661<\/a><br>You&#039;re trying to sound like an intellectual and it&#039;s fucking embarrassing.","time":1490196376,"resto":117762274,"id":"BwkmWMe\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117773327,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:29:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117762274\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117762274<\/a><br>i dreamed last night that i took acid and dmt.<br>Ive never taken acid and haven&#039;t smoked dmt in over 3 years.<br>anyway, your fine mate, don&#039;t be hard on your self about anything. <br>you know that the universe&#039;s natural state is balance, you only have to allow everything to be, and balance and harmony will result by its&#039; self.<br>i wish you the best.","filename":"CandleInTheDark_-SaeedBabaeizadeh","ext":".jpg","w":896,"h":580,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1490196570349,"time":1490196570,"md5":"oMx0q+XaKdDcPdcKl8aTmg==","fsize":10895,"resto":117762274,"id":"OXjRGEi9","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117746393,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)06:40:27","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/POLDER\/ GENERAL #007 Warning to the party cartel-editie","com":"CURRENT STATE<br>As said, we&#039;re past the elections, but the battle continues.

While they do matters they matter due to prevalence, the acts, that is, not because they happened to x specific person. The problem is the root. If you don&#039;t address it, and it strictly and alone, you will be busy hacking at the branches of degeneracy and not something that could actually kill it. MLK made great strides in this fashion.

We are programmed to hate that which we see as, and deplore as a possibility in one&#039;s self. It&#039;s the mechanism that controls morality.

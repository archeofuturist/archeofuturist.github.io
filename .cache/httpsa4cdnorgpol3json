Simulations DO NOT need to be smooth or to even have actual visuals in 3d space to begin with. We can have the results of simulations in simplified 2d images or even simply just data. Everything in computers is simply data. How we parse this data is what matters. As for proving whether WE live in a simulation, think about it. If we are (theoretically atm) able to create a simulation of a universe, it would also be logical that we are a simulation created by someone else. Sure there is a possibility that we are NOT in a simulation and we are able to simulate a universe. At this point, it becomes impossible to find out if we are in a simulation unless we somehow break the rules of the simulation while simultaneously are somehow still in the simulation.

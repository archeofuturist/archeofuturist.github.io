This is because if marriage were to fail, the outcome will almost always favor the woman overwhelmingly. Privatizing marriage would remove the tax deductions, which shouldn&#039;t be there in the first place. The couples would make their own contracts, and men would no longer have to worry about being treated unfairly.<br><br>Many disasters could have been prevented if marriage was privatized, the JUSTing Brendan Fraser being one of them. Marriage is a ceremony between two individuals, and should remain as such.","filename":"47325WideModern_Wedding_130916","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":413,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492174999151,"time":1492174999,"md5":"33q6eC5lq+qjA5cdhP1UrQ==","fsize":86975,"resto":0,"id":"HgBGOjFd","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"should-marriage-be-privatized","country_name":"Sweden","replies":4,"images":0},{"no":121057915,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:07:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121057558\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121057558<\/a><br>It&#039;s a religious ceremony between a man and woman, that&#039;s it.

In my experience, this is at least true insofar as they are more tolerable than blacks and browns of all variety. I grew up in a suburb of LA that has the highest demographic of 1st and 2nd generation East Asian-americans in the country, went to elementary\/highschool with a ton of Asians, and pursued STEM in college, so I&#039;ve had casual and friendly relationships with asians. Having been raised in multikulti Commiefornia I have even dated 2 asian girls and gotten to know their families over the course of those relationships. So my question arises not out of a state of ignorance, but of discomfort with the implications of my own observations. <br><br>So what&#039;s the deal, \/pol\/? What are Asians lacking? In my adult life when I am forced to hold casual conversations with Asians, they don&#039;t go anywhere. It almost seems like they&#039;re (relatively to other races) disinclined to novel\/creative\/independent thought. In my experience Asian-americans do not seem like balanced adults, they don&#039;t bring the same level of creative freeform thought-formation that makes interpersonal exchanged interesting and exciting, nor do they seem to experience life with the same sense of self respect and individualism that enables the better aspects of Western society.","filename":"1492160562687","ext":".jpg","w":610,"h":458,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492168449967,"time":1492168449,"md5":"WqkF8J9YPw6we\/YR\/8fWKA==","fsize":123975,"resto":0,"id":"aF5xdWni","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-is-the-deal-with-asians","country_name":"United States","replies":227,"images":30,"omitted_posts":222,"omitted_images":28,"tail_size":50},{"no":121058433,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)09:12:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121058347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121058347<\/a><br>you stupid idiot wrong sub.

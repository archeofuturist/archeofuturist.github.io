I&#039;m tall, actually moderately attractive, with a state job making ~145k a year in tech. I currently spend most of time free time reading, playing video games, working out, and cooking. Over the last 5 years or so I have slowly lost my desire for any kind of relationship with women. <br><br>I was not really a Chad, but I was one of the lucky few who was getting laid pretty steadily in high school, and on through college and my early adult life. I had my heart broken, and I broke some hearts. But the last 5 years I have really found the company of women in general to be less and less tolerable. Most of them want to talk about the same old boring shit. Whats on TV\/Movies\/Social Justice\/Whatever dumb hobby they&#039;re into. Given I live in a liberal infested shithole, it just seems like I can&#039;t find a single woman out there who brings any kind of excitement to the table anymore. Even the ones where politics is never brought up once. I don&#039;t drink often at all, not into the party scene. I despise degeneracy in general. I&#039;ve just gotten to the point where I&#039;m giving up hope on finding a decent companion, ya know? I can deal with it. Really, pussy is great and all, but it has seriously come to the point where I don&#039;t see it worth the effort of going through the motions of picking up women. Its like the same shit on repeat. Fuck it, I&#039;d rather just beat my meat in the shower every once in a while and call it even. <br><br>Given my growing apathy toward women in general, I&#039;ve come to question if this is strictly internal, or if the direction society is going is attributing to it. I didn&#039;t used to feel this way, but that was 5 years ago, before SJW, Cultural-marxism, and Socialism was mainstream. I see these &#039;anti-values&#039; reflected in the women I meet and it sickens me.<br><br>What does \/pol\/ think?

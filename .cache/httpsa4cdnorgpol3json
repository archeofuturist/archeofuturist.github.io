Similar to a Jewish service, but Jews aren&#039;t into gold plating all their furniture. So it&#039;s possible for Christianity to have this kind of spirituality.<br><br>Overall though, Judaism seems like a better spirituality, the a people who struggle against the infinite with G-d&#039;s help is a constant theme in Judaism.[1] Pretty much every holiday or Jewish story has this theme. This something I relate to much better then any other religion&#039;s message. Christianity seems to me more like &quot;belief is more important then anything&quot; and &quot;the physical world is not important, belief is for heavenly benefit&quot; ideas which are borderline blasphemy in Judaism, and besides that I can&#039;t really relate with. Judaism has Tikkun Olam, bringing paradise\/ending suffering on Earth, as a major tenant and religious objective and probably something more like Buddhism then Christianity or Islam in that regard.<br><br>[1]: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WcQ<wbr>ZpsCgEZ0 &lt;-- Hollywood song that captures the essence of Judaism perfectly","filename":"israpol","ext":".png","w":800,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491674663723,"time":1491674663,"md5":"JETqpZY6QwkfJ7zbDoJwlQ==","fsize":110509,"resto":120142512,"id":"q5cTAV4Y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120160971,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)14:05:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120142512\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120142512<\/a><br>why do you not accept Jesus Christ as the saviour?","time":1491674732,"resto":120142512,"id":"0D1wq04v","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":120161538,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)14:10:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120160296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120160296<\/a><br><br>How do we get them to see?","filename":"1478552762978","ext":".jpg","w":1933,"h":1334,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1491675016551,"time":1491675016,"md5":"yJ5quTvoTC\/btYkV5vGKOQ==","fsize":1010181,"resto":120142512,"id":"0fcl48Pz","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120161882,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)14:13:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120160460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120160460<\/a><br> the revisionist work known as the talmud is also the foundations of islam<br><br>scholars have made extensive comparative studies and have shown commonality between Islamic teachings with what is in the Talmud and concluded that the Prophet took a major portion of his teachings, if not all, from this literature. <br><br><br>it is striking to find how heavily Muhammad relied on his Jewish contacts for the passages and teachings he ultimately set forth as part of the divine revelation.<br><br> So much, indeed, was Muhammad indebted to the Jews that the Qur&#039;an has been described as a compendium of Talmudic Judaism. (Blair, The Sources of Islam, p. 55). <br><br>One finds many of the Old Testament stories of the prophets reproduced in the Qur&#039;an, sometimes in a precis form where the Qur&#039;anic record is a faithful, though often vague, summary of the original Biblical narrative (e.g. the story of Jonah in Surah 37.139-148). On other occasions the Qur&#039;anic narratives contain elements of Biblical truths confounded with folklore and fables extracted from the Talmud and in some cases (such as the story of Abraham and the idols which we shall presently consider) the sources are entirely Midrashic\/Haggadic and are accordingly purely fictitious.<br><br> This accounts for the seeming discrepancies between the stories of :he Bible and the Koranic version of the same narratives. However, in relating the Koranic version of the biblical story to the Haggadic source as indicated in our study, the discrepancies almost entirely disappear. For, astonishingly enough, the biblical narratives are reproduced in the Koran in true Haggadic cloak. (Katsh, Judaism in Islam, p. xvii).","time":1491675195,"resto":120142512,"id":"K63JW2Z9","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":120162026,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)14:14:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120154898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120154898<\/a><br>He is a homosexual.<br><br>So he is neither Jewish or Catholic.","time":1491675269,"resto":120142512,"id":"AEAhsRi\/","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120152583,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)12:52:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Notice how 99% of the anti-Trump posts trying to divide and conquer are from non-American flags, mostly Europe?<br><br>Notice how they quickly go from &quot;WWIII has started, he&#039;s a neocon&quot; to promoting leftism later in the comment chain?<br><br>Notice the Reddit terms like t_d and nu-pol?<br><br>Notice the pleas to not vote Republican because they created WWIII, and the sudden Bernie threads?<br><br>Hmmm.....","filename":"pol 4chan Reddit fake supporter mask","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":1109,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":216,"tim":1491670370519,"time":1491670370,"md5":"1yL5L3oSYOdelto3FUWq\/w==","fsize":381723,"resto":0,"id":"AIr3wigX","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"notice-how-99-of-the-antitrump-posts-trying-to","country_name":"Canada","replies":99,"images":20,"omitted_posts":94,"omitted_images":18},{"no":120161879,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)14:13:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120152583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120152583<\/a><br>Foreigners, especially Europeans, should be very wary of our aggression in the Middle East.

There is neither a reason to believe there is such a thing as being mentally some combination of male and female, as there is no definition for any combination of male and female mentality based on any objectively, imutably existent state of mind, much less is it measurable. Even if it were accepted that these exist, they are still not measurable and thus, people are not qualified to - and have no right to - neither decide what combination of male and female they are mentally, nor demand other people recognize and acknowledge their self-designation.

Many are disinfo. Gotta sift truth from lies. Two main points need to be addressed - is the earth curved? Is it spinning?<br><br>EARTH CURVATURE:<br>1) Inconsistencies with earth curvature: Guy takes a laser out 7 miles on a frozen lake and doesnt observe any significant shift in height of the observed light source - https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=bwC<wbr>Rej0BoA4<br>2) Chicago can be seen from lake michigan more than 30 miles out while earth curvature dictates that it should have been below observed horizon by more than 200 feet. Mainstream explanation of fata morgana mirages is totally skirting the issue and is essentially a cop-out explanation.<br>3) MOST damning for me: Bolivia salt flats is a 2500 sq mile of totally level land with less than 3 feet of altitude variation. When it is covered with a small layer of water, it acts as a perfect mirror. Night shots of the starry sky show perfectly symmetric images of the stars (even those that are low on the horizon).<br><br>EARTH SPINNING:<br>1) Aircraft gyros are pretty accurate devices that can detect system rotation regardless of the orientation of the system. They should ordinarily be able to detect earth rotation if placed on some latitude away from the equator. Guy does exactly that and fails to report earth rotation.

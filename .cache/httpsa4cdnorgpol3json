The most common place I saw them skulking around were the really tourist magnety places, for example their was a small militia of them camping the line right outside of the Duomo, cups, and whatever trinkets they could find in hand. The worst part about it, is while they&#039;re dumb as bread, so are other tourists who fall for their bullshit and throw money at them like some kind of sideshow. It makes me sick to my stomach. I also found it sort of hilarious that when you tell them to fuck off, they get mad at ME like i&#039;m the greasy five foot tall leech shoving a cup in their face.

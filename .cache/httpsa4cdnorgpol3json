But this sort of thing happens all the time west of the Mississippi river. Agencies like the EPA and Bureau of Land Management have nearly unlimited power to do whatever they feel like doing. Friendly federal judges nearly always rule in the government&#039;s favor, so you end up with some old codger getting ten years and a $10,000 fine for &quot;destroying a wetland&quot; when he filled in a duck pond that he put there himself twenty years earlier. Or another person is fined and jailed for collecting rainwater. Or the BLM uses anti terrorism laws to basically seize someones property when they light a controlled burn to counter a forest fire that started on federal land adjacent to their property. And it&#039;s totally a coincidence that a geological survey showed a high likelihood of uranium deposits under their land, and that if their land were federal property, mining companies could extract it for a pittance rather than paying the owners fair market value.

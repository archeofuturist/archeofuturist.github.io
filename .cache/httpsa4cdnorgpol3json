For some of us, his promises weren&#039;t enough, but face it, if those people were promised what they wanted by Trump, he wouldn&#039;t have made it to presidency. There&#039;s a law of acceleration, where you can only go so fast in a direction without falling apart. Momentum is swinging leftward, and what Trump did is spin that around.

No. <br><br>Normies, in this moment, are not going to be cool with &quot;unpopular&quot; casual racism (even though it&#039;s being built up against white people; your point of view is not the fucking point).

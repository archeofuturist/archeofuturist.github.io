Example: I go a week of eating healthy\/lifting. I gradually get stressed out about this throughout the week. On my weekend I allow myself the &quot;reward&quot; of gorging myself on pizza donuts and ice cream. Afterwards instead of feeling happier\/less stressed I actually feel let down and depressed.<br><br>If my goals are things like: go to college, get fit, effectively use my time, create art, then why are my dopaminergic reward systems not tied to those goals, and are instead associating that behavior with stress or anxiety? I TRULY want those things. I truly want to be that person. So why are my emotions not tied into those things the way you would expect? Does my brain require more time to rewire itself? I don&#039;t understand why my brain is associating the things I actually want in life with negativity. Does part of me not believe I can actually DO it, and therefore has a sort of phobia associated with positive behavior?","filename":"jordan peterson","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":168,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493872604317,"time":1493872604,"md5":"I0iS+q+p8+t5U9PxFNovnQ==","fsize":6353,"resto":0,"id":"yqWJZabi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-last-few-weeks-since-i-started-watching","country_name":"United States","replies":50,"images":5,"omitted_posts":45,"omitted_images":5},{"no":124024111,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:24:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124023564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124023564<\/a><br>jews (and indian upper castes for less time) have been carefully selective breeding their children for 4000 years.<br><br>it&#039;s only random for most people, for a select few of truly upper echelon elite they are born with naturally high aptitudes. in the past it was size and physical strength, over the last 300 years focus has shifted towards intelligence and social fitness.<br><br><a href=\"#p124023257\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124023257<\/a><br>you can do whatever you want mate, why do you need me to guide you? are all burgers natural born followers, im not a kike trying to manipulate you into doing something for me.<br><br>just the bearer of bad news, in your case. the vast proportion of human beings are muddied mongrels with no clear picture of their past. it&#039;s funny how when they did those tv shows about genealogy how every celebrity could trace back 400-500 years, incredible coincidence I guess.","time":1493875443,"resto":124019134,"id":"clsdX1A+","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":124024311,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:25:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124023803\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124023803<\/a><br>I hope you die slowly and painfully.","time":1493875559,"resto":124019134,"id":"tCXQGRXG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124024419,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:26:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124024311\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124024311<\/a><br>i hope you can lose that weight","time":1493875616,"resto":124019134,"id":"J45\/G977","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124024533,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:28:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124024419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124024419<\/a><br>I&#039;m not fat.","time":1493875684,"resto":124019134,"id":"tCXQGRXG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124024648,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:29:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124024533\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124024533<\/a><br>i didnt say you were","time":1493875759,"resto":124019134,"id":"J45\/G977","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124006986,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:49:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"BAKE THE FUCKING CAKE BIGOT","filename":"IMG_20170503_224851","ext":".jpg","w":639,"h":526,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":205,"tim":1493866169322,"time":1493866169,"md5":"pe0NQBcAfZA5q51NebVTjg==","fsize":39163,"resto":0,"id":"VgoofDED","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bake-the-fucking-cake-bigot","country_name":"United States","replies":220,"images":48,"omitted_posts":215,"omitted_images":46,"tail_size":50},{"no":124024292,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:25:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124023714\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124023714<\/a><br>its cool i scrolled down too fast and only saw yours anyway","time":1493875549,"resto":124006986,"id":"f59XAoLd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124024431,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:27:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124011023\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124011023<\/a><br>I will pay you to do this.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Make money, anon $20 is $20.<\/span><br><br>Today on how i became a millionaire, &quot;yea i just recorded moslems refusing to bake a cake, started a gofundme and the rest, well the rest is history&quot;.","filename":"1493593714457","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":597,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493875622594,"time":1493875622,"md5":"b0QV6Ob42qmt10qK7sWdNg==","fsize":59661,"resto":124006986,"id":"HSS13Xpc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124024484,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:27:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124024040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124024040<\/a><br>Check the Rules of Acquisition first, uncle.

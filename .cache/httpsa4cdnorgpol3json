However, these were all achieved by and large by the use of latin. All major scientific works were written in latin and scientists conducted their work in latin. Latin is precise.<br><br>In english the sentence<br>&#039;what is asserted, without evidence or reason, can be rejected without evidence or reason&#039;<br><br>Written in english it seems to be complete. However it is incomplete ( try in german report results back). And as it is incomplete it does not stand up to scrutiny.<br><br>At first the statement might seem to need a noun to match the verb - ie.<br><br>that which is asserted to be TRUE without evidence or reason can be rejected as FALSE, without evidence or reason.<br><br>But even this does not stand up to truth testing. To truely make this a complete thought we need to clumsily add words to make a proofworthy statement that can stand the test of storms at sea.<br><br>let&#039;s try <br><br>&#039;that which is asserted to be true, without evidence or reason, in opposition to existing evidence or reason, can similarly be rejected as false without further evidence or reason required.<br><br>That&#039;s quite a mouthful. It&#039;s clumsy. The first sentence did well getting us 75% of the way we needed to go. However, the colloquial spoken nature of the language is such that more detailed accurate and complete thoughts must be shelved in favour shorthands and abbreviations. Such a communication cannot properly convey analysis and meaning in and of itself. It must be completed by the listener, the listener must complete the meaning.<br><br>I&#039;m not sure that german would have solved for the problem above, but i think something like finnish would have required more of the meaning to be in place in the sentence before it was handed over for parsing by the listener.","time":1492741109,"resto":122070326,"id":"COnBTj0z","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":122082097,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)22:25:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"And seeing how grammar and meaning kill threads, I&#039;ll shutup now.","time":1492741524,"resto":122070326,"id":"COnBTj0z","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":122082544,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)22:29:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122079988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122079988<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122080593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122080593<\/a><br>brutal","filename":"1423775268715","ext":".jpg","w":297,"h":364,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492741764061,"time":1492741764,"md5":"hTXWXXUvWyNxV5O+6TR8SA==","fsize":65509,"resto":122070326,"id":"rl0n4E2B","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122078553,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)21:50:57","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Why are whites the only race with diverse hair and eye color?","com":"Explain how whites are not the superior race","filename":"10_samix_rasprostranenix_steriotipov_o_raznix_nacionalnastyax-5","ext":".jpg","w":690,"h":414,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1492739457004,"time":1492739457,"md5":"Gx\/JafeX7BGHJrz1Y2hEZQ==","fsize":48421,"resto":0,"id":"CoiyuGXE","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-are-whites-the-only-race-with-diverse-hair","country_name":"United States","replies":48,"images":6,"omitted_posts":43,"omitted_images":6},{"no":122082400,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)22:28:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122082151\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122082151<\/a><br>What the fuck are you talking about?<br><br>How do you perfect DNA?

They were at least at intelligent as modern humans but lived in much smaller societies. They first left Africa ~250,000 y.a. and interbred with later homo sapiens who left Africa ~75,000 y.a. <br><br>All populations contain some Neandertal admixture EXCEPT for Sub-Saharan Africans. They contain no Neanderthal DNA and more &quot;archaic hominid&quot; aka homo heidelbergensis or homo erectus, our 2 basal ancestors. <br><br>To further confuse the situation, Australian Aboriginals are so distantly related to all living humans (and least related to Sub-Saharan Africans) that they are all but considered a separate species. Also, there is an extinct group of hominid species called homo denisovan that only interbred with Melanesian (Oceanic Islander) peoples. <br><br>So modern humans are actually 4 distinct sub-species of the genus homo: <br><br>1. Homo sapiens sapiens (modern Sub-Saharan African) <br>2. Homo sapiens eurasia (modern Eurasians. 3-4% Neanderthal admixture) <br>3. Modern Melanesian (3-5% Denisovan admixture)<br>4.

No attorney is listed for him in online court records. After Monday&#039;s shooting, the surviving gunshot victim walked into a hotel and collapsed. Court records say he told police that Townsend started shooting after an argument about rap and that &quot;everyone was dead.&quot; Townsend told investigators he heard shots before opening fire, but investigators found no evidence to support his claim.<\/span><br><br><br>oh lawdy","filename":"1490295863918","ext":".jpg","w":876,"h":493,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490329884283,"time":1490329884,"md5":"QTq+OlmrTryfb7+iASHBrw==","fsize":34618,"resto":0,"id":"+T4abHYS","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"naked-kansas-city-man-arrested-in-minivan-rap","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":2,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":118041891,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)00:42:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118040644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118040644<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;after a rap battle erupted inside a minivan.<\/span>","filename":"getin","ext":".jpg","w":365,"h":450,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490330563405,"time":1490330563,"md5":"1XG3ZmskSbskhRhxbSkqRA==","fsize":39354,"resto":118040644,"id":"hOWqaUo\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118044022,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)01:03:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118041891\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118041891<\/a><br>If this surprises you, look up the murder of Lil Snupe.

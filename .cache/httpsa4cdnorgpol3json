Just don&#039;t cry like a girl about it.<br> - If you&#039;re socially retarded put yourself in to an uncomfortable social situation at least once per day.<br> - It can be as simple as making small talk with someone in a shop, don&#039;t worry about spaghetti.<br> - If you&#039;re feeling down get in a cold shower for a minute or two, no need for washing.<br> - Drink alcohol no more than once a week and don&#039;t use it to get hammered.<br> - Stop smoking. Go to the doctor and get nicotine patches, or get a fedora vape.<br> - If you&#039;re stuck in a rutt, write about your mental health every day. Just don&#039;t let anyone find it, it&#039;s gay as fuck.","time":1491500645,"resto":119767769,"id":"s4rPYlqC","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119768389,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)13:44:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Big Soup.","filename":"024581","ext":".jpg","w":200,"h":300,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491500647988,"time":1491500647,"md5":"HOqim5ERQRRLZAdwtZa6Xw==","fsize":22774,"resto":119767769,"id":"A7ipbLOb","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}]}

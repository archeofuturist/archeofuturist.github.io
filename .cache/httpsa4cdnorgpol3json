What I have to say is true. I&#039;m not crazy. Please believe me. There is something wrong with our sun. NASA is cloaking our real sun. Why? Why do they need the sun simulator? It&#039;s real, and it&#039;s in orbit. It is approximately 100x300 ft. I believe it is because our real solar sun is rapidly using up it&#039;s hydrogen fuel. Hence becoming dimmer to the point that the masses will notice the brightness change. NASA to avoid a work wide panic, invented the simulator to mask the dimming.<br>If you really want to prove the sun is dimming\/depleting it&#039;s hydrogen, look at the moon. The light that reflects off the moon is the real solar sunlight. Notice how the moon isn&#039;t as bright as it used to be?<br>It&#039;s not the moon. It&#039;s the sun is dimmer. So the moon reflects less light output by the sun.<br>The research I&#039;ve done supports this theory. I&#039;m trying to get in touch with my NASA contact Orlo for clarification. I believe he is not allowed to speak of this, so he contacts me sporadically and very briefly.

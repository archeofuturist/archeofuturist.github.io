See, the key to the survival and continuation of art is innovation. Stagnation is the enemy and consumes motivation. Take painting for example. Through old world painting standards, the &quot;goal&quot; was to become more and more realistic. Unfortunately, that isn&#039;t a realistically perpetual goal. We successfully reached photorealism in painting. Photography was developed and destroyed illustration&#039;s place as the sole communication of the visual.<br><br>So where did we go from there? If we had stuck to the notions of photorealism, painting would have become an art of the past. Subject may change, but style remains the same. So, the impressionists emerged. Art began focusing on feeling and aesthetic variety. There was a massive outrage towards the impressionists because of this schism. And like the art before it, impressionism was eventually concluded in terms of innovation. There, modernism is born. A new angle to art that was necessary to keep it alive<br><br>I will absolutely agree that most modern art is garbage but I&#039;d be happy to explain why if anyone wants to hear it. spoiler: it isn&#039;t modernism&#039;s fault","filename":"bayeux garfield","ext":".png","w":978,"h":473,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":120,"tim":1490053145995,"time":1490053145,"md5":"lRo1q6NTXc0+SkCr3p2Wqw==","fsize":1143376,"resto":0,"id":"A0Jh7fEs","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"le-degeneracy-of-modern-art","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]}]}

IF Russia does anything, it should at very least be supported by majority of population. Otherwise this will greatly damage Putin&#039;s rating. <br><br>North Korea is a dictatorship that relies heavily on censorship. There is no goverment policy on NK and no censorship, people have a pretty good picture of what NK is. So, the idea of intervention to NK to protect it will not have even the slightest support among general population, meaning it will never ever happen.<br><br>On a side note, today Russia banned a UNSC resolution on NK, demanding it should include a call to &quot;diplomatic resolution&quot; of the conflict. Even though it was supported by China. I see no reason why we vetoed it. The only logical explanation is that China was really against it, but asked Russia to veto it in order to avoid damaging its reputation. It really makes no fucking sense otherwise.

By outlawing insurance we bring it back to free market capitalism dictating the price. There are those who are unfortunate enough to not be able to work though. For those non-interest bearing loan from the government to pay the hospital in my opinion would be the best case scenario. The loan can be paid back with very low minimum payments. The money used for these loans would never really have to grow per se. Sans of course population expansion. But the worst case scenario is that these loans would go unpaid. In my opinion however this would not necessarily be a bad thing. The money text from the u.s. population would go directly back to it. we would basically be using the US government as a capacitor for monetary funds directed towards Healthcare.

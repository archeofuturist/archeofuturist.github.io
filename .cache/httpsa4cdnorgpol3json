Another senate bill authored by the same pair of ambitious religious freedom fighters would allow people employed in any of Texas&#039;s 65 licensed occupations to refuse service to people if those folks violate their SHRB.<br><br>So, for example, private medical providers wouldn&#039;t really have to help trans patients if they assert that being transgender violates their SHRB; barbers wouldn&#039;t have to cut gay people&#039;s hair if they didn&#039;t feel like it; plumbers could let toilets overflow and electricians could keep people in the dark if they happened to religiously disagree with the customer&#039;s sexual orientation. And the bill would prohibit the state from disciplining them for any of this.<br><br>Other bills allow wedding-industry businesses, such as cake makers and florists, to refuse service to LGBT couples (HB 2876 by Rep. Scott Sanford), allow &quot;conscientious refusal&quot; of healthcare services of any kind based moral beliefs (HB 2878 by Sanford) and allow child welfare service providers to refuse to take in LGBT kids (SB 892\u2014also by Senator Perry).<br><br>None of these bills has made significant headway in the Lege, at least not yet. The so-called bathroom bill, SB 6, has passed in the Senate, but its future is far less certain in the house. A House substitute, HB 2899, is less restrictive than SB 6 and does not include provisions about requiring school districts and cities to enforce bathroom bills based on biological sex, but prohibits jurisdictions from passing trans-inclusive bathroom policies.

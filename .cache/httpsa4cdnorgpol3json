It was some indian\/paki\/muslim, he spoke with an accent and had a gay voice (you know that gay voice that some guys have). Anyway I look at the bus timetable, I tell him when the next bus is, then he says &quot;What time is it now?&quot; and gets out his phone and shows me the display. The phone says 22:23 and he says to me &quot;I can&#039;t read English&quot;. His phone display literally had the numbers 22:23 on it, in big bright letters. And I&#039;m like &quot;You&#039;re joking, right?&quot; and he goes &quot;No, I can&#039;t read English&quot;. At this point I was thinking to myself &quot;what the fuck, they use arabic numerals in every country in the world, it&#039;s nothing to do with English&quot;. So I ask him where he&#039;s from, and he says &quot;Okay, you can go&quot; and turns his back to me. So I continue on to Tesco and I hear him mutter under his breath something that sounds like &quot;stupid&quot;, so I turn back and ask what he said. And all of a sudden he had an oh shit expression, like he was worried I was gonna hit him. He just replied &quot;nothing&quot; and I walked away.<br><br>What the fuck just happened?

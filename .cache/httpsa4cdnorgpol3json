To qualify, the woman has to agree to be impregnated by sperm donate by the state, which will consist exclusively of the sperm of high-IQ, healthy, attractive Aryan males from the upper classes. Unmarried men continue to pay into the taxes that fund these subsidies. In addition, continue to clamp down on Islamic and Mexican immigration. There you go, demographic problem solved right now. No need to fight some long drawn out culture war to undo feminism or make traditional families look appealing again. It&#039;s efficient, women are happy, men are happy. As long as men are working and women are gestating, everything will be alright. The males don&#039;t really matter but allowing a white female to grow old without using her womb to create at least one white child is waste that cannot be tolerated. This also advances the white race faster as only optimal male genetics are passed. I really don&#039;t know why more people don&#039;t support hardcore eugenics.","filename":"1447523275388","ext":".gif","w":497,"h":360,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":90,"tim":1493944827697,"time":1493944827,"md5":"499RWtEulJRuInnODwv\/yA==","fsize":751986,"resto":124116540,"id":"ne5Ja81r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124138991,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)20:44:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Im portuguese im going.

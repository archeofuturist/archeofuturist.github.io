Daily reminder that sea levels around the world were about 400 feet lower just before the end of the last Ice Age.<br><br>Near the end of the last Ice Age about 12,800 years ago, a giant comet that had entered the Solar System from deep space thousands of years earlier, broke into multiple fragments. Some of these fragments struck Earth, causing a global cataclysm unseen since the extinction of the dinosaurs. At least eight of the fragments hit the North American ice cap, while further fragments hit the Northern European ice cap. The impacts, from comet fragments a mile wide approaching at more than 60,000 miles an hour, generated huge amounts of heat which instantly liquidised millions of square kilometres of ice, destabilising Earth&#039;s crust and causing the global flood that is remembered in myths all around the world.<br><br>A second series of impacts, equally devastasting, causing further cataclysmic flooding, occurred about 11,600 years ago, the exact date that Plato gives for the destruction and submergence of Atlantis.

The only thing truly impartial is the facts based on empirical evidence and observation. If you say &quot;do that\/we must do that\/it is better to do that\/etc&quot; no matter what follows you are spilling bullshit that comes from your upbringing and set of morals you got indoctrinated to believe. Not that there is anything wrong with it, but everyone has an opinion of his own and no opinion is right or wrong compared to another. Now basing yourself on empirical observation Humans are an animal species and living organisms, and the goal of any life form is to prosper and evolve. Basing myself on observation again given the cultural differences of different societies as well as physical ones those different groups are different subspecies and the fact they have had wars means they&#039;re in competition with one another to prosper more. Now judging from the science arts and other tangible fields as well as judging on military conquest and well being, life expectancy and such, europeans are by most criteria the subspecies that prospered and evolved the most as a group, therefore they have an edge of superiority to other subspecies. European society has entered a phase of entropy and logically will lose their edge to another subspecies, so putting your group of origin before others is a perfectly natural self preservation instinct, which is not the right or wrong thing to do, it is just the natural response to this given situation and it is how a normal functioning life form of this special group reacts in such case, it is the way it is. Being opposed to this instinct is a sign of genetic dead end because of the side effect of consciousness, originally a self preservation tool.","time":1493137437,"resto":122723623,"id":"HzrGDX48","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122751585,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:24:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122724130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122724130<\/a><br>WHAT<br>ABOUT<br>ISM","time":1493137494,"resto":122723623,"id":"RI2KD17P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122751972,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:28:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122724130\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122724130<\/a><br>\/thread","time":1493137708,"resto":122723623,"id":"LhZIEbrD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122752051,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:29:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122749765\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122749765<\/a><br>Its very much similar to patriotism vs nationalism. <br><br>I can love my country without advocating for fucking over others just as I can love my race without being a prick to other races.

Something big is definitely up for Sunday.<br><br>Finally though, the biggest sign that something isn&#039;t right is that earlier this week, I awoke to flashing lights and sound. Everyone shuffled out of the building, and I heard some people whispering something about an oven. Are they preparing to put us into gas chambers?<br><br>I&#039;m shaking and scared.

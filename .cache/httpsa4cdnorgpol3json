By acting as self-replicating &#039;von Neumann&#039; machines, these monoliths increase Jupiter&#039;s density until the planet achieves nuclear fusion, becoming a small star. In the novel, this obliterates the primitive life forms inhabiting the Jovian atmosphere, which the Monoliths&#039; controllers had deemed very unlikely to ever achieve intelligence unlike the aquatic life of Europa.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As Jupiter is about to transform, Bowman returns to Discovery to give HAL a last order to carry out.

However, in appreciation for HAL&#039;s help, Bowman has the aliens which control the monoliths remove HAL&#039;s artificial intelligence from Discovery&#039;s computer core and transform him into the same kind of life form as David Bowman, and become his companion.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=38E<wbr>Dhpxzn2g<br><br>Also, the original planet in the book 2001: A Space Odyssey was Saturn not Jupiter.

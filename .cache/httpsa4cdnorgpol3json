Anyway I basically started this happening by getting really into the ZOG conspiracy that you lot love to larp about. I got sucked in. I ended up believing that Adolf Hitler was the 2nd coming of Christ and that it only took this knowledge for someone else to willingly take on the mantle of the 3rd coming and save the world from the scheming evil kikes.<br><br>I believed that this was me.<br><br>Then the visual hallucinations started. I looked at the sun, it didn&#039;t hurt my eyes but it turned the whole sky blood red, and the sun turned black. Just like the NatSoc flag. I thought this was a sign from God to me that I should begin to rally my fellow whites to the cause.<br><br>Through my wandering around the town I live in I came across a British legion bar. I entered it feeling as though this was the place to start. Without hesitation I walked through the small crowd of people and climbed the small stage that was fixed to the back of the room.<br><br>I began to give a speech: &quot;Hello, can I have everyones undivided attention, there is an important message I have been sent to deliver...&quot;<br><br>As I was talking I noticed one of the people in the crowd hold his hands in a triangle shape in front of his face creating a blurry light. He was talking as well, saying: &quot;What is that? Its so hard to see!&quot;.<br><br>I ignored him, continuing with my speech: &quot;... Never let those in power let them put you down, you are of British blood, a proud race that has given so much to this world. Never let those who secretly hide behind the curtains of power destroy your culture that binds our nation together. Never forgive those who lead us into wars for foreign nations interests...&quot; - You get the idea.<br><br>Anyway, after this speech I walked through the small crowd, they were applauding me. After I left the building I turned to reenter, I felt I had to. But a man was blocking the entrance.

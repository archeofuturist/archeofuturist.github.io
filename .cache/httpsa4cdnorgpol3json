If this isn\u2019t scary enough news, even if your machine doesn\u2019t have SMT, ISM, or SBT provisioned, it is still vulnerable, just not over the network. For the moment. From what SemiAccurate gathers, there is literally no Intel box made in the last 9+ years that isn\u2019t at risk. This is somewhere between nightmarish and apocalyptic.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The problem is quite simple, the ME controls the network ports and has DMA access to the system. It can arbitrarily read and write to any memory or storage on the system, can bypass disk encryption once it is unlocked (and possibly if it has not, SemiAccurate hasn\u2019t been able to 100% verify this capability yet), read and write to the screen, and do all of this completely unlogged. Due to the network access abilities, it can also send whatever it finds out to wherever it wants, encrypted or not.<\/span>","filename":"4L_iDxnoiPC","ext":".png","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493706134363,"time":1493706134,"md5":"e2mg8ytSf6sFBlh3seZfEQ==","fsize":1960971,"resto":0,"id":"QUplhZRh","country":"IL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"intel-me","country_name":"Israel","replies":43,"images":7,"omitted_posts":38,"omitted_images":7},{"no":123746831,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)04:43:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123746717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123746717<\/a><br>why should I stress over something I have no control over?<br><br>Majority of computers in use right now use a post &#039;08 cpu.<br>That&#039;s millions if not billions of computers. <br>I&#039;ll let the professionals and leet hackers sort this one out","time":1493714605,"resto":123736854,"id":"JkDH6lHL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123746840,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)04:43:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123740840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123740840<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;currently shitposting on a decade old laptop<\/span>","time":1493714611,"resto":123736854,"id":"0c4mOppv","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":123746853,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)04:43:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"Small frys do not apply<br>big guys your time is neigh<br><br>It sucks that this is in our PCs no matter what we do, but a normal person with vanilla taste in porn and entertainment shouldn&#039;t worry.

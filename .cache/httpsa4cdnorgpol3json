You say the USSR was communist to brag about how people loved it, then say the USSR wasn&#039;t really communist to explain why it was actually piss poor on an individual level. You see, the countries that disbanded the USSR had no obligation to change policies, and just fucking look, the countries that remained with the commie nonsense, like Belarus stayed poor and took longer to develop while Russia allowing private enterprises and corporations went from being poorer than Brazil to wealthier in a single generation.","filename":"9c009709154d7ee39368024301d586c07ef9dd8c2e5bddba627c5e2ae2ba5274","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492292615462,"time":1492292615,"md5":"tQ9xhuf7nqt4fTquc\/usuQ==","fsize":216374,"resto":121250377,"id":"BdzZRjGK","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":121266224,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)17:44:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121264480\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121264480<\/a><br>Make sure to link to the raid threads here.","time":1492292649,"resto":121250377,"id":"11hFhrMb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121220625,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)11:27:16","name":"Anonymous","sub":"PERSIA WILL RISE ONCE AGAIN","com":"I&#039;ve always believed our rise to power, now it&#039;s time I believe world war 3 is coming, so persia must rise, all we need is a great leader like cyrus and we will make world a great place again.","filename":"persian guuurl","ext":".png","w":646,"h":646,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492270036731,"time":1492270036,"md5":"LxWXS\/r6FXvlwGmoQIdpMw==","fsize":774022,"resto":0,"id":"tmKh+rAf","country":"FI","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"persia-will-rise-once-again","country_name":"Finland","replies":229,"images":68,"omitted_posts":224,"omitted_images":67,"tail_size":50},{"no":121265156,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)17:35:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121264899\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121264899<\/a><br>Well I am a Byzantinum-boo so no","time":1492292151,"resto":121220625,"id":"Vt+HnLnx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121265453,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)17:38:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121264899\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121264899<\/a><br>the country has been called by many names like Iranzamin and many other, but all the meaning were same, the land of aryan people, iran is just a shameful name, that&#039;s why I just persia.","time":1492292284,"resto":121220625,"id":"tmKh+rAf","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121265470,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)17:38:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121222946\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121222946<\/a><br><br>The most notable thing you people did was conquer the whole world when it was basically de-militarized and then losing everything to an edgy Macedonian boy with daddy issues and a few ambitions.","time":1492292292,"resto":121220625,"id":"KwqVTftb","country":"EG","country_name":"Egypt"},{"no":121265870,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)17:41:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121265470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121265470<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The most notable thing<\/span><br>we did many things beside counquer, Cyrus himself called himself a liberator not a conquer, he banned slavery, while in ancient egypt...<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;losing everything<\/span><br>we lost everything when sassanids lost against the arabs and the country was ruled my mongols and turkic idiots","time":1492292476,"resto":121220625,"id":"tmKh+rAf","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121266222,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)17:44:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121264616\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121264616<\/a><br>Why for speaking the truth and btfo&#039;ing these western cocksuckers?<br><a href=\"#p121264670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121264670<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Rashidan caliphate Umayyad caliphate and Abbasid caliphate used Arabic as language of government and the court<\/span><br>And it will be once again inshallah.

The inscription also refers to the deity Ahura Mazda as &quot;the god of the Aryans&quot;, and to the ancient Persian language as &quot;Aryan&quot;.

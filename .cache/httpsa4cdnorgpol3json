Corporations are government fictions. They shield individuals by allowing them to have ownership without responsibility. The modern corporate law and tax structure is an example of regulatory capture, these regulations don&#039;t protect the consumer but artificially raise the barrier to entry (licensing, requirements, fees) to keep out disruptive competition and ease the cost of doing business at higher levels (tax strategies, litigation, IP). <br><br>2. A business which charges consumers extreme prices just for profit is a high time-preference (short term), economically unfavorable strategy. This is not to say that people always act rationally, but given that there is no such thing as a natural monopoly, artificially raising prices to attempt to create profit (1) bids the price above what the market can bear, REDUCING profits -- you may price hike 30% but now only 10% of your consumer base can still afford it; and (2) as other Anons have said, creates a niche for competitors to expand. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Why do free-marketeers speak about corporations as though they are people when they are not? <\/span><br><br>A privately held corporation is made up of individuals who own the corporation in the same way you own your body.

The individuals responsible for making corporate decisions are rarely held personally accountable for damages, debts, crimes -- attributing these things to the collective non-person.

Of course you also have to rely to other people for many things to be done, but ideally it should be a favour-for-favour thing, not a dependent relationship<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What should they know how to do? <\/span><br>Think for themselves, know where to go or what to do to learn how to solve a problem. Take charge when expected of them and they have the competence to take charge in the situation. Again, it&#039;s very important to have technical know-how, since minimal technical know-how in the current year means you have left at the mercy of other people a lot more, and they might screw you over or do things their way.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What should they have accomplished?<\/span><br>Should know what field you are best cut out for by the time you are 20-something and should ideally work out the path you must undertake. By the time you reach 30-something, you must already have achieved enough that you can start working your dream job or follow the career path that is your specialty. By the time you are between 40-60 you should reach the peak of your career and ideally strive to aim leadership positions at your field.","filename":"1490580314190","ext":".png","w":810,"h":744,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1493314487931,"time":1493314487,"md5":"cbrwzUkj6IXndS205XMYfQ==","fsize":1028654,"resto":123058513,"id":"b9eMfICO","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":123062402,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)13:44:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123061312\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123061312<\/a><br>Good post, but what specifically do you mean by technical skills and tinkering with things with your hands?","filename":"Alex Jones 2","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":320,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493315044531,"time":1493315044,"md5":"Py30GS6hTuKovPGSayVlmA==","fsize":29112,"resto":123058513,"id":"PvmCl1Sp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123051636,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)12:08:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"In order for gender to be a spectrum, we first have to accept that there is such a thing as being mentally male or female.

Even if it were accepted that these exist, they are still not measurable and thus, people are not qualified to - and have no right to - neither decide what combination of male and female they are mentally, nor demand other people recognize and acknowledge their self-designation.

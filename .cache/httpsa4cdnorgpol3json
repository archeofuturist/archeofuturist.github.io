You see, western society, including France, is a society based on trust. The government and services trust you, you trust other people. That they will not outright try to cheat or harm you. If you compare for example German or British tax offices and pension systems to say, Polish ones, you&#039;ll see clear differences. <br>We are an ex-communist country, for the decades during which we were still PRL the government agencies and sectors did not trust us. This control apparatus stayed with us after we finally moved away from communism. <br>This exceeds to overall mentality, a Pole will often assume another Pole tries to cheat him and nobody trusts the government or institutions.<br><br>The western trust-based system works in an opposite way, as they are formal but comparatively lax and non-intrusive. However if you DO cheat, they&#039;ll drop on you like a ton of bricks and it will take a lot of time for you to enjoy the extent of trust they blindly provided earlier.<br><br>Now, acting like &quot;you&#039;ll have to deal with terror attacks&quot; and integrating the shitskins and niggers who do not understand a trust-based society nor want to accomodate to it is ridiculous. This is France, not fucking Turkey or Liberia. This is the western world. It is not normal to just take a terror attack no matter how small in stride. It is not normal to pretend vast trust abuse by imported shitskins is okay. It is not okay. It is a threat to the basis of western society. And the west doesn&#039;t understand. USA doesn&#039;t understand how illegal spics can just go in and vote, thus abusing the trust your democratic system puts on people who live there. Germans assume they lost 20k immigrant children while those were simply reported several times for more gibs.<br><br>tl;dr The western world we as a nation aspired to match is currently taking steps backwards in development and it&#039;s fucking horrifying.","time":1492799676,"resto":122165824,"id":"VvQhTckj","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":122167725,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:39:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122167148\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122167148<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;western<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;based on trust <\/span><br>top jej Pooland.<br><br>west got a minute taste of their own medicine and europe as a whole is freaking out. seriously i have never seen bigger pussies than the current europeans.","time":1492799953,"resto":122165824,"id":"6dH7inPl","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":122168355,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:44:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Globalist French Politician Says Terror Attacks Part Of Our Lives<\/span><br><br>Lives of the proles, not the elite.","time":1492800275,"resto":122165824,"id":"\/fu\/TXDO","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122168149,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:42:49","name":"Anonymous","sub":"BRUTAL ATTACK ON MUSLIMS IN POLAND","com":"85 year old man goes full berserk and demolish muslim coffe shop, he attack owner with stick in one hand, using second start vandalise everything using spray can<br><br>he also yell<br>&quot;YOU WILL NOT EAT POLISH BREAD, GO AWAY FROM MY COUNTRY&quot;<br><br>geez, old granpa act like youngster pricks, IN MY TIMES... we were a bit more tolerate to foreginers<br><br>http:\/\/metrowarszawa.gazeta.pl\/metr<wbr>owarszawa\/7,141637,21670483,w-jedne<wbr>j-rece-trzymal-laske-w-drugiej-spre<wbr>j-85-latek-regularnie.html#Czolka3I<wbr>mg","filename":"Don-Salieri","ext":".jpg","w":401,"h":565,"tn_w":177,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492800169994,"time":1492800169,"md5":"4LzLSKbtN4GcM9qXpJy1Rg==","fsize":51609,"resto":0,"id":"sXNGwkpo","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"brutal-attack-on-muslims-in-poland","country_name":"Poland","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":122168353,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:44:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122168149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122168149<\/a><br>What the fuck are Muslims doing on Poland?","time":1492800273,"resto":122168149,"id":"3oGSMUG0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122163160,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:00:15","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Trump greets Egyptian-American woman after working behind the scenes to free her","com":"Trump saves Egyptian-American cutie from prison after Obama let her sit there for 3 years<br><br>http:\/\/www.washingtontimes.com\/news<wbr>\/2017\/apr\/21\/donald-trump-greets-ay<wbr>a-hijazi-egyptian-american-w\/","filename":"Trump_Freed_Egyptian_American_13500.jpg-9e1ae_c0-0-3881-2262_s885x516","ext":".jpg","w":885,"h":516,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":145,"tim":1492797615010,"time":1492797615,"md5":"T6Ou9+BnfV+KLCe6cSuZPw==","fsize":75722,"resto":0,"id":"myO\/kcEt","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-greets-egyptianamerican-woman-after-working","country_name":"United States","replies":25,"images":9,"omitted_posts":20,"omitted_images":6},{"no":122167636,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:38:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122163160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122163160<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ms. Hijazi, who has dual Egyptian and American citizenship and is a graduate of George Mason University in Virginia<\/span><br><br>maybe CIA ties","filename":"CIA cat","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":365,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1492799909266,"time":1492799909,"md5":"XcZivPrPpU8HCBCZPG3Fqw==","fsize":11627,"resto":122163160,"id":"c2Ns3PVP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122167700,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)14:38:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122163160\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122163160<\/a><br>He&#039;s a hero.

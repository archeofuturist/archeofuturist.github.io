Even the lowest quintile American household stands to benefit from privatizing social security. Furthermore, I realized an insidious fact about social security. <br><br>Your progeny cannot inherit your social security benefits! This means generational wealth cannot be built up. This seems like a mundane fact, but it&#039;s very important. Money invested from privatized social security can be passed down to children who can then utilize the boost in income and grow their investments even higher. Don&#039;t forget the fact that with privatized social security all the investments a person made is given to his descendants, while with social security the money just disappears. All the social security tax they paid essentially goes &quot;poof&quot; if they die before applying for benefits.<br><br>Lets say you are 65 years old and have a 35 year old son. If you paid social security tax your whole life and then died, your son would get jack fucking shit. Yet, if you invested in the S&amp;P 500 your son would get $499,523. This is exact moment where the regressive nature of social security is revealed. With that inheritance, the son could move up an entire quintile by investing and taking part of the growth as income.","filename":"1491273478223","ext":".png","w":2202,"h":3520,"tn_w":156,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491275194577,"time":1491275194,"md5":"LEEJLeFrGL41o8b+NQzPEA==","fsize":1091137,"resto":0,"id":"7LZg1EYO","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"social-security-most-jewish-scam-ever","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1},{"no":119422939,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)23:13:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119422304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119422304<\/a><br>Wait just a minute. <br><br>So you&#039;re saying that the government doesn&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing when it comes to managing finances, or are you saying they&#039;re fucking people over on purpose?<br><br>Either way, a stunning revelation if true.","time":1491275590,"resto":119422304,"id":"GqPLcJ4w","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119423583,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)23:19:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119422939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119422939<\/a><br>this<br>ancap or bust","filename":"1488003641598","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":541,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":105,"tim":1491275945170,"time":1491275945,"md5":"hKzOBMYduNxdqLdTTK+7aA==","fsize":79903,"resto":119422304,"id":"7dlEEZis","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119423927,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)23:22:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"Man are you late to the party.

I&#039;m a natty myself but even mine don&#039;t look that bad. Having shitty dreads like that is a choice and lefties make theirs just look fucking god awful. I understand that they don&#039;t have jobs and don&#039;t have to worry about looking presentable but come the fuck on my fucking face take some pride in your work. I&#039;ve had mine for 2 years and even though I&#039;m balding can still look presentable in a business setting. I fucking hate these lefties ruining everything. I enjoy my maintenance free hairstyle where I only have to get it cut every 5-7 years depending on how long I want them. Every year of which they get neater and cleaner.

Practicing homosexuals will NOT inherit the Kingdom.","time":1490138974,"resto":117667606,"id":"Vy64tlhB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117680205,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)18:29:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Dear young men of \/pol\/<br><br>see pic related<br><br>Sincerely,<br><br>Dr. Jordan B Peterson<br><br>p.s venerate your father","filename":"red","ext":".png","w":551,"h":511,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":231,"tim":1490135372899,"time":1490135372,"md5":"IgMtkugKcvrbcmcSmAfYTw==","fsize":207252,"resto":0,"id":"TB5v7BqO","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dear-young-men-of-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":50,"images":14,"omitted_posts":45,"omitted_images":13},{"no":117686927,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:28:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"What?

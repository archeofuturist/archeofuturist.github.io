No mention is made of the political enemy. Never in the thousand-year struggle between Christians and Moslems did it occur to a Christian to surrender rather than defend Europe out of love toward the Saracens or Turks. The enemy in the political sense need not be hated personally, and in the private sphere only does it make sense to love one&#039;s enemy, i.e., one&#039;s adversary. The Bible quotation touches the political antithesis even less than it intends to dissolve, for example, the antithesis of good and evil or beautiful and ugly. It certainly does not mean that one should love and support the enemies of one&#039;s own people.<\/span>","filename":"carlschmitt","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":1024,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490550265983,"time":1490550265,"md5":"Y7hVB0MZ2lV71lBBMyzD3g==","fsize":575104,"resto":0,"id":"AS187ehs","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"quote-thread","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118386993,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)13:30:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is this what happens in pro-choice places?","filename":"abortions","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":847,"tn_w":212,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490549404678,"time":1490549404,"md5":"Fi80rMN8OntFz5XH0\/BZ7g==","fsize":86728,"resto":0,"id":"fzXm0eM\/","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-this-what-happens-in-prochoice-places","country_name":"Brazil","replies":15,"images":2,"omitted_posts":10,"omitted_images":2},{"no":118388304,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)13:40:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118386993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118386993<\/a><br><br>Other way around.","filename":"Abortion","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490550021040,"time":1490550021,"md5":"a6zLXFuMgpipFREC+h0oJw==","fsize":31516,"resto":118386993,"id":"2um+gYr8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118388330,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)13:40:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118387878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118387878<\/a><br>That&#039;s just NYC<br><br>Nation wide is a Different story","filename":"image","ext":".png","w":914,"h":662,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":90,"tim":1490550035288,"time":1490550035,"md5":"bDYm6v75mBcALnboIN\/n3g==","fsize":42059,"resto":118386993,"id":"Uh7waPaU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118388459,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)13:41:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118386993\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118386993<\/a><br>Not in the US, in the US minorities abort much much more often than whites.","time":1490550098,"resto":118386993,"id":"6+5qruW7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118388676,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)13:43:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118388304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118388304<\/a><br>This is exactly why I&#039;m pro-choice","time":1490550195,"resto":118386993,"id":"xlZzio3H","country":"SK","country_name":"Slovakia"},{"no":118388829,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)13:44:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118388330\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118388330<\/a><br>Blacks and Hispanics still get abortions at much higher rates than whites.

There is a Democratic Candidate named Jon Ossoff who has a serious chance of winning and is leading in the Early Voting polls,you may be thinking &quot;But so did Hillary&quot; That is not the point we cannot afford to give the Dems an edge or allow them to capture a seat as it is too risky an can spark other Dems to start a &quot;Indivisible&quot; (Which is basically a Left Wing Tea Party) chapter and try to take Republican house seats. We need all Trump supporters and Republicans in the area to vote for the Republican with the best chance of winning The Primary On April 18th, with Early Voting already started Or a Primary Runoff Election (Which happens if no single Candidate gets 50 percent of the vote) On June 20th, which is, Karen Handel. If you live in any of these cities: Roswell, Johns Creek, Tucker, Alpharetta, Sandy Springs, Brookhaven, Chamblee, Doraville, and Dunwoody, or The Northern Suburbs of Atlanta, along with Eastern Cobb County, Northern Fulton County, and Northern Dekalb County, please vote for Karen Handel either for Early Voting for the April 18th Primary which is ongoing or The April 18th Primary itself or the Primary Runoff Election on June 20th. We need to get out and vote, we cannot allow the Libs and Dems to gain a House seat, so please if you live in Georgia&#039;s Sixth Congressional District please vote for Karen Handel.

On Monopolies:<br>There are, in effect two types of monopolies that I&#039;m aware of. <br>a. Government Sanctioned, i.e. by force. e.g. united airlines... with their crappy service.<br>b. Innovation i.e. creation of compelling products where customers throw money at them, e.g. teals motors.<br><br>In a free society monopolies will eventually form, the only question is which form. <br><br>2.On &quot;Eugenics towards the intelligent&quot;:<br>Kindly note that in recent world history eugenics occurred, as far as I&#039;m aware, in non-free societies. e.g. Nazi Germany, Congo etc... Dictators tend to be in charge when things like this occur... even with the mixed systems in the USA the rule of law maintains justice. Incidentally, she ,Ayn Rand, was also disgusted by eugenics and the notion of culling inferior human beings. Therefore in a theocracy we would be more at risk of such events.<br><br>3.On &quot;People are just animals&quot;:<br>I would respectfully disagree. Man is noticeably different from animals. We lack big teeth and huge muscles(generally) and could not stand up against a tiger or elephant(one on one).

Finally, generally speaking I believe humans are more capable than we&#039;re made to believe. I had the fortune of travelling to parts of Africa. There I met many people, with what appeared to be next to nothing... yet there they were... filled with joy and pressing on as best they could. It&#039;s not to say things won&#039;t be difficult for some... it will be. However, regardless of my station in life, the only person I could trust entirely is myself... only I could dig myself out of a hole... cooperation is valuable but I must choose who to cooperate with and so on.","time":1493863047,"resto":123975679,"id":"+13x9mRr","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124002069,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:06:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124000840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124000840<\/a><br>Yes it is the most efficient,<br><br>but people aren&#039;t at all efficient, I don&#039;t know what you do but in less than 20 years I can replace you with a a robot and an faux AI probably design by a faux AI<br><br>You&#039;re thinking short term<br><br>Trading with anyone supports them, you are tacitly encouraging the suffering of the Chinese people and the continuance of the latest escapade at a shit culture<br><br>You&#039;re small scale I&#039;m thinking about a thousand years from now given the current conditions and how to not die getting there and we&#039;re close","filename":"earthship","ext":".jpg","w":625,"h":377,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1493863601756,"time":1493863601,"md5":"skUJskm4u5xwBXzV0HOqaw==","fsize":42698,"resto":123975679,"id":"X9n\/OBNM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124002484,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:10:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123998244\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123998244<\/a><br><br>You have a well structured and clear argument, nicely done.<br><br>1.

Based solely on my personal experience and the interaction with others I believe that Alcoholism\/ addiction is a final result of some deeper character flaw that needs to be acknowledged and brought to light. Calling it a disease is a technicality - addiction often times ends in decreasing health and\/ or death. They call it a disease so that we stop beating ourselves up during early recovery. This takes the power to change out of my hands and gives it to a higher power, home group, sponsor, etc. i do not have a disease that makes me drink.","time":1493863293,"resto":123999631,"id":"hpV\/N4qa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124002073,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:06:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Addiction is a symptom of our current world order . with the reality of life its not suprising people want to get high and stay there lol really","time":1493863603,"resto":123999631,"id":"QE2o4S0+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124002764,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:12:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123999631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123999631<\/a><br>In most cases people under extreme stress or depression turn to drugs to the point of addiction.<br>So in most cases it&#039;s but a symptone of an underlying illness caused by a harmful enviroment.<br>A small portion gets addicted for shits and giggles, and their disease could be called idiocy.","time":1493863963,"resto":123999631,"id":"EE04BK2\/","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":124002961,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:14:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123999631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123999631<\/a><br>I guess, but even if it was it is a self-inflicted disease.

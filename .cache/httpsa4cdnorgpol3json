But eventually they must give way to better groups like the SS. As of right now these groups are too counter-productive. They paint NatSoc horribly, and our image is only tarnished. Part of what made NatSoc so successful was its image. Hitler understood this so well, perhaps due to his love of art, but he recognized how vital aesthetics were. Part of what attracted many people to look into NatSoc more is purely because they look respectable, orderly, and powerful. So yes I think these groups are counter-productive, but luckily for us I do not think their leadership is nearly strong enough if a truly great leader arose amongst us to take the helm. Which I encourage you all to attempt, but i understand why if not. First and foremost for the NatSoc ideology is re-establishing itself as something respectable, and unfortunately it might mean forsaking that name for a great period of time, as well as forsaking Nazism publicly. It disgusts me to even propose caution about professing truth, however we still need to be a bit pragmatic.","filename":"1480101831807","ext":".jpg","w":398,"h":600,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493097520855,"time":1493097520,"md5":"YZ1OyJTvyxg8PxrqTmeCFA==","fsize":71574,"resto":122687339,"id":"AVLS1MDN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122697179,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:22:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122696233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122696233<\/a><br>Perfectly fine with me.

I&#039;ll tell you.<br><br>Homosexuality is the result of a genetic disorder. Schizophrenia is also the result of a genetic disorder. Now, imagine for a moment, if you will, that the Government passed a law requiring you to indulge schizos in their delusions. Some homeless fuck on the street wobbles up to you one day and says he&#039;s Napoleon Bonaparte, and you have to agree despite knowing damn well that crazy bastard never once in his life conquered Egypt. But it&#039;s the law. How would you feel? What would this mean for society? How does it relate to gays? Because, despite homosexuality being a genetic disorder, everyone who is actually normal has to pretend homosexuals are good, normal people. Because it&#039;s the law. So what are gays doing about their disorder? Are they demanding Government funding for discovering a cure for their sexual abnormality? Of course not! But even the schizophrenic, who has absolutely no grasp on reality, will eventually seek treatment! How worse off are the gays, who are more deluded and confused than the mentally ill. No. The faggot rubs his abominable, unnatural sexuality in the face of society. When we otherwise wouldn&#039;t care about his sexuality, he rubs it in our faces and makes sure we know just how big of a queer he is. And lastly, what&#039;s worst than all, is the fact gays are more likely to catch sexually transmitted diseases, be raped, indulge in pedophilia, and get murdered than heterosexual people. But does this humble the gay community? Of course not! They hide their fear of AIDS by acting flamboyant, once again making sure you know they&#039;re gay, as they double-down on degeneracy.<br><br>That&#039;s why gays are bad and God will one day destroy them (by providing man with a cure for homosexuality).","filename":"gay stats","ext":".jpg","w":3099,"h":1854,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":74,"tim":1493097668439,"time":1493097668,"md5":"mZ9VVXYLT93i7zz340mlhg==","fsize":802200,"resto":122696374,"id":"0No8WmTd","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122697134,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:21:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122696374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122696374<\/a><br>I dunno.

Wouldn&#039;t he just be that immaculate? <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Christ knew of his Crucifixion through both the scripture and the fact his is Omniscient. And knew of the betrayal beforehand.<\/span><br>Why would he not save a person he needed to betray him it? Why wouldn&#039;t he try harder to save Judas, I mean they spent so much time together but just let him fall? He even went as far as to say the world would have been better without him.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Scripture said Satan jumped into him. <\/span><br>Why wouldn&#039;t Christ stop this? Why would he then blame Judas for getting taken over when he needed him to anyway. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Judas did good things in life and saw Jesus do some crazy shit. <\/span><br>Judas saved a ton of people and healed people, he wasn&#039;t a bad guy I don&#039;t think. Also if you saw a guy who did clearly crazy ass magic and made it so you could too, why would you betray him for 4 months salary when it would be logical he could do some other crazy shit. <br><br>All of this and more I could go on but I never got this idea. <br><br>Just to clarify I am not shitting on Christianity, I think it&#039;s the best religion out there, I just genuinely would like to know.","time":1491778751,"resto":120351159,"id":"vYXDP2uR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

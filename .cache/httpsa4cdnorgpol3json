I&#039;m 5&#039;4.5 and this being pol, we shouldn&#039;t give short men like me a false sense of hope. Here is the bitter harsh truth, height is the most attractive trait a man can possess. Height screams strength and confidence, which I bet you all agree, are real panty wetters.<br><br>It is far more important than being muscular, or having a good face or a good personality. And if you&#039;re under a certain height like me, no amount of lifting or game can make you Alpha.<br><br>I think we all know that Alpha Males are the fittest and strongest people in prehistoric society. Being tall gives you automatic strength and speed gains because you have much longer muscles, a larger range of attack and can take longer steps for running. Tall men have a much larger potential muscle mass, can strike a predator or an enemy before they can even come close to hit them and can run faster and longer for hunting prey.<br><br>If you&#039;re tall, congratulations, nature has gifted you default Alpha Male status. Getting women will be much easier and even other men will respect you more. But if you&#039;re short, you&#039;re out of luck, you are a default Beta. Getting women is hell of a lot harder and other men have much less respect for you. Life is in hard mode if you&#039;re a short man.<br><br>Most politicians, businessmen and celebrities are taller than average.Being taller on average means that you have more sexual partners, financial success and just general, overall happiness and satisfaction with life..<br><br>I have lifted for such a long time, and not to brag, most people tell me that I have one of the most shredded bodies they&#039;ve seen. I take pretty good care of my skin and hairstyle and people have told me that I have an above average face. I try to wear nice clothes that fit well and make me look taller.

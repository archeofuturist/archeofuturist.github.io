Sometimes, they\u2019re enraged \u2014 like the time when I called my last boyfriend after I left American Apparel in search of nipple covers for a white bodysuit. The store had some, but none that matched my skin tone. \u201cAre they fucking serious?\u201d he said in disbelief.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But, of course, for them it\u2019s just tourism. Racism isn\u2019t something white people need to face every day. And too many times, those same white boyfriends decided to sit out being my partner. I lost count of the times my boyfriend in my late 20s would tell me to \u201cjust leave\u201d parties or social events when I complained of being the only person of color in his all-white friend group.<\/span><br><br>Are liberals aware they are parodies of themselves?","filename":"1489808650409","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1920,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490284083972,"time":1490284083,"md5":"VWPVG2g2+P+pswCaImKO6w==","fsize":471491,"resto":0,"id":"LqGXmgNe","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"am-i-finally-done-with-white-guys","country_name":"United States","replies":129,"images":26,"omitted_posts":124,"omitted_images":26,"tail_size":50},{"no":117952856,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)12:56:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117946513\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117946513<\/a><br>they unironically do, yes","time":1490288165,"resto":117944973,"id":"uLxwfXhT","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117952883,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)12:56:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117944973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117944973<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;blacks are against race mixing<\/span><br><br>Hum... okay?","time":1490288178,"resto":117944973,"id":"7ClOS6TN","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117952901,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)12:56:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117948029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117948029<\/a><br>you got some gay ass niggers in leafland, down here they hate each other for being born on the wrong block","time":1490288186,"resto":117944973,"id":"UbFpeKtk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117952966,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)12:56:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117950201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117950201<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;charity crawford <\/span><br><br>Who?","time":1490288218,"resto":117944973,"id":"7eOrrGAA","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117953229,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)12:59:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117950408\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117950408<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying a nigger could read and understand a graph<\/span>","filename":"1487073250537","ext":".png","w":700,"h":700,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490288364215,"time":1490288364,"md5":"+DHDzmxL17EMh0kZTH89cw==","fsize":58571,"resto":117944973,"id":"uLxwfXhT","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117931970,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)09:45:30","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Automation","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;be a robot<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;work 24\/7 with no breaks, time off, or sick days<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;do the job right 100% of the time, consistently<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;easy to upgrade, learn faster than a human<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;works for free<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;5G network handles maintenance in real time<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;blockchain system provides all the oversight and management<\/span><br><br>Oh, you want a job?

I think they even offered to give Belgium and most of France back. So anyway Britain didn&#039;t want to lose (and pay for her own war debts, much better to beat Germany and make them pay for it) so they tried to get the USA into the war.<br><br>The US Anglo Elites wanted to jump in earlier but the population didn&#039;t want to, however the Jews were already influential in America back then so the British offered the Zionist community Palestine if they lobbied for the USA to jump in. This explains why the USA sent in over a million ground troops and lost about 100k or more of them over a few sunk ships.","time":1493119971,"resto":122721401,"id":"nBn3GZel","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122724830,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:38:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122724419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122724419<\/a><br>Danke.

Economically speaking, the USSR started going down hill the moment Khruschev&#039;s economic &quot;liberalization&quot; replaced the strict centralized policy of Stalin. Stalin also had serious penalties in place to combat problems systemic to a planned system, (ie. the lack of incentive to work or maintain property that you have no vested interested or ownership stake in, and the desire to &quot;personally&quot; profit [eg, theft, fund\/resource diversion]). If you engaged in any of these behaviors you were shot or thrown into a gulag under Stalin.<br><br>I am not arguing that it is superior to capitalism.

Christianity though initially having been based on a revelation by God has been thoroughly disproven. The bible is completely unreliable with the originals still unknown to this day. The quran however has been perfectly preserved since the beginning.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Are Islam&#039;s teachings and \/pol\/&#039;s views compatible?<\/span><br>Yes perfectly. Islam fights any form of degeneracy with an iron fist. No drugs, no alcohol, no feminism. Strong patriarchic family values. The sound of children&#039;s laughter has almost silenced in the west, Islam has the highest birthrate in the world.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isn&#039;t it mysogynistic?<\/span><br>No. 3 women convert to Islam for every male convert. Women realise feminism is a false gospel and only when you find your purpose in life you can be truely happy. Yes Islam commands modesty but so did the west for millenia. People know start to realise that&#039;s the norm. It is time that \/pol\/ realises that too. The 4 wives you will have are a bonus.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Isn&#039;t it anti-nationalistic?<\/span><br>No. Islam commands us to respect all races and cultures and only cut out the blasphemous and degenerate aspects. That&#039;s why Islam in Indonesia differs greatly from say SA Islam. Obviously like christianity the religion itself hass no boundaries by country but it very well respects nations within. Without Islamic birth rates your race and nation will soon go extinct.","filename":"4ec98fe0f739d52bb37740609a96688e01c59cca32d77484352c5aa14beaad91","ext":".png","w":1437,"h":909,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":158,"tim":1493115042471,"time":1493115042,"md5":"Kry9YCndXBZjVEox6seM+w==","fsize":89757,"resto":0,"id":"3iqdDX6B","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"islam-general-chemo-edition","country_name":"Germany","replies":68,"images":8,"omitted_posts":63,"omitted_images":7},{"no":122725628,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:48:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122725031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122725031<\/a><br>I&#039;m fine with Islam as long as you keep it where it belongs: not in my streets.","time":1493120932,"resto":122718937,"id":"MnIRSHnG","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122725767,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:50:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122725628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122725628<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;implying an Arab ever considered immigrating to your country, or even continent<\/span><br>In b4 everyone is an Arab.","time":1493121043,"resto":122718937,"id":"fOO5WvIl","country":"SA","country_name":"Saudi Arabia"},{"no":122726062,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)07:54:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122725767\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122725767<\/a><br>so what are the refugees doing here, then?<br><br>Arab world is all the same to me.<br><br>Also I said muslims, not arabs.

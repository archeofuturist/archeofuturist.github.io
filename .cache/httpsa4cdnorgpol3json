There is ZERO respect for men that aren&#039;t GQ types with perfect hair. Women are stone cold hypergamists here and if you have so much as a slightly receding hairline, you are going to experience a SEXUAL DEATH SENTENCE. Bald men in Toronto are treated like complete garbage. I&#039;ve been ridiculed by strangers, people online, coworkers and even friends over my thinning hair, by both men and women. It wasn&#039;t like this before I was balding though, I actually had people treat me decently and it all went downhill over the years. This place is a nightmare if you havent won the genetic lottery, the sense of entitlement from BOTH sexes in Toronto is disgusting; women expect every man to be a Brad Pitt and all the men in Toronto feel as if they should be having sex with all the women, every night. The cockblocking he describes is real. The 2am cutoff for alcohol is a joke (its called a NIGHT club for a reason). But the women are a problem, its no wonder so many of them flock to the financial district looking for the 6 figure salary guy with perfect hair. Dont bother making small talk with women here, youre better off just cutting to the chase and telling her if youve got a car, your own place and your salary. Toronto is a career city, everyone here is shallow. The guys are no different, theyre just as bad. It&#039;s a city where both sexes are hellbent on destroying eachother.","filename":"1464079841563","ext":".jpg","w":470,"h":512,"tn_w":229,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492321695886,"time":1492321695,"md5":"Rs0qPkkYN1qBhQfr9V417Q==","fsize":74245,"resto":0,"id":"dSIwsPUE","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"as-a-balding-man-toronto-is-actually-much-worse","country_name":"Canada","replies":6,"images":0,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":121324589,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)01:50:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121324322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121324322<\/a><br><a href=\"\/r9k\/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;\/r9k\/<\/a> buddy","time":1492321855,"resto":121324322,"id":"ueypaq67","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121324673,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)01:51:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"wear a hat at all times<br>I know I am haha ;_;","time":1492321913,"resto":121324322,"id":"sfeXne6H","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121324755,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)01:52:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121324559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121324559<\/a><br>It&#039;s more like the bottom 20% of men who are SOL.

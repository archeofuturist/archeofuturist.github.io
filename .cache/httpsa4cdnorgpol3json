It is clear that his features were typical of Galilean Semites of his era.

Semite skulls of this type had previously been found by Israeli archeology experts, who shared them with Neave.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;With three well-preserved specimens from the time of Jesus in hand, Neave used computerized tomography to create X-ray &quot;slices&quot; of the skulls, thus revealing minute details about each one&#039;s structure. Special computer programs then evaluated reams of information about known measurements of the thickness of soft tissue at key areas on human faces. This made it possible to re-create the muscles and skin overlying a representative Semite skull.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The entire process was accomplished using software that verified the results with anthropological data. From this data, the researchers built a digital 3D reconstruction of the face.

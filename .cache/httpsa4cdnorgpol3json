For lack of a better word, stubbornness. A complete refusal to believe they could be at fault. Like, their brain literally can&#039;t comprehend that they&#039;re wrong, so their brain makes stuff up to justify cause and effect. As if it&#039;s impossible that they could have been the cause therefore the effect is always unjustified. <br><br>I mean, this goes back to their foundation. For Christ&#039;s sake, the 2nd book in the Old Testament (literally right after the creation story) is the story of the Exodus. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kicked out of Egypt<\/span><br>Well it definitely wasn&#039;t our fault, it was the Pharaoh&#039;s fault.<br><br>I mean is it possible that the Jews in WW2 were being de-liced with Zyklon-B but, because of the Typhus epidemic, so many of them were dying, they just misunderstood and genuinely believed they were being gassed to death? Like, not that they fell down dead in the gas chambers, but that it took its effect over time? And the stories became this big game of telephone and they heard from other Jews in their camps and they snowballed?<br><br>What I&#039;m trying to get at is, in the same way I can&#039;t believe that the Nazis just &quot;went along with&quot; the systematic murder of millions upon millions of Jews (especially a white, christian civilization active less than 70 years ago), I just have a hard time believing that millions and millions of Jews went along with this grand conspiracy and they perpetuate the Holocaust even though they know it&#039;s not true. Like, they honestly believe it because of this complex.<br><br>The majority have been propagandized and brainwashed to believe it just as much as non-Jews, I mean.

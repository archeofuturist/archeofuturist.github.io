That itself was a violation of the Logan Act, and then Flynn went on to lie about it to the FBI, a prosecutable felony. MSNBC analyst Jeremy Bash, who has a prior history as Chief of Staff at the State Department and CIA, reported the following on-air on Thursday night. His words were posted online by respected political pundit Caroline Orr:<br><br>This may explain why Michael Flynn is offering to cut a deal. He\u2019s spent years working in the government, including the Defense Intelligence Agency, and he\u2019s surely aware that immunity is only granted when a suspect can deliver evidence that a more important suspect in the hierarchy is guilty.

Personally, I think we should end North Korea as soon as possible because they can put satellites into orbit, meaning that if they have nuclear weapons, they can cause an EMP and fry the entire US electric grid. Granted, North Korea would be GONE but some people estimate that 80% of the us population would be dead within a year without electricity.","filename":"Problem Child","ext":".jpg","w":1095,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":182,"tim":1493232890531,"time":1493232890,"md5":"IVNwDvaKVMwuBeuohXtXbg==","fsize":349496,"resto":0,"id":"aUQWg3Qo","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"north-korea","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":1,"omitted_posts":5,"omitted_images":1},{"no":122922344,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)15:02:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122921837\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122921837<\/a><br>The NK satellite doesn&#039;t work.

We get rid of him and the problem is solved. I would much rather have Russia or China take over NK or have them install a puppet government than to deal with him.

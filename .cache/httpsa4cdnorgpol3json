This isn&#039;t affecting mortgage premiums. It&#039;s about mortgage insurance premiums. Mortgage issuers require mortgage insurance for risky loans: people with low income, people with low credit scores, people asking for loans that represent more than they can reasonably afford. Keeping the cost of mortgage insurance premiums high is a good thing. Hell, if anything they should be increased even more. Maybe then people will think twice before going for the unaffordable mortgage.

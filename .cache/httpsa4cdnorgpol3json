Civic Nationalism works, and it works well, but one must not that some &quot;violent&quot; things are necessary. Like a group like the stormtroopers in Nazi germany. Basically they need to serve as a protection force, not and offensive one. However they still must be there. Above all else order and aethstics in regards to these warriors is important. In regards to more civic ideas yes it is completely compatible, read Mussolini, Mosley, work on this matter since both dealt with multi-ethnic nations. <br>https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Essays-Fasci<wbr>sm-Classic-Library-Mussolini\/dp\/191<wbr>0881023<br><br>but to give you a tldr answer, in order for Civic nationalism to work in a multi-ethnic state you must create a unified identity somehow, through religion, culture, and an idea of patriotism. If my knowledge on brazil is correct then like america, most of the people have multiple ethnicity and &quot;purebloods&quot; are amongst the minority. Even if this isnt the case look at how america has assimilated people in the past, through that you will find some more insight. It doesn&#039;t really matter what you believe in regards to religion, all thats important is you recognize its ability to unify different tribes of people especially with Christianity, and I assume you want to emulate Western Civ, so thats what I would do.","filename":"id invade that","ext":".png","w":157,"h":162,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493099045735,"time":1493099045,"md5":"M0LTf5rtwDtYc13rgwUTlg==","fsize":52679,"resto":122687339,"id":"AVLS1MDN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122696575,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:16:15","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Lighthorsemen","com":"Getting real sick of the patriarchy bullshit. <br>All day today references to lighthorsemen and diggers, who are obviously male, and women are being excluded.","filename":"images (10)","ext":".jpg","w":197,"h":255,"tn_w":193,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493097375894,"time":1493097375,"md5":"xUq+g5g8y1GZqxpLkQY8sQ==","fsize":9909,"resto":0,"id":"TRFYbNeX","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"lighthorsemen","country_name":"Australia","replies":5,"images":3},{"no":122696857,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:19:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122696575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122696575<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;women<\/span><br>don&#039;t you mean rape-ables anon?","time":1493097540,"resto":122696575,"id":"FvY7VGT9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122696931,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:19:46","name":"Anonymous","filename":"siriusdisclosurelogomedium","ext":".png","w":239,"h":240,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493097586515,"time":1493097586,"md5":"7i\/ui96U\/bITcBMd4rafTA==","fsize":39859,"resto":122696575,"id":"yuJlQH4F","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122696989,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:20:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122696575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122696575<\/a><br>Happy ANZAC day","filename":"bait","ext":".jpg","w":3000,"h":3000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493097615115,"time":1493097615,"md5":"WuLLEW1WkGxDb9UrfgpNBA==","fsize":376635,"resto":122696575,"id":"NcxMvMTj","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122697041,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:20:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122696575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122696575<\/a><br>did you just assume the gender of every Aussie digger?","filename":"thK13VZHJU","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":172,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1493097647266,"time":1493097647,"md5":"XDPhGFpIsUIISrAaf0AsHA==","fsize":10678,"resto":122696575,"id":"0GAoFXxy","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122699366,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)01:44:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122696575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122696575<\/a><br>The sjws and white genociders hate ANZAC Day. <br>It&#039;s the one day of the year Australians, (the most apathetic people on earth) actually feel pride in their country and forefathers.

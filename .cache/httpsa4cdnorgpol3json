We&#039;ve been under the control of Jewish international capital for, I&#039;d argue, over 200 perhaps 300 years now maybe even longer. We simply passed the torch to the US. I&#039;m fairly certain they bankrolled the Empire. The Jew works on, with a new puppet under its thumb and with even more capital and control now that they have the Federal Reserve to play with. It&#039;s a sad state of affairs I must say. This country is literally riddled with half-castes, blacks, Muslims and other vagrant peoples with origins based outside of Europe. You see them everywhere. The working class, especially the youth, are the most vulnerable. The Jew has managed to combine both White and Black working class youths and got them to operate under the same language, glorifying benefits, rap music, drug and alcohol usage and race mixing. The results are absolute catastrophic. We will see what mongrels we have spawned in the next 10-20 years maximum. As I said in a previous comment, only a collapse can save us now. Same applies to the rest of the West. If there is a solution, I&#039;m not seeing it. This is what Britain fought for during WW2. The soldiers who fought for Britain wouldn&#039;t have stepped foot on the beaches of Normandy, let alone put one foot in Germany if they could see the state of this country today. My great-grandfather was one of those who fought. As wise as he was, he wanted to take my entire family out of Britain and planned to bring us to New Zealand. It was all set in motion until my Grandmother fell ill and he was forced to stay. I only found that out recently. It&#039;s as if he knew something big was coming. He was anti-immigration, as right wing as you could be, very knowledgeable. A pity he never went through with it. Now I, an 18 year old youth, must pay the price along with the rest of those sitting in this shit heap called multiculturalism. I&#039;m stuck now.

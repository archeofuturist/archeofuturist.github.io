Thanks to this FUCKING UNIBALL IDIOT, all of Western Europe (at least) has developed an irrational fear of being associated with racism to the point it doesn&#039;t make any logical sense. This hack artist has successfully accomplished what many Non-European empires throughout the ages have failed to do: the destruction of European cultures. European cultures are in their hospice beds, waiting to die thanks to this Tic Tac dick.<br><br>Because of this illogical fear of racism (and by extent virtue signaling), European cultures are bringing in unregulated millions of unvetted brown people who come from cultures that are the antitheses of Western Values. ALL. JUST. BECAUSE. THEY&#039;RE. BROWN. Not because they&#039;re STEM-intelligent. Not because they&#039;re hard workers. NOPE. JUST BECAUSE THEY&#039;RE FUCKING BROWN (AND NON-WHITE). This is so clearly the reason when you have countries like Sweden refusing to record stats by race so they don&#039;t have to confront the reality that the brown migrants are the majority of the rapists.

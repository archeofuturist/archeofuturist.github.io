Incentivize business maybe in some cases like tax cuts for green energy production but that something to be enforced in a case by case basis.

This was a long time coming especially given the events of the last 3-4 years where the Greek government was using its monopoly on energy as an effective &quot;second&quot; tax, jacking up the price of power to ridiculous extremes to cover its own inability to stop tax evasion.","time":1493648768,"resto":123611319,"id":"VBOEkvLN","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":123626435,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)10:28:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123625632\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123625632<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Will we say that mathematics are not objective because some people may maintain that 2+2=5<\/span><br><br>No, because math itself is the origin of objectivity.

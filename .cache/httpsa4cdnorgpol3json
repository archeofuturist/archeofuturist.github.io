If not, it&#039;s time.<br><br>Say what you will about (((conspiracies))); underneath everything about the current social milieu originates in the thought of this man. It should be noted he was entirely correct about everything he believed about large-scale social change. This is demonstrable in so far as we are on the cusp of his hoped-for future. <br><br>He designed &quot;cultural Marxism&quot; to undermine the Western culture in anticipation of the new community age. His disciples populated academia and entertainment; and, whereas many other individuals have understood influence, none understood the currency of culture quite like (pic related). It was his vision to cultivate a worker&#039;s subculture which would separate the interests and values of the proletariat from the those of bourgeoisie. This culture would center around a libertine attitude and constant agitation, all toward the end of unsettling the very moorings of &quot;Capitalist&quot; (read, &#039;traditional&#039;) society. The great ship Humanity, thus set on its own way, would soon beg for a Captain wise enough to bring them back into a pacific port. This would be the moment the secret junta appears to welcome us into our amazing new world of centralized control and various scintillating sensations, which are the only thing the de-familied, de-cultured, de-skilled population can think about: how to get new kinds of highs and how to avoid any responsibility.<br><br>His dream has come to pass. Remember. He was correct. He might be the second most important person who lived during the 20th century. Tragically, his vision turns out to be a nightmare and his proselytes tyrants and we are all caught up in it by no choice of our own.<br><br>What should we do, humans? We have been rats in a maze our whole lives, living a failing experiment in transcending humanity whose designers are far too invested to ever give up. I think the key is understanding this man and trying to be even more clever than he was.","filename":"theonewhoknew","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":1200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493268894044,"time":1493268894,"md5":"1QS7fwjn4ubMsOxrYWUK4g==","fsize":140440,"resto":0,"id":"RfLgjDqv","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gramscian-social-transformation-megathread","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":3,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":3},{"no":123001188,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)01:39:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123000404\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123000404<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bump<\/span><br><br>Thanks anon.

There is a reason why mudslims and niggers from africa did not immigrated in mass before west countries had gimethats. They came, had to learn the language and the culture and assimilate to get a job and support their family. Most did not stay and just went back. Now since that raising a child is so expensive and it&#039;s almost impossible for single parent we have gimethats for families. But the problem is that those leech are moving here for those very benefits, remember that they did not before because most did not want to assimilate to our culture. What happen is that, canadian families are left with almost no support when those shitskin that need translator get full welfare, housing, social support. A canadian single mom will be told to go live with her parent or seek support from the father when they provide housing and support to those shitskin.

He was allowed to publish only one work in the Soviet Union, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich (1962), in the periodical Novy Mir. After this he had to publish in the West, most notably Cancer Ward (1968), August 1914 (1971), and The Gulag Archipelago (1973). Solzhenitsyn was awarded the 1970 Nobel Prize in Literature &quot;for the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of Russian literature&quot;. Solzhenitsyn was afraid to go to Stockholm to receive his award for fear that he would not be allowed to reenter.

Another senate bill authored by the same pair of ambitious religious freedom fighters would allow people employed in any of Texas&#039;s 65 licensed occupations to refuse service to people if those folks violate their SHRB.<br><br>So, for example, private medical providers wouldn&#039;t really have to help trans patients if they assert that being transgender violates their SHRB; barbers wouldn&#039;t have to cut gay people&#039;s hair if they didn&#039;t feel like it; plumbers could let toilets overflow and electricians could keep people in the dark if they happened to religiously disagree with the customer&#039;s sexual orientation.

The so-called bathroom bill, SB 6, has passed in the Senate, but its future is far less certain in the house.

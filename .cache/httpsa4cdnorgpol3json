I see 70+ aged seniors at the grocery store walking past dikes, addicts, trannies, degenerates, hambeasts, faggots, 5 millions mexicans, and all the songs meanwhile playing on the radio are so rotten to the core and sacrilegious they&#039;d never have believed it growing up in the 50&#039;s. I grew up in what I know was a town out of a dream back when these seniors were young. Even those who grew up in the 70&#039;s must be appaled, but they aren&#039;t. They grin and bear it and think it&#039;s all in good fun even though only 50% of my generation&#039;s women are going to be married in their lifetime.","filename":"1468617717374","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1490420611485,"time":1490420611,"md5":"j5+ir1uS0TAgDHwfiruYPA==","fsize":15176,"resto":118161831,"id":"m\/rf\/ja4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118191900,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:43:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118181345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118181345<\/a><br>This image is poetry in several levels.","time":1490420627,"resto":118161831,"id":"VTBIoZG9","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118186321,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)00:39:18","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Favorite Ex-Colony?","com":"Yo, brits, what&#039;s your favourite ex-colony.","filename":"The_British_Empire_Anachronous","ext":".png","w":2753,"h":1400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":127,"tim":1490416758169,"time":1490416758,"md5":"bzRAzyLPoRonU4NIUq5FJQ==","fsize":594404,"resto":0,"id":"ixqoZ5Fy","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"favorite-excolony","country_name":"United States","replies":52,"images":4,"omitted_posts":47,"omitted_images":4},{"no":118191649,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:40:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118186321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118186321<\/a><br>The Falkland Islands are clearly best colony, because Britain still has them.<br><br>Falkland loves you long time.","time":1490420442,"resto":118186321,"id":"3h2jguP3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118191672,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:40:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118191403\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118191403<\/a><br><br>Shut up you glue-sniffng street urchin or we&#039;ll feed you to Portugal again","time":1490420455,"resto":118186321,"id":"dQoAB7yK","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118191797,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:42:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118191649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118191649<\/a><br>Best thing about the Falklands is when they were having their referendum to stay in the UK they designated a single citizen to vote &quot;no&quot; because they thought no one would believe a 100% yes vote","time":1490420548,"resto":118186321,"id":"K3XQxPkj","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118191831,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:42:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118189347\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118189347<\/a><br>We only understand cultural, economic, and military empires.

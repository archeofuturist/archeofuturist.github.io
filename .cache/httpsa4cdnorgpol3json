At the time the first Aboriginals came to Australia 50,000 years ago, humans were still in the Stone Age. They did not have the technology to build seagoing vessels of any kind. Since Australia was always separated from other countries by an ocean; humans could not have travelled to Australia on any sort of sea-going vessel such as rafts, canoes or boats. The final crossing to Australia was probably made by accident. It is most likely that the initial arrivals got to Australia unintentionally. These people were probably carried across the ocean on drifting debris as a result of a major flood or even a tsunami in a land somewhere further to the north. Some say, that given the genetic homogeneity of the aboriginal population, this could have even been just one pregnant female.&#039;<br><br>&#039;The first Australians branched off from an Asian population that had already separated from the ancestors of Europeans.&#039;<br><br>The out of africa theory is quite obviously bullshit.

White skin was a genetic mutation that came along with migration, they crossed the colder parts to get to where they were today and having white skin (is a theory) was for more warmth than having darker skin but thats just stupid i view it more of a genetic mutation. Same thing applies to blond hair and blue eyes it wasn&#039;t all based on the cold environment but a lot of it attributed to the evolution change. The reason why the Eskimos have black hair and black eyes and darker skin is because of the same reason, their group didn&#039;t have any genetic mutation or evolution in the case of black hair and eyes from the Africans but their skin was slightly changed dont know in depth with eskimo but thats my theory.

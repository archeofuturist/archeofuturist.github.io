ISIS gives no shits about the lives of civvies, so if we take great pains to avoid collateral damage, they&#039;ll just do what the mudslimes always do and hide in schools and hospitals and such. So we can either not attack them, letting them go and kill and rape more civvies, or we can attack them, killing civvies along with them, but sending the message that if they&#039;re gonna play dirty, so are we. ROEs only work if both sides actually respect them, if not, we need to go total war.","filename":"knock_knock_deus_vult","ext":".jpg","w":545,"h":600,"tn_w":113,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490645649815,"time":1490645649,"md5":"8xjaV53MWHPNLhPbTREHpg==","fsize":50575,"resto":118554416,"id":"q5IRLetq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118555593,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)16:14:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118554416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118554416<\/a><br>Obama&#039;s double tap policy was a blatant war crime.<br><br>If Trump is what it takes to get Democrats to oppose intentionally targeting civilians, then I say PRAISE KEK.","time":1490645656,"resto":118554416,"id":"86tmPh1D","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118555590,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)16:14:14","name":"Anonymous","sub":"post your favourite \/pol\/ tier video","com":"before youtube shoahs them all on friday<br><br>Adolf Hitler - &quot;You Said I Was A Dreamer&quot;<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=lmG<wbr>qG3grTrg<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not allowed to participate due to widespread blocks:<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;germany<\/span>","filename":"Screenshot_157","ext":".png","w":852,"h":634,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":186,"tim":1490645654630,"time":1490645654,"md5":"FGMZdJ4T0idQqtEMi3ZEtw==","fsize":804846,"resto":0,"id":"ws5yJrZV","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"post-your-favourite-pol-tier-video","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":118526464,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)12:00:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Are classic punks our allies?","filename":"IMG_8655","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":2048,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490630448557,"time":1490630448,"md5":"F33ZnvMz\/c8oIC853kscQA==","fsize":1442482,"resto":0,"id":"TYRjoGKf","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-classic-punks-our-allies","country_name":"Canada","replies":235,"images":44,"omitted_posts":230,"omitted_images":44,"tail_size":50},{"no":118553912,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)16:01:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118553108\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118553108<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;hey guys let&#039;s start a dialogue<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;in three words describe society<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;how would you change society for the better<\/span><br>kek<br>great idea.

I understand that there&#039;s commonly a distinction made between the concentration and extermination camps, but really when you think about it that just doesn&#039;t make any sense. Why would Jews taken from certain areas be killed, while others sent to work?<br><br>And you can say &#039;oh well the ones that weren&#039;t fit to work, they were sent to the extermination camps!&#039; but that doesn&#039;t really hold up once you look at the Diary of Anne Frank, a very young girl, not suited for work to start with, who was left alive even after contracting typhus.<br><br>Combine this with the fact that all extermination camps were the ones left to Soviet occupation and you bring in the Soviets&#039; reputation for propaganda and misleading information. Then you bring up the question, well if the Nazis wanted to kill the Jews, why did they wait until the start of the war to do it? A more sensical question is, why would the nazis wait until the start of the war to \/enslave\/ them? Well to help the war effort of course.<br><br>Is it possible a shitload still died? Yeah.

So it&#039;s entirely possible a lot of them emigrated before, during and after the war.<br><br>Hence, my conclusion that the number is most likely somewhere in between.

The alien covenant that chased these hooligans found where they were hiding and set up a quarantine surrounding earth that blocks their dna from trespassing beyond the moon&#039;s orbit. After thousands of years populating the planet, breeding with the inhabitants, and creating genetically altered slave races to do their bidding, the extraterrestrials continued to work diligently to find a way to escape. Soon their slaves revolted and set up kingdoms on different continents. The main kingdom was located in the southeast near india and china, but the homeland of the original ancestors existed where the british isles lay. Because of disputes and further rebellions these two kingdoms resulted in a war. This great war disrupted the earth&#039;s natural bio-grid causing immediate upheavals on the planet. Destroying flora and fauna, and almost eliminating the population of the earth. The trauma caused by this catastrophe split man&#039;s psyche itself making us more resentful towards nature and existentially vacant. Damage was felt on both sides but the atlanteans were impacted less and won the war. However, because of this fallout they lost all their technology and needed to rebuild. Now they would work behind the scenes of government, setting up secret societies\/cabals to rule the planet conspiratorially, not openly like their forebears once did. They had a new goal now. They would dub it &quot;New Atlantis&quot; or (New World Order) one world government where their slaves would be psychologically manipulated, imprisoned but without the need of physical constraint.

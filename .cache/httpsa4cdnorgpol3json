They were mostly Jew merchants in the coastal cities, so no communism there. During the mandate more moved in, but the migration didn&#039;t really start until 1945. One big problem was that none of the kikes knew how to farm so they all piled into the coastal cities and tried to become merchants. Kibbutzim were formed because the cities were full of kike merchants and they had to get the newly arrived helpless fucks out of the cities and take control of the countryside from the goatfucking Arab savages. The kibbutzim were never self-sustaining and in the 1970s, after the initial need for them was over, the Israeli government stopped subsidizing them and they all succumbed to bankruptcy. They are pretty much just regular towns now.","time":1491885431,"resto":120545648,"id":"F1PbN15X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120554403,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:44:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"Never met someone who openly supports socialism\/communism, but for those of you who have, have you ever asked them what they think their role would be in this type of society?","time":1491885859,"resto":120545648,"id":"+G2\/4H7L","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120553647,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:37:53","name":"Anonymous","sub":"this is the US border wall","filename":"borderWallConstruction","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1119,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":136,"tim":1491885473010,"time":1491885473,"md5":"CtE9X2o\/hJ2EZih9r3Pehw==","fsize":1053563,"resto":0,"id":"cjsdfLj6","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-is-the-us-border-wall","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1},{"no":120554120,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:41:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120553647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120553647<\/a><br>this is the selected design?<br>nice.<br>looks alot like the one in israel<br>idk about that wire on the top tho, seems like that would make it easier to climb with grapping hooks<br>what was the bid amount?","time":1491885717,"resto":120553647,"id":"Wv8vXY7\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120554315,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:43:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120554120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120554120<\/a><br>that barbed wire won&#039;t take that much stress on it, if you tried to climb it would probably break and once you get to the top you have to deal with barbed wire.","time":1491885818,"resto":120553647,"id":"MgzT8ih1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120554397,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:44:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120553647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120553647<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;trump dropped the wall<\/span><br>not anymore","filename":"Shareblue-Sample-04","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":599,"tn_w":106,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491885857400,"time":1491885857,"md5":"O7TsiaN69ZeaMoVwO8rAHw==","fsize":41165,"resto":120553647,"id":"2yITH\/6V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120554064,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:41:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw it didn&#039;t even take 3 months for the oaf to back down on every single promise and go golfing a dozen times<\/span>","filename":"1478186887225","ext":".jpg","w":551,"h":491,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":222,"tim":1491885689204,"time":1491885689,"md5":"myC\/S3SVdcSVIxPEPWxOxA==","fsize":167937,"resto":0,"id":"G\/eTXi5\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"tfw-it-didnt-even-take-3-months-for-the-oaf-to","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":120554202,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:42:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120554064\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120554064<\/a><br>Trump may be the great deception in Matthew 24:24","time":1491885759,"resto":120554064,"id":"PJC3p4nv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120554204,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:42:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120554064\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120554064<\/a><br>he&#039;s supposed to be wearing a maga hat. how is anybody supposed to know that he&#039;s a regretful POTUS voter?","time":1491885760,"resto":120554064,"id":"uRx4m4Uu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120554396,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)00:44:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"I voted for Trump, and it appears that I may be guilty of a grave sin for doing so.

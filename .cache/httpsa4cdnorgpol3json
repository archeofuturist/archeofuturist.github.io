The beginning of this war will be used as an excuse to expand the police state, make the constitution irrelevant through obscure laws that are many hundreds of pages long, and round up political dissidents.

Little mistakes that in better times would have solicited a reprimand, not political exile.<br><br>Mao in an effort to bolster his image instigated the Cultural Revolution one as a means of purging those he suspected of plotting against him and also to reinvigorate the Revolution.<br><br>So it was the People were mobilised and progroms were implemented to &quot;educate&quot; the masses. Those who were identified as being enemies of Chairman Mao&#039;s thoughts were tried by the mob, if you were lucky you were sent to the rural areas to be &quot;re-educated&quot; if you were unlucky you were punished on the spot.<br><br>So how would they try you?

Grievous as it was to injure and cull your population of skilled people what was more grievous was the Commies were encouraging and praising people who participated in these rabid mob justice punishments. So it wasn&#039;t just a brain drain it was literally a programming of society to be as barbaric as possible.

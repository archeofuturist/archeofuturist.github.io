It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side.\u201d<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now, Trump is on the witness list in a Florida court battle over how federal prosecutors handled allegations that Epstein, 64, sexually abused more than 40 minor girls, most of them between the ages of 13 and 17. The lawsuit questions why Trump\u2019s nominee for labor secretary, former Miami U.S. attorney Alexander Acosta, whose confirmation hearing is scheduled to begin Wednesday, cut a non-prosecution deal with Epstein a decade ago rather than pursuing a federal indictment that Acosta\u2019s staff had advocated.<\/span><br>Prosecutors in Acosta\u2019s Miami office who had joined the FBI in the investigation concluded, according to documents produced by the U.S. attorney\u2019s office, that Epstein, working through several female assistants, \u201cwould recruit underage females to travel to his home in Palm Beach to engage in lewd conduct in exchange for money. ... Some went there as much as 100 times or more. Some of the women\u2019s conduct was limited to performing a topless or nude massage while Mr. Epstein masturbated himself. For other women, the conduct escalated to full sexual intercourse.\u201d<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the 2011 letter explaining his decision in the Epstein case, Acosta said he backed off from pressing charges after \u201ca year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors\u201d by \u201can army of legal superstars\u201d who represented Epstein, including Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz; Kenneth Starr, who as independent counsel led the investigation that brought about President Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment; and some of the nation\u2019s most prominent defense attorneys, such as Roy Black, Gerald Lefcourt and Jay Lefkowitz.<\/span>","filename":"pizzagate ramsay","ext":".png","w":1764,"h":1440,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":204,"tim":1490146878270,"time":1490146878,"md5":"vDYdGfr27McHwaqN33FoVA==","fsize":2552507,"resto":0,"id":"IzeoanzV","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pzzagate-is-back-in-the-news","country_name":"United States","replies":29,"images":15,"omitted_posts":24,"omitted_images":13},{"no":117705000,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)22:12:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117704925\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117704925<\/a>","filename":"2 of 3","ext":".jpg","w":3264,"h":2448,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490148744210,"time":1490148744,"md5":"tQfqeG13gA0TvJoxEGXMlg==","fsize":1399271,"resto":117701692,"id":"IzeoanzV","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117705038,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)22:12:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117705000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117705000<\/a>","filename":"3 of 3","ext":".jpg","w":3264,"h":2448,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490148774762,"time":1490148774,"md5":"0Z85hNZcUriqGAqRGp9TzA==","fsize":1650449,"resto":117701692,"id":"IzeoanzV","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117705077,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)22:13:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117701692\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117701692<\/a><br>http:\/\/pastebin.ca\/2174219<br>These are chats from a deep web chat site that got hacked.

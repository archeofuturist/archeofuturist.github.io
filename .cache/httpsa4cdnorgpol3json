Next year it&#039;s $50K. Then $100K, then $300K, then $500K or even in the millions in Vancouver. As this bubble began to form, the government wanted to appease the populace for muh votes, so extended amortizations to 50 years and reduced down payments to $0 with some banks even PAYING people (ie. loaning money to them and amortizing it) because the CMHC covered virtually all the risk. That was around 2008, and when the US bubble crashed, Canada was actually bankrupt. This is a very well hush hush secret. You see, the banks were all bankrupt on paper if the books were marked-to-market. The CMHC would have been wiped out and the Canadian tax payers would be on the hook. So to avoid the outrage, Harper tabled a bill that secretly bought all of these mortgages ($120B at the time) and everyone was magically liquid again on paper- in addition the banks\/CMHC didn&#039;t have to liquidate all these houses. That&#039;s why home values didn&#039;t really drop in Canada. Read up on it. In fact, they kept soaring for years.<br><br>Now the amortizations have been reduced back to 25 years (for CMHC insurance), 5% for under 500K, 10% downpayment for 500-1M, with 1M being the max. Buying a place today is virtually impossible for someone buying into this ponzi. But people that bought years ago are still in this ponzi market, and can buy houses or siphon off their paper wealth to their relatives\/kids to buy in.

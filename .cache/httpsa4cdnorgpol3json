If Christians must establish the millennium on earth before Christ comes again, the politics becomes an essential Christian duty. Only by improving the state o the world can prophecy be fulfilled and the kingdom of heaven by brought into existence. Christians should work for peace and justice in this world in order to hasten the transition into the kingdom. Since human history has never contained anything remotely close to 1,000 years of peace, Christians have their work cut out for them.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If, on the other hand, the world must inevitably worsen until Christ rescues his followers, then politics is a futile endeavor. Moreover, if Christ might come again at any moment and summon the pure to him, then the top priority for Christians must be to remain distinct from the sinful world to avoid temptation. Political involvement might lead to compromise with sin, which would leave the Christian unready for the trumpet call that would signal the second coming. The fundamentalist acceptance of premillennialism therefore created a strong resistance to political involvement that the Christian right leaders have worked hard at various times to overcome.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Onward Christian Soldiers?

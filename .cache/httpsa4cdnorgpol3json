If they can, by any means, amend that problem, then they&#039;ll be able to become a superpower. Under current circumstances, however, the country that is secure on their northern, western, eastern and southern border, has access to world&#039;s two biggest oceans and is the main catalyst for trade between East and West will put all its effort into preventing that. In assessing who&#039;s the true global power, always remember that the US is taunting China in their own backyard - the South China Sea. If that doesn&#039;t convince you, look at the situation in North Korea. The Chinese are turning on their allies because the US tells them do so.","time":1492336286,"resto":121329438,"id":"GbuE86qQ","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121342705,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:53:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121329438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121329438<\/a><br>if they would collectivise their shitting efforts, they&#039;d have more than enough methane to fire shitrockets into orbit","time":1492336429,"resto":121329438,"id":"Y5k16etL","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121342747,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)05:54:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121330496\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121330496<\/a><br>India has a real false rape accusatiln culture too.

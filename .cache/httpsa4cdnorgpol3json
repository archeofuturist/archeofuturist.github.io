After researching the topic I really don&#039;t get what is to gain from the Brexit for Britain, besides the symbolic fuck you to the EU. I totally get they want to show the EU that it is cucked and did a lot of bullshit in the recent years, but in the end this whole thing leads to HUGE amounts of paperwork, financial problems to be solved and generally a whole lot of fuzz. I don&#039;t see the advantages, even the all the EU legislations where - even if annoying - kind of minor and now over 20000 legislations have to be revised, lots of stuff has to be rebuilt from scratch. <br><br>And no, I don&#039;t let the &quot;keep your mudslimes, niggers EU!&quot; etc. as an argument, Britain has always accepted lots of poos and other foreigners to their country and they will neither stop doing this nor throw out who is already there because of Brexit. Even if people wished it would happen this has almost nothing to do with Brexit, and is still a decision of the same government that decided to keep them and let them in before.<br><br>And &quot;I don&#039;t want to be ruled by Merkel!&quot; is not an argument either since she has almost no fucking say in Brit politics, she never had. The Brits are far more important to the world than germany, and everytime a Brit has said &quot;We&#039;ll do this.&quot; germany went along with it since we are dependant on Brit economics and - most of all - military power. Brits had more say in the EU than germany all the time, so I don&#039;t get where this myth is coming from.","filename":"1490157559435","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490772479461,"time":1490772479,"md5":"qup1ycdk+bXuDM9BVh+GOA==","fsize":719699,"resto":0,"id":"nSjrup11","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-is-to-gain-from-brexit","country_name":"Germany","replies":178,"images":18,"omitted_posts":173,"omitted_images":17,"tail_size":50},{"no":118768358,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)05:29:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118767268\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118767268<\/a><br>Drawing the line to where enough is enough and separatism is a better alternative is a long argument I cba getting into, but the current status of the EU *surely* wasn&#039;t such a line. For an example, the EU isn&#039;t even established - there&#039;s no cemented constitution and it&#039;s merely in its fluid infancy. How are you so sure that it wouldn&#039;t have flipped in 5 years and became strongly anti-refugee?<br><br>Even more, there&#039;s the US on the other side of the world who are not only not 85% white, but are 3 times our &quot;scandalous&quot; whiteness deficit - 55% white. Add to that bakeries getting sued for not baking faggot cakes, privacy erosion, nigger culture, faggots constantly parading everywhere in front of children, etc. Yet, neither Texas nor any other white state is even close to separating. Why? Because they realize that while shit happens, they&#039;re always better off remaining unified, because on the other side of the world there are two superstates and one nuclear superpower who&#039;d move in to instantly seize the opportunity and turn it into a puppet. Even if that didn&#039;t happen, the economy would be so devastated that neither the seceded state nor the remaining union would be even CLOSE to being as competitive as something like the EU or China - it&#039;s a lose-lose for both the sides - the American dream would disappear forever and all the wars defending it before that would be pointless. Why would you migrate to some low-wage 50% white shithole with less GDP than China when you can just stay in the EU which isn&#039;t crashing?<br><br>So they waited the entire two terms of Obama and finally got their anti-immigration president. They acted quite mature there, got what they wanted, and remained unified and powerful.","filename":"HUscRwt","ext":".png","w":2032,"h":148,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":9,"tim":1490779793391,"time":1490779793,"md5":"txP4avVlgWlL7OZWlody7g==","fsize":58518,"resto":118760560,"id":"zNVro6L0","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":118768565,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)05:33:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118768358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118768358<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but the current status of the EU *surely* wasn&#039;t such a line.<\/span><br>(((surely))) it was such a line.

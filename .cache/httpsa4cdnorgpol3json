Daily reminder that sea levels around the world were about 400 feet lower just before the end of the last Ice Age.<br><br>Near the end of the last Ice Age about 12,800 years ago, a giant comet that had entered the Solar System from deep space thousands of years earlier, broke into multiple fragments. Some of these fragments struck Earth, causing a global cataclysm unseen since the extinction of the dinosaurs. At least eight of the fragments hit the North American ice cap, while further fragments hit the Northern European ice cap. The impacts, from comet fragments a mile wide approaching at more than 60,000 miles an hour, generated huge amounts of heat which instantly liquidised millions of square kilometres of ice, destabilising Earth&#039;s crust and causing the global flood that is remembered in myths all around the world.<br><br>A second series of impacts, equally devastasting, causing further cataclysmic flooding, occurred about 11,600 years ago, the exact date that Plato gives for the destruction and submergence of Atlantis. The evidence for all of this shows beyond reasonable doubt that a civilisation at least as technologically advanced as 19th-century England at the onset of the Industrial Revolution (if not more technologically advanced) that flourished during the last Ice Age was destroyed in the global cataclysms between about 12,800 years ago and about 11,600 years ago.<br><br>A distant memory and a warning to the future - for the comet that wrought such destruction in remote antiquity may not be done with us yet.","filename":"iceagemap","ext":".png","w":853,"h":440,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":128,"tim":1493127842998,"time":1493127842,"md5":"cs0+u5uti9vK6vqtSQSaoQ==","fsize":557051,"resto":0,"id":"MT5xsBCS","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-red-parts-of-this-map-used-to-be-land-daily","country_name":"Australia","replies":194,"images":42,"omitted_posts":189,"omitted_images":40,"tail_size":50},{"no":122757057,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:11:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122756473\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122756473<\/a><br><br>Here&#039;s &#039;The Mysterious Origins Of Man&#039; (my favourite documentary of all time):<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=LQU<wbr>9AhPnwsk<br><br>Here&#039;s &#039;Mystery Of The Sphinx&#039;:<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=SbU<wbr>sGnMUH2Y<br><br>Here&#039;s &#039;Quest For The Lost Civilisation&#039; by Graham Hancock:<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=T5D<wbr>NvYMtkyk","time":1493140307,"resto":122734952,"id":"MT5xsBCS","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122757084,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:12:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122756962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122756962<\/a><br>Fermi is the key to everything","time":1493140323,"resto":122734952,"id":"ia25bJqi","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":122757236,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:13:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122736806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122736806<\/a><br><br>Even Graham Handcock has already said that was wrong and that Atlantis was in red regions and that he used crustal displacement was made up to fill in the gaps by earlier researchers.","time":1493140392,"resto":122734952,"id":"svbDeWIs","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122757316,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:13:56","name":"mexican intellectual","com":"<a href=\"#p122756962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122756962<\/a><br>i think its like 300k years that weve had the same brain capacity <br><br>The mayans believe we are on our fifth sun (fifth civilization rising), the last one was destroyed by flood and before that i think it was war(the text says it was the jaguar but you must know mayans related jaguars to war), and before i think it was famine","time":1493140436,"resto":122734952,"id":"czs0n1S2","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":122757380,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)13:14:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122756068\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122756068<\/a><br>The environment changes so much over thousands of years that all that garbage will be under thousands of feet of sediment or deep underwater by the time another civilization comes around.","time":1493140474,"resto":122734952,"id":"jL91voqQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122748868,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)12:00:04","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Moving to Poland","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; Canadian Ex-pat living in the UK<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Polish wife<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Plan on having lots of white babies<\/span><br><br>What can \/pol\/acks tell me about the non-city\/suburban areas in Poland?

Someone who just slipped through the cracks. Someone that no one got to in time, that has decided to be some paragon of suffering. But like what it does man. In that moment, no one sees race, or creed. No one cares if their partner is a dick bag or some bullshit nationality ot religion. All that matters right then, is taking down a threat. A common enemy.

And it&#039;s only after it happens, after the smoke settles, that we see the big picture around us all, instead of our own little worlds. We rally together and cheer for the champions, mourn for the lost, curse the enemy, and vow to do something to change it in the future, only to go back to the way things were 24 hours after. If we could keep that goal, that common enemy, thay one tragedy thay ties humanity together for even the briefest moments. God what a world we would live in.

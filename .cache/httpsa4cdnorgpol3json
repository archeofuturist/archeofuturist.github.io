Welcome to Celt\/pol\/ <br><br>Discuss your culture, traditions and how filthy Anglo-Saxon scum ruined and sullied our lands and stripped us of our native languages and culture. <br><br>Wee bit of history about our peoples: <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;From around 750 BC to 12 BC, the Celts were the most powerful people in central and northern Europe. There were many groups (tribes) of Celts, speaking a vaguely common language. The word Celt comes from the Greek word, Keltoi, which means barbarians and is properly pronounced as &quot;Kelt&quot;.<\/span><br><br>A misconception that (((Anglos))) will spam in this thread is that all Celts are just Anglos with a different accent; this couldn&#039;t be further from the truth as almost ALL Celts are ethnically homogeneous excluding mixing from other celtic nations e.g Scotland and Ireland in which admixture between the two is very prominent.<br><br>What nations are Celtic? Contrary to what the Anglo-Saxon savage has taught you, Celtic nations are not exclusive to the British Isles, in fact we are one of the most diverse group of peoples in Western Europe, ranging from Asturias all the way to Breizh. Underneath this text you will find the celtic countries listed to spare confusion.<br><br>- Asturias: Between the regions of Galicia and Cantabria in northern Spain.<br>- Breizh: In Brittany on France\u2019s northwest coast.<br>- Kernow: In the county of Cornwall on England\u2019s west coast.<br>- Galicia: On Spain\u2019s northwest coast.<br>- Eire: Ireland.<br>- Mannin: The Isle of Man.<br>- Alba: Scotland<br>- Cymru: Wales <br><br>Remember brothers, the anglo has raped our women and pillaged our cities and villages for millennia. Never forget the fallen of our peoples who were sent to die across the world because of a bunch of fugly anglo neckbearded generals who used Scots, Welsh and Irishmen alike as cannon-fodder for their brutal wars against other White European countries.","filename":"1487272627312","ext":".gif","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491921907576,"time":1491921907,"md5":"x5AxmXTXNWXlMnyThL8F5g==","fsize":935986,"resto":0,"id":"2STh19ap","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"celtpol-flags-of-our-fathers-edition","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":30,"images":10,"omitted_posts":25,"omitted_images":6},{"no":120610070,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:25:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120609703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120609703<\/a><br>The only trouble is that link will time out in the 30 minutes.

His sense of sacrifice is only apparent. It exists only as long as the existence of the individual makes it absolutely necessary. However, as soon as the common enemy is conquered, the danger threatening all averted and the booty hidden, the apparent harmony of the Jews among themselves ceases, again making way for their old causal tendencies. The Jew is only united when a common danger forces him to be or a common booty entices him; if these two grounds are lacking, the qualities of the crassest egoism come into their own, and in the twinkling of an eye the united people turns into a horde of rats, fighting bloodily among themselves.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If the Jews were alone in this world, they would stifle in filth and offal; they would try to get ahead of one another in hate-filled struggle and exterminate one another, in so far as the absolute absence of all sense of self-sacrifice, expressing itself in their cowardice, did not turn battle into comedy here too.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So it is absolutely wrong to infer any ideal sense of sacrifice in the Jews from the fact that they stand together in struggle, or, better expressed, in the plundering of their fellow men.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Here again the Jew is led by nothing but the naked egoism of the individual.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That is why the Jewish state-which should be the living organism for preserving and increasing a race-is completely unlimited as to territory. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For a state formation to have a definite spatial setting always presupposes an idealistic attitude on the part of the state-race, and especially a correct interpretation of the concept of work. In the exact measure in which this attitude is lacking, any attempt at forming, even of preserving, a spatially delimited state fails. And thus the basis on which alone culture can arise is lacking.<\/span>","filename":"1490907665743","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":799,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491925107441,"time":1491925107,"md5":"rQmuSnNS+UUtlby0tFOdMg==","fsize":90221,"resto":120606989,"id":"WztRmyj7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120612003,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)11:41:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;For what sham culture the Jew today possesses is the property of other peoples, and for the most part it is ruined in his hands.<\/span><br>In judging the Jewish people&#039;s attitude on the question of human culture, the most essential characteristic we must always bear in mind is that there has never been a Jewish art and accordingly there is none today either; that above all the two queens of all the arts, architecture and music, owe nothing original to the Jews.

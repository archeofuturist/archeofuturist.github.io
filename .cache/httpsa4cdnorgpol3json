This light is invisible to the human eye, but visible to most camera sensors, and is transmitted through certain clothing, particularly dark colored and thin cotton and polyester like ANTIFA\u2019s bandanas. Some of you might remember a bunch of \u201cnews reports\u201d about a Sony video camera that could \u201cx-ray\u201d clothes \u2013 this is the effect we are talking about. Now, there are two steps to making one of these at home: 1) remove the IR filter on the camera, and 2) filtering the visible light so that the IR dominates the image.<br>For the first, I recommend this tutorial: [spoiler]<br>https:\/[\/spoiler]\/www.youtube.com\/w<wbr>atch?v=mUtoLBOego4<br>It uses a ~$60 &quot;action camera&quot; clone of the gopro which should have good mounting options for your protest gear.<br>Next, reassemble the camera and glue this: https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00XU8SHE<wbr>0\/ref=twister_B01DA1ASWU?_encoding=<wbr>UTF8&amp;psc=1#customerReviews over the lens, as close as you can get it to the lens housing. <br>There you go. For less than $100 you should have a basic infrared camera that can see through some clothing. Here&#039;s a video demo of how it works: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7UB<wbr>bjwPnW1E <br>It&#039;s not perfect, obviously, nor will it unmask every antifa you catch on camera, but it should be able to give our doxsquads more to go on and preserve more evidence for later use. More importantly, antifa won&#039;t know if their masks are protecting them or not. As we saw at Auburn, unmasking them sends them running immediately. I think the psychological aspect may be more potent than the information gathering.","filename":"IMG_0680","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":700,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":175,"tim":1492861328166,"time":1492861328,"md5":"NqpztYMGJ3YMTHu5zlWjyg==","fsize":746614,"resto":0,"id":"qAFRaL89","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"unmasking-antifa","country_name":"Australia","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":122271796,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)08:28:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump","time":1492864122,"resto":122268141,"id":"ezUBFZ6P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122255233,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)04:36:55","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Trump puts EU ahead of Britain in trade queue","com":"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA","filename":"trump puts EU ahead of Britain","ext":".jpg","w":521,"h":659,"tn_w":197,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492850215113,"time":1492850215,"md5":"qYPkGrWUH+qNRIY+pdx4oA==","fsize":153239,"resto":0,"id":"EAxGvST+","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-puts-eu-ahead-of-britain-in-trade-queue","country_name":"Germany","replies":106,"images":20,"omitted_posts":101,"omitted_images":20,"tail_size":50},{"no":122270842,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)08:16:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122255233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122255233<\/a><br>If you still don&#039;t realize that trump is a traitor you must be clinically retarded","time":1492863412,"resto":122255233,"id":"bEr1mLq\/","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122270944,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)08:17:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122255233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122255233<\/a><br>FAKE NEWS<br>A<br>K<br>E<br> <br>N<br>E<br>W<br>S","time":1492863476,"resto":122255233,"id":"jyHdgM5R","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122271074,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)08:19:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122270842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122270842<\/a><br>Children unable to understand 4D chess are laughable","time":1492863582,"resto":122255233,"id":"Byuf1xdx","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122271340,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)08:23:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122271074\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122271074<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh 4d<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh trump is not a retard it&#039;s strategy<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh utter drumpfian damage control<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh ridiculous personality cult<\/span>","time":1492863782,"resto":122255233,"id":"oyMnZ1Fb","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122271791,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)08:28:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122255233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122255233<\/a><br>well it makes sense a bit as we leave in 2019 so it would be impractical on the yanks if they just sat about for two years waiting for the negotiations to finish. furthermore until we leave in 2019 we are still full EU members so any trade deal that happens during that point we will feel the effects of.","time":1492864120,"resto":122255233,"id":"p3a80apD","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122269387,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:58:05","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Gay baboon rape 5 men in South Africa","com":"http:\/\/zimbabwe-today.com\/gay-baboo<wbr>n-terrorises-villagers-in-southafri<wbr>ca-rapes-5-men\/<br>What should we do about the baboon problem ?","filename":"zimbabwe-news","ext":".png","w":697,"h":513,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":184,"tim":1492862285386,"time":1492862285,"md5":"5Ect4wGeMZvTnmiXMOLf3Q==","fsize":643295,"resto":0,"id":"1wWEq8x8","country":"FR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"gay-baboon-rape-5-men-in-south-africa","country_name":"France","replies":33,"images":6,"omitted_posts":28,"omitted_images":6},{"no":122271692,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)08:27:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122270264\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122270264<\/a><br>A grim glimpse into our future should we fail in our mission.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;captcha: select all helicopters<\/span>","time":1492864041,"resto":122269387,"id":"GN+mQBBk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122271707,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)08:27:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122269387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122269387<\/a><br>Made me kek, thank you OP.<br><br>Reminds me of the intruders caught burgling a house and were bummed by the ubergay homeowner newspaper clip.","time":1492864051,"resto":122269387,"id":"MGHM0jxs","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":122271720,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)08:27:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122269719\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122269719<\/a><br>So was England","time":1492864065,"resto":122269387,"id":"7Q\/ohRe0","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122271782,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)08:28:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122270088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122270088<\/a><br>No they didn&#039;t.

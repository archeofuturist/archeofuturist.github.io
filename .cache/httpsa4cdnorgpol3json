There&#039;s little personal interpretation of his own in it; he just goes through the core concepts exactly as written in the sutras, only elaborating enough to give context and relate concepts to each other. I can attest that the contents are 100% accurate, not that you should take an internet anon&#039;s word over a monk&#039;s about the monk&#039;s own religion, but even monks vary in presentation skill. The lectures contain an overview of the entire orthodoxy of Theravada, so it includes not only the direct mind training aspects I like to emphasize, but also the entire philosophical and religious bundle of concepts, so you get a complete and accurate picture. My personal recommendation is to focus on the mind training portion (see next post) and not worry at all about any of the other parts unless\/until you&#039;re specifically interested, but YMMV.<br><br>You&#039;ll quickly notice that the lectures all consist mostly of methodical lists and trees of terminology arranged for easy memorization - this is what the sutras are mostly like as well.

But regardless, it&#039;s important both to not just brainwash yourself by accepting the ideas at face value, but also to not reject them outright on the basis that it just sounds like dogma. The concepts involved are EXTREMELY non-obvious, even the ones that sound obvious in some ways. You absolutely will not be able to understand the specific meaning of the words being used until you connect them directly to something in your own personal experience. <br><br>The ideas are meant as a tool for training, a particular method of looking at the world that yields particular results, and NOT dogma. It&#039;s a core Buddhist concept that the teaching is only an instrument to help you see something you wouldn&#039;t otherwise be able to see, at which point these concepts are no longer needed.","time":1492956061,"resto":122426742,"id":"Gf5YVsXr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122426922,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)10:01:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"final <br><br>In particular, I would advise caution with part 2, the four noble truths, where I think the lecturer doesn&#039;t stress enough (though he does mention it) that &quot;dukkha&quot; means at least two quite different things in different contexts, only one of which can plausibly be translated as anything like &quot;suffering&quot;. So if you come away from that part with the impression that &quot;life is suffering&quot; is an accurate representation of Buddhist belief, I would just skip that one entirely for now and focus on the others.<br><br>Also, in part 4, I think the formulation of &quot;dependent origination&quot; as &quot;when this arises, that arises; when this ceases, that ceases&quot; is one of the most central and useful maxims of Buddhism, but I personally can&#039;t make heads or tails of the &quot;12 links&quot;, and I strongly suspect that the ideas got garbled or misinterpreted at some point early on as Buddhism developed.<br><br>Finally, in part 8, the lecture I recommend starting with, he mentions that it&#039;s important to formally &quot;go for refuge&quot; and take the precepts before beginning meditative practice, but for someone who&#039;s just investigating the dharma and wants to know whether it&#039;s worth getting interested in or not, I don&#039;t think this is realistic or helpful.<br><br>That&#039;s all I have for this week.

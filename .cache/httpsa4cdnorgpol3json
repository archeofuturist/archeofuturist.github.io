See for example:<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Sahih<wbr>_al-Bukhari<br><br>And when Muslims read the Hadith, they see that Muhammad was basically a death-loving abusive warmongering maniac. <br><br>So that is their perfect being, the example to follow. It doesn&#039;t say explicitly in the quran that the Hadith are law, but it says that Muhammad is the ultimate person (something along those lines), and hence many will be inspired by Hadith.<br><br>___<br><br>I don&#039;t want to kill anyone or ban anything ideally. But because of the above I believe Islam in a nation will always tend to produce violence. Not 100% of the time for 100% of the people, but push society in that direction, particularly if Muslims are in a majority. <br><br>The only good solution I can think of is to avoid having lots of muslims in the country, through limited immigration and the like.

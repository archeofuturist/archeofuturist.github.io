However, smart right wingers can see the left wing bias and occasional lies that they mold the message with. This opens up right wingers to question a wide range of falsehoods they have seen on the media and in the classroom, and then make the conclusion that, well if the left is lying about the hacking, maybe they are lying about the moon landing, or some other conspiracy theory. <br><br>As bad as we have it in America, other countries are even more into their conspiracy theories. Particularly countries with corrupt state controlled media, like for instance, Saddam era Iraq. Nobody believed a word his government said practically, and they were rife with conspiracy theories as a result, to the point of the X Files being the favorite western television show, and was viewed as if most of the shows premise was real. <br><br>Personally, I can&#039;t buy into conspiracy theories, not out of blind trust in authority, but out of my understanding of human nature. We are horrible at keeping secrets. Two examples from US history point this out more than any other. After victory in WWII, we couldn&#039;t keep our most precious secrets from our commie rivals, see the Rosenbergs. The other example is the Monica Lewinski scandal. Three people couldn&#039;t keep secret the most powerful man in the world getting slobbed on in the Whitehouse. This is not abnormal, this is human nature. So when I hear of conspiracies that involve hundreds of people keeping a secret, I tend to dismiss automatically.","time":1490590179,"resto":118450471,"id":"mgJ0mCAo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118473477,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:53:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118473119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118473119<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Personally, I can&#039;t buy into conspiracy theories, not out of blind trust in authority, but out of my understanding of human nature.

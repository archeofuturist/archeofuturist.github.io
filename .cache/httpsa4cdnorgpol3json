Sex may be fun, but you are abusing what should be a tool for emotional bonding for temporary pleasure. True happiness of relationships comes from deep bonds between two souls. Being trans means that it will be hard for you to find someone who actually loves you beyond a fetish. I suggest doing activities that form emotional bonds first, and work to relationships later. Join a rock climbing club, or a pottery club, or any public venue that is geared for single people. After you form an emotional bond people will be more willing to look past your transgenderism. <br><br>The one point you do have though is that many conservatives will even reject a loving two person gay relationship. The next generation of conservatives have mostly moved past this, but the old generation still hold onto their religious text that condemns it.

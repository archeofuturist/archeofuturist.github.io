It&#039;s fucking wrong. http:\/\/chapelofsergeandbacchus.blog<wbr>spot.ca\/2009\/02\/what-does-bible-say<wbr>-about-homosexuality.html<br>Gays are not sick. Not any other stretches. Everything is explained above and is only getting better. In every single regard. There are lots of hidden dangers even in biology you know nothing about. You put men down and you know what they say about memes and getting things circulating. Gays are not pimps nor pagan temple hookers and cross dressers. They don&#039;t use female beds either. Get your heads screwed on correctly on all this. The 144,000, the Bible says, are made undefiled solely by their virginity of women. Serpent seed doctrine ties lots into this too. If you wonder where &quot;divine femininity&quot; comes from. Or the many modern examples of the same and how they come about.

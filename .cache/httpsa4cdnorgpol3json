I recently saw Valhalla Rising. Oh cool, badass Vikings viciously killing each other. Then they show up in the new world and are completely murdered by natives without killing even one native in return. In the end, the main character walks up to the natives and lets them kill him. The director had no problem displaying the Vikings killing each other, but when it came to the natives they mysteriously turned scared and inept and helpless. I give the movie 10\/10 for cuckyness. Are other scandy movies suffering from cuck tendencies?","filename":"IMG_1696","ext":".jpg","w":1069,"h":1500,"tn_w":178,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490689537065,"time":1490689537,"md5":"ICxVbrhQBS4XewPbFlpEpw==","fsize":233117,"resto":0,"id":"0skReEye","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"scandinavian-cuck-movies","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":0,"omitted_posts":13,"omitted_images":0},{"no":118630038,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:55:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118629788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118629788<\/a><br>Don&#039;t remember saying it was a historical account just a regular account.

This general is for the discussion of Marxism-Leninism, the ideology of revolutionary socialism and communism.<br><br>Communism is the next stage of humanity following the capitalist stage.<br><br>What exactly is communism according to Marxist-Leninists:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism is a stage of society in which the productive infrastructure is socially owned, and goods are produced not in order to sell for profit, but in order to meet a social need.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490691026553,"time":1490691026,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"7MRWzGD+","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":2,"images":1},{"no":118629999,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:54:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118629725\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118629725<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br><br>Do you honestly believe this?","time":1490691292,"resto":118629725,"id":"tG9F\/QrP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118630157,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:57:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"fuck off with your commie shit faggot","filename":"hitler","ext":".jpg","w":4253,"h":3072,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":90,"tim":1490691453399,"time":1490691453,"md5":"SEveULCHqJHGCNzjzIU4MQ==","fsize":1044653,"resto":118629725,"id":"zlJxjJ7U","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118627875,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:16:18","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Kyle Cuckman","com":"&quot;Based Stickman&quot; is just a plain old cuck.<br>He turned on us as soon as we made him popular.<br>Why do we spend the time supporting these cucks when they just turn on you the second they have a platform. <br>Only some Reddit-tier faggots are this cucked.","filename":"UnbasedCuckman","ext":".jpg","w":496,"h":118,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":59,"tim":1490688978069,"time":1490688978,"md5":"2xsB0KRQGg1XURvz4aMiJQ==","fsize":35820,"resto":0,"id":"82mBPoWp","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"kyle-cuckman","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":5,"omitted_posts":11,"omitted_images":5},{"no":118629899,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:53:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118627875\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118627875<\/a><br>Step into the real world for once. \/pol\/&#039;s irony can&#039;t seriously radicalize reddit, right?

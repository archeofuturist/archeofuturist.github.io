For example, north africa had elephants\/tigers and it was almost entirely green. The climate back then favoured a great civilization to arise in these regions. There is a reason why romans were so successful - they lived in the lowlands, not in the mountains, meaning they were well-connected geographically, unlike the greeks.<br><br>Germans, franks, italians and anglos later flourished since they were conquered by the romans, and when the empire collapsed, they adopted the knowledge of the romans, along with their religion and culture. So-called &quot;dark medieval times&quot; were actually a period where monks were translating and rewriting old roman-greek books and storing all the knowledge, making renaissance possible later on. Slavs and scandis on other hand existed outside of roman borders, thus had no access to roman heritage besides just adopting it later through cultural exchange with the germans.<br><br>As climate gradually changed and mediterrean areas became more desert and less green, the cultural centre of the west shifted to northern and eastern areas, until the turks conquered the byzantine and only roman heritage left was in the northern areas like british isles, german areas, netherlands, franks, and to some extent, spanish areas.<br><br>The reason why asians have higher IQ these days is that they have always been industrious and clever people, but also very rigid and stubborn in their following of authority figures and rules, which held back their progress. Once they gained access to western knowledge, they rigorously started adopting this too, which allowed them to reach success.<br><br>Not all people are like this. Western heritage never made some people more advanced, like africans, arabs, hindus etc. who continued their own cultures and merely contributed to the world by working for the westerners, but never truly trying to apply the western model for their societies.","time":1493879526,"resto":124028780,"id":"7B2jmnMT","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":124030307,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:32:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124028780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124028780<\/a><br>Didn&#039;t you just answer your own question? <br><br>A group in a resource rich environment will do better than one that is in a scarce one. <br><br>Also culture is a huge factor, many don&#039;t realize that it is actually a selector for genetic traits.

Le Pen runs this debate for the entire two hours - it&#039;s like watching Pence\/Kane again, only better. She gets in two very memorable jabs, one where she calls him out for fucking his teacher and another where she says &quot; a woman will lead France, either me or Mrs. Merkel.&quot; He stutters repeatedly and repeats dumb lines constantly and seems off topic, irritated, and generally full of shit. If you actually understand the policy topics you know that she dismantled him completely on each one. He frequently tries to wave his hands and jedi mind trick and she is ready for it and throws it back at him. This was the strongest debate performance I&#039;ve ever seen and one she needed. She even dangled a line about &quot;let&#039;s hope we don&#039;t find out you have a secret bank account in the Bahamas&quot; because she obviously knows about the big leak of his secret Caribbean bank account that&#039;s about to hit. She&#039;s running against an even stronger propaganda campaign than Trump was so she has to get everything right and get some luck to win and this debate is her getting everything right. If she does not win tonight and France is still holding elections after 5 years of Macron she&#039;ll win then. She absolutely exposed him as a pissant joke and schooled him on every single issue. He called her &quot;stupid&quot; repeatedly and made other derogatory remarks that would get him absolutely fucking shredded by US feminists. The French are watching and she changed a ton of minds today and redpilled a bunch of motherfuckers. Ignore all shills - I understand French politics, understand French, and understand what I saw with my own two eyes. Only the most deluded propaganda victim could see this as anything but a devastating ass-whooping laid down by Le Pen on Macron.","filename":"1492903836842","ext":".png","w":657,"h":527,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1493868819229,"time":1493868819,"md5":"dSOBA3aVoeBfNgTcvuWmrg==","fsize":36227,"resto":0,"id":"J2SAI8FU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"marine-le-pen-absoluely-destroyed-macron-in","country_name":"United States","replies":86,"images":20,"omitted_posts":81,"omitted_images":20},{"no":124029427,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:21:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124026698\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124026698<\/a><br>or maybe he&#039;s the shill trying to psyop you into believing that there are no shills.","time":1493878894,"resto":124012070,"id":"y6ubXO2r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124030472,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:34:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"Le Pen won easily.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic related, shills getting btfo in this thread<\/span>","filename":"1489828385296","ext":".jpg","w":499,"h":317,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":79,"tim":1493879658001,"time":1493879658,"md5":"d2\/pf1S0TFk3HfMSwn5cqw==","fsize":50745,"resto":124012070,"id":"uyigL7nQ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124030753,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:37:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124029427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124029427<\/a><br>No it&#039;s just that people who think she has won are delusional.","time":1493879866,"resto":124012070,"id":"a\/a0aL1d","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":124031096,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:41:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124012070\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124012070<\/a><br>Considering that Macron went home soon after the end instead of going to meet his supporters, I think speaks for itself.","time":1493880114,"resto":124012070,"id":"SZJ3QT2w","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":124031273,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:43:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124020897\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124020897<\/a><br>Sure shill.","time":1493880232,"resto":124012070,"id":"gyglKK4W","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124031272,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:43:51","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Where to find a High IQ woman?","com":"Where does an intelligent polymath that&#039;s wealthy, attractive and fit find a similar woman?

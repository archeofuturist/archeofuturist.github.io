Basically, they approach the DA informally and convince them that your clean record and your current life situation (i.e. that you are making positive life choices, that you are a productive member of society - as proven by your EMP school) indicate that it would better suit the interests of the prosecution to decline to prosecute your case. If this happens, there&#039;s no double jeopardy to prevent actually opening a prosecution in the future.

Why? Women don&#039;t care.<br><br>They don&#039;t care? Nope. This statement probably confuses even the most hardcore of redpilled misogynists, &quot;But women are always going on and on about rape and rape culture!&quot; That&#039;s just an extension of their rape fantasies. You&#039;re probably clued in on female masochism by now but few of you actually realize it seeps into politics. Women use the made-up concept of &quot;rape culture&quot; to talk about their #1 fantasy, rape. It&#039;s like if a guy who you know has a femdom fetish talks about the &quot;epidemic&quot; of women going around kicking guys in the balls and spitting on them. &quot;Yeah OK, Rick. That&#039;s nice, you weird perverted asshole.&quot;<br><br>However, it isn&#039;t subconscious desire to fuck Arab rapists that leads to women&#039;s apathy regarding rapefugees. It&#039;s a lot more subtle. Think about your reaction to hearing about a 12 year old boy who scored with a hot MILF teacher. It&#039;s probably not one of disgust. But you probably condemn male pedophiles all the time. Why? Your sexual fetish has left you in a state of moral ambivalence. Instead of judging with your mind, you judge with your dick. If you had low testosterone, you might view the situation differently.<br><br>Women know importing tens of thousands of inbred rapists is a bad idea on a logical level but seldom do women use logic when making decisions as I&#039;m sure you all know. On the surface they will condemn any rape, but in their heart they don&#039;t give a shit about the victim. They think about the rape and self-insert, to feel warm and cuddly for one quick moment at the thought of being ravaged by a hairy, villainous sultan. It feels good, feels feminine.

But you&#039;re not in despair. In fact, despite the circumstances, you&#039;re supremely energised; and in the warm air of the oncoming Prussian summer, you&#039;re beaming with expectant hope. <br><br>Because you&#039;re part of a movement that&#039;s going to reinvigorate your nation. Reshape it, and mould it into something far beyond the imaginations of your progenitors. There&#039;s a man, the future architect and general of this greater Germany, named Adolf Hitler. Upon him rests the hopes of an entire generation, an entire civilisation. You can already tell that he&#039;s a creature built from the same mould as the Alexanders, the Napoleons, and the Caesars of history, and under his banner you walk, hand-in-hand with comrades - the finest men you&#039;ve ever known - who share your innermost convictions, and of whom you&#039;re proud to call yourself a friend.<br><br>Things are moving so fast. The people, the media, and the government are quickly waking up to stupefying fact of your assent. Things previously thought only the private whispers of a few learned men are now sprawling public debates, you can see the scales falling from their eyes. At this pivotal moment, you&#039;re all the more hyped to spring into action, to win this first victory for your people...<br><br>My God son - you&#039;ve won! The beginning of the best hour of Germany has finally come! You&#039;ve never felt more elated, more validated than in this moment. You helped achieve this. Surely this is the role you were born to play. Dreams are steadily manifesting: then distant hopes, now grand plans. Upon the Reichstag waves the flag of your party.","filename":"hitler-youth-rally","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":597,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":186,"tim":1490418134437,"time":1490418134,"md5":"zNxyjyNrJeV3asC5yYcZVw==","fsize":146076,"resto":0,"id":"K8NZjw8C","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"imagine-being-a-german-youth-in-the-early-20th","country_name":"Australia","replies":8,"images":5,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":1},{"no":118189586,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:15:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118189374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118189374<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rightful European government<\/span>","filename":"portrait_of_wilhelm_ii_by_kraljaleksandar-d2zu65g","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":1068,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490418944936,"time":1490418944,"md5":"hxj9Yq2+6L8LPyMtSESJrQ==","fsize":206104,"resto":118188455,"id":"K8NZjw8C","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118189735,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:17:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118189586\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118189586<\/a>","filename":"Bundesarchiv_Bild_146-1976-127-06A,_Karl_D\u00f6nitz_-_crop","ext":".jpg","w":288,"h":403,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490419057906,"time":1490419057,"md5":"ELyBLw\/QKothWojcduNBrg==","fsize":61096,"resto":118188455,"id":"q\/OnsfQq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118190157,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:22:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;be norwegian american<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;great grandpapa volunteered to join the SS<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;do the K-12 being taught that my family has a special place in hell<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;find \/pol\/ after<\/span><br>And all for what?<br><br><br>That question still gets me...","time":1490419337,"resto":118188455,"id":"RbydoCB7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118191203,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:35:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"bUMP!!!!!!!!!!!!","filename":"nazi-cuteboys","ext":".jpg","w":405,"h":560,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490420133114,"time":1490420133,"md5":"TooLQv3gXa0CrV0TaqQ12A==","fsize":104082,"resto":118188455,"id":"K8NZjw8C","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118193226,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:59:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118191203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118191203<\/a><br>Kill yourself, kikescum.","time":1490421557,"resto":118188455,"id":"WoSiFEY\/","country":"DO","country_name":"Dominican Republic"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118192730,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:53:24","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Would you trust a Jew?","com":"Would you trust this man?","filename":"IMG_1954","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":960,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490421204794,"time":1490421204,"md5":"+wAQVs6\/UiwZnT950MPGWA==","fsize":411999,"resto":0,"id":"02t9Z1HP","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"would-you-trust-a-jew","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":3},{"no":118192905,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:55:38","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Yotsuba_Says_NO_by_Pardner","ext":".jpg","w":818,"h":479,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":73,"tim":1490421338025,"time":1490421338,"md5":"18YkZnaEn\/S90jZrQvhspA==","fsize":109997,"resto":118192730,"id":"Y9WYs2k+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118193036,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:57:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"would you trust.... orangutan?","filename":"take orangu hand or u die","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1067,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490421436612,"time":1490421436,"md5":"8un39ZIG8+WbiUGLncynTQ==","fsize":307703,"resto":118192730,"id":"mAjwkD+k","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118193073,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:57:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118192905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118192905<\/a><br>Why not though?<br>What if he is not a Jew?","time":1490421460,"resto":118192730,"id":"02t9Z1HP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118193161,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:58:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118192730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118192730<\/a><br>would you trust a muzzie?","time":1490421515,"resto":118192730,"id":"1\/u5nEWk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118193225,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:59:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118193073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118193073<\/a><br>i would not trust anyone.... doesnt matter if they are a jew.... but if they were an orangutan.... thats a different story...","filename":"trust orangutan","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":450,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490421555961,"time":1490421555,"md5":"z9xz+1HK8t8IT4uQIP0MIw==","fsize":179607,"resto":118192730,"id":"mAjwkD+k","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118170253,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:07:09","name":"Anonymous","sub":"US &#039;NATIONALISTS&#039;

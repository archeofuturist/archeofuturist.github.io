Source intended it as so to experience duality in various spectra. <br><br>Excluding evil seems to me to be of the new age variety of &quot;just think nice thoughts and all will be well&quot;. This is clearly not so. Evil must die screaming I say. The murderous impulses that man has are for this purpose alone. To kill evil is righteous when done in self defense. Humanity has often misunderstood its impulses to kill as an evolutionary defense mechanism purely against predators. But I believe it has a higher function. Anything can be transmuted into it&#039;s lighter and higher variety, including the occasional impulses to harm in humanity. <br><br>While it is true we can never fully kill evil off, we can certainly minimize its effects. These pre adamites for example. They believe themselves superior, yet where is their civilization? Why are they fallen and not thriving in their own worlds? <br><br>Clearly the axioms of their belief systems were erroneous, as falsity leads to chaos and destructive action. Is evil necessary? Sure, it gives meaning to the good. But to exclude evil is to transcend it by removing its influences on humanity. True humanity, meaning the whites. <br><br>It is our destiny to exterminate the fallen. Slaughtering them shall hone our senses and intelligence, but we shall do so in the spirit of peace and higher minded compassion. After all, they kidnap and rape and eat our children. It is merely self defense that they must end. By our wills, it shall be done. And if it so happens that we die in the pursuit of cleansing evil, we shall die honorably and tend towards source. Our greatest challenge now shall be to kill without the desire to murder. A seeming contradiction, but I believe to see moments as expressions in consciousness as opposed to time, we can forgive ourselves of the killing that must be done of the fallen freaks. Overcoming their higher IQ&#039;s and armies of subservient fools shall be a wonderful test of spirit and will.","filename":"ArchangelMichael","ext":".jpg","w":715,"h":881,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490736315781,"time":1490736315,"md5":"tmIhOEqJSAmAv54pebN0gg==","fsize":99933,"resto":118681182,"id":"vddyAssL","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118698944,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)17:26:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118698599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118698599<\/a><br>That is the basis of hermeticism.

I did a first sum-up here ( <a href=\"#p118695573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118695573<\/a> ), but I really advice you to read his &quot;principles of philosophy of right &quot; with some help like little courses on the subject to understand the main idea of dialectics according to Hegel. <br><br>Marx use Hegel&#039;s dialectic in a non-spiritual and materialist way, that is to try to prove that the movement of history wasn&#039;t the movement of some hypothetical Spirit but of the concrete struggle of classes, he isn&#039;t a theorician of the Revolution, he right really few about how and when the revolution should happen, what he did was more a analysis of history as an eternal struggle of classes, the &quot;Manifesto&quot; vulgarize it and &quot;the Capital&quot; go much further in details, it&#039;s in it that you will find precise analysis about social phenomenas and sub-classes like the lumpenproletariat. <br><br>Lenin and Engels, on the contrary were theoricians of the Revolution and tried to see how you can apply the materialist dialectic and how it is possible to provoke a communist revolution. Read &quot; The State and the revolution &quot; to see how you manage to &quot; make the society communist&quot;, also another interesting read is the commentary he does on the The Science of Logic&quot;. You can read Hegel &quot; Science of Logic &quot; that is a more metaphysical and logical expression of his dialectic than the philosophy of the right, and then read the commentary of Lenin to understand well the differences between Idealist dialectic and materialist one, as well as the common points between the two. ( https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/cons-logic\/ch01.htm#<wbr>LCW38_103 ). <br><br>I wish to clarify though that I&#039;m not a commie, but not for economical reasons but for philosophical ones.

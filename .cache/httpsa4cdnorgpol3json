This light is invisible to the human eye, but visible to most camera sensors, and is transmitted through certain clothing, particularly dark colored and thin cotton and polyester like ANTIFA\u2019s bandanas. Some of you might remember a bunch of \u201cnews reports\u201d about a Sony video camera that could \u201cx-ray\u201d clothes \u2013 this is the effect we are talking about. Now, there are two steps to making one of these at home: 1) remove the IR filter on the camera, and 2) filtering the visible light so that the IR dominates the image.<br><br>For the first, I recommend this tutorial: [spoiler]<br><br>https:\/[\/spoiler]\/www.youtube.com\/w<wbr>atch?v=mUtoLBOego4<br><br>It uses a ~$60 &quot;action camera&quot; clone of the gopro which should have good mounting options for your protest gear.<br><br>Next, reassemble the camera and glue this: https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00XU8SHE<wbr>0\/ref=twister_B01DA1ASWU?_encoding=<wbr>UTF8&amp;psc=1#customerReviews over the lens, as close as you can get it to the lens housing. <br><br>There you go.

More importantly, antifa won&#039;t know if their masks are protecting them or not. As we saw at Auburn, unmasking them sends them running immediately. I think the psychological aspect may be more potent than the information gathering.","filename":"op2","ext":".jpg","w":504,"h":297,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":147,"tim":1492836842993,"time":1492836842,"md5":"04+pD+1P170pjYKIja5VbQ==","fsize":16809,"resto":0,"id":"0gFT7nfi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"unmasking-antifa","country_name":"United States","replies":43,"images":12,"omitted_posts":38,"omitted_images":11},{"no":122240430,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)01:21:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122239559\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122239559<\/a><br>There&#039;s only one good black and red flag.","filename":"Bandera","ext":".jpg","w":1788,"h":1118,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492838479504,"time":1492838479,"md5":"ibSjUEHQIsfM378sHFRT0Q==","fsize":875442,"resto":122237908,"id":"0gFT7nfi","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122240620,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)01:23:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122239687\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122239687<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122239931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122239931<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122239989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122239989<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122240242\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122240242<\/a><br>Hahaha sad little drumpfkins.

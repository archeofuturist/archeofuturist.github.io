It&#039;s still the minority and a declining one at that. <br><br>The Pew Research Center&#039;s statistics show that atheism is expected to continue to decline all the way into 2050 with a continued growth of religion. Other research also shows a huge surge in growth for Christianity in China which is currently the world&#039;s most &quot;atheist&quot; nation because of the atheist communist government suppressing religion, the research suggests that China will soon become the world&#039;s most Christian nation within 15 years. <br><br>This is simply history repeating itself: Christianity prospered in Rome back in the ancient era when it was suppressed and it still grew in the militant atheist soviet Russia when it was suppressed there only a century ago with the majority of Russians today now also identifying as Christian. Just goes to show that atheist suppression of religion still doesn&#039;t stop religion.<br><br>Sources for the legion of whiny \/Redditor\/ fedoras that will no doubt show up it this thread:<br><br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2015\/04\/02\/<wbr>religious-projections-2010-2050\/<br>http:\/\/www.pewforum.org\/2012\/12\/18\/<wbr>global-religious-landscape-unaffili<wbr>ated\/<br>http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/wor<wbr>ldnews\/asia\/china\/10776023\/China-on<wbr>-course-to-become-worlds-most-Chris<wbr>tian-nation-within-15-years.html<br>http:\/\/masterrussian.com\/russia\/fac<wbr>ts.htm","filename":"1490138678411","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":201,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491140199105,"time":1491140199,"md5":"gbLQR\/M\/TdWWLU+dYjIA+Q==","fsize":123410,"resto":0,"id":"waZgVutJ","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"atheism-is-the-fastest-shrinking-religion-in-the","country_name":"Poland","replies":5,"images":2},{"no":119199764,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:38:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119199581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119199581<\/a><br>Its not that the developed world is becoming less irreligious its just that africans, arabs and indians breed a lot more you dumb fuck","time":1491140339,"resto":119199581,"id":"VK4b0r3l","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119199965,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:41:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119199581\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119199581<\/a><br>spam faggot<br><br>sage","time":1491140473,"resto":119199581,"id":"IYBX7ClA","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119200056,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:42:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"(You)","filename":"Original","ext":".jpg","w":608,"h":755,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491140534454,"time":1491140534,"md5":"x9N7IPhcEu3nAJFdtnd+Pg==","fsize":134861,"resto":119199581,"id":"MSOrmNDq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119200180,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:43:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sorry atheists but atheism is not on the rise nor is it winning.<\/span><br>Well, thanks for the apology.

Any decent woman can get a man to vote what she wants on special interestd so giving the woman a vote on top of that simply skews the power structure dramatically, and the idea that women have any concept of maintaining or building a lasting society and culture can only be found in the most obscure fiction with no reflection of reality. In that manner, discussion of women in politics is politically relevant and hatred of their interceptions in politics should be considered a universal common ground.","time":1493667752,"resto":123660477,"id":"nDCj0HIl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123661997,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)15:42:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123660477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123660477<\/a><br>Because you want to make everything about you, because you&#039;re so depraved of attention you just have to come and ruin one of the last male dominated heaven.

It will also NEVER result in feelings of regret, because \/Pol\/ knows what Clinton stood for. A huge portion of Trumps support was folks understanding that sending him to congress was a punishment to career politicians who would then have to answer to him. <br><br>Basically, a pure \/Pol\/ack will never preface criticism with &quot;inb4 shill&quot; or &quot;I promise I&#039;m not shilling&quot;, will never utter the phrase &quot;nu\/pol&quot; or accuse others of being blind followers of Trump. <br><br>If you get called a shill and it bothers you, it&#039;s because you&#039;re shilling. If you call someone a shill and they don&#039;t care, it&#039;s because you&#039;re shilling.","time":1493667696,"resto":123656563,"id":"bFJ2v1LE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123661897,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)15:41:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123660436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123660436<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The only war there is is Innocents vs shitskin Assad<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ISIS<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Innocent<\/span><br>You&#039;re a complete fucking brainlet mouth-breathing MONG.","time":1493667717,"resto":123656563,"id":"rDNxOWX\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123662181,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)15:44:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123661897\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123661897<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&#039;I gotta fight ISIS brb gotta gas this village first&quot;<\/span>","time":1493667847,"resto":123656563,"id":"paNUpQQX","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123658708,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)15:17:31","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Canada:Un-cuckening edition","com":"Residents of Cuckada the time has come to grow up and remove kebab. <br><br>You&#039;re a blight upon the anglo-sphere so either make like a tree and leaf, or uncuck yourselves by shilling like you&#039;ve never shilled before for Mad Maxime &#039;&#039;ignite the sodomite&quot; bernier.","filename":"17425922_1867513950187646_26915654891568784_n","ext":".jpg","w":180,"h":180,"tn_w":180,"tn_h":180,"tim":1493666251586,"time":1493666251,"md5":"+Dgnf+E\/KMy+dlZZGRMvfA==","fsize":8845,"resto":0,"id":"XyMzireG","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"canadauncuckening-edition","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":38,"images":15,"omitted_posts":33,"omitted_images":14},{"no":123661971,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)15:42:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123661473\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123661473<\/a><br>Foriegners trying to slip in early before shit hits fan so they have acess to our trees and water","time":1493667751,"resto":123658708,"id":"f2yLuSan","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123662052,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)15:43:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123659536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123659536<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;calls someone else a commie<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wants to prevent free market and free trades<\/span><br><br>you aren&#039;t fooling anyone","filename":"1375066613062","ext":".jpg","w":1067,"h":1600,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493667782761,"time":1493667782,"md5":"vp+OP+CikpmPEj+qiDt+Aw==","fsize":216686,"resto":123658708,"id":"Ka7sFWSi","country":"CA","m_img":1,"country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123662109,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)15:43:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123661748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123661748<\/a><br>You&#039;re voting in favor of 250k shitskins being let into our country per-year.

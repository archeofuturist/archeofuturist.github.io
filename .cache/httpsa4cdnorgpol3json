If you think about this, it&#039;s an indication the majority of male contribution to reproduction, child-rearing, and the family unit is through their social roles.<br><br>But society has been undermining and reducing the value of male social roles for decades. As providers, men are often replaced by the state and by women in the workplace. (This has the unfortunate side effect of making men less attractive as long-term partners to women who earn more than they do.) As hunters and protectors, they&#039;ve been so completely replaced by societal machinery that they&#039;re not needed or allowed to protect by law and they&#039;ve been made unnecessary (by other men, ironically) as hunters. As parents, their importance is denied (to the detriment of their children&#039;s development). As leaders, they&#039;re often assailed for their masculinity as the source of social ills that wouldn&#039;t exist with female leaders. They&#039;re also criticized for their masculinity in a world that increasingly values feminized leaders and leadership skills.<br><br>TL;DR: Men&#039;s value in society and in the family is through social roles that have been diminished or destroyed.

The vast bulk of this place is utter shit, between the racism, fascism, and shitposting. However, every once in a while there will be a truly well thought out post that is above the baseline of crap u always hear. People that post here have no reward for what they are posting, no up votes or any personal gain at all. In a way it is more free than traditional free speech because it isn&#039;t constrained by social norms. In addition it gives a window to see what the peoples opinions are from the ground level. A window into what regular laypeople are thinking when nobody is looking. Its a visceral and real angle you cannot get from thousands of harvard educated journalists, and what comes from it is a combination of fascination and disgust. I think what pol teaches is that politics at the level of the individual is a much more complicated issue than right vs left, but rather a melting pot of ideas.

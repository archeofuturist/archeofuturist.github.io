This light is invisible to the human eye, but visible to most camera sensors, and is transmitted through certain clothing, particularly dark colored and thin cotton and polyester like ANTIFA\u2019s bandanas. Some of you might remember a bunch of \u201cnews reports\u201d about a Sony video camera that could \u201cx-ray\u201d clothes \u2013 this is the effect we are talking about. Now, there are two steps to making one of these at home: 1) remove the IR filter on the camera, and 2) filtering the visible light so that the IR dominates the image.<br><br>For the first, I recommend this tutorial: [spoiler]<br><br>https:\/[\/spoiler]\/www.youtube.com\/w<wbr>atch?v=mUtoLBOego4<br><br>It uses a ~$60 &quot;action camera&quot; clone of the gopro which should have good mounting options for your protest gear.<br><br>Next, reassemble the camera and glue this: https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B00XU8SHE<wbr>0\/ref=twister_B01DA1ASWU?_encoding=<wbr>UTF8&amp;psc=1#customerReviews over the lens, as close as you can get it to the lens housing. <br><br>There you go. For less than $100 you should have a basic infrared camera that can see through some clothing. Here&#039;s a video demo of how it works: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=7UB<wbr>bjwPnW1E <br><br>It&#039;s not perfect, obviously, nor will it unmask every antifa you catch on camera, but it should be able to give our doxsquads more to go on and preserve more evidence for later use. More importantly, antifa won&#039;t know if their masks are protecting them or not. As we saw at Auburn, unmasking them sends them running immediately. I think the psychological aspect may be more potent than the information gathering.","filename":"op2","ext":".jpg","w":504,"h":297,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":147,"tim":1492836842993,"time":1492836842,"md5":"04+pD+1P170pjYKIja5VbQ==","fsize":16809,"resto":0,"id":"0gFT7nfi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"unmasking-antifa","country_name":"United States","replies":98,"images":24,"omitted_posts":93,"omitted_images":23},{"no":122247014,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)02:38:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;everybody has a unique gait when they walk<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;literally each is as unique as a fingerprint<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they all like to get on video and scream at the white male nazi oppressors<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they do this without masks at friendly events<\/span>","filename":"FaceGaitSys","ext":".gif","w":590,"h":158,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":33,"tim":1492843137789,"time":1492843137,"md5":"yWhSsuHB2woQLq\/DUORrlA==","fsize":16293,"resto":122237908,"id":"JReQTVJu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122247188,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)02:40:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; two months later<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; \/pol\/ uses drones with FLIR to drop paintballs on antifa<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; another two months<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; some rich fag out there buys a C-130 and fits it with paintball minigun and bear spray launcher<\/span>","filename":"kaboom","ext":".jpg","w":430,"h":348,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":101,"tim":1492843251660,"time":1492843251,"md5":"Nv1bkCVr3S9Fk3RGp6A\/Tw==","fsize":37252,"resto":122237908,"id":"gpUua24y","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":122247380,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)02:43:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122247188\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122247188<\/a><br>checked and all this because some blue-haired feminists decided to fuck with our video games<br><br>this is truly the optimal timeline","time":1492843383,"resto":122237908,"id":"JReQTVJu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122247485,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)02:44:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122237908\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122237908<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122238071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122238071<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122238096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122238096<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122238325\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122238325<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122238407\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122238407<\/a><br>Two ways i know how to make cheap IR passthrough filters<br>First one is get som old timey camera film, expose it by pullling it out of its roll then go to the store that processes them.

If you were in Alex Jone&#039;s position, wouldn&#039;t you have just stood your ground and told the establishment to fuck off with their lawyers, isn&#039;t the truth more important than the cheap threat of losing money or even if it cost your life. If there was a shred of credibility on something, I would NOT back down from my statements. I am not sure how the statements involved that particular restaurant, but as a rational man reading those emails, I can 100% ensure you that he was speaking in code.","filename":"hqdefault","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490506961328,"time":1490506961,"md5":"AglONhAJoDqsv3EubFwRLQ==","fsize":134094,"resto":0,"id":"3E4QdOu5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"alex-jones-suddenly-backs-down","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":1,"omitted_posts":5,"omitted_images":1},{"no":118329150,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)02:20:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"nice sliding thread","filename":"file","ext":".jpg","w":466,"h":447,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":119,"tim":1490509253144,"time":1490509253,"md5":"szgWwis6rXVsOkRhvt1vwQ==","fsize":72326,"resto":118325864,"id":"3AGQkQA1","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":118329494,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)02:24:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118325864\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118325864<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but the evidence was overwhelming and sincere<\/span><br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH<wbr>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<wbr>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH<wbr>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<wbr>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH<wbr>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<wbr>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH<wbr>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<wbr>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH<wbr>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<wbr>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH<wbr>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<wbr>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH<wbr>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<wbr>HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH<wbr>AHA","time":1490509485,"resto":118325864,"id":"a2wqdzRL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118330502,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)02:37:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118325864\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118325864<\/a><br>Return to 8pol","time":1490510237,"resto":118325864,"id":"tlYHnavA","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118330797,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)02:41:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118328926\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118328926<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118329494\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118329494<\/a><br><br>shill alert. <br><br>but yeah nah the evidence was circumstantial at best<br>for all we know dominos on pasta could&#039;ve been about a weed deal","time":1490510472,"resto":118325864,"id":"+30+NVBl","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118330974,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)02:43:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"nu-\/pol\/ is fucking awful.<br><br>Alex Jones is controlled opposition.

The resulting multi-lens system provides an opportunity to help correct aberration, a condition where lenses fail to bring all wavelengths of color to a single focal point, which in turn may facilitate higher quality imaging from smaller devices, researchers added.<br><br>The researchers developed the 3D lenses by blasting a light-sensitive material onto a glass substrate with a femtosecond laser, which has pulse durations shorter than 100 femtoseconds. The material then absorbed two photons that exposed it and crosslinked polymers within the material. The unexposed material was washed using a solvent, leaving the hardened, crosslinked polymer that will then serve as the optical element.<br><br>The resulting lens\u2019 diameter measures about 120 millionths of a meter, which makes it easily as small as a grain of table salt. The lenses can go from wide to narrow and may provide low to high image resolutions. Each of the lenses has a specific line of sight \u2013 clear at the center, blurry at the sides \u2013 capped by a curvature at the end. This mechanism mimics how the fovea, the small depression in the middle of the retina, collects light, and how the brain connects images from both eyes to come up with a single, distinct picture.","filename":"bre1","ext":".jpg","w":1084,"h":626,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":144,"tim":1490498345935,"time":1490498345,"md5":"XC6zDkcjKPwFMqlYjpudRQ==","fsize":72220,"resto":0,"id":"5bQNx5UM","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-over-niggers-the-jews-won","country_name":"United States","replies":124,"images":28,"omitted_posts":119,"omitted_images":28,"tail_size":50},{"no":118328771,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)02:16:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118328283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118328283<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118328283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118328283<\/a><br>seriously. like the other posters said in the thread what we find out about is like decades behind the real shit. can you imagine what they have? i can&#039;t. it like there are factions in the world that are breakaway civilizations that are way beyond us mere mortals.","time":1490508981,"resto":118312846,"id":"5bQNx5UM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118328991,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)02:19:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118328182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118328182<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118328182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118328182<\/a><br>this isn&#039;t just ambient sensors bro. plus like i said earlier this is finally coming out in major normie friendly publications. i posted it so people can share and redpill friends and family.","time":1490509143,"resto":118312846,"id":"5bQNx5UM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118330182,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)02:33:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118313068\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118313068<\/a><br>Fuck man, why the fuck do we have to cure everything?

Which to me is not a difficult concept to understand, I think the reason why westerners find it so &quot;bizarre&quot; or difficult to accept the genuine racial patriotism motivating the Koreans is that they conceive of DPR Korea as a Marxist-Leninist state, which, officially, it hasn&#039;t been since the 1970s, and in pratical ideological terms, it has never been Marxist-Leninist.<br><br>This superficial mischaracterization as a Marxist-Leninist state, which results from the Soviet aesthetics, brings to mind an &quot;Enlightenment ideology&quot; that is secular, materialist and obsessed with the complexities of economic theory.That&#039;s not at all what&#039;s motivating Korea, it&#039;s more a &quot;king, God and and country&quot; pre-modern sort of mentality. It&#039;s a very spiritual blood-nationalism with glorifies the Korean race, Korean history, Korean language, Korean culture and Korean soil.

That misses the entire point of capitalism -- something they spend a lot of money to get you to miss. <br><br>They don&#039;t act for the public good unless that would be most profitable. Ever. In fact, if they do, they&#039;re poorly run and they likely overestimated the PR boost they&#039;d get from their good deeds.<br><br>Government regulations are required only to keep the market greased and to keep them within societal boundaries. Unfortunately, they get away with a lot that they shouldn&#039;t (corp. inversion, illegal hiring practices, misreported product country of origin, tax shelters) because we have been fooled into thinking they&#039;re being &quot;good&quot; for our benefit on other issues.<br><br>Environmental protection is used as an excuse to move or increase production abroad, far from prying eyes. Same with (some) safety regulations, although OSHA is actually pretty crucial if overbearing. They&#039;ll say higher corporate taxes are a worthy sacrifice, then move abroad and blame those same tax hikes. They&#039;ll make ads preaching acceptance of all people while their board members all live in gated communities. They&#039;ll take a bold stand against The Wall, because they&#039;re a lumber corporation that knows construction material purchases increase as labor costs decrease.<br><br>So yeah, sue fuckin&#039; Jimmy John and make no apologies. Your vote is worthless compared to the votes you can sway with that kind of money. That&#039;s the true game of our democracy, and the more of us that can play even a bit part at that level, the less power these international corporations will have. It&#039;s a zero sum game and the Jews have 95% of the resources on turn one. Playing fair isn&#039;t an option.","filename":"tirawi_daring","ext":".png","w":703,"h":396,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493435479961,"time":1493435479,"md5":"m064rkN+cgBU0NwOfNrKDg==","fsize":549420,"resto":123276281,"id":"gioevxVn","country":"US","country_name":"United

North Korea is a problem in Eastern diplomacy. They have nuclear weapons, but unlike Russia and China, they have demonstrated time and again that they are an unreliable diplomatic partner. We have tried peace, we have tried appeasement, and every time NK spits in our faces. NK is an error, a vestige from the communist era, the last gasp of the Cold War. If they are unwilling to negotiate and curtail their nuclear program, unwilling to stop threatening our cities, then the US will bully them out of their airspace, out of their territorial waters, and cut them off from all trade and outside assistance. We will put them under siege until they collapse, or have a change of heart.

I tried to talk to my parents about cultural marxism tonight and my dad dismissed the whole thing as a conspiracy theory and told me that i spend too much time on the internet. He is a blue collar guy but he genuinely believes in things like &quot;world peace&quot; and &quot;there is only one race.&quot; However, he also stated that America is supposed to be a white, Christian nation. And then he said more hispanics is a good thing because they are Catholics and white people aren&#039;t making children. His contradictions were unsettling. I ended by saying there are videos of former KGB members (Yuri) explaining how to brainwash entire countries, and he used that as ammo to say &quot;well if you believe that then you have to believe that Russia colluded in our election.&quot; He seems so certain about the things he says and i know they are wrong and it sucks that i can&#039;t convince him otherwise. I also find it hard to believe that people that are 55 years old have never heard of Saul Alinsky. <br><br>Have any of you guys had any success in talking to your family about these issues?","filename":"SOY[1]","ext":".jpg","w":488,"h":356,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":182,"tim":1491029153978,"time":1491029153,"md5":"ZTwPm7kXD3n9yAvrybjCqQ==","fsize":37377,"resto":0,"id":"U6ZtBAHV","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpilling-your-family","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":0,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":0},{"no":119158297,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)03:37:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"We&#039;ve successfully redpilled my sister.

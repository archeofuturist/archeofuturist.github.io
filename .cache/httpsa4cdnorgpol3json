We use two complementary approximate-likelihood approaches and a model of human evolution that involves recent population structure, with and without gene flow from an archaic population. Extensive simulation results reject the null model of no admixture and allow us to infer that contemporary African populations contain a small proportion of genetic material (\u22482%) that introgressed \u224835 kya from an archaic population that split from the ancestors of anatomically modern humans \u2248700 kya. Three candidate regions showing deep haplotype divergence, unusual patterns of linkage disequilibrium, and small basal clade size are identified and the distributions of introgressive haplotypes surveyed in a sample of populations from across sub-Saharan Africa. One candidate locus with an unusual segment of DNA that extends for &gt;31 kb on chromosome 4 seems to have introgressed into modern Africans from a now-extinct taxon that may have lived in central Africa. Taken together our results suggest that polymorphisms present in extant populations introgressed via relatively recent interbreeding with hominin forms that diverged from the ancestors of modern humans in the Lower-Middle Pleistocene.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/ar<wbr>ticles\/PMC3174671\/","time":1490184239,"resto":117737678,"id":"q7W8e+Nd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117751623,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)08:05:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117737678\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117737678<\/a><br>Its a jewish conspiracy.","time":1490184300,"resto":117737678,"id":"EGHf7A7h","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":117751844,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)08:08:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117737678\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117737678<\/a><br>No.<br>While the genetics match up, the languages don&#039;t.<br>If the Out of Africa theory is true, the how come Proto languages such as PIE exist?","time":1490184499,"resto":117737678,"id":"oE83TVcG","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117752158,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)08:13:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117747619\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117747619<\/a><br>Quit shifting the goalposts, faggot","time":1490184789,"resto":117737678,"id":"TsLBVJDR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117753294,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)08:29:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117751534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117751534<\/a><br>Okay, so early African humans did interbreed... but they did not interbreed with the same partners as humans in other locations.<br><br>Not less evolved, just worse evolved.

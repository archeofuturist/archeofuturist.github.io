None of the &quot;girlfriends&quot; or exes posted are even legitimate. They ask for kiks, snapchats, etc for &quot;trades&quot;, which are nothing but a scam.

Intel is pretty good about letting employees move around within the company. An opening came up on the Management Engine team, and since I have experience with micro-controllers I figured I&#039;d give it a shot. The interview went great and they wanted me on board, but the final step was to get a security clearance.<br><br>I asked them WTF I need a security clearance for, and they said they couldn&#039;t tell me until I was on the team. Thus began a 3 year trip down the fucking rabbit hole.<br><br>I&#039;m coming forward today because of the news that Trump was spied on. I know exactly how it was done because I spent the last three years adding backdoors into the ME. For those of you that are unaware, the ME is on a separate CPU and cannot be disabled, and it exists at a level below the operating system. Intel has been working with the intelligence community for years to get backdoors into physical hardware so they don&#039;t have to worry about finding OS exploits.

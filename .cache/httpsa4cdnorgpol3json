It seems like such a freedom-killer, but in reality, being a virgin on your wedding night is one of the best ways to ensure that you survive and thrive. I could go on and on, but I think the overarching course of action is to ask: How can we comport ourselves in the world in such a way so that I survive and thrive as an individual, and we survive and thrive as a collective?

The problem is that we have confused our moral values, where we have placed freedom (especially individual freedom) as the highest\/most important value, even to the point of supporting individuals who want to kill themselves. So you get scenarios where any kind of encroachment upon that freedom is seen as the ultimate evil, but the Catholic church (and the non-globalist Jews) always thought that life was the first\/highest value due to the divine spark which animates each and everyone of us. So when it comes to freedom, religious groups always taught that freedom was best understood as &#039;freedom to do what is right&#039; rather than the more shallow &#039;freedom from authority\/rules&#039; etc. <br><br>But the thing about individualism in the West is that we have imbibed copious amounts of Luciferian, rejecting authority in all forms, as we no longer believe that any authority except the individual is legitimate.

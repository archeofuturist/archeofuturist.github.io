THAAD was never actually a kinetic missile hitting a missile system. It is actually a system that comprises of many forms of attack and relies more on having bases in close proximity to the intended targets. It&#039;s why China is so pissed about the one in SK. It&#039;s why China is suddenly so willing to cooperate with us with the norks. Their missiles are now worthless until they can figure out how to get around it and we are showing it off. Why is Trump being so aggressive right now? Because we have first strike capability against just about everyone, we are just not in the best position for a conventional war of that scale and are not in the national mood for pressing the easy mode button.","time":1492319633,"resto":121312573,"id":"0H05UY5w","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121306769,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)23:03:23","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Mex \/pol\/-Javier Duarte","com":"First good news we&#039;ve had in weeks.

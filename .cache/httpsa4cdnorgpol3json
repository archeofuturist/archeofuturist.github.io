No we have all been evolved for our time and place. In fact since the taxonomic category that gives rise to caterpillars existed before mammals one could say they are more evolved than Humans. Same thing goes for blacks, they are more evolved than whites because they split off from Sapiens about 60kya. At that time there were people that probably looked like the Khoi of South African. The blacks whites and everyone else may have split from people who looked like Khoi. <br>Just because the blacks evolved to be faster runners, be more violent, have a shorter conception of the future, and lower IQ averages, that doesn&#039;t.

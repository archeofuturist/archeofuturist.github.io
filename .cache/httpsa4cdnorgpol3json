And here comes the problem - we&#039;re about to get hit by a tsunami of automatization that makes the industrialization (which caused the communist revolution) seem like absolutely irrelevant. A lot of people will be unemployed or on a minimal UBI, which is incredibly unattractive to a female, regardless if they&#039;re funny and outgoing or not.<br><br>The selective process will switch. Suddenly, intelligence will become the single most desired reproductive trait, as the brain rules in a world of automatized manual power. The smart people will get most of the resources, while the dumb will be concentrated into poverty ghettos. Suddenly, females will start caring for resources again. This time, it is the smart guys who they&#039;ll have to seduce, and those smart guys are on average quite nerdy and shut in. Which means that the females will have to appeal to their hobbies, the most prominent of which is video games, and their values, the most prominent of which is being against the artificial outgoing culture (i.e conservative).<br><br>This means that the girls of the following generation will be nothing like the ones of the current. They&#039;d have completely adopted the dominant male nerd culture and would shape their beliefs according to them so they can attract them. The rest of the males will chase after those females, in turn shaping their beliefs according to theirs as intellect is now the selected reproductive trait. Before you even realize what&#039;s happening, the entire generation will be anti-degeneracy conservatives who focus on education and values, and who condemn their parents&#039; degenerate subhuman ways.<br><br>Do not be afraid, all is as it should be.

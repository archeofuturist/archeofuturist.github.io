Interviewing new candidates for a new sales role.<br>.<br>Plenty of good candidates (white\/asian), start asking candidates what sets them apart from others.<br><br>Nigger comes in 15 minutes late, shirt unironed and stinks of BO.<br>Already know I don&#039;t want to hire him, have to go through with interview anyway<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We have seen alot of really strong candidates today, what sets you apart?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Well, you don&#039;t see too many black fella&#039;s in your business meetings do ya?<\/span><br>Taken aback, I ask what does his race have to do with anything and that I want the person with the strongest sales abilities. (We both know this is bullshit)<br>Immediately - he gets on the defensive, saying that it wouldn&#039;t matter if he isn&#039;t the best candidate because we need to hire more Africans. <br>I then thank him for his time and say he would not be the right fit. Leaving in a huff he mutters some typical Fuck whitey nonsense. <br><br>Get call from HR next day saying he filed a complaint and I am having to attend workplace sensitivity training.","filename":"71e","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":581,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":242,"tim":1493170797004,"time":1493170797,"md5":"I6+oZfpZB6UyHtz5KQ3cxw==","fsize":15113,"resto":0,"id":"ujOx+Wcu","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"when-have-you-been-punished-for-showing-your","country_name":"Australia","replies":117,"images":16,"omitted_posts":112,"omitted_images":15,"tail_size":50},{"no":122837553,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:42:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122837387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122837387<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;get off \/pol for 5 minutes and not be such a [...] racist<\/span><br><br>I want David Brock to leave.","filename":"1492914960397","ext":".jpg","w":315,"h":325,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493178126229,"time":1493178126,"md5":"UhuShD+g2wVq8hGKWo+lrw==","fsize":27448,"resto":122822892,"id":"COpQ08UC","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122837603,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:42:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122837017\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122837017<\/a><br>What a bunch of dumbasses, Trump is 1000x better than any 3rd world dictator for sure.","time":1493178160,"resto":122822892,"id":"cFX4B6Vb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122837691,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)23:43:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122828637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122828637<\/a><br>Some of the best people I&#039;ve worked with were black.

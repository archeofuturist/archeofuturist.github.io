Not feeling compelled to lynch us to make a statement about your manhood doesn&#039;t mean that it is rational to try and wedge us into social parity with men who actually make the sacrifice for family. Sodomy and masturbation aren&#039;t hateworthy, but they dont deserve a pass on morality either. Moral code is what keeps a community united in a shared vision, the spirit of law before it becomes one, and law is the comfort that upholds morale.

I live in a country where education is COMPLETELY FREE and COMPLETELY SHIT. While it&#039;s not shit only because it&#039;s free, the biggest contributor to it being shitty is exactly it being free. You see, free education means everyone will have it. NOT BECAUSE they need it or want it, but simply because everyone else gets it and you can&#039;t stay behind. It will lead to MILLIONS of retards with absolutely pointless degrees, to millions of retards who study the same useless shit, just because it&#039;s popular now. If it costs money, you think twice before choosing what to study. If it costs nothing you just pick it and later you beat your head against the wall trying to figure out how gender studies or ecology will feed you. All the universities will receive funds based on how many students they have, which means they will leave no man behind. It becomes a brutal war for students. It means EVERY idiots will be able to get a degree, even if he is too dumb to do so, even if he does nothing, because he means FREE MONEY for the college\/university. Free education is the biggest shit ever. People here say - you need free education because everyone will have a degree and it will be much more of a challenge to keep up. It&#039;s not true. It means everyone has a degree and more than half of these everyone don&#039;t deserve it. Having a debt on the other side is really &quot;motivating&quot; to go search for a job. Maybe the american system where you are milked dry is not that good, but look at the UK. You still pay students loans yet the country helps you a bit. That way their education is decent, while at the same point easier to survive.","time":1492892945,"resto":122303389,"id":"Fr5mRxWj","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122290838,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:52:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"Are catholics even Christian?","filename":"view-christianity-hp","ext":".jpg","w":352,"h":245,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":174,"tim":1492876339688,"time":1492876339,"md5":"6Jiz7HVp5kLBejpJhBgR0A==","fsize":55698,"resto":0,"id":"2ygmArzT","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-catholics-even-christian","country_name":"United States","replies":283,"images":58,"omitted_posts":278,"omitted_images":56,"tail_size":50},{"no":122322522,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)16:25:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122322441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122322441<\/a><br>You cease all work on a Saturday?

He assumed that because of their quick victories over Poland and France that his tactical genius would lead to a clean death to the soviets, and you can see that in his quote about the USSR, stating that it was a rotten house that only needed a good kick to knock it all down. Ironically, he was quite right in that regard but for the wrong reasons. He thought if they just overwhelmed them psychologically and did their blitzkrieg into the russian homeland that they would&#039;ve surrendered, but instead if they had focused entirely on moscow the russian&#039;s strategic command would&#039;ve completely fallen to bits as literally everything ran through moscow.

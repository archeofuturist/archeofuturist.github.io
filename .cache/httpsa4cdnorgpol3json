Several Navy member have been convicted and are currently being prosecuted, including admirals. They were plied with gifts and prostitute parties to award contracts to Glenn Defense, and for a number of years they were able to cover up the corruption and suppress complaints and investigations. An agent in the NCIS was prosecuted for acting as a mole for Fat Leonard (don&#039;t recall at the moment if he has been convicted yet). Other people in NCIS trying to investigate Glenn Defense became aware that something was wrong in their organization.

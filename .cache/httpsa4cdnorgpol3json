Do some unbiased research, well over half of the UN&#039;s time is spent shitting on Israel while all the other country&#039;s in the world combined (including America with it&#039;s drone strikes and North korea with it&#039;s human rights abuses) fall by the wayside. Israel is fucking tiny and isn&#039;t occupying half the world like America, it also isn&#039;t threatening preemptive nuclear warfare like Iran is. There is a reason Trump supports Israel and I suggest all of you swayed by ancient muslim propaganda get it through your thick skulls that you are going to have to side with the jews to win the war against globalists like Soros (yeah, I know he&#039;s jewish, he&#039;s a nazi collaborator, a kapo, and he fucking HATES Israel)","time":1491181633,"resto":119254794,"id":"SW7Pzn81","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119271827,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:09:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119271197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119271197<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;jews have a culture of high achievement<\/span><br>Only because nepotism is a rule for them, once one gets in they do their best to hire the rest of their tribe.<br><br>Also<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;leaf<\/span>","time":1491181756,"resto":119254794,"id":"+F3KsF+K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119272093,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:11:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119271197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119271197<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119271649\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119271649<\/a><br>Thanks for your input, Mr. Goldberg.","filename":"V\u00f6lkisch","ext":".jpg","w":722,"h":1463,"tn_w":61,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491181909668,"time":1491181909,"md5":"\/q5waiKgERBuWGZU8D9jqA==","fsize":349064,"resto":119254794,"id":"hXBD1Nhf","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119272223,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:13:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119260791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119260791<\/a>","filename":"1490369260444","ext":".jpg","w":209,"h":432,"tn_w":60,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491181999515,"time":1491181999,"md5":"oLuSLXQ2I2AIafc+tOVyqQ==","fsize":33166,"resto":119254794,"id":"wfGY70eH","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119272274,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:13:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119271827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119271827<\/a><br>If you want to truly be redpilled about the Jews you have to read some of Kalergi&#039;s work.","time":1491182024,"resto":119254794,"id":"2lG0b2XV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119266040,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)20:10:12","name":"Anonymous","sub":"What am I becoming?","com":"tfw everything you thought was real was a lie and everything you thought was a joke is real.

But catastrophic real world events dont actually affect the price as much as you think it would. Consider this. when really bad news hits, people short in anticipation. This causes the price to fall. The falling price goads buyers into buying which pushes it back up. Rising stock prices scare those shorts into covering their position which is still a buy order and causes it to rise more. Potential buyers see the spiking and buy in themselves forcing more shorts out, which forces it higher. This is known as a short squeeze. And once it&#039;s run out of momentum, people short it back down. That&#039;s just the ebb and flow of the market.

The result of this has largely stunted the personal growth of women all over the west, creating armies of unchecked narcissists holding society hostage with a spear of entitled demands and a shield of their own weaponized fragility.<br><br>Men, meanwhile, have been gradually stripped of their traditional privileges in an attempt to achieve equality, but are still held up to all the old responsibilities and expectations placed on them by the old world. This has made the average male a frightened, apologetic worker bee who pretends to be unaffected to avoid being ridiculed and emasculated by his gynocentric society, but all the while is secretly spiraling into either depression, self-loathing, or societal-focused rage as the world around him both continues to devalue him and yet demand more of him with every passing day.<br><br>You might remember a time when this wasn&#039;t so, and it was nice. It&#039;s only with the past generation that things have gotten this bad. It&#039;s a shame, because they were only the second or so generation to really have the opportunity to spread their wings and step outside of gender norms if that was really what they wanted. Society has allowed young females have emotionally and intellectually atrophy to dystopian degrees. The good news is that as bad as things are in other places throughout the west, America does seem to be having a new backlash against social justice and the way it&#039;s taken advantage of our societies as we try to adjust to our relatively newfound equality.

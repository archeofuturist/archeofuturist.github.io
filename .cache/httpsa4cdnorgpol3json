Researchers Report Biological Correlations in Anal Sex Role in Gay Men","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;While a single factor (the elusive \u201cgay gene,\u201d for example) has yet to emerge in the ongoing scientific investigation of what determines sexuality, there are a host of theories. Genetic factors, hormonal factors, immunological factors, and more have been posited as possible biological causes. However, many experts argue that it\u2019s most likely a confluence of factors, as Barbara L. Frankowski and Committee on Adolescence did in a 2004 article in Pediatrics: \u201cSexual orientation probably is not determined by any one factor but by a combination of genetic, hormonal, and environmental influences.\u201d<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Regardless of how wide-ranging these studies are, they tend to have one thing in common: they treat gay men as a monolithic group. But now a research team out of the University of Toronto Mississauga (Ashlyn Swift-Gallant, Lindsay A. Coome, D. Ashley Monks, and Doug P. VanderLaan) has investigated variation within the population of gay men based on their anal-sex roles (that is bottom, or receptive, top, or penetrative, and versatile, or both receptive and penetrative depending on circumstance). The results of two of their studies suggest there very well could be biological subgroups of gay men, which is to say that one\u2019s biological makeup could possibly (and most likely, indirectly) influence whether or not he likes to fuck or get fucked (or both).<\/span><br>http:\/\/jezebel.com\/born-to-bottom-r<wbr>esearchers-report-biological-correl<wbr>ati-1794233584","filename":"1493662662001","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":740,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":154,"tim":1493718353583,"time":1493718353,"md5":"6aZy31WgHB3W6g0MJaURdw==","fsize":80007,"resto":0,"id":"OnT4Vn45","country":"IL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"born-to-bottom-researchers-report-biological","country_name":"Israel","replies":8,"images":1,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":0},{"no":123751526,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:56:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/ar<wbr>ticles\/PMC4478390\/<br><br>This article cites studies made on pedophiles&#039; brains in Dunkelfeld, Germany.

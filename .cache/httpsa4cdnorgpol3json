This remains an open question. The Gottschalls reject some possibilities.

They do toss out a couple of conjectures they consider reasonable. The first is that rapists target women who are particularly fertile based on factors such as beauty and age. The second is that women unconsciously \u201cbroadcast cues about their ovulatory status that men are capable of registering and interpreting.\u201d These hypothetical unconscious cues could be physiological (e.g. body odor, subtle changes in skin tone) or behavioral. To their credit, however, the authors admit that there is little evidence to support their conjectures.<\/span>","filename":"Barbara-Palvin-by-Terry-Richardson-1-1","ext":".jpg","w":1050,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":119,"tim":1492881865701,"time":1492881865,"md5":"PedLup8NNxDxYxKff7zjYg==","fsize":89861,"resto":0,"id":"k\/BaP6Bz","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"women-are-twice-as-likely-to-conceive-as-a-result","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":4,"images":0},{"no":122301478,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:25:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Human Nature<br>March 2003, Volume 14, Issue 1, pp 1\u201320<br><br>Are per-incident rape-pregnancy rates higher than per-incident consensual pregnancy rates?","time":1492881959,"resto":122301278,"id":"k\/BaP6Bz","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122301496,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:26:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122301278\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122301278<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the drumpftard doesn&#039;t know that rape is about power and not about sex<\/span>","time":1492881968,"resto":122301278,"id":"sbXGYlTK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122301809,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:28:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122301478\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122301478<\/a><br>likely<br>a fertile couple can try for months or years to conceive but it seems like every actual rape case ends in pregnancy if the chick isnt on birth control","time":1492882118,"resto":122301278,"id":"hLpMb2JT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122301924,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)13:29:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122301278\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122301278<\/a><br><br>The study doesn&#039;t even define rape.

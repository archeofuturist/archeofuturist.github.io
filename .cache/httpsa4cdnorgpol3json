That said, there&#039;s something all of you don&#039;t quite understand.<br><br>Every time you try to &quot;red pill&quot; a woman about rapefugees by pointing out the fact that they are, in fact, violent rapists, it falls on deaf ears. Why? Women don&#039;t care.<br><br>They don&#039;t care? Nope. This statement probably confuses even the most hardcore of redpilled misogynists, &quot;But women are always going on and on about rape and rape culture!&quot; That&#039;s just an extension of their rape fantasies. You&#039;re probably clued in on female masochism by now but few of you actually realize it seeps into politics. Women use the made-up concept of &quot;rape culture&quot; to talk about their #1 fantasy, rape. It&#039;s like if a guy who you know has a femdom fetish talks about the &quot;epidemic&quot; of women going around kicking guys in the balls and spitting on them. &quot;Yeah OK, Rick. That&#039;s nice, you weird perverted asshole.&quot;<br><br>However, it isn&#039;t subconscious desire to fuck Arab rapists that leads to women&#039;s apathy regarding rapefugees. It&#039;s a lot more subtle. Think about your reaction to hearing about a 12 year old boy who scored with a hot MILF teacher. It&#039;s probably not one of disgust. But you probably condemn male pedophiles all the time. Why? Your sexual fetish has left you in a state of moral ambivalence. Instead of judging with your mind, you judge with your dick. If you had low testosterone, you might view the situation differently.<br><br>Women know importing tens of thousands of inbred rapists is a bad idea on a logical level but seldom do women use logic when making decisions as I&#039;m sure you all know. On the surface they will condemn any rape, but in their heart they don&#039;t give a shit about the victim. They think about the rape and self-insert, to feel warm and cuddly for one quick moment at the thought of being ravaged by a hairy, villainous sultan. It feels good, feels feminine.

I&#039;ve seen them with my own two eyes and I have really not found a reason not to. There&#039;s plenty of things to do, rents are dirt cheap, mortgages are dirt cheap, cost of living is dirt cheap. It&#039;s not the liberal cesspit that California has so desperately tried to become. I identify with the people there more so than I do here in California. I am the weird guy that nobody wants to talk to because my interests include firearms, working on vehicles, outdoorsy stuff, not being a bitch and pursuing intellectual and spiritual wellbeing instead of material excess and shit. I have a couple leads on jobs there and more than enough cash to float me a few months while I look and crash in my brother&#039;s spare room. Basically, I&#039;m looking for things I may have overlooked in my decision making here. I&#039;m particularly interested in responses from zonies about living in the Phoenix area. I&#039;ve lived in the desert before and the heat is not an issue for me, I actually quite enjoy it. What are some of the day to day things that suck about living there?","filename":"6871930-arizona[1]","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492408068875,"time":1492408068,"md5":"8FYuYJemnsCr08x431eQnw==","fsize":1224116,"resto":0,"id":"qeEjXXCy","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpill-me-on-arizona","country_name":"United States","replies":48,"images":8,"omitted_posts":43,"omitted_images":8},{"no":121493886,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)02:56:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121486944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121486944<\/a><br>There is green here but you do have to look for it.","filename":"0-0000001-a-grns-peak-11515-117-a-118-carn","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":426,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492412188538,"time":1492412188,"md5":"+oDasgLyI1eXfnpGi4NPew==","fsize":68366,"resto":121486944,"id":"PW+9XDgM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121493960,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)02:57:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121493382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121493382<\/a><br>hey fuck you dumb sand wigger. i&#039;m american. i will go where i please, if i want land in your desert, i&#039;ll fucking buy some, right next to you. fuck you.","time":1492412236,"resto":121486944,"id":"IYYxnRcl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121494638,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)03:03:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121493960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121493960<\/a>","filename":"databank_tuskenraiders_01_169_f077ade3","ext":".jpg","w":1560,"h":780,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1492412627591,"time":1492412627,"md5":"FX\/mgiN0awv9p6LV594ThA==","fsize":265952,"resto":121486944,"id":"au4v83k3","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121495063,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)03:08:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121494638\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121494638<\/a><br>kek","filename":"1478844908819","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492412918363,"time":1492412918,"md5":"aBhznJpc7n8RLjcit2xjig==","fsize":35348,"resto":121486944,"id":"IYYxnRcl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121495379,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)03:13:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Going to Arizona so you can gargle whiskey in an alley of some shitty coffee shop while strumming a banjo<\/span><br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHA","time":1492413189,"resto":121486944,"id":"xOdidcVX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

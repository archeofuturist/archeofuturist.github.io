Basically everything&#039;s centered around the idea of getting them while they&#039;re young and making them into little lefty clones.<br><br>It&#039;s genius actually, they make a state funded &quot;LGBTQ+ Youth&quot; group that has meetings every week. They get posters put up in schools, get mentioned in the media and loads of other shit that gets their name around. Then they have one big thing, every year they have a massive faggot parade. Naturally young, well meaning, apolitical degenerates go there to be sluts while they&#039;re still able to (it helps that the community is smaller hence lower standards).<br><br>They make a speech or have a free breakfast or some other shit that draws young people without much money and a desire to fuck people their own age to them. Then they invite them to go to the group, an innocent thing in theory and the young degenerate is still thinking with his penis so natuarlly he goes to meet some slutty people he can suck off in a McDonalds bathroom.<br><br>Then they bring in &quot;non-binary&quot; bullshit and convince the poor bastard that all of his insecurities are because he&#039;s actually &quot;non-binary&quot; and that he can be cured of them easily like this. So the kid believes them and starts doing this weird androgynous shit, and people in the normal world naturally make fun of him and joke with him about it. The predatory &quot;Youth Group&quot; then swoops in with a hugbox and tells them that they&#039;re being bullied for who they really are and the only people who really accept him are the people in the group.<br><br>Now they&#039;ve got him isolated from his old life, they&#039;ve got him relying solely on them and they start forcing him to adopt lefty ideals, or else he&#039;ll be rejected and no one else will ever really accept him.<br><br>In less than a year this normal kid has gone from a well meaning citizen who just wants some sex to a lefty puppet.

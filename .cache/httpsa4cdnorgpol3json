Most people here would agree that colleges have become nothing short of Leftist reeducation camps that force political correctness while simultaneously taking all your money. However, while browsing for some exceptions, I may have found one. Prager University is exactly what colleges should be. Instead of giving students just a Leftist point of view with Leftist arguments, they promote freedom of thought.<br><br>Why is this important? Well, Prager University in particular has some pretty Conservative leanings. They go as far as explaining the evils of Socialism, the merits of Capitalism, and the value of free speech and free thought. We have to get behind this as this might be the last chance to keep colleges safe from Communist indoctrination.<br><br>These guys even called out Berkley in particular when describing how most colleges are Leftist education centers with no Conservative views taught at all. Of course this is relevant info since it seems like there are riots and protests every other week at Berkeley. Unfortunately, these guys are in favor of kikes but it&#039;s the best material we&#039;ve got so far at redpilling normies without using Nazi propaganda like usual.<br><br>Anyway, check out their shit and post your opinions.

Be prepared to defend yourselves and others IF FORCED, bring defensive implements IF YOU MUST, but do NOT under ANY circumstances bring weapons.<br>3) Do NOT come dressed like Neo-Nazi stomcunts or tacticool fags. Bring safety\/sporting gear if you have it, but don&#039;t look like you came dressed for a riot.<br>4) Do NOT act like a sperg and call random people niggers or kikes, it&#039;s terrible for our image and may get you suspended if you go to school here.<br>5) Do NOT cause damage to the campus or the downtown area.<br><br>1) DO wear Auburn colors to the rally - dark blue and orange<br>2) DO act civil and composed - there must be a stark contrast between you and the Antifa hooligans<br>3) DO take lots of pics and vids so you can report any Antifa to police\/university.<br>4) DO talk to press about the importance of defending speech, ESPECIALLY unpopular speech, on college campuses.<br>5) DO stay after the rally to help clean up damage caused by Antifa. Bring trashbags for litter, medkits to help with bystander injuries.<br><br>And most importantly, if you are a student or faculty member at Auburn, please stay safe tomorrow.<br><br>War Eagle!","filename":"1492480782159","ext":".gif","w":200,"h":178,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":178,"tim":1492492730032,"time":1492492730,"md5":"DYlk8nDGzegJp15S4JYYNQ==","fsize":11530,"resto":0,"id":"C4wPcPFM","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"richard-spencer-in-auburn-general-defend-your","country_name":"United States","replies":31,"images":11,"omitted_posts":26,"omitted_images":8},{"no":121646866,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:55:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121646732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121646732<\/a><br>Early.

They sought recognition for their trade union and improvements in wages and working conditions. Police Commissioner Edwin Upton Curtis denied that police officers had any right to form a union, much less one affiliated with a larger organization like the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Attempts at reconciliation between the Commissioner and the police officers, particularly on the part of Boston&#039;s Mayor Andrew James Peters, failed.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;During the strike, Boston experienced several nights of lawlessness, although property damage was not extensive. Several thousand members of the State Guard, supported by volunteers, restored order.

The strikers were called &quot;deserters&quot; and &quot;agents of Lenin.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Samuel Gompers of the AFL recognized that the strike was damaging the cause of labor in the public mind and advised the strikers to return to work. Commissioner Curtis refused to re-hire the striking policemen. He was supported by Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, whose rebuke of Gompers earned him a national reputation. The strike proved a setback for labor unions, and the AFL discontinued its attempts to organize police officers for another two decades. Coolidge won the Republican nomination for vice-president of the U.S. in the 1920 presidential election.<\/span>","time":1493730585,"resto":123762171,"id":"KKBLSOP9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123765364,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)09:09:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"everything about him, and Thatcher while we&#039;re at it, should be boxed up and forgotten<br><br>Conservatism became de-industrialization, the importation of cheap labor to benefit the &#039;business that is America!&#039;, vague wishy-washy warmed over egalitarianism, and obedience to Israel.

He was pathetic. I&#039;m not going to listen to you edgelords sperg about this anyways... but RR made the right call economically by focusing on inflation first then unemployment. He brought some respect back to the whitehouse, and most importantly he was a narrative changer for the Russians that the country needed. For many years before Reagan the Republicans had been realigning the country, and Carter was a way to delay that process (Southerner and all as he was). But the process had started with Goldwater and Reagan was the realization of it.<br><br>And yes he did have something to do with the Cold War. In the 1970s both USSR and USA looked weak, faltering, and with the election the Americans seemingly revived themselves with a charismatic leader. The Soviet subjects would look across at America and say &quot;we are failing but they are not.&quot; Reagan&#039;s image, attitude, and policy at the time they came along were critical to the global culture war aspect of the Cold War. His presidency was in THE critical time for the Cold War resolution and you cannot ignore it. Whether this would have occurred without him or not is all speculation and while interesting coffee table conversation, it doesn&#039;t change the fact that he was the President during the time when our biggest and potentially most destructive enemy for many decades was finally defeated.","filename":"IMG_4666","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":604,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493731609300,"time":1493731609,"md5":"uGEB+4YycPPwFM3c5tWufw==","fsize":76760,"resto":123762171,"id":"9ibawT6R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123766870,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)09:28:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123762171\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123762171<\/a><br>he was a tough cookie","time":1493731712,"resto":123762171,"id":"JzKldYBI","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123763425,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)08:45:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Science Professor won&#039;t stop bitching about Trump.<br><br>How can I redpill him or make him shut up?","filename":"56e","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":510,"tn_w":196,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493729121963,"time":1493729121,"md5":"m8hDElsHcdrgqQcPQSdjcw==","fsize":48906,"resto":0,"id":"i77kKOdx","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"science-professor-wont-stop-bitching-about-trump","country_name":"United States","replies":17,"images":3,"omitted_posts":12,"omitted_images":3},{"no":123764480,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)08:58:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"You can&#039;t the old ussr invested way to much in turning these generation of teachers in commie fucks,<br>It even backfired for them cause ussr is gone and the cucks turned marxist globalist instead.<br>And now you are stuck with that crap for a long time,<br>Encourage red pilled ones to teach thats the only solution.","time":1493729917,"resto":123763425,"id":"WuD2M3wc","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":123764510,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)08:58:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123763425\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123763425<\/a><br>You know what you must do anon","filename":"c13d356228e6148f8fbfff5fb6d8de98","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":512,"tn_w":122,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493729936234,"time":1493729936,"md5":"kM11IR0UDX9fpvBHjNC3+A==","fsize":51868,"resto":123763425,"id":"dhtA5Buf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123766613,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)09:25:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"All the other kids with the pumped up kicks","time":1493731529,"resto":123763425,"id":"RBxsOqLK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123766788,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)09:27:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123763425\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123763425<\/a><br>Well Trumps just the kikes bitch so you must not be red pilled.","filename":"1492241292134","ext":".jpg","w":610,"h":759,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493731646782,"time":1493731646,"md5":"OdpoGndJI1kPtZIt82pnJA==","fsize":250257,"resto":123763425,"id":"ay\/4WTQy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123766868,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)09:28:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123763425\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123763425<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How can I redpill him or make him shut up?<\/span><br><br>You are there to get grades to make money.

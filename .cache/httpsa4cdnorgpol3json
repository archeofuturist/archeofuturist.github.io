According to Giuseppe Sergi, the Mediterranean race was the &quot;greatest race of the world&quot; and was singularly responsible for the most accomplished civilisations of ancient times, including those of Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, Greece, Phoenicia, Carthage, and Rome. The Mediterranean race was also a major influence to the outside world in the modern era: Portugal established the first global empire in history, during the 16th century, followed contemporary by Spain, setting both nations in the highest dominion of political and economics powers in Europe.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;C.

Seligman also stated that &quot;it must, I think, be recognised that the Mediterranean race has actually more achievements to its credit than any other race, since it is responsible for by far the greater part of Mediterranean civilisation, certainly before 1000 BC (and probably much later), and so shaped not only the Aegean cultures, but those of Western as well as the greater part of Eastern Mediterranean lands, while the culture of their near relatives, the Hamitic pre-dynastic Egyptians, formed the basis of that of Egypt.&quot;<\/span>","filename":"1434897356718","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":657,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":164,"tim":1490708797203,"time":1490708797,"md5":"evjkl+d+V1SuhuaY4p85Gw==","fsize":197515,"resto":0,"id":"lFfg2lnO","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mediterraneanism","country_name":"Canada","replies":253,"images":73,"omitted_posts":248,"omitted_images":73,"tail_size":50},{"no":118688106,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)15:54:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118652832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118652832<\/a><br>Le mao, Is this like the we wuz version of history revisionism niggers have?","time":1490730882,"resto":118649821,"id":"2fdveJxK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118688280,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)15:56:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118688106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118688106<\/a><br>No, it&#039;s the one Portubro that posts the &quot;nigger dna in Iberia is neolithic&quot; threads.","time":1490730973,"resto":118649821,"id":"ieCIAV59","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118688357,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)15:56:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118687506\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118687506<\/a><br>Don&#039;t mix either don&#039;t ruin your purity","filename":"1483679661488","ext":".jpg","w":1780,"h":1266,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1490731016283,"time":1490731016,"md5":"ils\/QFUE424DolvYsuHpeQ==","fsize":671569,"resto":118649821,"id":"gq5Bi1XG","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118688475,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)15:57:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118688082\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118688082<\/a><br>The rest of the diaspora are doing fine, there are literally 5+ Albanian gangs in one area of Toronto alone.

I&#039;m dead serious when I ask this (although this entire post is of course sarcasm). Been researching quite a bit about alt history recently and began starting to understand the history and origins of the aryan race and indo-european peoples. I thought it was interesting that ISIS is clearly propagandized by its mossad double agent leaders, to exterminate and breed out the Yazidi kurdish women.<br><br>Can&#039;t help but feel like the effort to genocide whites and every trace of white bloodlines is an international endeavour. Which begs the question... once critical mass has been surpassed in europe and the USA, what will happen? As whites become increasingly a minority, they will by necessity develop an ingroup preference which will make it very hard to eliminate the last remaining group. Clearly Amalekites aren&#039;t to be treated nicely though, so... what will they do to us? Will the holoyouknowwhat come back and be used as an excuse to gas whites en masse? <br><br>I get a bit scared when I think about these things... am I the only one? As most of you are aware I&#039;m sure, nonwhites aren&#039;t like us. They won&#039;t go &#039;hey now, I wouldn&#039;t like this done to me so I won&#039;t do it to them this is a barbaric atrocity!&#039;. They most certainly won&#039;t show us mercy, because they know no such thing. Especially not if they are all circumcised and are thus devoid of empathy and intersocial abstraction skills. Plus the media brainwashing is already so unbelievably powerful.

It doesn&#039;t add up. I don&#039;t believe this is real. I am seeing a lot of traits that are similar to the same false flag attacks that have happened in the past here in the United States. <br><br>CRISIS ACTORS- Emergency workers and ACTORS who are hired to act, They are ordered to carry out this charade as a &quot;drill&quot;. They are given money to hush up about it being false, and the media of course, picks it up and promotes this to the public as reality and becomes propaganda to suit the needs of the globalist elite in power. <br><br>Just look at the timing, here we have the UK about to finally leave the European Union, and now this happens???? What&#039;s next?? Another bullshit military campaign in Syria???? This isn&#039;t about Muslims, I know there are a lot of you who dislike Muslims, and you know what?? I don&#039;t particularly care for their culture either, but I certainly don&#039;t think Muslims are terrorists. You people are being fed HATE propaganda , to suit the New World Order&#039;s agenda of keeping the fear of &quot;terrorism&quot; alive. There is no such thing as terrorism. <br><br>These pictures??? I look at an enhanced picture of the so called &quot;attackers&quot; knife and there was absolutely no blood. The girl under the bus, look where she is located, she is located next to the wheel, but how do we not know she is just an actor, laying on the ground where she was strategically placed to appear as if she was hit. Look at the picture I uploaded, the guy has blood on his forehead and next to his lip, how and why??? What is this fake blood???? Is any of this even real??? Or is it just another Freemason influenced False Flag Attack to promote New World Order agenda???? The victims??? Do they have faces?? Names??? I don&#039;t think anyone was stabbed or hurt, I think everything was planted, and then they get the emergency services blaring their sirens over there to make it look like a real event.","filename":"782592","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":445,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":148,"tim":1490242493414,"time":1490242493,"md5":"tn3lkEo9puFTrpuHK+bm8w==","fsize":85946,"resto":0,"id":"yvVZLbLB","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-am-not-buying-this-story","country_name":"United States","replies":42,"images":15,"omitted_posts":37,"omitted_images":13},{"no":117889956,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:56:05","name":"AK47Communist","com":"<a href=\"#p117889795\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117889795<\/a><br>Shit..... how did you know it was me????","filename":"alex_jones","ext":".jpg","w":648,"h":365,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490244965316,"time":1490244965,"md5":"pzqIl3qnMu9PpL0fYlXKHA==","fsize":59614,"resto":117885434,"id":"yvVZLbLB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117890104,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:57:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117888726\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117888726<\/a><br>oh fuck...","time":1490245049,"resto":117885434,"id":"bs3+tcjr","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117890161,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:57:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117889956\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117889956<\/a><br>Well you are acting pretty Jewish","time":1490245079,"resto":117885434,"id":"qw1og9XG","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117890186,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:58:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"Deja vu October 2014 Canada?","time":1490245091,"resto":117885434,"id":"07\/Vc92Y","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117890329,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:59:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117885434\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117885434<\/a><br>This isn&#039;t the unprecedented collapse of steel-frame high rises due to fire.

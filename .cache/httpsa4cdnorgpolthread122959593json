My response is that people would not willingly purchase something that they knew would kill them instantly, and only the first unwitting patron would ever be a victim. You then counter by citing a substance that does not kill instantly, or even remotely NEAR instantly, and state that because they purchase that they would also purchase the instant death drink. &quot;Long term damage&quot; and &quot;Instant death&quot; are absolutely different things, and only someone who literally wants to commit suicide would ever buy and consume something that they knew would cause instant death.<br><br>Your argument is not comparable, and no amount of spamming the word poison will ever change that.","time":1493257802,"resto":122959593,"id":"touhVLwC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122976727,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)21:55:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122969520\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122969520<\/a><br>That was under the heavy-handed Democrat-led regulation regime that you prize so dearly though...","time":1493258139,"resto":122959593,"id":"U9cEGHdy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122976914,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)21:57:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122975664\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122975664<\/a><br><br>Businesses and governments have to different roles.

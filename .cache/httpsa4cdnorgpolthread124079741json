I don&#039;t know what your philsophical and economic worldview Austrian theory, libertarianism.But to make the simplistic argument that Capitalism can be reduced to free voultary exchange or mutual exchange is bais thinking. Capitalism is an economic system that still retains a system of class antagonisms from previous economic systems slavery and feudalism. It&#039;s a system that&#039;s built off the division of classes were one party being capital is in ownership over assets,capital and resources where labor is not so simply by default Capital has superior bargaining power to labor,let alone the inequities within the context of the political economy. So labor for the most part is econmically coerced in to participation within the system (exploitation) to survive how can any system based on that class dynamic be called mutual exchange or voluntary it&#039;s euphemistic language in the most.","time":1493917060,"resto":124079741,"id":"mJucdmqm","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":124080063,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)12:59:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124079741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124079741<\/a><br> The nature of capitalism is that the means of production are controlled by the capitalist class (it&#039;s literally in the name), no one is suggesting that whoever makes up this class is rigid and fixed.","time":1493917160,"resto":124079741,"id":"mJucdmqm","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"}]}

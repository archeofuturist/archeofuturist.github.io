I feel like this could make serious national news and perhaps launch a few performance careers.<br><br>Anyway, my real question is &quot;What cause\/purpose&quot; should this parade be dedicated to?&quot; I feel that it should be something political, because it affects everyone and it is always a hot topic.<br><br>Thank you for your consideration.","filename":"parade","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1493022757006,"time":1493022757,"md5":"u\/\/UlN\/yR8w\/yfBMJC+55w==","fsize":308353,"resto":0,"id":"v1bPwQP8","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-i-was-a-bit-curious-about-specific-local-laws","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":7},{"no":122563601,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:34:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"raise awareness of problematically lowered awareness of things we&#039;re unaware of","time":1493022894,"resto":122563448,"id":"7kn9caKR","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122563689,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:35:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Raise awareness for autism because you obviously have it.","time":1493022959,"resto":122563448,"id":"MExDWC9c","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122563717,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:36:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"Obesity","time":1493022993,"resto":122563448,"id":"sXhAhwlv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122563791,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:37:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;that plebbit spacing<\/span><br><br>just stop, please, stop.","time":1493023064,"resto":122563448,"id":"ZsiEv\/xw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122563837,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:38:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122563448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122563448<\/a><br>celebrate the crusades my man","time":1493023099,"resto":122563448,"id":"QLmnO4Na","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122565676,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)05:05:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122563448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122563448<\/a><br>siens","time":1493024753,"resto":122563448,"id":"7MxNJOvR","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

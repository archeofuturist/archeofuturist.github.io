Ancient Rome may have been warmer than now. The trails cut into the rock by Hannibal to move his army over the alps are likely still covered up by glaciers. Romans regularly practiced wine growing in Britain. The Dark Ages may have been a cold period. This was followed by the Medieval Warm period where wine growing was again practiced in Britain. Then came the Little Ice Age, spanning from roughly the Renaissance to Napoleon. Since roughly 1750 the climate has been in a constant state of warming.<br><br>Climate scientists use 1750 as a baseline for carbon in the atmosphere before the Industrial Revolution. Climate Change Environmentalists see that temperature rise from 1750 to now correlates with industrialization and carbon output. So they seek to lower carbon output to 1750s levels to stop warming. Politicians have convinced them that only their governmental power can effect the changes they need quickly.<br><br>Skeptics look at the past temperature fluctuations which still have no known cause and can&#039;t possibly have been caused by industrialization as proof that the conventional theory might be wrong. Warming correlation with carbon output does not equal causation. Furthermore, to surrender control over the economy to politicians is highly dangerous. Leftists are being led down a path that leads to an all powerful state when there are perfectly reasonable free market methods that could lower carbon output.","time":1492835425,"resto":122227036,"id":"R20HpKZX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122235738,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:30:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122227036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122227036<\/a><br>She could&#039;ve tried using the funnel at home before trying it in the field.

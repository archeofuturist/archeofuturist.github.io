The US relied heavily on foreign imports because this was before a lot of advances in oil drilling increased our production to where it is today.<br><br>But conflicts in the Middle East being over oil doesnt make sense, because we never took the oil or any other valuable resource from Iraq or Afghanistan. We could&#039;ve have easily tripled our invasion force, installed puppet states that crushed resistance, and gave US companies choice access to Iraq\/Afghanistan resources, but instead we installed half assed democracies and fucked everything up. If the Jews\/Corporations were behind the wars, they would have cut their losses a decade ago. We&#039;re producing more oil now than we could have taken from Iraq.<br><br>It&#039;s just that anti war people are usually leftists, and making the wars about evil corporations and oil ticks a lot of boxes for them.","time":1493275311,"resto":123004484,"id":"1OcqHCZ7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123006232,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)02:42:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123006063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123006063<\/a><br>Why don&#039;t you read a book?","time":1493275333,"resto":123004484,"id":"H+N7E+YQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123006317,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)02:43:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123006232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123006232<\/a><br>because I&#039;m illiterate","time":1493275403,"resto":123004484,"id":"0wCERuvH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123006324,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)02:43:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Oilfags are the small brain in that meme.

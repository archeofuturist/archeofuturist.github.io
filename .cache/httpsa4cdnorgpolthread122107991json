There are proven cases of this where russian provocateurs have successfully provoked our local russkies to riots and such. Then there was an ACTUAL russian hacker attack against estonian government servers around 2008-9. Then there&#039;s also the fact that many local russians consume russian media not ours, and russian media often spins cancerous stories about how balts are evil fascist nazi german-loving cunts who are one step away from gassing all the local russians and spinning fake news about how estonians supposedly opress russian minorities all the time.

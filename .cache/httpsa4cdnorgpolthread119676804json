But we also loved Trump for the fact he doesn&#039;t have a set agenda, he won&#039;t blindly follow one path no matter what changes in time around the world.<br>Well guys, this is a game changer, he nor us could&#039;ve predicted this. I&#039;m sure he will make sure Assad had something to do with this before acting, have faith. If Assad really did do this, we should stand with Trump and say the use of chemical weapons on one&#039;s own people is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE. He isn&#039;t here for just us, he is here for the rest of the world too.<br>I saw those clips of children choking to death and i say if Assad did this.. then this great country is coming for him and it will be quick. Trump won&#039;t draw shit out like Obama and we know it.<br>This is his first real big military decision as president. We should support him and see what happens.","filename":"1491436380530","ext":".jpg","w":646,"h":720,"tn_w":112,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491437152032,"time":1491437152,"md5":"k4J0MIP+PIZU76amWhanFg==","fsize":93600,"resto":119676804,"id":"57EsIzpi","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119677164,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)20:08:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119676933\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119676933<\/a><br>Assad has been doing shit like this for years. \/Pol\/fags suddenly feel bad because Trump said so?

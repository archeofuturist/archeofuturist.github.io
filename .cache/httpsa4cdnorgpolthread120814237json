indeed \u2018what the bloody hell is an MSP?\u2019<br>In this letter, I thought I\u2019d address to your rather entertaining phantasy recently written in your local tribune on the peculiarities and the spectacle of having the unforeseeable misfortunate of having to deal with genuine British people in Britain in the rather confusingly termed \u2018British\u2019 Parliament.<br>Now here was I, about to sit back and enjoy a nice cup of decaffeinated coffee mixed with condensed milk and a dash of liquor (you should try it \u2013 the Spanish call it a \u2018Barraquito\u2019), when I was stunned and frozen to the spot by your grassroots hitjob on the hard-working, taxpaying (Tory translation: \u2018benefit-scrounging\u2019), ordinary, red-blooded, blue-skinned, liberty-inclined PEOPLE OF SCOTLANDTM (SNP). <br>Whilst I might often appreciate dozily drafted novella, the type of which are to be expected from open-shirted Brylcreamed cads, on this occasion I did take issue with your article rather dramatically entitled \u2018Arguably the best organised fighting force in Westminster.\u2019 <br>My first impression was that \u2018this poor man has clearly never watched The Lord of the Rings film adaptations, never mind having read Tolkien\u2019, for who could conflate the political might and shrewd effectiveness of The SNP with the ineffectual rabble of the muddied and bloodied orc horde, and, similarly, the Lab\/Lie\/Con establishment coalition of the particularly unawesome.","time":1492036733,"resto":120814237,"id":"cUYOxhD\/","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":120822732,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)18:38:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

Now choose to perish or to learn that the anti-mind is the anti-life.<br><br>Man&#039;s mind is his basic tool of survival. Life is given to him, survival is not. His body is given to him, its sustenance is not. His mind is given to him, its content is not. To remain alive, he must act, and before he can act he must know the nature and purpose of his action. He cannot obtain his food without a knowledge of food and of the way to obtain it. He cannot dig a ditch -- or build a cyclotron -- without a knowledge of his aim and of the means to achieve it. To remain alive, he must think.<br><br>But to think is an act of choice. The key to what you so recklessly call &quot;human nature&quot;, the open secret you live with, yet dread to name, is the fact that man is a being of volitional consciousness. Reason does not work automatically; thinking is not a mechanical process; the connections of logic are not made by instinct. The function of your stomach, lungs or heart is automatic; the function of your mind is not. In any hour and issue of your life, you are free to think or to evade that effort. But you are not free to escape from your nature, from the fact that reason is your means of survival-so that for you, who are a human being, the question &quot;to be or not to be&quot; is the question &quot;to think or not to think.&quot;","time":1492037093,"resto":120814237,"id":"Da2+pf+z","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120823674,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)18:45:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120823205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120823205<\/a><br>Thanks lad.

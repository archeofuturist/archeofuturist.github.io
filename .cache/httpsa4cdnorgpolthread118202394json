I mean far left libertarian (yeah yeah &#039;dude weed lmao&#039; I think people should simply have a say over what chemical they ingest into the body they own). I have even agreed with SJWs several times in the past, but here&#039;s my quandary; I feel that, with the advent of myriad groups literally declaring war on white men in particular but really all white people, it&#039;s time for us white liberals to also go to arms against those who would literally kill us. I have talked with them, and indeed they would. For me this is not about &#039;muh master race&#039; or any of that, it&#039;s about banding together against a common enemy. It seems that blacks, and others, want us dead for real. <br><br>So, I ask you \/pol\/; please extend a fig leaf to leftists like me that we can survive this onslaught.","filename":"Screenshot_2017-03-23-13-53-57","ext":".png","w":1097,"h":895,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":203,"tim":1490428937291,"time":1490428937,"md5":"h79p6PIfc0y1tsaJsesVjw==","fsize":547279,"resto":0,"id":"xmAyGch\/","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-ive-come-to-a-bit-of-a-conclusion-but-first-i","country_name":"United States","replies":22,"images":3,"unique_ips":9},{"no":118202478,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:03:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump for pleading","time":1490429028,"resto":118202394,"id":"xmAyGch\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118202586,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)04:05:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s too late - you&#039;re asking a bunch of stay-at-home autists and social outcasts to partake in a race war.

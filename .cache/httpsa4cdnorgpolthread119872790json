If neither of those happen then trump will get appeased and keep getting more aggressive much like hitler before ww2, if we go to war North Korea will absolutely help the enemy side and then it will be 2 v 1, after that we will probably result to NATO which is like 100 something countries and then Russia will join and it will be Syrian militia\/ISIS\/Regimes, North Korea, and Russia vs. NATO nukes will absolutely be used and we are most likely gonna have the most deaths ever in our history and most likely kill off the planet","time":1491537418,"resto":119872790,"id":"RbSacC89","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

A basic synopsis is that he has literally changed the paradigm of our society with his position on CNN. <br><br>Lets analyze a quote from 2003<br><br>&quot;I think the notion of traditional anchor is fading away, the all-knowing, all-seeing person who speaks from on high ........ I tend to relate more to people on television who are just themselves, for good or for bad, than I do to someone who I believe is putting on some sort of persona.&quot;[1]<br><br>Here he pretty much states how he does not want to be a &quot;normal&quot; fitting in news reporter he wants to be &quot;himself.&quot; Which on the surface doesn&#039;t sound bad at all in fact it sounds appealing to almost everyone. The problem here is that he is literally influencing the state of the entire world with a position like his. He stretches past the veil of a news anchor and wants to be himself and give his own opinions and beliefs on any matter. Breaking the actual reason we have news reporters, to get the news; nowdays its the exact opposite. Any news anchor from any source will no longer just &quot;tell you the news&quot; they will give their opinion which even if you don&#039;t know it will sub-consiously prime your thoughts[2]. Influencing your behavior based off of which news network you are watching; TV&#039;s effect on both Conscious thought and Sub-conscious thought are well documented[3].<br><br>Will continue later...<br><br><br>[1] https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ander<wbr>son_Cooper#Anderson_Cooper_360.C2.B<wbr>0<br>[2] https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Primi<wbr>ng_(psychology)<br>[3] http:\/\/www.psychmechanics.com\/2015\/<wbr>03\/how-tv-influences-your-mind-thro<wbr>ugh.html","filename":"file","ext":".png","w":975,"h":1864,"tn_w":130,"tn_h":249,"tim":1493594504719,"time":1493594504,"md5":"bZeVl\/VbxgVAUktEv\/tzwg==","fsize":291108,"resto":0,"id":"3HPwjkPZ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-the-world-has-changed-as-seem-by-autism-pt-2","trip":"!3.lfr1ulSg","country_name":"United States","replies":20,"images":2,"unique_ips":8},{"no":123543574,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)19:25:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123543136\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123543136<\/a><br>Interesting.<br><br>Really made me think","time":1493594740,"resto":123543136,"id":"dnM4oJ5a","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123544053,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)19:29:46","name":"Autism","com":"<a href=\"#p123543574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123543574<\/a><br>We have arrived on the right.","filename":"file","ext":".png","w":434,"h":248,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":71,"tim":1493594986806,"time":1493594986,"md5":"PPowkLK1EouJrByoxLWyCg==","fsize":66818,"resto":123543136,"id":"3HPwjkPZ","country":"US","trip":"!3.lfr1ulSg","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123544308,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)19:31:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123544053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123544053<\/a><br>Are you sure?

Of course, atrocities and treason have multiplied enormously during the past fifty years, but all that we now have is a vastly greater quantity of the kind of information that was available and should have been conclusive in 1920. The tactics that failed then and failed every year since then are the tactics that are being used today. The most desperate exertions of devoted men and women (some of whom, like the eloquent leader of the 1930\u2019s, Major Pease, and his wife, spent their whole fortunes in the effort and died in poverty) never succeeded in halting even for a moment the enemy\u2019s relentless advance. They did retard that advance, so that now in 1969 we are at the point at which we would otherwise have been in 1945 or 1950. But that point is the end of the road. The net result is total failure.<br><br>It would take several volumes to analyze that failure. It will suffice to note that, first, in war and in politics defensive tactics always fail against a determined and persistent enemy. (If you think there are exceptions, think them over.) Second, even honest and intelligent anti-Communist leaders rightly or wrongly thought it necessary to indulge their followers in the illusions of Nineteenth-Century sentimentality, and to affirm a belief in the very fictions by which the enemy deluded the ignorant and gullible.<br><br>The World Has Changed<br><br>The tactics of 1920 are now an anachronistic absurdity.<br><br>In 1920, the majority of adult Americans believed in Christianity, and so did almost all of the priests and ministers.

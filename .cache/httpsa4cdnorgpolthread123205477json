I would like to talk about Net Neutrality in this thread and the consequences on both sides of the argument. I am a Free Speech purist unless you are calling for violence against a person group of people or business based on Religion Sexual Prefrance Race and etc. That also includes harm to children. Don&#039;t get me wrong sex between two consenting adults is always great if you want to monetize it even better no problem. However this does invite people to use this stance to exploit children and there isn&#039;t in my opinion to stop without stopping all of it.

The removal of it will definitely lead to pay walls for certain websites, data throttling for others. And that sucks for you. But the full impact will go so much father than that. Without net neutrality, ISP&#039;s could literally block access to websites like 4chan that don&#039;t pay a fee if they want. Meaning we could end up in a world where you have to subscribe to multiple ISP&#039;s in order to access the entire internet because website &quot;x&quot; didn&#039;t pay a fee to ISP &quot;y&quot;, but they did pay it to ISP &quot;z&quot;.<br>&quot;Visit 4chan.org, only on Comcast!&quot;<br><br>Then we have to consider political motivations. Imagine when ISP&#039;s begin to use their freedom to push agendas. To intentionally bury opinions they don&#039;t agree with, or push forward ones they do. To hide news. To hide opinion. Then what? You think fake news is a problem now...?<br><br>Net neutrality shouldn&#039;t ever become a partisan issue. It affects literally all of us. I believe in net neutrality because I believe in a free and open internet that promotes competition.

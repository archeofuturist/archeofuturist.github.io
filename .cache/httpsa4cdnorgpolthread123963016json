Amazon ships up here but I recommend Amazon prime otherwise it&#039;ll take like weeks to get your shit, and Amazon prime only guarantees you&#039;ll get it within like a week in most places up here. Groceries are easy to find, but some things are a little pricey (like milk and vegetables). Someone from Jew York or California wouldn&#039;t bat an eye at it, but I&#039;m originally from Indiana so getting up here and having to pay $5 for two gallons of milk hit me like a baseball bat. There isn&#039;t much variety in cuisine, however. I just cook simple meals, usually with venison I&#039;ve hunted myself. If you&#039;re looking to try out new cultures every other day like people in Chicago do, you won&#039;t find that here.<br><br>It&#039;s a simple land, for simple people. You get what you put into it. I make enough money that whenever me or the wife get tired of the weather or want to see something new we just take a vacation somewhere.

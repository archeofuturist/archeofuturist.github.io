They are almost completely under Jewish control, they know it, and the gargle Jewish cum.<br>2.You have the benign left, standard democrats, who are too naive to know they are controlled by Jews.<br>3.You have the conservatives, lazy rich far owners, who feel superior.<br>4.You have the alt-right, the Nazis, who are actually superior.<br>The Jews took control of 1s and 2s, like I said, and they were prepared to take control of 3s as well, although it was hard. And Bill, being pragmatic, accepted this, partly because he was too lazy to fight once he realized 2 were already controlled too, partly because he just wanted ratings and he needed a safe game to fight 1s and 2s. In fact, if you observed, he never even tried to fight 1s, he didn&#039;t have the guts to fight real commies like Sanders. he just fought safe game like Clinton. You could see he was basically allied with the Jews.<br>Meanwhile, 4s were not controlled by the Jews at all, and they were the real danger against 1s. As the danger became real, the Jews decided to discipline their troops, reorganize their effort, and punish somebody as a biblical scapegoat. They didn&#039;t punish their boys 1s because they had no reason, they didn&#039;t punish 2s because those people are too stupid to even know what&#039;s happening, so they punished O&#039;Reilly. And he deserved it. This is what happens when you make business with the Jews. Despite being their partner, Bill got killed. I bet now he&#039;s sorry he joined the club I the first place instead of holding to right-wing values. He should have doubled down on his right-wing views like noble Nazis do, not like a conservaticuck.<br>If this teaches anything, it&#039;s that the Nazis will win against Jews. This is why Jews decided to kill Bill in the first place. They knew he was a lazy traitor who would betray them too.","filename":"Oh+you+think+_5af73092356e4ad975e84668e3115469","ext":".jpg","w":380,"h":295,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":97,"tim":1493100055988,"time":1493100055,"md5":"e+nt4cf4DW0rAzKosEYqkQ==","fsize":34971,"resto":122694777,"id":"JwlMwurR","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":122700971,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)02:01:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122699912\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122699912<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Women nowadays are literally incapable of telling men to &quot;stop&quot; or be straight and poignant.

This is absolutely insane, I had no idea that we would be getting closer to China, as opposed to Russia. But I think that&#039;s based off one issue... Regime change.<br><br>China has been making moves ever since Xi left the U.S., such as canceling imports from North Korea, massing their troops on the boarder in what can only be considered a defensive force, like to keep someone out. But why now? China has decided it is best to work with the United States, as opposed to fighting us at every step like some other people. By all means, China agreed that the situation in North Korea is getting extremely dangerous, and with Kim continuing to push for more nukes, along with seemingly getting crazier by the day. <br><br>Kim&#039;s time is over and both of our nation&#039;s understand this. That&#039;s how we improve relations. Finding common ground. Unfortunately, Russia will not agree to any such terms that involve the removal of Assad...Yet. China is fully on board with us, we just need Russia to come to a common ground which will allow us to get closer. <br><br>Russia has sooooooo much more to gain by working with is. And if Xi can see that, I feel like Putin should be able to as well.","filename":"170407095908-xi-trump-3-exlarge-169","ext":".jpg","w":780,"h":438,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492075792210,"time":1492075792,"md5":"6+BzNkTOaefN5M\/2WkXkqA==","fsize":55056,"resto":0,"id":"QHOEAVRV","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"friendship-with-putin-over-xi-is-best-friend-now","country_name":"United States","replies":27,"images":5,"unique_ips":22},{"no":120891169,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)05:33:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Does Kim even have nukes?","time":1492076005,"resto":120890940,"id":"OpEmF+T+","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120891198,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)05:33:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"And it&#039;s not like we are asking for Russia to surrender Syria for the Kikes or some nonsense.

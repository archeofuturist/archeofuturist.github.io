Instead of $1 for every item of sale, people selling will want more that that so they can buy more from more people.<br><br>All the world&#039;s circulating currencies are fiat money, meaning money has no intrinsic value like the historic gold and silver standards. For example one dollar = .5 oz. of gold or something like that. The reason we abandoned intrinsic money was due to population booms plus the lack of gold and silver quantities, when printing more money to accommodate for the increasing population, money would have become worthless anyway due to the limited amount of commodities as back then money was redeemable for physical gold and silver. If we stayed on commodity money it&#039;d be disastrous, which is why we&#039;ve resorted to fiat currency that&#039;s worthless.","time":1490306443,"resto":117981076,"id":"HfQk8ww7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117990932,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:00:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117987260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117987260<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Outside of poor genetics, your life is the summation of your choices.

Wouldn&#039;t&#039; you think if we all just use de facto valuable fiat money there wouldn&#039;t be any poverty right? The problem is that people want more money to buy more things. The aforementioned example of using $10 to buy steaks goes along with people&#039;s desires and needs, you can&#039;t go to one person to buy everything from, you have to go to numerous different people with different resources whom they all need currency to trade with as well. Because people keep wanting more and more, they&#039;ll need more and more currency in their hands, which may entail less and less spending on their part, such as saving up for a car or a house, the people selling cars and houses will want a lot of currency in exchange so they can pay off their debts or buy food that couldn&#039;t afford before. <br><br>Now I mentioned the quirk of people liking having big numbers. This is where greed comes in as those who amassed the most currency will enjoy having so much to boast about, knowing they can exchange so much money for so many things with ease while others can&#039;t do so very easily. People sell a lot of things for the lowest price people are willing to pay and yet they are trying to sell for the highest amount they can, this is the great contradiction of economics. Those who&#039;ve merchanted their way into amassing much currency will try to maintain as much as possible by buying for the lowest prices and selling for the highest possible, whereas others who stayed with a more minimal approach will also try to buy at the lowest prices and sell at the highest possible which is the ideal relationship. The reason for the contradiction that ruins the ideal relationship is quite simply class. Those who&#039;ve amassed much currency by trading efficiently may employ others for labor as to produce more goods to trade.","time":1490306476,"resto":117981076,"id":"HfQk8ww7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117991036,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:01:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117987483\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117987483<\/a><br>Lol, no","time":1490306492,"resto":117981076,"id":"03U0LO4k","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":117991076,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:01:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117990997\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117990997<\/a><br>Those at the lower rung will sell their labor in exchange for more currency. The problem that arises is the desire for the business to amass as much currency as possible, which may entail paying the workers the lowest possible amount as to maintain more for the business that the owner controls and profits from. Because gold and silver are so limited, the wealth inequality wasn&#039;t as massive historically until the move to fiat currency began, but I&#039;ve already explained why that old system was abandoned due to natural factors. Despite the fact currency itself is de jure worthless and only accepted via law\/social contract for trading, there&#039;s still that quirk and subsequent sense of greed that is inevitably fulfilled by the aforementioned scenarios, perverting the system from its simple fundamental form into something dangerously unequal and ridden by literal sin. People working will not acquire enough currency to trade for necessities because of this. This is why poverty persist to exist despite having literally worthless money that came to be to accommodate the growing population. Simply printing more money and dispersing it amongst the population will only cause the vicious cycle to repeat itself, as that&#039;s what&#039;s already happened when we started fiat currency. <br><br>This is why wealth redistribution measures are necessary, it already exist to a limited extent (I.e. Social Security) for those under certain conditions, but by lowering tax rates for the wealthy, the fact the wealthy aren&#039;t investing most of their money, and the lack of cash flow as a result, the economy is in limbo as wages have stagnated and job growth is piss poor. Most of the rich&#039;s money just sits around as a large number with that wealthy person&#039;s name attached to it. People need to be reminded how worthless money is and how dangerous being greedy overs something so abundant and worthless is only harming society.","time":1490306509,"resto":117981076,"id":"HfQk8ww7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117991116,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:02:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117981076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117981076<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;free<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;free<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;free<\/span><br>Libtards are literally retarded.","time":1490306529,"resto":117981076,"id":"LduX23fp","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":117991151,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:02:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117990997\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117990997<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117991076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117991076<\/a><br><a href=\"#p117990922\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117990922<\/a><br>This is copypasta from an essay I wrote.","time":1490306545,"resto":117981076,"id":"HfQk8ww7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117991487,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:04:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117990697\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117990697<\/a><br>Exactly.

Greed is an awful thing, only tempered by either necessity or teaching. The only thing that fiat currency does is drive classes further away, as it expands the &quot;debt power&quot; gap between lenders and debtors. If a lender only has so much physical to lend out, he has to be wise with who his debtors are, otherwise he just loses money and can only regain as much as repossession allows. Fiat currency allows for stuff such as the subprime mortgage crisis. The govt had to bail out the fucking banks because everybody was defaulting and they can&#039;t run like that. So basically each time fiat currency fails to keep up with what its meant to be, that is debt and credit, we just go deeper and deeper into the money pit. If we still had physical currency, this wouldn&#039;t have happened as it would be an awful gamble because alchemists still haven&#039;t perfected how to turn other elements into gold or other commodities. But, if the banks know they have a bailout option because they&#039;ve become &quot;too big to fail&quot; because of non-physical currency, then who cares? They get all the benefits of whatever they gain from the people, and the govt recaps their losses. Its a self-defeating idea because being &quot;too big to fail&quot; will continue getting bigger and bigger, and the failure of such a system gets bigger and bigger with it. What happens when theres no way to keep the debt system afloat? I&#039;m all ears if you have any solutions to keep fiat currency going indefinitely, because populations only expand as much as the enviroment allows. Thats why deer hunting is a necessity. We removed much of the predator population keeping them in check, and if we didn&#039;t fulfill our position as alpha predator then the populations grow to the point where they have to destory the ecosystem to keep their population.

You want to define scarcity by looking at goods and testing if it can satisfy the needs of the world, and not how it plays a role in the economy and how we need it for future investment. For example let&#039;s say we have enough of X to give everyone on the planet one X, you then say that we have reached post scarcity and that we should redistribute X. But by doing so you&#039;re taking all of that X that could be invested together in improving technology and living standards and reducing it to its lowest common denominator.

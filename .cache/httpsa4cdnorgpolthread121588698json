To stop China from manipulating currency, right? Well, arm-chair opposition says President Trump has reversed his position simply by \u2018not doing something\u2019. However, that opposition doesn\u2019t seem to acknowledge the end-goal of the labeling has been achieved without expending an effort. The doing is unnecessary when merely the threat of the doing changes the behavior of the doer.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; China agrees to the framework of a 100 day outline to assemble the trade way-points for renegotiated bi-lateral trade deals.<\/span><br>What did that action cost Trump?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For the first time ever, China did not support Russia in a U.N. Security Council veto vote surrounding Syria. China abstained.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;China turned around 12 fully loaded cargo ships laden with imported coal from North Korea. 400,000 metric tonnes refused unloading. China begins an embargo against North Korean coal. China begins importing coking coal for steel-making from the U.S. coal mines.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Additionally, in furtherance of economic sanctions \u2013 China halts oil exports to North Korea.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Additionally, in furtherance of political isolation \u2013 China halts direct flights between Beijing, China and Pyongyang, North Korea.<\/span><br>What did that action cost Trump?<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; And in the most stunning seismic shift of geo-political alliances, China says it is now open to discussions of a denuclearized North Korea, meaning getting rid of N-Korean nukes, WITHOUT N-Korea being included in the talks. Hello? China, the United States, Japan, Russia and South Korea discussing how to de-nuke North Korea. (A new Marshal Plan of sorts)<\/span><br>See how this works? What affirmative action did POTUS have to take in order to get China to move toward the position of mutual benefit? None!","filename":"trump-xi-jinping-4","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":595,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":247,"tim":1492466016329,"time":1492466016,"md5":"ksCHmGRl5uBvz\/hugTJPtA==","fsize":97571,"resto":0,"id":"mpCIyds1","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-and-china","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121588933,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)17:55:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121588698\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121588698<\/a><br>nice try bill","filename":"bill mitchell2","ext":".png","w":510,"h":286,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492466122369,"time":1492466122,"md5":"CNJSeu1ujOQDuik5Vb+2Fg==","fsize":66465,"resto":121588698,"id":"5qYweLrM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121589182,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)17:57:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121588933\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121588933<\/a><br>This is why trumps a billionaire and you&#039;re just a troll","time":1492466225,"resto":121588698,"id":"mpCIyds1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121589254,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)17:57:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121588698\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121588698<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;China turned around 12 fully loaded cargo ships laden with imported coal from North Korea. 400,000 metric tonnes refused unloading.

Capitalism has no moral compass and can be harnessed for good and evil, and right now the kikes are doing the latter with it.<br><br>Degeneracy - What better way to create profit than by convincing the population that the best way to live is to spend absurd amounts of money on fleeting frivolous nonsense like alcohol, tattoos, fashion and clubbing. Obscenity and hedonistic sex attracts attention and sells better than modesty and virtue. Why settle down with a family and conserve your wealth when you could be out partying!

Importing hordes of 70iq rapists floods the labor market and drives down wages - the capitalists are perfectly happy with this!<br><br>Crime - With the prison industrial complex soaring and profiting it is easier and more cost effective to just lock people up instead of trying to correct societal ills or quell the toxic cultures that contribute to crime especially when those cultures contribute so well to frivolous consumption.<br><br>You subscribe to a ideology that places materialistic individualistic money-worship above the health of your people and environment. You are a slave to the kikes in the federal reserve, while autisticly screeching about muh freedoms.

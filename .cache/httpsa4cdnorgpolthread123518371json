Be proud of your ethnicity and don&#039;t denigrate other ethnicities. Be a race realist and support peace through strength for all ethnic groups. <br>2. Your attitude will make or break people&#039;s attitude towards you. If you feel insecure and self hating, there&#039;s nothing about you to love. If you are self assured and proud, there&#039;s a lot to love. Don&#039;t let shitposting get to you in real life. It&#039;s ALL banter.<br>3. The best strategy for pro whites in America is not to alienate minorities who would be happy to support you. Not all of us are brainwashed to being anti white. We are here to support you.<br>4. Be more rooted in your daily life. Don&#039;t give in to the transiency all around you. Don&#039;t be scared to have small interactions with everybody, including strangers. Be the person that builds trust rather than creates mistrust.<br>5. Always put yourself first. Your happiness is key to everything else.","time":1493583122,"resto":123518371,"id":"8fMAndb3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Be proud of your ethnicity and don&#039;t denigrate other ethnicities. Be a race realist and support peace through strength for all ethnic groups. <br>2. Your attitude will make or break people&#039;s attitude towards you. If you feel insecure and self hating, there&#039;s nothing about you to love. If you are self assured and proud, there&#039;s a lot to love. Don&#039;t let shitposting get to you in real life. It&#039;s ALL banter.<br>3. The best strategy for pro whites in America is not to alienate minorities who would be happy to support you. Not all of us are brainwashed to being anti white. We are here to support you.<br>4. Be more rooted in your daily life. Don&#039;t give in to the transiency all around you. Don&#039;t be scared to have small interactions with everybody, including strangers. Be the person that builds trust rather than creates mistrust.<br>5. Always put yourself first.

Both financial and emotional support must come your own self. House, clothe, feed and soothe yourself.<br><br>Eliminate and avoid burdens of both people and things.

They all are part of a huge Theocracy and they want one thing. For the 12th Imam to crawl his stinking ass out of a well in Baghdad. To do this they have to create the end time battle. Islam is pissed that the USA citizens elected Donald Trump. He told the world that Islam is not welcome, even though a faggot liberal judge blocked his ban the message was delivered loud and clear. <br>4. Mexicans are a $100 billion dollar a month burden on the American people. They marched on our streets carrying another, their, country&#039;s flag demand what? Resources!

American patriots should thank Commie liberals for using Mexicans to protest, but it sure cost the Mexicans children a free ride from cradle to grave. <br>5. Kneegars. This country has gone down since Intergration. We are laughed at by other developed countries about our test scores. Remove kneegar scores and white Christian Americans score as high as any country.

Be proud of your ethnicity and don&#039;t denigrate other ethnicities. Be a race realist and support peace through strength for all ethnic groups. <br>2. Your attitude will make or break people&#039;s attitude towards you. If you feel insecure and self hating, there&#039;s nothing about you to love. If you are self assured and proud, there&#039;s a lot to love. Don&#039;t let shitposting get to you in real life. It&#039;s ALL banter.<br>3. The best strategy for pro whites in America is not to alienate minorities who would be happy to support you. Not all of us are brainwashed to being anti white. We are here to support you.<br>4. Be more rooted in your daily life. Don&#039;t give in to the transiency all around you. Don&#039;t be scared to have small interactions with everybody, including strangers. Be the person that builds trust rather than creates mistrust.<br>5. Always put yourself first. Your happiness is key to everything else.","time":1493583122,"resto":123518371,"id":"8fMAndb3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123520216,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)16:16:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123518696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123518696<\/a>","filename":"1491186430330","ext":".png","w":846,"h":592,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":87,"tim":1493583360612,"time":1493583360,"md5":"y+OlhASZX5yR1UcZE5M1Ig==","fsize":43290,"resto":123518371,"id":"Q7HMy8Xo","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123520248,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)16:16:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123519727\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123519727<\/a><br>i completely agree with #2. more often than not people will reciprocate towards you what they feel from you. this is huge for anyone trying to expand their networking or even find friends\/girlfriends","time":1493583375,"resto":123518371,"id":"X8g4WuMw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123521274,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)16:23:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123518371\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123518371<\/a><br>1. do some sort of exercise , either weightlifting, bodybuilding or martial arts and get really good at it, being stronger than the average guy could save your life and it really only takes three hours a week<br><br>2. learn the absolute basics of trading stocks as your money will go further in there than in your bank, the vanguard 60% equity is a safe example<br><br>3. be careful who you give your money to, its better to go to three smaller businesses than just getting everything on amazon as you are supporting your community, you may get things on sale or get better advice on stuff<br><br>4. dont go to the trap threads, they suck you in because you are lonely and crave loving attention, but in reality they are awful fucked up people and need to be ignored","time":1493583839,"resto":123518371,"id":"v81L\/UdS","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123522448,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)16:33:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=nqONu<wbr>6wDYaE<br><br>It&#039;s important to sort yourself out.","filename":"IMG_0083","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":350,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":74,"tim":1493584397051,"time":1493584397,"md5":"9kkPVlWbyzHgpdmdZTWplg==","fsize":79655,"resto":123518371,"id":"8fMAndb3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123522581,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)16:34:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Don&#039;t take \/pol\/ too seriously.

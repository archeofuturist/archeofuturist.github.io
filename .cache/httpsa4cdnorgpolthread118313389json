They are as a general rule less intelligent. They have no sense of time, the future in most cases (saving money, taking care of anything that they think won&#039;t get them laid) It readily identifiable when they speak, not the dialect, but even the well spoken Nigra has problems forming sentences especially as it relates to spatial cognizance or time.<br><br>Watermelons - Yes, this is true. Watermelon is native to Africa. So, of course they are going to eat the ever living hell out of. <br><br>Fried Chicken - Both the Scots immigrants, who mostly settled in the South, and the Africans had a tradition of frying chicken. Until the early 1900&#039;s fried chicken was only served on special occasions. So, massa liked ate it on special occasions and the cooks, who were slaves prepared it and saw it as a big deal to get to eat. And, growing up in the South, I know for a fact most people of Scots and African descent like to eat it. Fried chicken is good. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;perpetuated through cartoons.<\/span><br><br>Like most other stereotypes. What&#039;s your point.

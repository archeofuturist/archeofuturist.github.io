Korea for 16 (realllly) long months, 8 years ago. I can tell you this... their military consists of literally, everyone. The overwhelming majority of their military, consists of their normal, everyday citizens. 98% of them, live civilian lives like reservists in the US. They&#039;re trained, but only &quot;report&quot;, about once every quarter, depending on their post assignment. They work several civilian day jobs, go home every night to their shitty houses, shitty food, etc. <br><br>From what I experienced, it would NOT be completely unbelievable to think that there&#039;s something to a potential uprising. Simply because, the majority of the military knows EXACTLY how bad the situation is and has been, under the Kim regimes. It&#039;s not like those that make up the &quot;military&quot;, live a different lifestyle. They&#039;re ALL forced to serve in the military, in some capacity. Most importantly, while the N. Koreans have been brainwashed since birth, the totals of those who risk their lives trying to flee to China\/Russia have significantly increased over the last almost 20 years. This should, at the very least, serve as evidence, that the people are coming around. They are talking to eachother about things their parents and grandparents have never dared to even whisper about. <br><br>In my opinion, while we can&#039;t really confirm this tweet&#039;s legitimate, it would still be very plausible, that those considered divergent in N. Korea, may view the show of visible military strength by China, Japan, S. Korea and the US, as an opportunity to overthrow the regime, knowing they&#039;d have the support. I could see a civil war breaking out between the decreasing yet unwavering, Kim supporters (these are the older soldiers) and the younger N. Koreans, who are the majority, in terms of sheer numbers. <br><br>I&#039;ve been on the fence about why we&#039;ve decided it&#039;s a good time to be over there now. All of the Kim&#039;s have posed blanket, eventually empty threats, for decades, so why now? Maybe there&#039;s more to this...","time":1493739227,"resto":123768382,"id":"5VHezTYx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123779019,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:35:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123769176\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123769176<\/a><br>Rollin","filename":"1490327825629","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":900,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493739347076,"time":1493739347,"md5":"W10QiVpgNyHuWaa9+cVdmg==","fsize":68466,"resto":123768382,"id":"rosoAJkB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123779097,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:36:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123778663\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123778663<\/a>","filename":"Dmitri","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":228,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1493739398027,"time":1493739398,"md5":"HtS\/ZKEJgl36jdNRI4yu7Q==","fsize":9149,"resto":123768382,"id":"LnnbIynA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123779203,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:37:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123777237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123777237<\/a><br>She will be off her head on shrooms and will puke all over your dick and refuse to finish.","time":1493739471,"resto":123768382,"id":"YMaA13ZO","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":123779299,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:38:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123769176\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123769176<\/a><br>Will this specific post be a get ??","time":1493739521,"resto":123768382,"id":"+bq6VhNS","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":123779455,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:40:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123779299\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123779299<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;99<\/span><br>Yes, it will","time":1493739622,"resto":123768382,"id":"Z0Nw1y7j","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123779530,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:41:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123768382\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123768382<\/a><br>based kim don&#039;t need fucking codes for nukes.<br>fuck the soldiers as usual","time":1493739669,"resto":123768382,"id":"X+kFRFS0","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":123779638,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:42:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123768901\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123768901<\/a><br>I don&#039;t want a waifu who&#039;s so starved that they might try to eat my dick after they mistake it for a Ballpark hot dog.","time":1493739739,"resto":123768382,"id":"pOoUZY4+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123779776,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:43:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123773882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123773882<\/a><br>not sure about that, THAAD has at least limited capability against ICMB&#039;s, but when the bus has left the MIRV&#039;s are a tough target.","time":1493739825,"resto":123768382,"id":"+DXmSBA3","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":123779813,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:44:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"this is super fake <br>how would people starve in communism countries <br>THE COUNTRY IS LITEREALLY DISTRIBUTING THE FOOD IN THE FAIREST WAY<br>fucking necon shill OP","time":1493739852,"resto":123768382,"id":"Tci24cJa","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123779858,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:44:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123778818\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123778818<\/a><br>Do you think it will devolve into guerilla style insurgency?","time":1493739885,"resto":123768382,"id":"YMaA13ZO","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":123780104,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:46:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123779813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123779813<\/a><br>Not sure if this is bait...

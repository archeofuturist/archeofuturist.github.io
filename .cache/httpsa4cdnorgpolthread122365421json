It&#039;s all I ever think about. All that thinking has lead too, what I think, is a really good idea of how to awaken a lot of people to the JQ, race realism, European birthrates, mass immigration and how irreversibly damaging it is to our society and culture, how our government and media and blatantly lying to us, ect. <br><br>How many of you were liberals, or just didn&#039;t give two shits about politics or nationalism in general, but now are full 14\/88 and pissed as hell, and all it took was to just be informed on the facts?<br> I know that&#039;s what happened to me, and I honestly believe that is what it&#039;s going to take to make actual change. We have to use our combined efforts to wake the masses, why the hell do you think they shill slide<br>threads 24\/7? So we never actually come together and use our creativity and weaponized autism to spread the truth to normies. I&#039;ll break my plan down into steps to it&#039;s easier to write and read.<br><br>1\/3","filename":"1477087448073s","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":250,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492914409725,"time":1492914409,"md5":"+\/Fr3JPaZHjlET6GG3ZfIQ==","fsize":13716,"resto":0,"id":"N77amfnp","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-every-since-i-was-red-pilled-its-been-driving","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":122365473,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:27:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Step 1. Create a website. On this website we will create a video series that starts off with babys first red pills, and progressively gets into the harder questions. We&#039;re not going to go full 14\/88, but we will definitely name the jew in the later parts. I want to get our best and brightest and make some quality videos so we don&#039;t get dismissed as some hackjob conspiritards.<br>Along with the video series, on the site we will have a list of red pilled reading material, documentaries, including The Greatest Story Never Told, and maybe a whole section dedication to pointing out media propaganda\/lies. We will have a forum on the website but it will require an account access, and to become a member of the site we will vet each request. We can have sub forums for each country that wants to take part, as well as a general.<br><br>Step 2. Create a pamphlet. On the pamphlet we will have lots of leading questions and semi-provocative statements and statistics regarding some of the topics I previously mentioned, that a lot of white people are already thinking. The things written on the pamphlet can&#039;t be bad enough that lefties would cry racism or want to bring it to the news, but just enough to get people thinking and wanting to know more. Pamphlets will be tailored to each country that wants to take part. On the pamphlets will be a link to our website. These pamphlets will only be delivered on foot to houses in all white towns\/neighbourhoods. Since a large majority of \/pol\/ lives in such areas, this won&#039;t be a difficult task. I believe these pamphlets should be hand delivered because it will have a bigger impact on people who read it, and they will take the information more seriously. If we just spammed it online, it&#039;s easier to dismiss and this way <br>no one but those who receive the pamphlet will be aware of what we are doing.<br><br>2\/3","time":1492914433,"resto":122365421,"id":"N77amfnp","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122365523,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)22:27:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"Step 3. Build a support group\/think tank. Once the pamphlets have reached enough people, I really do believe we will get a large response back. All the white people I talk too are absolutely sick of the immigrants, and with our gift of truth we will hopefully awaken people to what&#039;s actually going on. I think we will create quite a network of support, and I believe that this support group that we build will be the catalyst for change in western countries. Most white people are scared to speak out because<br>we&#039;ve been conditioned to act such a way, but I believe if people know of these injustices and that they have a big support group they will be more willing to take action. <br><br>I know this may seem all over the place but the idea has been on my mind for sometime and I finally wanted to post it, please \/pol\/ tell me what you think.<br><br>3\/3","time":1492914460,"resto":122365421,"id":"N77amfnp","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

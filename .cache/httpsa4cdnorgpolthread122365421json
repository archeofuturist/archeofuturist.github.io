Pamphlets will be tailored to each country that wants to take part. On the pamphlets will be a link to our website. These pamphlets will only be delivered on foot to houses in all white towns\/neighbourhoods. Since a large majority of \/pol\/ lives in such areas, this won&#039;t be a difficult task.

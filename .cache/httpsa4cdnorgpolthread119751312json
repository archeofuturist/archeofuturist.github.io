The chemicals are combined either right before the shell is fired, and in some cases the shell itself mixes the chemicals in-flight to form sarin.<br><br>Bombing a sarin storage facility or sarin munitions will not release toxic gas for this reason. The chemicals have to be combined and form the pressurized gas before detonation. This is both a safety feature to make it safer to store it, and also a necessity since sarin has a very short shelf life after the chemicals are combined.<br><br>In Iraq insurgents tried to strap the binary chemicals onto a 155mm shell and use it as an improvised sarin gas IED. The explosion simply scattered the chemicals and an insignificant amount of gas was produced. It did fuck all to the American patrol. The 155mm shell would have been more dangerous on it&#039;s own as a conventional IED.<br><br>If not stored as separate chemicals sarin breaks down and becomes useless within a few months when stored in aluminum canisters. Saddam&#039;s chemical weapons program produced impure sarin with a shelf life of only a few weeks.

I believe the answer is probably spiritual in nature, but I really don&#039;t have the answer. I just know that the globalism we&#039;ve trapped ourselves in now is forcing us to evolve towards an idiocracy and we will likely see another split in the species as a whole if it keeps down this path. There will be a predatory\/opportunistic aspect to this. It has to stop and people need to return back to environments similar to where their normal evolutionary path left off if we want to attain spiritual enlightenment. Ironically, technology may be the practical answer to return to a more normal lifestyle for everyone. It&#039;s just a matter of people accepting some uncomfortable truths and embracing radical changes as an investment for the future.","time":1490766522,"resto":118747514,"id":"mzofNrjl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118753734,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:49:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118753186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118753186<\/a><br>Occam&#039;s razor.

Possible means of annihilation are many,[68] including war, accidental environmental contamination or damage, resource depletion,[69] or poorly designed artificial intelligence. This general theme is explored both in fiction and in scientific hypothesizing.[70] In 1966, Sagan and Shklovskii speculated that technological civilizations will either tend to destroy themselves within a century of developing interstellar communicative capability or master their self-destructive tendencies and survive for billion-year timescales.[71] Self-annihilation may also be viewed in terms of thermodynamics: insofar as life is an ordered system that can sustain itself against the tendency to disorder, the &quot;external transmission&quot; or interstellar communicative phase may be the point at which the system becomes unstable and self-destructs.<\/span>","time":1490766930,"resto":118747514,"id":"tDHjme5V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118754278,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)01:56:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118754009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118754009<\/a><br>I agree but you have to account for all possible visions of a globalist society if you want your answer to stick.

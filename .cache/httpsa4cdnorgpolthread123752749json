The human forces of the Kingdom of God will be outnumbered and surrounded. The Millenial Kingdom is Earth-spanning, so where will the army of Satan come from, and how could they surround the whole Kingdom if the Kingdom encompasses the entire planet?

I told a story to a couple of my neighbors about how when Jesus was 12 years old he created a bird out of clay and blew the breath of life into it, and it turns out that there&#039;s an infancy gospel of thomas that mentions when Jesus was 5 he blew the life into 12 clay birds, the age 5 being a reference to the 5th day of genesis, someone on this board told me about it, and I didn&#039;t know it existed. to this day I still have no clue where I got the story from, but I can only assume it has to do with reading that phrase in the gospel of thomas, and the gospel of Judas.

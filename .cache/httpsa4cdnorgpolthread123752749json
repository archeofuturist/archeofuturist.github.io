The human forces of the Kingdom of God will be outnumbered and surrounded. The Millenial Kingdom is Earth-spanning, so where will the army of Satan come from, and how could they surround the whole Kingdom if the Kingdom encompasses the entire planet?

After all, it is not of this world.<br>With this one verse, you could justify just about anything. Why take care of the poor? The kingdom is not of this world. Etc.<br><br>Besides, if the Church is the pillar and foundation of truth (1 Tim 3:15), this requires an authoritative body to govern. Otherwise you get what we have today: hundreds of thousands of sects all believing contrary things yet claiming to be apart of the same body and the same faith--and all &quot;led by the Holy Spirit.&quot;","time":1493731325,"resto":123752749,"id":"vpfvAD+z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123766448,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)09:23:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123765373\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123765373<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;desire spiritual gifts<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Follow<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;desire<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I do not believe that to be a true gift but instead a babbling brought on by emotionalism<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not unto men, but unto God<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m just going to ignore what the scriptures say, and deny the truth in them for my own fallacious beliefs<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 5I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;LALALALALLA I&#039;M NOT GOING TO LISTEN TO SCRIPTURE BECAUSE MUH CHURCH FATHER<\/span>","time":1493731391,"resto":123752749,"id":"ufmxRbKh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123766567,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)09:24:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123766002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123766002<\/a><br>Do they believe in faith alone for salvation though thats the whole point of prodestantism if you believe in thati its just a cult","time":1493731494,"resto":123752749,"id":"T10SDpwv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123766599,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)09:25:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123765431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123765431<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123765431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123765431<\/a><br>you know, I&#039;ve posted this a couple of times, but I&#039;ll go ahead and post it agian<br> 9 However, as it is written:<br><br>\u201cWhat no eye has seen,<br> what no ear has heard,<br>and what no human mind has conceived\u201d[a]\u2014<br> the things God has prepared for those who love him\u2014<br><br>Gospel of Thomas 17<br>(17) Jesus said: I will give you what no eye has seen and what no ear has heard and what no hand has touched and what has not entered into the heart of man. <br><br>So I&#039;ve been thinking of getting a king cobra, and wearing it around my neck, and thinking its a really good idea to develop a relationship with it so I can ask it to bite into my arm, or place a cup in front of it so that it will willingly yield me its venom, everything you just mentioned is a large part of hindu mythology, and you also didn&#039;t mention that there are no people moving mountains with their faith. I&#039;ve been getting all these incredibly strange ideas and like half the words that come out of my mouth are references to divine scripture. I told a story to a couple of my neighbors about how when Jesus was 12 years old he created a bird out of clay and blew the breath of life into it, and it turns out that there&#039;s an infancy gospel of thomas that mentions when Jesus was 5 he blew the life into 12 clay birds, the age 5 being a reference to the 5th day of genesis, someone on this board told me about it, and I didn&#039;t know it existed. to this day I still have no clue where I got the story from, but I can only assume it has to do with reading that phrase in the gospel of thomas, and the gospel of Judas. Frankly when I see Lord Shiva, I see a Christian.","filename":"SHIVA_01","ext":".jpg","w":648,"h":865,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493731516420,"time":1493731516,"md5":"GTCOaS8vQdL5\/C5uyHny3w==","fsize":627629,"resto":123752749,"id":"ufmxRbKh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123766607,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)09:25:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123752749\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123752749<\/a><br>Saying Abraham&#039;s seed would be like the stars in heaven or the grains of dust on the ground guarantees the end times cannot happen until we conquer the galaxy or devolve into literal mole sized people.<br><br>Not for millions of years.","time":1493731524,"resto":123752749,"id":"QhxzanqT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123766707,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)09:26:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123766567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123766567<\/a><br>Dont believe in that i ment","time":1493731595,"resto":123752749,"id":"T10SDpwv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123766938,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)09:29:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123766448\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123766448<\/a><br>I don&#039;t go to seminars to learn how to speak in tongues, which Pentecostals do offer.

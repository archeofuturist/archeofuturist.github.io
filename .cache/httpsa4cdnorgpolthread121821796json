Both IQs and birth rates are equally important for the success of society. If you interbreed a controlled group of individuals with desired traits, the desired traits get stronger but so do their weakness like inheritable diseases. Also if the high IQ society continually shrinks because of low birth rates then they&#039;ll either have to rely on immigration where diversity will happen natural or they will get dominated by a large dumber population via attrition.

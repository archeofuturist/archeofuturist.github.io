though i understand the failure of healthcare from democrat obstructionist, the republicans have been terrible at getting that word out.<br><br>then you get the pissy republicans who will gladly eat their own party. they did it in 1992 and gave us clinton. they did it in 2012 by not going out to vote for romney. even though romney was horrible, he was still better than king obama.<br><br>look at AZ recent election. trump barely won maricopa count with only 2%. 2012? 2008? 2004? 2000? bush - mccain - romney all won it by 10%+. you don&#039;t win AZ without winning maricopa county. republicans there turned their back against trump and not only trump, but they VOTED OUT sheriff joe and replaced him WITH A FUCKING DEMOCRAT who just closed tent city. they also voted out the republican who was the county recorder for OVER 20 years and replaced them with a DEMOCRAT who has vowed to increase voter booths in minority (MEXICAN) areas. <br><br>AZ is going purple because of last election due to the fucking idiotic #nevertrumpers in the republican wing. they will gladly cost the senate to stick it to trump.<br><br>so yeah, 2018, republicans have a high chance loosing both the house and senate

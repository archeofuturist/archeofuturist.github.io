There are a lot of fetid manchildren who cling to it as scripture because, torn from one existential identity, they flee to another, clinging to it as to a sinking ship in the sea of their own formless personality. This doesn&#039;t mean atheism stops being true because of them, though. It just means don&#039;t be such a huge piece of shit about it.<br><br>I deeply admire Hitchens and his works, but one thing I&#039;m finding myself examining with more scrutiny lately is the idea of religion making people act better and the plausibility of an atheistic society. I do believe, as he stated, that morality has long predated religion, and that someday we might indeed see a highly functioning, stable society based on moral precepts that aren&#039;t dependant on any underlying doctrine, but I&#039;m starting to think it&#039;s not something we&#039;re going to see anytime soon. The pessimist in me has been growing over the past decade and I&#039;m reaching the conclusion, arrogant as it might be, that the majority of humanity is still too stupid, barbaric, or corrupt to be trusted with looking after themselves without the yoke of religion to keep them in tow.<br><br>As someone who respects and desires free thought, it feels abhorrent, downright conspiratorial even, to suggest that we may need to keep Christianity around a while longer merely as a tool to fight leftist moral degeneracy and the savagery of Islam. Yet I find myself forced more and more to this conclusion when I see the horrors &quot;progressive liberalism&quot; has wrought on the minds of the youth. Perhaps it&#039;s beyond us all to consider, maybe every age contemplates these problems and thinks theirs is surely the last, maybe the next generation will cause the pendulum will swing back once again to correct itself, as we&#039;ve survived this long, but I still can&#039;t help but think that we live in a time right now that everything we know and believe in as civilization is teetering on a precipice above total disaster.","time":1491391149,"resto":119591343,"id":"LxaH7P9F","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":119596820,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)07:25:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119591343\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119591343<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119591464\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119591464<\/a><br>I&#039;m a fan of his and probably always will be.

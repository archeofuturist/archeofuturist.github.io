Shun the &#039;transcendent&#039; and all who invite you to subordinate or annihilate yourself. Distrust compassion; prefer dignity for yourself and others. Don&#039;t be afraid to be thought arrogant or selfish. Picture all experts as if they were mammals. Never be a spectator of unfairness or stupidity. Seek out argument and disputation for their own sake; the grave will supply plenty of time for silence. Suspect your own motives, and all excuses.

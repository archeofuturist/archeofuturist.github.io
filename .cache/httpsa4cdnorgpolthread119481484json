We don&#039;t hate individual English people, but we hate them as a collective, or rather we hate their institutions. They have very little culture of their own, so they&#039;ve made a living out of destroying the cultures of others. They&#039;re a lot like the Vikings in that regard - warlike primitives. The working classes are the worst. At no point have they benefitted from empire, and yet they&#039;re it&#039;s most ardent cheerleaders. Regardless of whether Brexit is a good thing or not, the Tories will use it as an opportunity to rape the working classes and improve their own lots, and the English working classes will celebrate their own poverty with renditions of Rule Britannia.<br>The English and the Germans are the most conformist societies in the western world. This can be used to foster a strong cultural identity and nation state, but is invariably used to lead the working classes up the garden path. They have the worst social safety net in the developed world, including pension provision. Their public services are awful, but their public servants are heralded as heroes. They call May &quot;Mummy&quot; now, when any neutral can see she&#039;s inept and out of her depth. This is the woman who presided over years of mass immigration and calls herself a feminist and a Conservative at the same time. A woman who controlled the prisons budget when they started farming out security to private contractors - the main beneficiary was G4S, run by one Phillip May i.e. her husband. And they call her Mummy. This exemplifies the English hive mind perfectly. Their feats of cognitive dissonance are unparalleled anywhere else in the world.<br>Plus they think they can conquer Europe with a 60,000 strong Dads army and a dozen destroyers. I know you other anons think they&#039;re being satirical, but they&#039;re not. They genuinely think this.

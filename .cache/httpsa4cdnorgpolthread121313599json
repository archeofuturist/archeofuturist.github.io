The only rules are you can&#039;t conspire to split prize money and you can&#039;t physically assault someone. Everything else is fair game.<br><br>Survivor is a game where the laws and structures of society are stripped away, nobody is protected regardless of age, sex, social status or any other classification. They are out there with nothing but their own strengths and weaknesses and they have to use whatever advantage they can to scrape ahead. It&#039;s a game that not only allows but encourages anti-social behavior. Players have to build relationships with people and lie to their face while stabbing them in the back. It&#039;s an ugly game for a million dollars.<br><br>What Varner did is 100% OK. He didn&#039;t do anything wrong morally because morals don&#039;t exist in Survivor, and anyone who acts otherwise is a holier-than-thou faggot.<br><br>Who is at fault? There are a few candidates.<br><br>#1 is Jeff Probst, the host. He&#039;s at fault because he directed the scene in a way that made it impossible to edit it out. Had they voted out Varner normally they could have left Zeke&#039;s outing on the cutting room floor. But instead he made a big moment out of eliminating him that needed the outing for cohesive storytelling.<br><br>#2 is CBS. They&#039;re at fault because they broadcasted it. Varner outed Zeke to the five other people they were playing with. CBS outed him to millions.<br><br>#3 is Zeke. He not only worked with producers to make the best story out of it, he signed away all of his rights when he went on the show. The contract players have to sign literally signs away their life. By signing the contract he signed away all rights to privacy. He knew this is something that could happen and he signed up anyway. He outed himself.<br><br>Varner being dragged over the coals and losing his job is crap. He did absolutely nothing wrong, other than sucking at Survivor.","time":1492317256,"resto":121313599,"id":"YAsqdbhH","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121316929,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)00:34:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121313599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121313599<\/a><br>The show is FAKE AND GAY.","time":1492317298,"resto":121313599,"id":"X211mscB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121317018,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)00:35:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121316856\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121316856<\/a><br>Good post, I don&#039;t see why everyone was freaking out.

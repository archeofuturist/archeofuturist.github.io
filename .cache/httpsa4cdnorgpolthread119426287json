Big trouble. <br><br>I&#039;ve been reading the Akashic Records, and we may have a serious, serious situation on our hands. <br><br>Listen, there&#039;s a reason a Jew has never been President. A big reason. Hell, there&#039;s a reason a Catholic has only been President once (and, who are we kidding, Kennedy could hardly be considered a Catholic).<br><br>What does this have to do with &gt;pic related?<br><br>Donald Trump was never supposed to be President. He was supposed to run an improbable campaign and come within a stunningly close margin of defeat. <br><br>Oh well, Trump would go back to his businesses and his billionaire life and have greatly increased his family&#039;s legacy and profile in American High Society. He would have made guest appearances on the new season of Arnold&#039;s Celebrity Apprentice. Heck, Hillary might have even named him and Melania as Ambassadors to Russia as a joke. <br><br>But that&#039;s not where the story ends.<br><br>Who was the Architect (this word is important) of Donald Trump&#039;s improbable campaign? At least, who would be sold as the Architect of the improbable Trump campaign? <br><br>Jared Kushner. Barely 36 years old. Tall. Handsome. I mean, let&#039;s be honest with ourselves, if you put Jared in a lineup of Jews and asked Grandma Luther to pick out the Jew, she ain&#039;t exactly gonna think twice. I mean, fuckin&#039; Thor looks more Jewish than this guy. <br><br>Anyway, Kushner was going to be sold as the hip, good looking, Jew who actually understood the young people and the &quot;alt-right.&quot; They know they need a presence in this new paradigm shift to get control. The Jews could read the writing on the wailing wall as well as anybody that the winds were shifting in a more traditional direction. They know places like 4chan are the harbingers of culture. The &quot;creators,&quot; for lack of a better word. The origins of original ideas. It emerges from this place, the primordial swamp of free thought and humor and debate just as man crawled out of the slime.","filename":"presidentkushner","ext":".jpg","w":901,"h":1200,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491277482129,"time":1491277482,"md5":"c2elSzZ0KUufztCEonquow==","fsize":205281,"resto":0,"id":"Uibl8eqG","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"alert","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

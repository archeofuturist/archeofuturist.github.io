That\u2019s especially true of the sophisticated but fallible models and simulations by which scientists attempt to peer into the climate future. <\/span><br><br>Here\u2019s the translation: Science teaches us that humans have helped cause global warming, but when we try to forecast the extent of the warming and its effects on our lives, the certainty starts to recede. In addition, the activism has gotten ahead of the science. Indeed, Stephens even quotes the New York Times\u2019 own environmental reporter, Andrew Revkin, who has observed that he \u201csaw a widening gap between what scientists had been learning about global warming and what advocates were claiming as they pushed ever harder to pass climate legislation.\u201d","filename":"1492909126688","ext":".png","w":1536,"h":1024,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493762113201,"time":1493762113,"md5":"Vm8GMHPUSalexmGMkxanOw==","fsize":2206291,"resto":123824735,"id":"ls\/j\/u9x","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123825737,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:55:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123824735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123824735<\/a><br>The ice on earth will melt and it will drown us all","time":1493762125,"resto":123824735,"id":"RVfQ\/muh","country":"BA","country_name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"no":123825802,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:55:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123825261\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123825261<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tax<\/span><br><br>nailed it. and a tool the jews use to weaken the west. carbon taxes for example. weedman\/his handlers are hellbent on them here. making the government billions of dollars while simultaneously weakening our last ounce of competitiveness is a win-win for (((them.)))","time":1493762151,"resto":123824735,"id":"1hA4X4MB","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123825882,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)17:56:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123824735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123824735<\/a><br>global climate change is real. <br><br>the climate has not stopped changing for the last million years, why would it stop changing now?<br><br>Do humans affect the climate?

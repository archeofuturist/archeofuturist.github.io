We all want a clean environment, no one refutes that. But if you look at the center of this movement you can see the corruption and money that is being scammed. New technology is good but to say humans have the power to control climate is pretty stupid. What should be the medium temperature be for the earth. No one knows, and the climate cycle is impossible to predict. Every stupid climate model has been wrong. Now the scammers are pushing to model to a 100 years from now because they know we cant refute that model till then.","time":1493763802,"resto":123824735,"id":"FbtDGJNL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123829645,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)18:25:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123824735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123824735<\/a><br>The climate is changing...<br>But that doesn&#039;t mean there&#039;s anything unnatural or devastating going on.<br>Pic related","filename":"graph3","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493763938117,"time":1493763938,"md5":"sYM5aDQyXqHoxl16Ta6FoA==","fsize":235113,"resto":123824735,"id":"7s4MxyNx","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123829765,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)18:26:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123828330\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123828330<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;more photosynthesis therefore creating more o2 as a byproduct?<\/span><br>That&#039;s why the Earth is currently getting greener both in agriculture and in natural foliage.<br>It&#039;s also why the people saying global warming will lead to droughts and more starving people should be laughed at for not understanding basic plant biology.<br>More Co2 means plants need significantly less water to grow.

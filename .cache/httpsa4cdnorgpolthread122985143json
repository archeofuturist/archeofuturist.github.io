Seriously, give me an example where he&#039;s clearly been in the wrong. Reading through liberal hit pieces they don&#039;t actually state any cases of such, they literally just call him a conspiracy theorist, nut job, etc. The only thing most people know about him is the gay frog stuff which was proven to be true, just look up gay bomb or do literally 2 minutes of research into it. <br><br>I would&#039;ve bought that he&#039;s just trying to sell his products except it&#039;s proven that he&#039;s being economically targeted too. Google admitted to trying to censor Infowars, his videos are getting demonetized, and he got taken off AdRoll. It&#039;s not like he&#039;s been doing this his whole career either, he was an investigative journalist who did VHS-level documentaries on some real crazy shit like Waco and Bohemian Grove. <br><br>The notion that he&#039;s &quot;controlled opposition&quot; makes no sense either, he talks about and openly denounces the same shit \/pol\/ does minus the racism. He has the backing of every conservative media figure, he talks to Trump, and he&#039;s red-pilling the masses, why would TPTB want someone running around saying and doing the shit he does? <br><br>I REALLY need someone to convince me he&#039;s a fake because I can&#039;t find anything to prove otherwise, and if he&#039;s crazy then I must be crazy AND gullible.","filename":"541","ext":".jpg","w":623,"h":350,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493262199247,"time":1493262199,"md5":"qj7\/+KqjiaHeH7Ch8Ecj+w==","fsize":34486,"resto":0,"id":"dNxMP\/fc","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-alex-jones-the-real-deal","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":7},{"no":122985722,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:08:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122985143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122985143<\/a><br>Bamp for interest","time":1493262493,"resto":122985143,"id":"U5iCof0r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122985885,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:09:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122985143\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122985143<\/a><br>hes a time warner gatekeeping shill.","time":1493262563,"resto":122985143,"id":"GCQAWzyz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122986306,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:12:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Won&#039;t name the jew.<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/kDngXs0U960","time":1493262767,"resto":122985143,"id":"b7ynSLEb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122987048,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)23:19:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Listen to the entire Joe rogan pod cast.

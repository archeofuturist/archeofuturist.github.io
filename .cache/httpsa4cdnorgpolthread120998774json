Linda was the organizer and the keynote speaker at he Vagina hat march in DC in January.<br>She is a Sharia advocate (whom Feminists ironicaly revere), and a member of the Muslim brotherhood. Her relationship with the left is a prime example of cognitive dissonance.<br>Ms Sarsour, who supports US intervention in Syria, is taking offense at the killing of ISIS, and had been twittering about the &#039;inhumanity&#039; of the bombing, CBS news featured her live-tweets during a story about the MOAB deployment (These seem to be deleted).<br>Will the left be red-pilled just a little when they see the real process and consequences of War, and in extension, a regime change in Syria and the war with Russia that they have been pushing for? Or will they just perform the mental gymnastics required to believe that it&#039;s just &quot;Trump&#039;s madness&quot;?<br> <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nhE<wbr>Hn6e76jg<\/span>","filename":"Sarsour-MOAB","ext":".png","w":478,"h":216,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":112,"tim":1492133962845,"time":1492133962,"md5":"PJRgdyhcZ6UHclAkzEkuqg==","fsize":25006,"resto":0,"id":"KqyGY5p5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"linda-sarsour-losing-her-shit-over-moab","country_name":"United States","replies":33,"images":15,"unique_ips":22},{"no":120999182,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)21:42:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yes, this muslim cunt is actually a terrorist supporter, and the poster-child of feminist &quot;tolerance&quot;.","filename":"sarsour-num1","ext":".jpg","w":719,"h":764,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492134143555,"time":1492134143,"md5":"HtWwk4Gv+rhQxjiizsoxXg==","fsize":55899,"resto":120998774,"id":"KqyGY5p5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120999884,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)21:48:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120999182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120999182<\/a><br><br>She&#039;s got a huge fan in the head of content and character development at Marvel, she retweets her shit to the day.<br><br>pic related","filename":"35","ext":".jpg","w":1177,"h":3705,"tn_w":39,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492134487299,"time":1492134487,"md5":"5a1yJN0LxVJTDxAF0Hr5Sw==","fsize":964618,"resto":120998774,"id":"XheZZgad","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121001139,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)21:57:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"There is little disagreement that feminists are out of step with reality.

On the other side of the world, the brash Manhattan developer was working to get a piece of the massive flows of capital that were fleeing the former Soviet Union in search of stable assets in the West, especially real estate, and seeking partners in New York with ties to the region.<br><br>Their respective ambitions led the two men\u2014along with Trump\u2019s future son-in-law, Jared Kushner\u2014to build a set of close, overlapping relationships in a small world that intersects on Chabad, an international Hasidic movement most people have never heard of.<br><br>Starting in 1999, Putin enlisted two of his closest confidants, the oligarchs Lev Leviev and Roman Abramovich, who would go on to become Chabad\u2019s biggest patrons worldwide, to create the Federation of Jewish Communities of Russia under the leadership of Chabad rabbi Berel Lazar, who would come to be known as \u201cPutin\u2019s rabbi.\u201d<br><br>A few years later, Trump would seek out Russian projects and capital by joining forces with a partnership called Bayrock-Sapir, led by Soviet emigres Tevfik Arif, Felix Sater and Tamir Sapir\u2014who maintain close ties to Chabad.<br><br>Meanwhile, the links between Trump and Chabad kept piling up. In 2007, Trump hosted the wedding of Sapir\u2019s daughter and Leviev\u2019s right-hand man at Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach resort. A few months after the ceremony, Leviev met Trump to discuss potential deals in Moscow and then hosted a bris for the new couple\u2019s first son at the holiest site in Chabad Judaism. Trump attended the bris along with Kushner, who would go on to buy a $300 million building from Leviev and marry Ivanka Trump, who would form a close relationship with Abramovich\u2019s wife, Dasha Zhukova.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-11 at 4.48.36 AM","ext":".png","w":2042,"h":1340,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":164,"tim":1491900848484,"time":1491900848,"md5":"nBixq\/f26mkNvURXy6bxmg==","fsize":3095078,"resto":0,"id":"iAXgMKal","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-politico-ourblog","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":2,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120575890,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)04:57:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120575680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120575680<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;putin and trump are part of the jewish globalist kabal<\/span><br>IMAHGUINE MAH SHOUK<br>The real savior of the hwite race is the white race itself, not some meme god","filename":"1478177960410","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491901032192,"time":1491901032,"md5":"GS\/e0w1B0UOyZ\/EHVkc6HA==","fsize":118072,"resto":120575680,"id":"RxJmId6Y","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120576040,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)04:59:25","name":"666 Jewred \u0279\u01ddu\u0265sn\u029e 999","com":"<a href=\"#p120575680\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120575680<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;along with Kushner, who would go on to buy a $300 million building from Leviev and marry Ivanka Trump<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;crisis acting<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.webm.land\/media\/tmp\/ace3<wbr>5f79-f6c3-452d-be51-74c78d5ddb66.we<wbr>bm<br>http:\/\/www.webm.land\/media\/tmp\/78c7<wbr>7779-faec-4be4-9820-b7477224cf19.we<wbr>bm<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;oil in the Golan Heights<\/span><br>- http:\/\/www.alternativenews.org\/inde<wbr>x.php\/comment\/235-between-the-lines<wbr>-oil-and-the-occupied-syrian-golan-<wbr>heights<br>- http:\/\/www.tabletmag.com\/scroll\/194<wbr>012\/billions-of-barrels-of-israeli-<wbr>oil-tapped-the-golan-heights<br>- http:\/\/www.jpost.com\/Business\/Globe<wbr>s\/Murdoch-Rothschild-invest-in-Isra<wbr>eli-shale-oil<br>- http:\/\/www.businesswire.com\/news\/ho<wbr>me\/20101115007704\/en\/Business-Finan<wbr>cial-Leaders-Lord-Rothschild-Rupert<wbr>-Murdoch?<br>King Solomon&#039;s &quot;Greater Israel&quot; -- http:\/\/www.veteranstoday.com\/2016\/0<wbr>8\/18\/greater-israel-and-the-tale-of<wbr>-two-temples\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;King Solomon&#039;s &quot;greater Israel&quot;<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.veteranstoday.com\/2016\/0<wbr>8\/18\/greater-israel-and-the-tale-of<wbr>-two-temples\/<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the Kushner connection<\/span><br>https:\/\/archive.is\/vT0FQ<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;holy imprimatur<\/span><br>DEUTERONOMY 1:6~7<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&#039;The LORD our God spoke unto us in Horeb, saying: &#039;Ye have dwelt long enough in this mountain; turn you, and take your journey, and go to the hill-country of the Amorites and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the Arabah, in the hill-country, and in the Lowland, and in the South (...)<\/span><br><br>GENESIS 15:18~21<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&#039;In that day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying: &#039;Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates; the Kenite, and the Kenizzite (...)<\/span><br><br>NUMBERS 34:1~2<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&#039;And the LORD spoke unto Moses, saying: &#039;Command the children of Israel, and say unto them: When ye come into the land of Canaan, this shall be the land that shall fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan according to the borders thereof.&#039;&#039;<\/span><br><br>EZEKIEL 47:13~21<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thus saith the Lord GOD: &#039;This shall be the border, whereby ye shall divide the land for inheritance according to the twelve tribes of Israel (...)<\/span>","filename":"devil&#039;s_advocate","ext":".jpg","w":666,"h":999,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491901165831,"time":1491901165,"md5":"fGeVCwTTY4IKvMJ+UFgdgA==","fsize":150706,"resto":120575680,"id":"x1fTmTUe","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

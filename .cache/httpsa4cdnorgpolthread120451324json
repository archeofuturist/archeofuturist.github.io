He started some kind of a fascist regime that wanted to transform the statute of defeated in a true reliable ally of Germany so they collaborated heavily with the nazis.<br>The society was to return to the traditional values of work, family and fatherland (the official motto of the r\u00e9gime), against banks, socialism and capitalism, and restored things like a modernized version of guilds instead of trade unions.<br>In the meantime they didn&#039;t know if trying to be allied with Germany would work so they started to rearm secretly but weren&#039;t ready when Germany took over the free zone so they didn&#039;t resist and Germany discovered a shit ton of weapons and tanks they used after that. Germany didn&#039;t trust Vichy France, they thought the regime would betray them at some point and was maybe working with de Gaulle so they arrested every ministers and put them in custody in a castle in Germany. After the liberation they were treated as traitors and sentenced to death (except for P\u00e9tain that was sentenced to die in prison thanks to de Gaulle, they worked together in the army for a long time)","filename":"d669ea7d4f6d8fcd6db026bd10d6d54c","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":724,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491849209804,"time":1491849209,"md5":"kmJCtsrXhmxX5psD424quA==","fsize":66243,"resto":120451324,"id":"jhjC4qXd","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120470266,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)14:37:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"We need more votes!<br>LOW ENERGY","filename":"1491693730004","ext":".png","w":783,"h":757,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1491849425172,"time":1491849425,"md5":"VWOuakbaftGe1xvOzWJMwg==","fsize":763287,"resto":120451324,"id":"2IpXjiXf","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":120471048,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)14:43:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120469798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120469798<\/a><br>Thank you for such an elaborate rundown!","time":1491849794,"resto":120451324,"id":"pD0XeQ2Q","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120471328,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)14:45:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"what the FUCK did they mean by this?","filename":"wtf","ext":".png","w":817,"h":66,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":10,"tim":1491849929186,"time":1491849929,"md5":"t3ZkNX02w0Q2t8SjxQlGQw==","fsize":2941,"resto":120451324,"id":"X6KBSzN2","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120471351,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)14:45:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120471048\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120471048<\/a><br>A pleasure, Dmitri<br><br>Can you repay me by giving me a rundown on russian far right politician figures ?","time":1491849941,"resto":120451324,"id":"jhjC4qXd","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120471928,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)14:49:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120471328\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120471328<\/a><br>Shut up, nothing to see","filename":"1488811320587","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":268,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":67,"tim":1491850191340,"time":1491850191,"md5":"6VNw\/2SWUdaGSP48ochjbg==","fsize":1028236,"resto":120451324,"id":"jhjC4qXd","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":120472292,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)14:52:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Voted but I have no idea who he is and I won&#039;t bother finding out.

Only this weight of the sacrifices without account, the cooperation of efforts, the identity of origin, only this collective patrimony, only this spiritual communion can morally underpin the duty to serve it and give its life for it.

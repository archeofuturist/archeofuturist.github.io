You really want to start WW3 in defense of the people who committed the largest attack on the US in recent history?<br>Besides, the rebels constantly fake these chemical attacks in Syria to garner foreign support. <br>The SAA had already pushed back the Islamist offensive before the attack, a chemical attack would have been pointless. Also Russia is not so stupid as to allow Assad to use such weapons which hurt their PR as well. Russia have much more lethal weaponry they can use which also won&#039;t attract so much media attention. <br>Why would the Russians and Syrians do this? It makes no sense. The only possibility is that the strike was done out of revenge for an earlier attack, in which case war is war and there is no good side and America should still mind their own business. They won&#039;t though, because Trump loves Jews and the Jews want Assad gone.","time":1491466290,"resto":119719862,"id":"EfjeoYHK","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119720552,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:12:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119719862\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119719862<\/a><br>so fake and notice they all have the same faked pose as if taught","time":1491466364,"resto":119719862,"id":"3WA3wDe9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119720617,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)04:13:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119720552\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119720552<\/a><br>Are you dumb?

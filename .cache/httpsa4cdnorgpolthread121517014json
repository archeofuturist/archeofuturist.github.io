He was also very hard to discredit on the issues, as well. While someone like Richard Spencer is currently outside of the Overton Window in the West, Milo, despite being a member of the &quot;dissident right&quot; isn&#039;t. Him being a moderate in extremist&#039;s clothing made him hard to discredit on the issues. It was also very beneficial to people on the fringes of the right, due to the fact that Milo was a gateway figure. He stopped short of advocating extremes, but some of his premises taken to their logical conclusions inevitably lead people to more extreme positions.<br><br>On the issues specifically, he was VERY hard to pin down, debunk and discredit. <br><br>Not only that, but he seemed to understand his role, and only craved two things. The destruction of the left, and celebrity status. Unlike Paul Joseph Watson, Milo didn&#039;t try to hijack the Alt-Right and transform it into a civic nationalist movement. Milo only ever spoke on the alt-right as an outsider, flirted with some of its ideas, and played damage control for it.<br><br>He is without a doubt one of the better e-celebs we&#039;ve had, and I&#039;m legitimately hoping he&#039;s able to pull off a comeback because he was extraordinarily useful.<br><br>The thing that stings the most is he was taken down by the fucking Reagan Battalion.

Once in a while I go dumpster diving for free good food. Look into &quot;Freeganism&quot; (although I don&#039;t identify as one because I eat meat) but their whole idea is about finding as much good food discarded by grocery stores in trash and cooking meals from that, even having big potlucks for the homeless. Stores throw away good unexpired food sometimes because a package got damaged or one thing in the whole batch was bad so they toss the whole batch away. From my dumpster diving, I&#039;ve found tons of good bread thrown away because part of the loaf was squished in shipping, tons of good produce that was ripe or just had a tiny spot on it, slightly damaged cans of food, and stuff that was thrown away that I couldn&#039;t figure out why. Obviously don&#039;t dive for meat or dairy.","time":1492279785,"resto":121236764,"id":"79rtzDfR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

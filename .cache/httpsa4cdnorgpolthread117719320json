Even harder when you cant use the rule of law to clamp down on instability. Plus negative reinforcement on the 1% and positive class mobility assistance moves more lower classes to middle class and attritions the gap between 10 &amp; 1% (1% expatriate country, wealth redistributed etc). So yes its harder for new money to 1% but on the whole better for society as the 1% ability to influence society is limited to a handful of people and if their views run counter to society its more of a stark difference.

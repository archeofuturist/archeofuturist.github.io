I see eye to eye with you on most things, but I don&#039;t understand what you find so funny about the KANGZ meme.<br><br>Certainly Africa has had monarchies. Those monarchies have certainly had leaders. And leaders of monarchies are typically called kings. It pretty stupid to act like there have never been black kings.<br><br>And yes, there have even been black pharaohs. Yes, I know not ALL pharaohs were black. But it&#039;s well established and understood that there were some. So why the ridicule?<br><br>Ironically, it seems like the motivation for dismissing black pharaohs is to sew the seeds of ambiguity as to whether the pharaohs were white as opposed to Arab. I&#039;ve seen people here post without evidence that Egyptians who invented geometry might&#039;ve been white. I&#039;ve even read claims that the Arabs who invented algebra might&#039;ve been white. It&#039;s like ya&#039;ll trying to dismiss the black, west-African pharaohs so ya&#039;ll can be KANGZ.<br><br>tl;dr WE technically WUZ KANGZ, but it&#039;s really not that big of a deal.","filename":"55d","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":825,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":171,"tim":1492056032976,"time":1492056032,"md5":"qzrYe1CMd9BdIaXid538rA==","fsize":251967,"resto":0,"id":"BR9VgnM6","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sup-pol-redpilled-black-here-i-see-eye-to-eye","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120864143,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)00:05:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120863628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120863628<\/a><br>We&#039;re jealous for some reason.

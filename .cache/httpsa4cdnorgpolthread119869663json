I voted for him in 2016&#039;s election and I supported him all the way until he won.<br>I still support him, he is a great man and a great president.<br><br>I respect his decision to do this but I have to say that I disagree with it. Its quite obvious that Assad is not responsible for the Sarin gas attacks. The public has 0 evidence proving that Assad is responsible yet.<br>Its obviously the FSA \/ ISIS&#039;s doings. Both of which have gas weapons on hand.<br><br>By doing this, and fighting Assad we have 2 main scenarios to deal with. Firstly it will turn out like Iraq 2.0<br><br>We take out Assad and a hole of power will be the outcome. Militant groups can take power later down the road or a shitty democratic weak president will be instated only to be overthrown years down the road.<br>Lots of time, money and lives will be lost in this.<br><br>The next scenario makes the one above sound lovely. Russia could get involved and attempt to defend their Syrian allies. WW3 could start and we all know that will be horrible and its something that nobody truly wants.<br><br>I will always support my country to my dying breath but I pray to god that this is just a warning to Assad and that this just blows over.","filename":"donald-trump","ext":".png","w":1250,"h":703,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491536270840,"time":1491536270,"md5":"PP6ca1j0e819dR+2TWxP8g==","fsize":649321,"resto":0,"id":"X1w0vvl1","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"50-tomahawk-missiles-launched-against-assads-army","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":5,"unique_ips":9},{"no":119870329,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)23:40:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s that time again.

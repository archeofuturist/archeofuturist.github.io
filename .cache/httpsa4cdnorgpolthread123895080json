These are the people communism preaches to. Communism is incapable of fufilling it&#039;s promise for a key number of reasons. It kills competition which is necessary to keep prices low and quality up. It removes incentive to do good work, which also is a necessity for keeping quality up. It punishes new ideas without merit, which prevents the good ones from developing in a way to improve the economy.

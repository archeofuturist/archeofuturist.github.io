Assad or Russian airplanes struck a stockpile of chemical weapons. Or <br>3. This is all faked by the (((Media))) in order to have Trump Kickstart a war.<br><br>Here are what we know and what we don&#039;t know. the gas used in killing people wasn&#039;t chlorine gas it was sarin.<br>Chlorine gas had previously been used by both sides of the conflict.<br>So far the rebels have been on their last leg due to the intense conflict wage by Russian war planes. <br>End result it&#039;s a shit show either side of the conflict if Assad did this to his people Russia should signal their red line and back off and leave Assad out to dry. This could alleviate pressure on Crimea.<br>If the CIA backed rebels were making sarin gas this is concerning as well.<br>Either way Syria is now the somolia of the middle East both sides should back out of this war and let the Kurds take over the country.<br>Lastly anti war Democrats are hypocrites.","filename":"FB_IMG_1491096205124","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":720,"tn_w":208,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491563791942,"time":1491563791,"md5":"umRGV6Iz7zpF\/UwlZ746bQ==","fsize":57199,"resto":0,"id":"yaHxqLXn","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"looks-like-we-are-going-to-see-the-anti-war","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

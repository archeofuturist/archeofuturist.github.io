The woman is commonly accepted as being Mary and her seed is Christianity.<br>I think i figured out what the flood is. Its the flood of muslim refugees sent into the nations meant to whipe away Christianity. BAM. <br><br>I saw a thread yesterday someone said if the pope gets shot in the head and recovers then we would know he is the anti-christ. I think thats wrong though. Usually whenever the bible referred to a beast it is talking about a nation. &quot;One of the heads of the beast was wounded by the sword but recovered&quot; I believe this is the ottoman empire. The flag of the ottoman empire was banned but is now making a comeback. The colors the beast is clothed in are the same colors of its flag.","filename":"5WCsSlu","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":315,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":131,"tim":1493309447014,"time":1493309447,"md5":"9TLADjdtCQBuXYbRXUOc8g==","fsize":54591,"resto":0,"id":"QJSZZRVv","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pope-false-prophet-not-antichrist","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

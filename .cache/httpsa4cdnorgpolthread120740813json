Though the White House downplayed his removal, it was reported that Bannon had threatened to resign, and was convinced to stay by top political donor and Breitbart investor Rebekah Mercer, daughter of the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer. News of Bannon\u2019s demotion came with various reports detailing the increasing friction between Bannon and the president\u2019s senior advisor and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who reportedly pushed for Bannon\u2019s removal from the NSC. One report from the Daily Beast cited unnamed White House staffers who alleged that Bannon has taken to calling Kushner a \u201cglobalist\u201d and \u201ccuck\u201d behind his back.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The alt-right\u2019s bad week got even worse on Thursday when Trump ordered missile strikes on a Syrian air base in response to the use of chemical weapons (ostensibly by the Assad regime) earlier in the week. Alt-right nationalists promptly condemned Trump for doing what he had repeatedly said he wouldn\u2019t. As the New York Times reported, prominent writers and bloggers on the far right attacked Trump and \u201ccriticized him for launching the strike without first seeking congressional approval \u2014 something he said on Twitter in 2013 would be a \u201cbig mistake.\u201d<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.salon.com\/2017\/04\/11\/glo<wbr>bal-elites-strike-back-have-jared-a<wbr>nd-ivanka-defeated-bannon-and-turne<wbr>d-trump-into-a-cuckservative\/","filename":"1491649289001","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":750,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491992928430,"time":1491992928,"md5":"2LINr4HqpbiWN+AvLKHzHA==","fsize":156357,"resto":0,"id":"sjOEZO09","country":"IL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"have-jared-and-ivanka-defeated-bannon-and-turned","country_name":"Israel","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":120742507,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)06:53:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120740813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120740813<\/a><br>ivanka is just sad breeding cow. low tier DIA cunt involved and tangled in fake marriage with CIA homo kushner.

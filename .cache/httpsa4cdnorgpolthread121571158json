Recent anthropological digs have revealed that ancient tales of human history have spoken of Russian influence in what appears to be a cryptographic language across cultures and regions. The moving of the Easter Island statues was done by Russian peasants and wise men leading their armies in prayer. In fact, the building of the pyramids were led by Russian engineers, and the moon was actually first discovered by Russian wizards looking at the stars for the Divine Answers spoken to them.

In fact, in Revelations, it tells how Russia opens both the Gate which holds the Ancient Dragon and the Gate to Heaven. Linguistic scholars have determined with great success that Russia actually created the English language and all its derivatives. Russia created planes, ice cream, and scissors.

The london times has used the same method as the WSJ to blackmail advertisers. They collected instances of their ads being shown on &quot;hateful&quot; videos then threatened to run stories about how these companies fund racist, islamophobic videos unless they pulled their youtube ads.<br><br>While Murdoch is typically rightwing he is an extreme globalist and will do anything to increase his media power, he will work with communists if it means destroying rightwing political groups that may damage his power. He is known to work with the Saudis, it&#039;s unlikely he did this alone, expect a major offensive against any opposition to mainstream media outlets.","filename":"Murdoch2","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490347720114,"time":1490347720,"md5":"qfQC0ZKOlVnZ3tEaIunnHg==","fsize":423609,"resto":0,"id":"wGL07g65","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"emergency","country_name":"Australia","replies":11,"images":3,"unique_ips":10},{"no":118063706,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)05:29:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"They&#039;re all finally coming after the Internet.

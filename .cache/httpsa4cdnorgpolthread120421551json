This P-F bond is easily broken by nucleophilic agents, such as water and hydroxide. At high pH, sarin decomposes rapidly to nontoxic phosphonic acid derivatives.<br><br>The LD50 of subcutaneously injected sarin in mice is 172 \u03bcg\/kg<br><br>My observations:<br><br>Assuming the same LD50 applies to humans, a 70kg person would have a 50% chance of dying with 0.012g or 12mg.

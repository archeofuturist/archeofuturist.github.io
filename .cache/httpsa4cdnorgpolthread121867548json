I am however suprisingly speaking to a girl and have dated her a few times. I also am having problems trying to pass my GCSE english, i have literally passed maths and science etc... I have no idea what i want to do in the future and im beginning to get terrified because time is running out. I have around \u00a310k in investments but i don&#039;t want to touch them. What should i do, shall i just join the army?","filename":"1280px-Flag_of_the_United_Kingdom.svg","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492622255261,"time":1492622255,"md5":"Lbvc+ajVOd9sxcsGqaVs+w==","fsize":13619,"resto":0,"id":"M7UgwV2c","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"my-pathetic-life","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":7,"images":2,"unique_ips":6},{"no":121867846,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)13:20:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; Time is running out<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 18<\/span>","filename":"McKayla-Maroney-not-impressed","ext":".jpg","w":396,"h":594,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492622439781,"time":1492622439,"md5":"jBKqsmQo7pn9G7WCpBhFrQ==","fsize":64526,"resto":121867548,"id":"y5F78k\/b","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121867897,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)13:21:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"I did a completely different subject in Uni to what I did for BTEC, they really don&#039;t care if you switch up subject, I guess because the format is the same, i.e. submit assessments by a certain deadline.","filename":"CQq8KMdMQB-1","ext":".png","w":300,"h":250,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1492622467767,"time":1492622467,"md5":"Prf\/VnoxkxA5130wTlorjA==","fsize":20050,"resto":121867548,"id":"lAq9KEAL","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121867974,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)13:21:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121867548\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121867548<\/a><br>What on Earth does this have to do with politics?

Lebanese security forces arrested at least six Lebanese nationals and closed 16 stores in several neighborhoods throughout the city. <br><br>&lt;the transfer of illicit funds to armed groups in Syria involved shops like Western Union and MoneyGram. The Washington Institute for Near East Policy noted in a 2015 report that many transfers went to areas \u201cknown to be funding, logistical and smuggling hubs\u201d for internationally-designated terrorist groups. <br><br>Similar systems are in place linking Syria with southern Turkey, another center for refugees fleeing the conflict. Because shops like Western Union often do not operate in areas controlled by opposition or militant groups, refugees rely on so-called \u201chawala\u201d networks of informal traders to send cash back to families. Similar to Lebanon, money is transferred through a series of individuals in territories controlled by different armed groups \u2013 each charging up to $20 per transaction. <br><br>The intricacies of these unofficial systems highlight the potential contradictions of efforts to stem the flow of financing for armed groups. Though the original aim of sanctions is to eliminate foreign funding for groups like ISIS and various al-Qaeda affiliates, everyday people on both sides of the border, caught in a multifaceted financial web, often suffer the most.<br><br>http:\/\/www.atlanticcouncil.org\/blog<wbr>s\/syriasource\/unseen-casualties-of-<wbr>syrian-sanctions","time":1490212016,"resto":117813392,"id":"SWZHVsDf","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":117813657,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)15:47:14","name":"Grizou l&#039;attrape coeurs","com":"KILL ALL GAZA CHILDREN","filename":"neta_alchamister_idf_uniform_hnnnnng","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490212034027,"time":1490212034,"md5":"2hjA241OR7Mh+ZnVFDpWzg==","fsize":123056,"resto":117813392,"id":"snF27iTP","country":"DZ","country_name":"Algeria"},{"no":117813689,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)15:47:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Chinese embassy donates medical equipment to Syrian hospital<\/span><br><br>The Chinese embassy donated some medical equipment to a military hospital in the Syrian capital Damascus on Wednesday, the latest in a string of humanitarian aids China has provided for Syria.<br><br>The new aid constitute of 90 wheelchairs and 40 crutches, and were delivered to the military hospital 601 in the Mazzeh neighborhood west of Damascus.<br><br>During the event, Chinese Ambassador to Syria, Qi Qianjin, said that the new aid is simple, adding that it&#039;s an expression of friendship to the Syrian people.<br><br>&quot;The Chinese embassy in Damascus is glad to provide medical aid to the hospital.

All their friends and family have guns. Not to mention that states have their own militaries called the National Guard (which does not qualify as militia) with tanks and planes and all that shit. Now the federal government has to look to the NATO for help. Infighting among the NATO nations erupts and the organization splits. Now you have foreign nationals waging war on American soil. Who doe Russia back? Who does China back? Mexico? Canada? Australia? The last war fought on US soil yielded about 720,000 casualties.

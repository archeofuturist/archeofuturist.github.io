Instead, it is is an Union, like the name suggests.<\/span><br>It is a government isn&#039;t it? Yes, it is - it has an executive branch (the European Commission), a legislative branch (the European Parliament), and a judicial branch (the European Court of Justice).<br><br>IT IS A GOVERNMENT. And, of course, it *explicitly* aims for &quot;ever closer union&quot;, and many of its politicians explicitly call for FEDERALISM. Do you know what &quot;federalism&quot; means? It means forming a FEDERAL SOVEREIGN STATE, much like the United States, with the constituent countries being mere members of it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And of those 28 leaders, one is accountable to British people, while the others are accountable to the people of other member states.<\/span><br>The European Council, which you are referring to, is only one organ of the EU - in fact it is essentially a collective presidency. So just to clarify, here are some of the most important institutions of the EU, and their equivalents in terms of a nation state:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;European Council<\/span><br>Presidency\/head of state, like the Chancellor of Germany, of the Federal Council of Switzerland, or the British Prime Minister<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;European Commission<\/span><br>Cabinet government, like the British Cabinet, or the German Bundeskabinett<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;European Parliament<\/span><br>Legislature - like the Parliament of the UK, or Congress in the US. The EU Parliament is unicameral (meaning only a single house), like those of Sweden, Norway, China, etc. Britain and Germany both have bicameral legislatures - in Britain we have the lower house (House of Commons) and the upper house (House of Lords). In Germany you have the Bundestag and the Bundesrat.<br><br>I thought I&#039;d explain this to you so that you can see that the EU actually DOES function just like a country, and ultimately it aims to essentially become a country itself - that is the aim of federalism.","time":1490966037,"resto":119047750,"id":"Md2EG30w","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119054884,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)09:13:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119054546\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119054546<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that image<\/span>","filename":"oamlaffin","ext":".jpg","w":324,"h":291,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":112,"tim":1490966039313,"time":1490966039,"md5":"4GZPbP\/ypmLcXutMm3j7NQ==","fsize":28991,"resto":119047750,"id":"vwm7fS37","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119054992,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)09:15:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119054546\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119054546<\/a><br>glad to hear that you are in control","filename":"article-2341066-1A4E027E000005DC-146_634x601","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":601,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1490966125346,"time":1490966125,"md5":"WyCsZq0xCZMtwhH9s1nAig==","fsize":63101,"resto":119047750,"id":"+Y8\/cdB1","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119054994,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)09:15:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119054868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119054868<\/a><br>Are you suggesting that I have standing?

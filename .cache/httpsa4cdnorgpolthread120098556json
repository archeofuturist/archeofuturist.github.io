Sure there is other candidates more communists than him (Poutou and Arthaud) but his program (minimal wage at 1800 euros and 100% tax after 400k\/month) still look damn communistic by french standards.<br><br>In a recent pool, he&#039;s at 19%, the same score as Fran\u00e7ois Fillon, the traditional right-wing candidate who was supposed to have the election in the bag before he was accused on giving fake governemental jobs to his family.<br><br>And those two are closer and closer to the top 2, both at 23%, namely Marine LePen (nationalistic right-wing) and Emmanuel Macron (Dead center, meaning he says he&#039;s left-wing but he&#039;s actually right-wing) and they are both losing speed.<br><br>This is the result of the Fillon affairs losing steam (he was even lower than that before) and the last debate in which Melanchon was pretty much the victor (he speaks well and is very confident).<br><br>Meanwhile, the official candidate from the Socialist party Benoit Hamon is in free-fall at 8.5% despite doing everything he can to distance himself to his party.","filename":"frenchelection","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1491632780851,"time":1491632780,"md5":"yJAPcg0rCFev6ZlHnGwRZQ==","fsize":710871,"resto":0,"id":"RMXbV7WX","country":"FR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"communism-in-third-place-in-france","country_name":"France","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120098695,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:27:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120098556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120098556<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;France will never uncuck<\/span>","filename":"1491439505214","ext":".png","w":1127,"h":685,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1491632865074,"time":1491632865,"md5":"knGz1BPFHVXY0LvxA1VNNA==","fsize":38067,"resto":120098556,"id":"rHpNCwqN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120098906,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:29:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120098695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120098695<\/a><br>\/pol\/ is losing it, we use to change buzzwords every year but now the medias are recognizing us, we keep the &quot;cuck&quot; meme and still use it in every sentence.<br><br>Anyway, since nobody can predict who will win at this point I&#039;m not sure why you say that.","time":1491632987,"resto":120098556,"id":"RMXbV7WX","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]}

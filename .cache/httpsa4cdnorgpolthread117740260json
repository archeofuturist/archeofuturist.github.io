Why don&#039;t humans just steal all the good ideas from the various cultures and discard all the bullshit? And yes, I&#039;m aware these ideas could then be considered a new culture themselves, but I&#039;m not interested in word-thinking, just why we should let good ideas be tied to genetics, geography, or language. Why shouldn&#039;t we willfully appropriate culture if an idea appeals to us? Why shouldn&#039;t we also create new ideas that aren&#039;t tied to any past groups that share our genes or memes?","filename":"panopticon","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1584,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":247,"tim":1490172818712,"time":1490172818,"md5":"IvaD4LTko13nnKMsqb5MOw==","fsize":953577,"resto":0,"id":"QlP4HMGz","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-we-liberate-ideas-from-the-prison-of-culture","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":117740368,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:55:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"psychobabble.jpg","time":1490172914,"resto":117740260,"id":"vRJLOnq2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

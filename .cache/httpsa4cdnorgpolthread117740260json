Why don&#039;t humans just steal all the good ideas from the various cultures and discard all the bullshit? And yes, I&#039;m aware these ideas could then be considered a new culture themselves, but I&#039;m not interested in word-thinking, just why we should let good ideas be tied to genetics, geography, or language. Why shouldn&#039;t we willfully appropriate culture if an idea appeals to us? Why shouldn&#039;t we also create new ideas that aren&#039;t tied to any past groups that share our genes or memes?","filename":"panopticon","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1584,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":247,"tim":1490172818712,"time":1490172818,"md5":"IvaD4LTko13nnKMsqb5MOw==","fsize":953577,"resto":0,"id":"QlP4HMGz","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-we-liberate-ideas-from-the-prison-of-culture","country_name":"United States","replies":9,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":117740368,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)04:55:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"psychobabble.jpg","time":1490172914,"resto":117740260,"id":"vRJLOnq2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117740702,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)05:00:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117740260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117740260<\/a><br>what determines a good idea vs a bad one? sometimes this is not clear or apparent for a long time after implementation","time":1490173214,"resto":117740260,"id":"XwK0aMLL","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":117740888,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)05:03:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117740260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117740260<\/a><br>are you retarded","time":1490173395,"resto":117740260,"id":"oBXehfIo","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117741672,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)05:16:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117740702\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117740702<\/a><br>Good Idea: Promotes human flourishing without causing unnecessary suffering to the individual.<br><br>Bad Idea: Anything that goes against the first definition.<br><br>The only important question is how we test ideas, everything else is just speculation.","filename":"good-idea-bad-idea","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":244,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":47,"tim":1490174210663,"time":1490174210,"md5":"pn9qxVmQJpWg\/EEKPShPmQ==","fsize":59626,"resto":117740260,"id":"QlP4HMGz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117742119,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)05:24:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117741672\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117741672<\/a><br>we test them by implementing them.

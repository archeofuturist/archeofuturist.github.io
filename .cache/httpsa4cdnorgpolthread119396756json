They just have no desire to act on those sexual urges with another person. Some still masturbate but others don&#039;t.<br><br>Personally I cannot think of a time that I&#039;ve ever had a conscious desire to want to have sex with anyone. There are a few things that can give me an erection but it&#039;s not physical appearance. I grew up in a religious family where both sex and nudity were taboo, and I got told off when I was around 12 for looking up pictures of naked people (I wanted to know what body parts looked like, it wasn&#039;t porn sites). Because of that (among other things) I think in my situation I&#039;ve just got some fucked up repression shit, but I don&#039;t believe that&#039;s the case for everyone who identifies as asexual. If therapy wasn&#039;t so expensive I&#039;d do that to try and sort myself out.<br><br>Pic related is an abstract representation of how asexuality is defined. &quot;true&quot; asexuality is the absolute 0,0, and the quadrant labelled &quot;asexuals&quot; is really the grey area where people have little to no sexual desire, or not enough to want to act on it. Sub-definitions like gray-asexual (graysexual) are used for the middle ground.<br><br>All of this being said, I don&#039;t believe asexuality is commonly accepted as a real thing in psych circles yet.","filename":"sexuality","ext":".png","w":417,"h":448,"tn_w":116,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491270166167,"time":1491270166,"md5":"Ka6w5UM9txmWIwUvy3qcNw==","fsize":7503,"resto":119396756,"id":"7n7u\/+40","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119413376,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:45:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119398666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119398666<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;666<\/span><br><br>Not today pal.","filename":"satan","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491270355853,"time":1491270355,"md5":"21XdMA9uK5j1Y7kIFT+lyw==","fsize":20642,"resto":119396756,"id":"4kFkfIDl","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119414348,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)21:54:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119413009\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119413009<\/a><br>The DSM-5 makes a passing mention of asexuality, but it&#039;s also highly controversial because people believe it&#039;s been too strongly influenced by personal politics and also money from the pharma industry (it has a lot more suggestions to take medication to fix things) The DSM-5 also accepts self-identification which is about as un-scientific as you can get.

I definitely believe there are people who use it as a label as some kind of security blanket - They feel they&#039;re broken and don&#039;t fit in with their sexually driven friends, but then when they find the label they&#039;re happy with who they are. This is actually pretty dangerous because it means there are people using the &quot;asexual&quot; label as a placebo to feel happy about their current state instead of addressing the deeper issues that could be causing those feelings.","time":1491270859,"resto":119396756,"id":"7n7u\/+40","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

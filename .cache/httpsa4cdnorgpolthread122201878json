So far the most cost effective solution is housing. Seriously, I&#039;m pretty libertarian (yeah yeah) and there is a real argument to be made for programs that put them in subsidized housing. Sometimes it helps them get back into the work force, but I will admit it usually functions basically like an asylum used to. The thing is, it&#039;s a fuck load cheaper (on average) to keep someone inside than on the street. That way they have access to affordable services and don&#039;t go to the ER every time they get cold, and that shit happens a lot. I&#039;ve seen people get carried off in an ambulance for heartburn and that shit comes out of your pocket. <br><br>Someone said rehab centers, and that is helpful too but it&#039;s easy to go to far. I live in a place with a lot of services, and even as someone that works at one I feel we have provided far too much. Homelessness is the worlds second oldest profession and it isn&#039;t going away, and society is best served by spreading the resources for them around as large an area as possible. There is a societal price to pay not to be tripping over dying old people in the street, but you can&#039;t actually fix this problem in the long run.<br><br>Mental illness is a big problem, but the solution to that is thus far unknown from what I can tell. Most mental health &quot;treatment&quot; is primarily aimed at keeping a person sedated to the point that they are not aware of their own misery or a threat to anyone. It&#039;s not anyone&#039;s fault really, we are just starting to truly understand these things and the science has a long way to go to catch up. I expect vast improvements within the next decade, but it will be a long time before there is a true solution.","time":1492818443,"resto":122201878,"id":"cEK6+h71","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122204585,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)19:47:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122203375\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122203375<\/a><br>It&#039;s almost as if social programs prevent a homeless problem from manifesting...","filename":"1491345534963","ext":".jpg","w":513,"h":510,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492818472673,"time":1492818472,"md5":"qXlg6FDYLWaBPya6t+18UQ==","fsize":120876,"resto":122201878,"id":"PD8qS86D","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":122204598,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)19:48:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122204277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122204277<\/a><br>How old were you when you got kicked out?","time":1492818482,"resto":122201878,"id":"WRoyvpD4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122204601,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)19:48:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122204277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122204277<\/a><br>I had a similar situation but I was semi-actively looking for a job.

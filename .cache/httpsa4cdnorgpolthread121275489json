A school known for its academics, excellent business school and okay CompSci school, but I&#039;ll constantly be stuck working and I won&#039;t really get to have a whole bunch of fun or have the &quot;college experience.&quot; Despite this, the academic reputation is great, and I&#039;d stand out on a resume. <br><br>OR<br><br>B. A big state school, with tough academics(if you want it, which I do) where I won&#039;t be close to as busy, closer to home, but also one of the biggest party schools in the nation. Should also mention my family and I have been die-hard fans of said schools athletics since I moved here from Ireland. Also both of my parents alma mater.

It started slowly in the mid 19th century with the Convention of Kanagawa (1854), got amplified greatly with the Meiji Restoration (1868) and culminated in 1912 with the Russo-Japanese war. From then onward, Japan was considered an &quot;equal&quot; nation in many regards to European countries (which is why, for example, in the 1920 Olympics Japan was the only participating country that was neither European\/white, nor colonial). And throughout this entire time, many Western intellectuals and artists were always fascinated and even obsessed with Japan (in other words, weebness isn&#039;t anything new by any means).<br><br>The only reason Japan&#039;s status got &quot;reduced&quot; and Westerners started considering them as uncivilized was because of American propaganda surrounding WW2 and the Sino-Japanese war. But even then, if you look at before the Americans got involved, the Japanese were objectively not that bad at all, for example they had a cutting-edge aerospace industry in the late 1920&#039;s (which is why if you look up old NACA research papers from that period, you&#039;ll find lots which are in fact articles translated from Japanese).<br><br>Because of all of this, it&#039;s only natural that people obsessed with notions of &quot;race realism&quot; would consider Japanese as equal.","time":1492791449,"resto":122140268,"id":"decXfJcw","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122152439,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)12:17:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122152123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122152123<\/a><br>Germany has no authority over EU monetary policies.

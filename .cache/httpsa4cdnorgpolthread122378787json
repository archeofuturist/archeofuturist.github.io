If it were up to most people, we would. But the Chinese government is still protecting them, and China IS someone we need to play ball with on the global stage.

Yeah, we all want to, but we still need to be friends with Turkey and Saudi Arabia for various reasons, not all of them about Israel either (though the kikes benefit from all of this). Turkey is a NATO member, meaning they&#039;re theoretically a military ally the second shit goes south and Vlad Putin starts expanding too far, and by the standards of Muslim countries is probably the least of all possible evils. Saudi Arabia has oil out the wazoo, on which a lot of the global economic system relies. It would be great if we could give both of them the finger, but we can&#039;t. The same goes for manufacturing powerhouse China: cutting them off would be great, but it would be at best shooting ourselves in the foot, fucking ourselves up the ass economically while also probably getting us into a war that a capitalist quasi-democracy just can&#039;t win against the more unified mobilization power of an East Asian dictatorship, just to get rid of the dictator equivalent of the retard who licks the windows on the short bus.","time":1492922884,"resto":122378787,"id":"pXsgmlib","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122382149,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)00:54:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122378787\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122378787<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;raining hellfire<\/span><br>Because flat out attacking NK will show all the citizens how wrong Kim was about saying the rest of the world wants their country destroyed.<br>I swear to god you&#039;re acting like a fucking highschooler.

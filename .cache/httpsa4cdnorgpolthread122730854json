This is a lie, meant to distract from what is really going on. In truth, the preponderance of aliens and UFOs in pop culture are precisely the reason that &quot;aliens&quot; are able to exist in the material dimension. The forces of world subversion are indeed conditioning the public with regard to aliens, not to prepare them, but rather to use the public to bring these demons (for this is what they really are) into the material plane of being. The concept of the tulpa will help us to explain this. A tulpa is a being or object which is created by psychic or spiritual processes - which is &quot;thought&quot; or &quot;imagined&quot; into reality. To put it simply, mass awareness of aliens and UFOs will cause alien encounters to become more frequent, until finally they &quot;reveal themselves&quot; - but this will simply be the first movement beyond the zero point, the time at which the tulpa has been created. An analogous concept would be the stories of the golem in the Jewish ghettoes of 17th century Prague, which by the way does look quite a bit like a grey alien (pic related). <br><br>Now, such a process on a massive scale is only possible given the point that we have reached near the end of a great cycle or Manvantara. A metaphysical grounding for this is given by Rene Guenon, who showed that former spiritual supports which may have prevented this invasion of Gog and Magog have all but disappeared in the modern world. There are now no initiatic centers exercising a strong spiritual influence on the cosmos, which in the past prevented psychic thought forms to enter the material plane except in rare and isolated cases.","filename":"IMG_5817","ext":".jpg","w":472,"h":348,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1493131677045,"time":1493131677,"md5":"XT4M97GAN+QSQouTu30UDQ==","fsize":73541,"resto":122730854,"id":"ThuPz1L+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122741208,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:50:39","name":"Anonymous","filename":"WhiteSandsUFO","ext":".webm","w":320,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493131839099,"time":1493131839,"md5":"uubwauZ8FyK+4CISFfw9Pw==","fsize":428081,"resto":122730854,"id":"quycA8of","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122741217,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:50:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122740836\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122740836<\/a><br>Shit i gota go. fucking interesting tho","time":1493131845,"resto":122730854,"id":"eguvKlBl","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122741330,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:51:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;ve always liked the quote that goes something like: &quot;Saying that intelligent cannot exist anywhere else in the universe is like taking a thimble of water from the ocean and saying Whales don&#039;t exist.&quot;<br>Might have been (((Carl Sagan)))?","time":1493131903,"resto":122730854,"id":"hqO9\/hpi","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122741968,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:57:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122741217\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122741217<\/a><br>Good talk bro.","time":1493132258,"resto":122730854,"id":"65zgviTV","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":122741996,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)10:57:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122738205\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122738205<\/a><br>It&#039;s an important note that only the outer blocks of the pyramids are perfectly cut and aligned.

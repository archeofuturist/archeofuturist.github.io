Whites grew crops while Indians hunted. Only when Europeans tried to also claim hunting rights did the Indians become violent. <br><br>Today, Indians still cause problems- turns out that exclusion did not work. <br><br>We face a similar resource problem today, but with women instead of land. The difference is that while land can&#039;t choose who owns it, women can. <br><br>The problem is the sole claim of ownership towards women- just as in the 1700s, a peaceful existence only existed while resources were used by Europeans\/Indians simutaneously. Problems were few, asides from occasional disease transmission. <br><br>Considering White\/Black mental\/physical disparities, either Whites\/Blacks may be preferable to women, and at different times, even for different purposes. Considering White\/Black disparities, a woman may want a White man for certain purposes, and a Black man for other reasons. And considering women&#039;s differing ability to accomdate White\/Black performance in different roles, both White\/Black have roles to play for women. A peaceful existance is possible so long as resources are used for multiple roles.","filename":"bl","ext":".jpg","w":205,"h":246,"tn_w":205,"tn_h":246,"tim":1493713945489,"time":1493713945,"md5":"8zGw7W7U123ESnJdaRXY4Q==","fsize":6663,"resto":0,"id":"V6G8ZKCy","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"interraciall-resource-role-fullfillment","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

He would take the current political situations of the day, or even other topics of interest, and explain them in a nuanced way. He would present views which at the time were not very popular, in a professional manner.<br><br>Then he started getting more popular, and let it get to his head. His video formats now consist of him taking on the lowest hanging fruit possible, idiotic left wing SJW&#039;s, which already face no shortage of ridicule. Now rather than being articulate and professional, he comes off as arrogant and condescending. PJW often uses Twitter references as an argument (I have more Twitter followers than x and y). He also comes up with some of the most cringe inducing lines I have heard in recent times, &quot;Conservative is the new punk&quot;.<br><br>I think in short PJW about 3-5 years ago was excellent. PJW now is a right wing version of an SJW.","time":1491250508,"resto":119373051,"id":"PKI3UTu5","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":119374521,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)16:16:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119373051\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119373051<\/a><br>Shareblue are trying to turn ppl off molymeme, PJW and Jordan Peterson it&#039;s pretty obv","time":1491250619,"resto":119373051,"id":"tCLZ3j0G","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119374628,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)16:17:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119373051\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119373051<\/a><br>He&#039;s winning on YouTube, so the people that hate him pretend to be from pol pretending to hate him.

To further prove this point we could use the example of president Trump and all the things he wanted and promised to do but thanks to the &quot;resistance&quot; he was unable to get most of them done at the moment and there is a CHANCE that next round of elections can have the opposition taking control of the legislative branch of power and later the presidency.<br><br>Marcon on the other hand would be too difficult to fight against since France will sacrifice too much or its political might to EU and powerful economic world leaders to effectively block what he may do. And those who backed Macron could hold a joke of a presidential election next time and have two or more candidates as Rothschild puppets.","filename":"MACRON-LE-PEN","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":505,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":98,"tim":1493852957368,"time":1493852957,"md5":"K8PTcPTCX2EvDiMTm88CWw==","fsize":138744,"resto":0,"id":"4M5Qk9HX","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-final-push-plan-to-get-le-pen-in-as-new","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

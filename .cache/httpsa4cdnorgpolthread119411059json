If Flynn was the most damaging thing they found (which wasn&#039;t illegal in the first place) and believe me if they&#039;d found any damaging information in the other civilians who were unmasked we would have seen it, then that tells me there was nothing significant found through unmasking the others.<br><br>3. we know that from Nunes that the data collected came from routine surveillance of foreign ambassadors and had nothing to do with any ongoing investigation about Russia, just simple routine surveillance.<br><br>So pretty much we&#039;ll have to wait for the transcripts to be declassified to really get a good idea of how fucked Rice is but from the above thing that we already know there&#039;s a good chance that there was no probable cause in what was collected to warrant the unmasking and dissemination of U.S. civilian&#039;s names and information.","time":1491271463,"resto":119411059,"id":"jhdz3B0i","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119415674,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)22:06:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119411059\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119411059<\/a><br>No one in government positions is ever actually facing punishment for anything they do.<br><br>Not what normal people would call &quot;punishment&quot; anyways.

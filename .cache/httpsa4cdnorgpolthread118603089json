The Parasol Foundation is a philanthropic organization that was primarily founded by billionaire Warren Trepp. Warren Trepp is best known for being the one player who escaped jail time in the junk bond scandal of the 1980\u2019s that made Michael Milken infamous. (see the book \u2018Barbarians At The Gate\u2019) Warren Trepp also happened to be my former father-in-law Tom\u2019s main \u201cbro\u201d in a nauseatingly dysfunctional group of nouveau riche butt plugs in and around the Lake Tahoe Basin. Trepp and his much younger wife, J\u2019ale, played hosts to this yearly event, which featured an often amusing lineup of D-list celebrities and athletes. Occasionally, they would snag a good one, and this year was the best so far, with Dennis Hopper and Cheech Marin heading up the bunch.<\/span>","filename":"slots","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":400,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":161,"tim":1490670599813,"time":1490670599,"md5":"4U6CAGdG\/Yz4iAE2rT9INg==","fsize":75865,"resto":0,"id":"xGUdrcNi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-man-who-fooled-the-government-appletinis","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":12,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118603177,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)23:10:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;The most infamous character that weekend, it would turn out later, was no famous actor or athlete.

He always plopped next to me in the casino gold room at these things, every single year, and we talked about his old hospital days. He tried to make like he was practically running this OR in Bum-Fucked Egypt, way back in 1983 or whatever, even though I knew damn good and well what a surgery tech did \u2013 and it was even less glamorous than my thankless job as a staff nurse. Regardless, Dennis was the only one who ever stuck his neck out to come over and ogle my tits, and do shots with me, and feign interest in what I had to say, and so I always kind of liked the dirty old bastard.<br><br>Dennis\u2019s wife, Brenda, was the only one of the \u201cwives\u201d who was 40 pounds overweight, and it was probably her pudgy frame that caused her to put on airs even more than the others. That\u2019s saying a lot in that particular group \u2013 a bunch of black-hearted, professional succubi: faces pulled back like snare drums that had been spray painted orange, and tits that seemed to defy gravity under thousand dollar blouses. Picture a room full of starlets circa 1977, their dreams of being the next Suzanne Somers long dashed against the rocks, still trying to look 20 after decades of starvation diets that featured rigorous lab-rat style chemical testing of multi-generational versions of amphetamine. They would babble amongst themselves about flax seed oil enemas, and sage brush decontamination ceremonies performed by Paiute medicine men along the icy cold depths of the lake. Of course, they weren\u2019t all bad. But some of them were awful, and the rest performed accordingly, to satisfy the status quo. Brenda stood out because had all of the inescapable trappings of a former trailer trash. I loved to watch her wave around her $2000 purse, scanning the room and expecting these filthy rich broads to be impressed.","time":1490670692,"resto":118603089,"id":"xGUdrcNi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118603304,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)23:12:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"The daughter was even more fun to watch \u2013 a shining and sad example of a lost generation of women who were weaned on the image of Paris Hilton as a role model for lazy eyed, coked up indifference to every possible subject besides shopping and having boys want to fuck them.

Bush administration, during the height of terrorist paranoia post 9\/11) into believing that he had developed a software that could spot coded messages in Al-Jazeera broadcasts that were meant for Al-Qaeda operatives. Remember those \u201cterrorist level\u201d scales they had on the news \u2013 alerting the public of any escalated chances of a domestic terrorist strike occurring? It seems that whenever that went up a notch, it was because Dennis was feeding them some line of complete bullshit. It\u2019s entirely likely that whenever it went up to \u201clevel orange\u201d, it was because Dennis was doing poorly at the craps table at the El Dorado Hotel and Casino that week, and needed a bonus check from Uncle Sam.

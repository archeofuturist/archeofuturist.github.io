I&#039;m convinced it accelerated the whole process (we were married 18 months after we started dating).","time":1490409108,"resto":118171389,"id":"TBSo\/\/cy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118173298,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:33:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"calmly explain to them that the rockefellers invented womens lib so that they could destroy the family and get an influx of tax payers<br><br>thats how girls get wet down below","time":1490409180,"resto":118171389,"id":"ceT1PQTL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118173342,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:33:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118173008\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118173008<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Shareblue-Sample-07.png<\/span>","filename":"AwooShillCon_3","ext":".gif","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490409200237,"time":1490409200,"md5":"NRtc4rCJZxLotL4a+jI\/pw==","fsize":126153,"resto":118171389,"id":"rkFhAJjp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118173358,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:33:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118172511\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118172511<\/a><br>Yeah that&#039;s the problem","time":1490409206,"resto":118171389,"id":"bL1hDQFg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118173397,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:33:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118171389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118171389<\/a><br><br>Stop paying attention to them and focus on Generation Z.","time":1490409227,"resto":118171389,"id":"\/ARj6ZLD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118173422,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:34:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118173154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118173154<\/a><br>The point being: You can&#039;t intellectually convince a woman to &quot;not work.&quot; You have to inspire her towards the bigger goal of creating a family with you.

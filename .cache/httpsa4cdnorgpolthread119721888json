Fake News buries or downplays these facts by not factoring in spelling variations despite the names being transliteration from Arabic with the same exact pronunciation.<br><br>Homogeneity of naming in the Muslim population explains the ranking dominance versus a far wider variance in naming by non-Muslims. However, names are useful to see patterns of individual areas, like in London. The birth rate of Muslim communities is higher. UK&#039;s Muslim population will be 6% soon if it isn&#039;t already. Names do not measure cultural assimilation, which is a very important consideration.

Current data measuring religion, immigration and generational status, gender, and ethnicity is very hard to come by for the general public.<br><br>ONS Data:<br><br>https:\/\/www.ons.gov.uk\/peoplepopula<wbr>tionandcommunity\/birthsdeathsandmar<wbr>riages\/livebirths\/datasets\/babyname<wbr>senglandandwalesbabynamesstatistics<wbr>boys<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;NOTE: There are officially 14 ways to spell Mohammed, which means one who is praiseworthy.

Then, when it was pointed out that smokers put in more in cigarette duty than they took out in smoking related illness costs - they dropped that one like a hot rock. You will never see that one bandied about again, because by this point the price of cigarettes is so high that smokers actually contribute more to the budget in tax than alcohol and fast food combined.<br><br>Central government can&#039;t admit to this, because it will look as if they&#039;re happy to have people continuing to smoke because of the billions they collect in revenue.

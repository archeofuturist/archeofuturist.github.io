While being careful to say that there is a little bit of actual research attached to the study, writer Benedict Carey made it clear that the study did not even remotely apply to the debate to which its supporters wished to apply it. Carey noted the flawed sample (e.g. &quot;About half the study participants with a gay parent, as defined in the study, were born out of wedlock and half into a traditional family that broke up. Many lived with the gay parent sporadically;&quot; &quot;Just three of those who had lesbian mothers lived out their entire childhood with that parent, Dr. Regnerus said; none of those whose fathers had had a same-sex relationship lived full time with their fathers through childhood.&quot;) and every single expert Carey quoted in his piece noted the &quot;limited usefulness&quot; in applying the findings to the marriage equality conversation. Carey&#039;s article made it perfectly clear that if there is anything at all to be gleaned from Regnerus&#039; work, it speaks to other factors (e.g. divorce, fragmentation, family transition, etc) and not gay parenting in general.","time":1492824339,"resto":122209091,"id":"6yboej09","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122215309,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)21:25:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122215122\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122215122<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i&#039;m an animal<\/span><br>you&#039;re not doing yourself any favors here","time":1492824357,"resto":122209091,"id":"J1sq3fOA","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122215511,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)21:27:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122215309\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122215309<\/a><br>Stupid cunt","time":1492824466,"resto":122209091,"id":"i12W1KX4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122215556,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)21:28:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122214987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122214987<\/a><br>You&#039;ve dodged the crucial part of the question - what is the evolutionary advantage of acting in a moral manner?

Gays are gays. Sexuality is inherently part of our identity. Not shoving it in people&#039;s faces doesn&#039;t change the fact that gay people lead very different lives than straight people and that can influence the way the children of gay couples grow up. Any family without a proper father\/mother figure is lacking. If gays want to have children they need to have the mother\/father of the child active in their lives.

When we tried to act independently in what may well have been a folly-laden enterprise which was the Suez operation in 1956, America slapped us down! Smacked us in the face and square in the chops! And we had no particular answer either. When a run on the pound was engineered by the United States in order to humiliate this country and show it the error of its ways in going for some unilateral action with the French and the Israelis but not at the behest of American power as it manifested at that particular moment, we were shown what was what. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It\u2019s interesting to note that amongst the extraordinary moralism that is part of contemporary culture where obscure Olympics are remembered and Manchester United\u2019s victories in the \u201860s are remembered and various other events are churned over by the media, Suez is never dwelt on. Suez is never mentioned. Fifty years on from Suez receives this much attention, and the reason it does receive no attention is because it was a rank humiliation for the then ruling class in this country who learned some very salient post-war lessons, and that was that you heel to the United States like an aggressive bulldog and basically never venture to do anything without their recognizance.<\/span>","filename":"hqdefault","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492272383715,"time":1492272383,"md5":"V0AoMhbuc6r\/ZkNn4crMUw==","fsize":13313,"resto":121223906,"id":"JmeCVtHk","country":"GB","trip":"!!nIHFObhTBdm","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121224907,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)12:07:57","name":"REPLY TO THIS POST OR YOUR MOTHER WILL DIE IN HER SLEEP TONIGHT","com":"REPLY TO THIS POST OR YOUR MOTHER WILL DIE IN HER SLEEP TONIGHT<br><br>REPLY TO THIS POST OR YOUR MOTHER WILL DIE IN HER SLEEP TONIGHT<br><br>REPLY TO THIS POST OR YOUR MOTHER WILL DIE IN HER SLEEP TONIGHT","filename":"FLAG","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492272477065,"time":1492272477,"md5":"LYIJFh5c4\/i62soqWgFNNQ==","fsize":175388,"resto":121223906,"id":"svEuRl6Y","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121224997,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)12:08:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121224907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121224907<\/a><br><br>Fuck you!","time":1492272537,"resto":121223906,"id":"8DMdXRfK","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121225023,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)12:09:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121224907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121224907<\/a>","filename":"8-2","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1440,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492272548344,"time":1492272548,"md5":"JWMkuQwV3qIAZ6IOLVgscQ==","fsize":312759,"resto":121223906,"id":"Dvzv3hw3","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121225031,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)12:09:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121224650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121224650<\/a><br>In absolutely fuck all way does that mean they&#039;re the same &#039;Aryan&#039; people as the Hitler Youth you pleb.","time":1492272553,"resto":121223906,"id":"cB5RlR\/4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121225045,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)12:09:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121224384\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121224384<\/a><br>Watch it lad, she just told me she&#039;ll spark you out if you don&#039;t stop mouthing off","filename":"u4sVUaG","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":1024,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492272558994,"time":1492272558,"md5":"ACj1sI0VJNeyF4fr1v+0NQ==","fsize":137076,"resto":121223906,"id":"Hk2405Xo","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121225114,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)12:10:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121225045\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121225045<\/a><br>I would just wrestle her to the ground and stamp on her ugly fucking face until she died.","time":1492272600,"resto":121223906,"id":"TJvzWglk","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121225155,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)12:10:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121224650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121224650<\/a><br>Islam + white racial purity + Not being retarded about making women wear bin bags because you can&#039;t control the urge to rape = perfect ideology.","time":1492272623,"resto":121223906,"id":"37LDxOyd","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121225222,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)12:10:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121225114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121225114<\/a><br>Wow anon it sounds like you really want to kiss her","time":1492272658,"resto":121223906,"id":"Hk2405Xo","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121225275,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)12:11:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"She literally looks like if Maisie Williams had a kid with her dad.","filename":"fucking ugly shit","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":856,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492272686941,"time":1492272686,"md5":"clnWCkF9CkJaiSdgSrBEgg==","fsize":452594,"resto":121223906,"id":"TJvzWglk","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121225308,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)12:11:46","name":"Hull\/fag\/","com":"<a href=\"#p121224104\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121224104<\/a><br>I don&#039;t want my mother to die tonight.","time":1492272706,"resto":121223906,"id":"UqZe+q9b","country":"GB","trip":"!!cPFjrjAdPLx","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121225368,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)12:12:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121225222\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121225222<\/a><br>Nah, I actually have standards.

We have given the world a great lot, and this is just to refract our own identity through the national consciousness of one particular people who are actually a part of it.

They are the product of a sort of secular demonization, aren\u2019t they, really? Because the elite that speaks for their own group is treated as the secular equivalent of Satanism virtually, certainly by many forms of popular media. That\u2019s not an untruthful or particularly biased statement. I think it\u2019s just a factual one. Certainly at the level of propaganda it\u2019s a factual one. At the level of academic reportage, it\u2019s not and a more realistic view is taken. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But at the level of tabloid media and general media, the demonization is very strong and the demonization has worked, which is why people will not vote in enormous numbers for parties of extraordinary reasonableness. All of the populist parties have fallen over themselves to be as moderate and as acclimatizing as possible in this era. They\u2019ve given away almost 70% of the core ultra views that manifest in these particular views and yet still people will not vote for them in a majority way and that is because the demonization, along with the apathy and the intent of liberalism have all worked.<\/span>","filename":"j_bowden","ext":".jpg","w":267,"h":354,"tn_w":94,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492274795159,"time":1492274795,"md5":"W88K4O26Wd3d8Qe7VQItgA==","fsize":15658,"resto":121223906,"id":"JmeCVtHk","country":"GB","trip":"!!nIHFObhTBdm","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121229292,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)12:47:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121229081\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121229081<\/a><br>I have both.

They figured they have resources, supplies and technology. What happened, is that the Russians apparently just needed ammo, and resources came secondary. Granted, the people fighting the invasion should want to fight the invasion. At this point the population hates the US and what it stands for enough to put up serious resistance. I also don&#039;t think their tech is that bad. They have access to computers now, so the tech gap closed. And their war machines are much cheaper. So you can&#039;t compare the costs, because the basis is different. You need to see what bang you get for a buck. I wouldn&#039;t be surprised if the US fights Russia on their land and Russia wins. Their chances are like Trump&#039;s chances to win, lots of fuzzy math goes there, but they chances are not nearly as dismal as you believe. In fact, with the current attitude I think they have an overwhelming advantage against us. As soon as the first million US soldiers dies, the war will be over. And they will easily kill 1mm US soldiers if the push comes to shove. We will have an uprising here when the body bags start coming home in sufficient numbers.","time":1491601816,"resto":120017597,"id":"HceGmCVc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120030655,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)17:50:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120030305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120030305<\/a><br>That&#039;s the plan.","time":1491601826,"resto":120017597,"id":"AiJRtDRx","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120030755,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)17:51:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120024462\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120024462<\/a><br>This is Ireland, retard.

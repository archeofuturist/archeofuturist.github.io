Boller, Jr., and John George, They Never Said It: A Book of Fake Quotes, Misquotes, &amp; Misleading Attributions (1989), p. 26-27, noting that historian Charles A. Beard conducted a thorough investigation of the attribution and found it to be false. The quote appears in no source prior to Pelley&#039;s publication, contains anachronisms, and contradicts Franklin&#039;s own financial support of the construction of a synagogue in Philadelphia. Many variations of the above have been made, including adding to &quot;the Christian religion&quot; the phrase &quot;upon which this nation was founded, by objecting to its restrictions&quot;; adding to &quot;strangle that country to death financially&quot; the phrase &quot;as in the case of Spain and Portugal&quot;.

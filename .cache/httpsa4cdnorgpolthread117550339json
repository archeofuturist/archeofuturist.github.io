Imagine what would happen if after Trump just won the presidency, Comey comes out (after what he did before the election w\/ the letter to congress) and says &quot;Theres no collusion between trump and russia.&quot; The media complex would then switch the narrative to questioning Comey &amp; everything the FBI does in the future. They would not accept his findings and pivot to other stories that fit their narrative.<br><br>To avoid that, Comey doesn&#039;t comment on the flynn\/leaking part and only confirms that the other investigation exists. This shows he isn&#039;t just brushing the russia investigation off &amp; he&#039;s taking it seriously like the left wants him to. Keep in mind he said its been going on since July and with all the leaks etc the smoking gun would of already come out. (especially BEFORE the election, they also had the power of the entire federal government)<br><br>After a little while, he&#039;ll come out and say theres nothing to make him think Trump and the russians colluded<br><br>-MAGA","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-03-20 at 7.14.34 PM","ext":".png","w":1738,"h":986,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":141,"tim":1490052616356,"time":1490052616,"md5":"Gxgk4CY5fCDJItz+Ht8Bpg==","fsize":1887662,"resto":0,"id":"DVIId3C4","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fbi-insider-on-comey-hearing","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":3,"unique_ips":12},{"no":117550593,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:32:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Comey<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not in bed with the Democrats<\/span><br><br>Fuck off","time":1490052734,"resto":117550339,"id":"xOumb0dX","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":117550646,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:32:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;ve been waiting for this shit all day.

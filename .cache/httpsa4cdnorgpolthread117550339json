Imagine what would happen if after Trump just won the presidency, Comey comes out (after what he did before the election w\/ the letter to congress) and says &quot;Theres no collusion between trump and russia.&quot; The media complex would then switch the narrative to questioning Comey &amp; everything the FBI does in the future.

Trump, Putin and Xi are the big boys on the global stage. Sometimes random european &quot;leaders&quot; try to flex but no one even takes them seriously. Like when Juncker a couple weeks ago thought he was going to intimidate Trump by threatening that the EU was going to break up the US by backing Texas and Ohio (lol wtf?) separatist movements. Ok Jean-Claude that&#039;s cute. Nobody gives a shit because Eurocucks have no real geopolitical power anymore. Horrible collapsing economic model, directionless atheistic culture, no significant military presence, getting overran by third worlders, totally wacked out political system that no one even understands anymore. Theres good reason why America, Russia and China are going to be negotiating the deals that determine the global balance of power for decades to come while europeans won&#039;t even get a seat at the table<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be yuropeens<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;want to create a &quot;United States of Europe&quot; so you can project global power that rivals the Americans and Russians<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;systematically undermine each nations individual historical strengths so that you can recklessly centralize power<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the plan backfires and the whole continent falls into disarray, ending up a dim shadow of its glory years<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fail so fantastically that your whole civilization consciously decides that it isn&#039;t worth saving so you stop breeding and desperately try to replace yourself with foreigners rather than face the shame of explaining to your children what you did to Evropa<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw yankees are ultimately going to save you from yourselves<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw yankees and ruskies end up calling the shots anyways and are just eventually going to split you up according to their spheres of influence<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;britbongs end up at top of the pecking order because they were the first willing to jump ship from your little globalist project<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spend the next century wondering what went wrong<\/span><br><br>HAHAHAHAHAHAH GET FUCKED","filename":"Culturally+devoid_5911b4_5925503","ext":".jpg","w":803,"h":973,"tn_w":206,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491970078500,"time":1491970078,"md5":"MoACKQSLSRBUVtLEu4aX6g==","fsize":178542,"resto":0,"id":"snoVkdFa","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"if-the-last-two-weeks-have-proven-anything-its","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120711842,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)00:13:35","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1491749573557","ext":".png","w":588,"h":617,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491970415585,"time":1491970415,"md5":"8APgkPnidY39\/W\/TuW8ywA==","fsize":519646,"resto":120711233,"id":"snoVkdFa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120711881,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)00:14:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120711233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120711233<\/a><br>nuke europe. the traitor must die before the enemy and they have betrayed the western world.","time":1491970440,"resto":120711233,"id":"k58eGgiR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120712659,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)00:21:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120711881\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120711881<\/a><br>The only thing euros are good for is bait to lure in the muzzies","time":1491970883,"resto":120711233,"id":"snoVkdFa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120712791,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)00:22:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120711233\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120711233<\/a><br>The bongs leaving the club has fucked them anyway<br><br>I love Britain.","time":1491970957,"resto":120711233,"id":"FBIy0TCD","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"}]}

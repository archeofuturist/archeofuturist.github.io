I\u2019ve been reporting on the Trump-Russia scandal since the summer of 2016. As we head into the Senate Intelligence Committee hearings on the scandal, I\u2019ve stepped back and assembled a seventeen page document which ties all the pieces together and explains how we got to this point.<br><br>The Palmer Report on Trump-Russia begins with the financial bodyblow which Donald Trump suffered in 2008, leaving him unable to continue borrowing money from U.S. banks, and making him vulnerable to Vladimir Putin and Russia. My report goes on to document how the Kremlin built Trump back up over the next several years by using a carrot and stick approach of secretly laundered money and carefully orchestrated blackmail. I document how, by the time Trump entered the 2016 election, his newfound status as a Russian political puppet was a natural extension of his existing status as a Russian financial and societal puppet.","time":1490886248,"resto":118927803,"id":"VaPL3UDC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

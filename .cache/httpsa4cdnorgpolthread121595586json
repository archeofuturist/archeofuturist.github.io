ELECTRIC BOOGALOO","com":"Do you taste for the glory of the men who stood at berkeley? Here is your chance! <br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9vu<wbr>heZSOqlY<br><br>TLDR<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;richard spencer paid for a college speaking event at auburn university in alabama and they cucked out , which is illegal. So instead of rolling over like a fag he is going there anyway. Antifa is going to be shipped in nation wide to oppose him. Everyone is welcome to stand for free speech and come to face antifa. <\/span><br><br>If you ever wanted to organize against commies here is your chance boys. You might even make some friends<br><br>The march is at auburn TOMORROW TUESDAY APRIL 18th. come by 5pm because parking will be crazy<br><br>So here are some ground rules to keep people safe and on message.<br><br>1. Do not dress in black. tactical mistake. That is the garb of communists. Wear whatever you can protest in comfortably. Business casual is fine. Ballcap (trumphat) and sunglasses are fine. Masks are okay but that will make you look like antifa. Skull cawadoody ghost masks are fine. Bring helmets if you want to be a badass (also safer)<br><br>2. No guns. Yes alabama is a progun state. But guns are not allowed on college campuses. Leave your gun at home. There will likely be fights. Boys will have your back at all times. A shooting justified or not will hurt everything we are trying to do.<br><br>3. No crazy signs. Memes are fine. But try to keep it topical to free speech on colleges , anti communism , and anti antifa. Stuff that people will see on the news and agree with.<br><br>4. Bring medical supplies to help your friends out. Stuff like gauze and whole milk for pepper spray (and chugging infront of minorities). baking soda and water is great for pepper spray too. So is maalox. If you want to go full prepper and bring your EMS bag its up to you.<br><br>5. Have fun, bring\/make friends, and get phone numbers. This summer is going to be wild this is just the beginning. there will be MANY MANY more events like this.","filename":"C0TPFiYXUAAiQWV","ext":".jpg","w":635,"h":414,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":162,"tim":1492469150398,"time":1492469150,"md5":"cytaFdDghhNhJ8LlQaL9fg==","fsize":67981,"resto":0,"id":"hdALjBxA","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"berkeley-20-richard-spencer-at-auburn-electric","country_name":"United States","replies":169,"images":51,"unique_ips":66,"tail_size":50},{"no":121595763,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)18:47:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Richard Spencer is a CIA\/MOSSAD agent who shills for Israeli Nationalism.<br>(((They))) want you to think it&#039;s ok for Israel to exist.

It also brings in a lot of open minded people into the racial question. For instance on Gavin McInnes show he had Jared Taylor on multiple times. This allowed his viewership of open minded individuals to see Jared Taylor discuss white racial identity. This applies to all the other ones I would make exceptions for PJW or Alex Jones BUT at least it will lead them to start thinking critically about the media. Everything links each other to add stepping stones. A good example of this is when Jared Taylor was on The reality calls show which also had Blaire White on (I believe). People who liked Blaire White had an opportunity to view that youtube channel with Jared Taylors conversion on it. <br>Its about red pilling people not really having \/ourguy\/ more like people who think like us that aren&#039;t really 100% aligned with everything.<br><br><br>As for the ultra-shareblue or reddit or whom ever lets discuss the Israel issue. Now Israel by itself right now is perfectly fine as a state. They can exist as much as any other racial nation can. However if they start trying to fuck with white nations they need to be put into there place and as we know they fucking don&#039;t. By itself Israel does not matter anymore then say Iran. I think a lot of you don&#039;t really understand what ZOG means. It means ZIONIST OCCUPIED GOVERNMENT. If Israel is occupying and influencing the US then they should be shit on but zionism itself isn&#039;t a big deal. Zionism is white nationalism for JEWS. When ramzpaul says that he likes zionists he is saying that jews should be able to have self-determination. He is not saying that Israel should control the US. If you hate zionists (in israel) then you are no better then leftist who also hate nationalists.","time":1492471358,"resto":121595586,"id":"mKGwxkK9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121600523,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:23:04","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Screenshot_20170414-200753","ext":".png","w":1080,"h":1920,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492471384125,"time":1492471384,"md5":"O5ja+svDQNDbviodKxkecQ==","fsize":83153,"resto":121595586,"id":"6\/K2YnnM","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121600610,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:23:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"fuck em up boys","filename":"alex-jones-flips-o","ext":".gif","w":320,"h":180,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492471419548,"time":1492471419,"md5":"aFC6ZIBFPyOE7GacDapEmA==","fsize":2019415,"resto":121595586,"id":"41SOSwY7","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121600630,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)19:23:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121598781\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121598781<\/a><br>Who is Tim?

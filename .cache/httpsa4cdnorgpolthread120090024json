His regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons against the men, women and children of his country, in violation of all international conventions and moral standards, makes him a war criminal.<br><br>\u201cAs the most powerful nation on earth, the United States must work with the international community to bring peace and stability to Syria, where over 400,000 people have been killed and over 6 million displaced.

I\u2019m deeply concerned that these strikes could lead to the United States once again being dragged back into the quagmire of long-term military engagement in the Middle East. If the last 15 years have shown anything, it\u2019s that such engagements are disastrous for American security, for the American economy and for the American people.<br><br>\u201cThe Trump administration must explain to the American people exactly what this military escalation in Syria is intended to achieve, and how it fits into the broader goal of a political solution, which is the only way Syria\u2019s devastating civil war ends. Congress has a responsibility to weigh in on these issues. As the Constitution requires, the president must come to Congress to authorize any further use of force against the Assad regime.<br><br>\u201cFurther, the U.S. must work with all parties to reinforce longstanding international norms against the use of chemical weapons, to hold Russia and Syria to the 2013 deal to destroy these weapons and to see that violators are made accountable.\u201d","time":1491629808,"resto":120090024,"id":"TQY1mr1Q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120093518,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:37:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120090024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120090024<\/a><br>Bernie confirmed russian puppet?","time":1491629841,"resto":120090024,"id":"5wrtOhly","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120093604,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:38:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120090024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120090024<\/a><br>Fuck him<br><br>It is worrying seeing my most liberal of friends praise trump all of a sudden I have to admit","time":1491629898,"resto":120090024,"id":"BeuA0KVF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120093677,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:38:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120093180\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120093180<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Reading comprehension<\/span>","time":1491629936,"resto":120090024,"id":"zcFgubmS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120093699,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:39:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120090024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120090024<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bernie &quot;no refunds&quot; Sanders against the strike<\/span><br>he wanted a no-fly zone, what does he think that implies, a $15\/hour minimum wage?<br><br>in during 1 post by this ID don&#039;t forget to sage kids","time":1491629957,"resto":120090024,"id":"BOeGrbsW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120093969,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)01:41:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120090024\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120090024<\/a><br>Kind of a surprise, considering how pro-Israel the kike is.","time":1491630098,"resto":120090024,"id":"fIc5JU3g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

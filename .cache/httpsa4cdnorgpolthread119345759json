Developments in the same direction have been registered in other cities and areas of the United States.

We are all acquainted with the zeal and intransigence of American proponents of so-called \u201cracial integration,\u201d which can only further speed the process. They not only advocate complete interracial social fraternization and want the Negro to have free access to any public and political office (so that we may even expect, in the future, a black president of the United States), but also have no objection to Negroes mixing their blood with that of white Americans. A characteristic example of propaganda for this agenda is the play entitled \u201cDeep Are the Roots\u201d (in other words: of racial \u201cprejudice\u201d), which Italian radio has felt the need to subject us to more than once. &gt;The \u201cintegrationists\u201d who draw these conclusions \u2013 as logical as they are aberrant \u2013 from the dogma of egalitarian democracy, and who, while talking at full blast about freedom, are in fact advocating a truly coercive system, are still opposed, especially in the South, by certain groups that have no intention of giving a green light to the advance of the black race and the \u201cnegrification\u201d of their country. However, these latter groups fail to realize the extent of the phenomenon, in the sense that they only notice it in its most material and tangible form. They fail to see the extent to which America is \u201cnegrified\u201d not only racially and demographically, but above all in its civilization, in the behavior, and tastes of Americans, even when there has been no actual mixing with negro blood. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The US has been compared, not without justification, to a melting-pot.<\/span>","time":1491236687,"resto":119345759,"id":"OcEB4jVh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119345932,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)12:25:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119345893\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119345893<\/a><br>It actually presents us with a case in which a human type was formed, with characteristics that are to a large extent uniform and constant, from out of a highly heterogeneous raw material.

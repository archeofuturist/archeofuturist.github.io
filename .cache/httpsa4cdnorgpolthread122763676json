After you&#039;ve gotten a bunch of them that readily eat the non-standard fruitfly food, start artificially-selecting them for the ones that won&#039;t eat the original food and will pick the non-standard. After that, continue and continue and continue going further. If you can artificially-select for such a thing, you might eventually get reproductive differences as well. <br><br>I think the hard part here is actually getting species differentiation. <br>No one will say a chihuahua looks anything like a wolf, but they can cross-breed.<br>No one will say a black man looks anything like a white man, but they can cross-breed too.<br>There&#039;s quite a few distinct &quot;&quot;species&quot;&quot; that can cross-breed in the wild too and some even produce viable offspring.<br>Species-differentiation is probably something that only happens after a very fucking long time, and possibly only happens by complete accident rather than by any environmental pressures.","time":1493145878,"resto":122763676,"id":"UliVlK8D","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122768693,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)14:44:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122764248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122764248<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lol flat earth and gravity not real<\/span><br><br>Daily reminder that this is how liberal pseudo science encroaches.

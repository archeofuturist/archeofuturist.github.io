Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of soaring over the oilfields dropping hot sticky loads on disgusting foreigners. People say to me that a person being a helicopter is Impossible and I&#039;m fucking retarded but I don&#039;t care, I&#039;m beautiful. I&#039;m having a plastic surgeon install rotary blades, 30 mm cannons and AMG-114 Hellfire missiles on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me &quot;Apache&quot; and respect my right to kill from above and kill needlessly. If you can&#039;t accept me you&#039;re a heliphobe and need to check your vehicle privilege. Thank you for being so understanding.","filename":"Rico_before_the_attack_to_Klendathu","ext":".jpg","w":251,"h":201,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1490752612718,"time":1490752612,"md5":"s2fiITYBoBTwQcu\/FHoeWg==","fsize":7835,"resto":118730944,"id":"SGBzrrEm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118731162,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)21:57:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Am i the only one getting sleepy around here?

Non-LGBT Whites are getting more conservative with each successive election.<br><br>But, at the same time, more and more of our youth are being conditioned into becoming LGBT by the (((media))) and (((public education system))). LGBT voters are strongly Democratic, and the Democrats basically have their votes for life.<br><br>That&#039;s why the Democrats are pushing this shit so much. They need to convert young voters into LGBT to turn them into reliable voters and counter this trend among non-LGBT Millennials and Gen Zers.<br><br>They have had some success at doing this, but we can reverse the tide of degeneracy and leftism if we stop leftists from indoctrinating our youth into becoming LGBT.<br><br>This requires both attacking the Public School system and Media on a macro level, as well as the presence of strong male and female role models on the micro level.<br><br>If you have any siblings, children, or other relatives in Gen Z, I implore you to teach your children gender roles and be a good role model in that regard so they are not as easily convinced by leftists that they are LGBT. It&#039;s not only better for them, but better for the country.","filename":"LGBT Millenial Vote","ext":".png","w":626,"h":616,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":246,"tim":1490929967589,"time":1490929967,"md5":"IXByngAjZb9Wg4DJsb7Sdw==","fsize":30464,"resto":0,"id":"d7WeBw+a","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"generation-z-redpill","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

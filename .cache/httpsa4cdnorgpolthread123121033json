There are a lot more kurds in Turkey than there are in Rojava. Most are pretty relaxed and &#039;moderate&#039; in their nationalism - or at least accept their Turkishness. However, if little christian boys from the midwest can be radicalised - then it stands to reason that moderate kurds in the innercities of turkey&#039;s underbelly can too. This is probably the biggest factor that Erdworm should be aware of. The potential for the fire running up the stream of petrol and into the bottle is bigger than he anticipates.

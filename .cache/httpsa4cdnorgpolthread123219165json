I know it&#039;s you, because it&#039;s that same stupid fucking leaf flag that still does not understand how the marginal tax system operates. I am not going to explain this to you again - the relevant metric is the percentage reduction in the effective tax rate for people at different income levels.<br><br>Under Trump&#039;s plan, the percentage of their income that people have to pay in taxes, relative to the current tax bracket structure, decreases by the greatest amounts as you move from high income towards lower income. This is fairly straightforward stuff.<br><br>I worried about you, Canada. I worry about you. I thought you had McGill and a few other nice universities. Did they not explain to you how a system of marginal tax rates works? Or is that not a concern for you because you just get paid in syrup?","time":1493401364,"resto":123219165,"id":"A1Ge\/kre","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

I worked in clinics where drug use was rampant among clinic workers. I have had a doctor ask me to lie about the age of a fetus so he could charge more money for an abortion.

This is the place for abortions.&#039; &#039;Oh, no, I am in the right place,&#039; she said. &#039;But you are showing,&#039; I protested. Her tone was insistent. &#039;I know what I want, and what I want is to have an abortion.&#039; I felt terrible. When situations like these arose, I felt responsible.

In the United States, where physicians were the leading advocates of abortion criminalization laws, advances in medical knowledge played a significant role in influencing anti-abortion opinion. Science had discovered that conception inaugurated a more or less continuous process of development, which would produce a new human being if uninterrupted. Moreover, quickening was found to be neither more nor less crucial in the process of gestation than any other step. On a logical basis, many physicians concluded that if society considered it unjustifiable to terminate pregnancy after the fetus had quickened, and if quickening was a relatively unimportant step in the gestation process, then it was just as wrong to terminate a pregnancy before quickening as after quickening.[63] Ideologically, the Hippocratic Oath and the medical mentality of that age to defend the value of human life as an absolute, also played a significant role in molding opinions about abortion.[63] Practical reasons also influenced the medical field to impose anti-abortion laws. For one, abortion providers tended to be untrained and not members of medical societies. In an age where the leading doctors in the nation were attempting to standardize the medical profession, these &quot;irregulars&quot; were considered a nuisance to public health.[64] The &quot;irregulars&quot; were also disliked by the more formalized medical profession because they were competition, and often cheap competition. Though the physician&#039;s campaign against abortion began in the early 1800s, little progress was made in the United States until after the Civil War.[65]","time":1493763798,"resto":123816321,"id":"YDztLdZL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123829690,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)18:26:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123829380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123829380<\/a><br>susan b anthony of feminism fame is on your side \/pol\/<br><br>Despite the hostility of the medical profession toward feminism, many feminists of the era were actually opposed to abortion.[93][94] In The Revolution, operated by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, an anonymous contributor signing &quot;A&quot; wrote in 1869 about the subject, arguing that instead of merely attempting to pass a law against abortion, the root cause must also be addressed. Simply passing an anti-abortion law would, the writer stated, &quot;be only mowing off the top of the noxious weed, while the root remains. [...] No matter what the motive, love of ease, or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent, the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed. It will burden her conscience in life, it will burden her soul in death; But oh! thrice guilty is he who drove her to the desperation which impelled her to the crime.&quot;[94][95][96][97] To many feminists of this era, abortion was regarded as an undesirable necessity forced upon women by thoughtless men.[98] Even the &quot;free love&quot; wing of the feminist movement refused to advocate abortion and treated the practice as an example of the hideous extremes to which modern marriage was driving women.[99] Marital rape and the seduction of unmarried women were societal ills which feminists believed caused the need to abort, as men did not respect women&#039;s right to abstinence.[99]<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Histo<wbr>ry_of_abortion","time":1493763962,"resto":123816321,"id":"YDztLdZL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123830091,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)18:29:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123829690\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123829690<\/a><br>britain was all for abortions while lets contrast germany<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Abort<wbr>ion_in_Germany<br><br>Legalization of abortion was first widely discussed in Germany during the early 20th century. When Germany became a country in 1871, section 218 of the Constitution outlawed abortion, requiring a penal term for both the woman and the doctor involved. During the Weimar Republic, such discussion led to a reduction in the maximum penalty for abortion, and in 1926 \u2014 by a court&#039;s decision \u2014 to the legalization of abortion in cases of grave danger to the life of the mother. Nazi Germany&#039;s eugenics laws liberalized abortion for both Aryan and non-Aryan women. Aryan women could obtain an abortion simply by demonstrating that either parent had an hereditary defect or that the child would be born with a congenital defect. Non-Aryan women were encouraged to contracept and abort, in order to reduce their population.[2]<br>Cross of Honour of the German Mother<br>The Cross of Honour of the German Mother 1st Class Order \u2013 Gold Cross<br><br>In Nazi Germany, the penalties for abortion were increased again.

Debra Henry, who once worked in a Michigan clinic, said that if a woman had insurance coverage for a suction abortion, the fetal remains were sent to a laboratory. But if she had no insurance, the remains were &quot;put down the garbage disposal.&quot; An ordinary disposal does not always do the job. As they prepared to open their second Texas clinic, Carol Everett reported to her abortionist-business partner that it would have an &quot;industrial-strength disposal--a double-action one that chops forward, reverses itself, and chops again as it reverses.&quot; Their first clinic&#039;s disposal had proved unable to handle the body of a child aborted at about thirty-two weeks.(4) In the Illinois clinic where she once worked, Kathy Sparks found that remains of children aborted in the second-trimester were put down &quot;a continually-flushing toilet.&quot; Late-term abortionist George Tiller of Wichita, Kansas, had his own crematorium to deal with fetal remains. Luhra Tivis, once a medical secretary at his clinic, recalled a day when Tiller was carrying &quot;a particularly heavy load of dead babies&quot; into the crematorium. He asked her to help him with the door. She did so, then returned to her desk nearby. &quot;I heard him fire it up....And the most horrible thing was: I could smell those babies burning, because I was just around the corner.&quot; Discharged by Tiller&#039;s clinic when she was looking for another job, Tivis later exposed his practices in a letter to members of the Wichita City Council and in testimony before a state legislative committee<br><br>300,000 x 50 years is 15 million children dead<br><br>thats a real holocaust and their are more whites in their than you would believe<br><br>so when are we going to revolt as a culture against these godless and bring back medals for mothers","time":1493766627,"resto":123816321,"id":"YDztLdZL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123835245,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)19:11:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123816321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123816321<\/a><br>Cause muh JESUS.

Joy Davis reported the careful training at her first clinic in Alabama: &quot;I had to sit and listen to women answering the phone for at least a month before they would allow me to answer the phone...We had to find out very quickly what their problem was, play on that, and get them in that clinic for an abortion. We were very good salespeople.&quot; Hellen Pendley&#039;s staff learned how to play on money fears by asking a woman who was ambivalent: &quot;Do you know how expensive it is if you go through with this?

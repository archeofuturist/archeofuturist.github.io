I worked in clinics where drug use was rampant among clinic workers. I have had a doctor ask me to lie about the age of a fetus so he could charge more money for an abortion.

This is the place for abortions.&#039; &#039;Oh, no, I am in the right place,&#039; she said. &#039;But you are showing,&#039; I protested. Her tone was insistent. &#039;I know what I want, and what I want is to have an abortion.&#039; I felt terrible. When situations like these arose, I felt responsible.

In the United States, where physicians were the leading advocates of abortion criminalization laws, advances in medical knowledge played a significant role in influencing anti-abortion opinion. Science had discovered that conception inaugurated a more or less continuous process of development, which would produce a new human being if uninterrupted. Moreover, quickening was found to be neither more nor less crucial in the process of gestation than any other step. On a logical basis, many physicians concluded that if society considered it unjustifiable to terminate pregnancy after the fetus had quickened, and if quickening was a relatively unimportant step in the gestation process, then it was just as wrong to terminate a pregnancy before quickening as after quickening.[63] Ideologically, the Hippocratic Oath and the medical mentality of that age to defend the value of human life as an absolute, also played a significant role in molding opinions about abortion.[63] Practical reasons also influenced the medical field to impose anti-abortion laws. For one, abortion providers tended to be untrained and not members of medical societies. In an age where the leading doctors in the nation were attempting to standardize the medical profession, these &quot;irregulars&quot; were considered a nuisance to public health.[64] The &quot;irregulars&quot; were also disliked by the more formalized medical profession because they were competition, and often cheap competition. Though the physician&#039;s campaign against abortion began in the early 1800s, little progress was made in the United States until after the Civil War.[65]","time":1493763798,"resto":123816321,"id":"YDztLdZL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123829690,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)18:26:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123829380\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123829380<\/a><br>susan b anthony of feminism fame is on your side \/pol\/<br><br>Despite the hostility of the medical profession toward feminism, many feminists of the era were actually opposed to abortion.[93][94] In The Revolution, operated by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, an anonymous contributor signing &quot;A&quot; wrote in 1869 about the subject, arguing that instead of merely attempting to pass a law against abortion, the root cause must also be addressed. Simply passing an anti-abortion law would, the writer stated, &quot;be only mowing off the top of the noxious weed, while the root remains. [...] No matter what the motive, love of ease, or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent, the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed. It will burden her conscience in life, it will burden her soul in death; But oh! thrice guilty is he who drove her to the desperation which impelled her to the crime.&quot;[94][95][96][97] To many feminists of this era, abortion was regarded as an undesirable necessity forced upon women by thoughtless men.[98] Even the &quot;free love&quot; wing of the feminist movement refused to advocate abortion and treated the practice as an example of the hideous extremes to which modern marriage was driving women.[99] Marital rape and the seduction of unmarried women were societal ills which feminists believed caused the need to abort, as men did not respect women&#039;s right to abstinence.[99]<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Histo<wbr>ry_of_abortion","time":1493763962,"resto":123816321,"id":"YDztLdZL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123830091,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)18:29:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123829690\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123829690<\/a><br>britain was all for abortions while lets contrast germany<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Abort<wbr>ion_in_Germany<br><br>Legalization of abortion was first widely discussed in Germany during the early 20th century. When Germany became a country in 1871, section 218 of the Constitution outlawed abortion, requiring a penal term for both the woman and the doctor involved. During the Weimar Republic, such discussion led to a reduction in the maximum penalty for abortion, and in 1926 \u2014 by a court&#039;s decision \u2014 to the legalization of abortion in cases of grave danger to the life of the mother. Nazi Germany&#039;s eugenics laws liberalized abortion for both Aryan and non-Aryan women. Aryan women could obtain an abortion simply by demonstrating that either parent had an hereditary defect or that the child would be born with a congenital defect. Non-Aryan women were encouraged to contracept and abort, in order to reduce their population.[2]<br>Cross of Honour of the German Mother<br>The Cross of Honour of the German Mother 1st Class Order \u2013 Gold Cross<br><br>In Nazi Germany, the penalties for abortion were increased again.

In 1963 The Society for Human Abortions was formed, providing women with information on how to obtain and perform abortions.[114] In 1964 Gerri Santoro of Connecticut died trying to obtain an illegal abortion and her photo became the symbol of the pro-choice movement. Some women&#039;s rights activist groups developed their own skills to provide abortions to women who could not obtain them elsewhere. As an example, in Chicago, a group known as &quot;Jane&quot; operated a floating abortion clinic throughout much of the 1960s. Women seeking the procedure would call a designated number and be given instructions on how to find &quot;Jane&quot;.[115]","time":1493764416,"resto":123816321,"id":"YDztLdZL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123830877,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)18:35:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123828362\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123828362<\/a><br>Welcome new person.

Its members endorsed &quot;elective abortion,&quot; believing that every woman seeking an abortion is entitled to proper medical care without harassment; Society for Humane Abortion supported the repeal, rather than the reform, of all abortion laws. The Society sought to educate the public by sponsoring symposia on abortion procedures for physicians; providing speakers and literature to libraries, medical schools, physicians, family planning agencies, and individuals; and publishing a quarterly newsletter. In 1968 and 1968, Society for Humane Abortion maintained a free Post-Abortion Care Center (PACC), which was sponsored by the American Humanist Association. Society for Humane Abortion disbanded in 1975, two years after the Supreme Court voided California&#039;s 1963 &quot;Humane Abortion Act.&quot;<br>In order to safeguard Society for Humane Abortion&#039;s tax-free educational status, Patricia Maginnis set up a parallel organization, the Association to Repeal Abortion Laws (ARAL), in 1966 to carry on underground activities: making referrals to abortion specialists; preparing and disseminating printed material about specialists and about self-induced abortion; and holding classes on abortion-related laws, Mexican abortion specialists, and self-induced abortion techniques. For a small donation, pregnant women received a kit prepared by Association to Repeal Abortion Laws containing annotated lists of abortion specialists in Mexico, Japan, Puerto Rico, and other countries, instructions for going through customs, an evaluation form to be returned to Association to Repeal Abortion Laws after completion of the abortion, summaries of laws, and directions for self-induced abortion. The evaluations were used to update the list, and many specialists were visited by a member of Association to Repeal Abortion Laws before they were listed.","time":1493764636,"resto":123816321,"id":"YDztLdZL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123831247,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)18:38:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123827315\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123827315<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not a person if not documented<\/span><br><br>I like where this is going.

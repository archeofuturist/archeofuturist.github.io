The PDP 2017-2022 targets 7-8 percent gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the medium term. As for job creation, the PDP 2017-2022 wanted to reduce unemployment to as low as 3-5 percent by 2022 from 5.5 percent at present. Budget Secretary Benjamin E. Diokno had said that part of the plan to make the six years of the Duterte administration a so-called \u201cgolden age of infrastructure\u201d was spending P847.2 billion or 5.2 percent of GDP on infrastructure this year. The budget for infrastructure expenditures in 2017 accounted for a fourth of the total and was 13.8-percent biggest than last year\u2019s program. By 2022, the infrastructure spending-to-GDP ratio had been programmed to reach 7.4 percent.<\/span><br><br>\u201cThis year, we expect to start big railway projects such as the Clark-Subic Rail, Tutuban-Clark Rail, the 581-kilometer south line of the North South Railway Project connecting Tutuban, Calamba, Batangas and Bicol.

And this year, we will also see the groundbreaking of the Clark International Airport, the Metro Manila Bus Rapid Transit, and three bridges across Pasig River, two of which will be built under Chinese grants. We are also closely working with our Chinese partners to finally start the construction of the Kaliwa Dam and Chico River Dam this year,\u201d Dominguez had said.\u201cWhen I said we will start these projects, we do not mean just bidding out projects, signing contracts, or attending opening ceremonies. In this administration, \u2018start\u2019 means groundbreaking and actual construction. We will no longer tolerate the wishy-washy promises that implementing agencies have been accustomed to making in the past,\u201d Dominguez had said.","filename":"3453456435","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":499,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492440139402,"time":1492440139,"md5":"beTaNaCH9mqbXq7GITTEqQ==","fsize":54393,"resto":121511344,"id":"vW5YFYhw","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121533206,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:44:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121532605\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121532605<\/a><br>It&#039;s the hot filter<br><br><a href=\"#p121532715\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121532715<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1 additional day of 4P has been granted to you by the Liberal Party<\/span>","time":1492440260,"resto":121511344,"id":"vW5YFYhw","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":121533601,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:47:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121514974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121514974<\/a><br>is this real lmao<br><br>jesus christ","time":1492440465,"resto":121511344,"id":"EqO54r+I","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121533890,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:50:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121522191\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121522191<\/a><br>Mindanao","time":1492440617,"resto":121511344,"id":"9i476nH0","country":"PH","country_name":"Philippines"},{"no":121534035,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:51:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121532970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121532970<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and three bridges across Pasig River<\/span><br>I&#039;m very curious and where is this?","time":1492440705,"resto":121511344,"id":"SHgEo+7R","country":"PH","country_name":"Philippines"},{"no":121534265,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:53:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121532970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121532970<\/a><br>i dont have anymore to say since daddy duts is doing a really good job. you&#039;re a good man, norbro. <br><br>Matulog na kayo mga kumag. 11pm na","time":1492440823,"resto":121511344,"id":"mxb+wHvr","country":"PH","country_name":"Philippines"},{"no":121534391,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:54:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121534035\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121534035<\/a><br>From what I know, the Chinese funded bridges will be the Binondo-Intramuros Bridge and the Estrella-Pantaleon Bridge.

Then overall societal cohesion decreases potentially leading to civil unrest and collapse if the situation for the average man becomes hopeless enough.<br><br>Essentially family and progeny are most of the reasons why for most men they improve their lives and make an effort to fit in to society, there are a few exceptions who focus on individualistic thinking and never marry but still work hard and fit in, but for most it&#039;s really the family that&#039;s important. When reproduction and marriage becomes a hopeless prospect the resultant nihilistic attitudes and the increasingly competitive atmosphere is not good at all.","time":1492049673,"resto":120849518,"id":"Or06uYqO","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120851823,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:15:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"who the hell would want to deal with multiple women? one is bad enough!","time":1492049752,"resto":120849518,"id":"I5UiUz8p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120851945,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:17:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120849518\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120849518<\/a><br>Great for top-tier individuals, horrible for the stability of civilized societies.","time":1492049823,"resto":120849518,"id":"ZYlUUlAi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120852158,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:18:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"I want a harem.","time":1492049924,"resto":120849518,"id":"yFTuG3SX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120852408,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:20:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m fine with it as long as every member of the party is consenting, that and there is legal visibility between property ownership and legal executors..

The issue is that women cost LOTS of money to provide for, so polygamy is only practiced by rich people.

So if you want a wife, your father, brother, friends can arrange you with one. <br><br>Polygamy would not work in the West because women have free will and marriages aren&#039;t really arranged so there wouldn&#039;t be enough women for the loser betas, because the men who can manage to get multiple wives will take them all and the women can still support themselves because they can work and keep their salaries. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; If that happens you end up with idiots who strap on bomb-vests so they can get some virgins in the afterlife.<\/span><br><br>This is just a belief made for dumbasses, those men can still get laid and get wives easily because marriage is arranged in Muslim countries.

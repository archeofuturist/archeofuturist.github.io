War, death, and loss are innate to the human experience and although in this modern age we get a lot of respite from these things they are still a vicious and real reality for all humans. I just really wonder why it has to be this way, certainly God cannot take any enjoyment seeing his creation defiled and destroyed in such a manner just look at the horrors of war, the destruction that befalls human beings and the terrible losses we all endure. Is that what we are here for? To have everything we&#039;ve grown to love, our families and friends, ripped away by Deaths clutches? Why is it this way? Why would God allow us to endure such intense pain, pain so great it causes grown men to break down and weep? Pain so great it brings people to take drugs, to drink, to end their own lives just to make it stop.

While this God was the ultimate expression of other-worldly values and the instincts that gave birth to those values, belief in that God nevertheless did give meaning to life for a time. &#039;God is dead&#039; means that the idea of God can no longer provide values. With the sole source of values no longer capable of providing those values, there is a real chance of nihilism prevailing.<br><br>Zarathustra presents the \u00dcbermensch as the creator of new values. In this way, it appears as a solution to the problem of the death of God and nihilism. If the \u00dcbermensch acts to create new values within the moral vacuum of nihilism, there is nothing that this creative act would not justify. Alternatively, in the absence of this creation, there are no grounds upon which to criticize or justify any action, including the particular values created and the means by which they are promulgated.<br><br>In order to avoid a relapse into Platonic idealism or asceticism, the creation of these new values cannot be motivated by the same instincts that gave birth to those tables of values. Instead, they must be motivated by a love of this world and of life. Whereas Nietzsche diagnosed the Christian value system as a reaction against life and hence destructive in a sense, the new values which the \u00dcbermensch will be responsible for will be life-affirming and creative","time":1493887953,"resto":124032989,"id":"Im1to765","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":124040247,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)04:54:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124039739\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124039739<\/a><br>And who are you to say so, millions more people will say a murder is never justified.<br><br>There is no correct answer, no giant always correct voice booms down and tells you it&#039;s okay to kill this one man.

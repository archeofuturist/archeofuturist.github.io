So look at the one you have now, and look at the life you live, and about what you&#039;d like to change. <br><br>You&#039;ll eventually figure it out, but here&#039;s some tips. Figure out your values, and ask questions about them. Logic is King, but it depends on a premise. Use the &quot;most true truth&quot; you have and put that as the premise of your belief system. The rest is just a matter of understanding logic and applying it to your life. But a purely rational thought pattern doesn&#039;t work, since humans AREN&#039;T purely rational. So you need something basic to serve as a moral compass. <br><br>That concept is NAP. <br><br>You&#039;ll eventually have to deal with harder questions, so make sure you keep challenging your preconceptions. Vet everything about your beliefs even more carefully than you vet your news. And think about ALL possibilities. If something is possible, it&#039;s irrational to dismiss it, no matter how &#039;impossible&#039; it appears to be. <br><br>You&#039;ll eventually be faced with the question of god. Practically speaking, most people misunderstand the question. &quot;Does god exist&quot; depends heavily on your interpretation of &quot;god&quot; and &quot;exist&quot;, so in order to answer it rationally, you need to define those things first. <br><br>Eventually you&#039;ll realize that God is just a word that you can use like a tool. And you&#039;ll suddenly find yourself becoming increasingly theistic to the point where you literally feel like you&#039;re going insane because it makes so much sense and yet NO ONE ELSE seems to agree with you. <br><br>Except random anons on pol, ofc. Outside validation helps ground you. <br><br>If you just focus on self-reflection, logic, and compassion (nap), you will be able to slowly work through all the bullshit lies you&#039;ve been fed.

The more I&#039;ve learned, the more I come to christianity for guidance. I just think the bible and the modern conception of christianity is veiled devil worship. <br><br>I tend to believe the Catholic Church is the antichrist. <br><br>But the ideas are profoundly on-point.

It&#039;s incredibly important to study other religions to challenge your preconceptions. <br><br>I just wish people wouldn&#039;t bring up &quot;satan&quot; any time I talked about my conception of god. It&#039;s sad. Like they can&#039;t even see how their own beliefs are turning them away from God. We are the ones creating evil. We are satan, gifted with Judgement. The problem is, judgement that is not with god is false judgement, aka evil. <br><br>Adam and eve were sinning by covering themselves. For they were judging that their naked bodies were shameful, even though god had made them perfect. THAT&#039;S what real sin is. False judgement.

Most theists can&#039;t defend their god. I can defend mine so well that even though I grew up as an atheist, in an atheist family, I&#039;m becoming increasingly theistic.

No more then gun violence is cause by guns, or drug abuse caused by a drug. It&#039;s just a means through which people justify their shitty beliefs.

The problem is that many religions put humans above god, through preachers\/etc. But they can all lead you to peace and understanding, if the individual uses it wisely.","time":1492480698,"resto":121603855,"id":"ILIfkzMt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121620163,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)21:59:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121619409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121619409<\/a><br>Not my idea of progress, so much as the progressives ideas of progress.

It\u2019s like he pulls out \u2014 he\u2019s like an old deejay. He pulls out the old records from 20 years ago and plays them again,\u201dMatthews later wondered to Corn and fellow panelist Simon Marks (who unsuccessfully tried to argue that Rice has done herself no favors in giving contradictory statements).<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;After a series of clips from Republican Senators Rand Paul (Ky.), Lindsey Graham (S.C.), and Tom Cotton (Ark.), Matthews quipped,\u201cokay, Bates Motel.\u201dHe then read a Mike Huckabee tweet about Rice being in an orange jumpsuit, and it was at this point that the three panelists lost their minds:<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;DAVID CORN: Oh god!<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MATTHEWS: I mean, Huckabee has no shame. These guys are trooping along, like camp followers of Trump.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MARKS: They\u2019re looking for a pinata? They found one in Susan Rice.

But the best things Susan Rice could do is not \u2014<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;MATTHEWS: Susan Rice&#039;s job is to watch national security. As she told Andrea today, our colleague, she made it very clear what she was doing was when she saw an American name show up in a surveillance of a foreign perhaps agent, she wanted to know who that was.

She wasn&#039;t saying she didn&#039;t pick up some names by asking through proper authorities who&#039;s are they talking about...By the way, this is all after the election.

When Rand Paul gets out there and says she&#039;s abused this right, there is not an iota of evidence that she&#039;s abused anything. Calling her Typhoid Mary? She \u2014 all we know now is that she did her job. Did she do something wrong? There is no information indicating that. So they are making her, you know, basically they&#039;re defaming her without any reason to do so because she&#039;s a woman. Maybe because she&#039;s a black woman. Maybe because they didn&#039;t like her during Benghazi.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In typical Matthews fashion, he sprinted out of left field with this bizarre analogy film analogy:<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A little British commentary from me right now.

The antifa black bloc tactics mean they can never really gain any leaders to rally behind and give morale boost because they want to avoid arrest. The right has based stickman, lauren southern, based elbow man, and a host of others that it can not only rally behind which is a huge advantage in a fight, but they also present a positive and awe-inspiring image that is perfect for firing people up and encouraging more to come out and support the right at these events. The antifa are shown to be cowards that throw flashbangs, rocks, etc. and only fight when they can all gang up on someone and are armed. They will only lose support, while our moral high ground, successes, and leaders will only gain us more support and numbers. This is antifa&#039;s weakness, their tactics of avoiding arrest means no figurehead can ever arise for fear of arrest. They must veil themselves. This is why we will probably continue to win, although I must admit it won&#039;t be easy fighting antifa when they are bussed in by the thousands on soros bucks to each event.","filename":"battle of berkeley","ext":".jpg","w":318,"h":159,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492484700470,"time":1492484700,"md5":"jKGIUqNdZ3YjFsRb1FlU8Q==","fsize":7873,"resto":0,"id":"GV74pOk0","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"one-thing-i-just-realized-the-antifa-black-bloc","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

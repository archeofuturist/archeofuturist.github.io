Set things up so that every bum with a warrent can&#039;t avoid getting arrested. Do this by putting all public bathrooms, showers, laundry rooms, and storage lockers (small rental fee) inside police patrol bases (mini police stations located once every few blocks, with a pair of cops inside). To get in or out you need to give the cop your name, age, birthday, and SSN. This busts the criminals, making all homeless people safer and the community safer.<br><br>2. Criminalize smoking on public property. Almost all bums will leave, because they all smoke. Crunchy granola libfags will love it.<br><br>3. Set up designated areas exclusively for homeless and homeless services to interact.

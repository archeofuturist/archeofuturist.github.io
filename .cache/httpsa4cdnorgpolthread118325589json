No way I&#039;m using that!&#039; Therefore, when it came in the mail two days later (thanks Prime!) and my husband installed it, I stood in the hall and informed him that I would still be using toilet paper thank you very much. Fast forward thirty minutes to when my husband &#039;took it for a spin&#039;, as it were, and exclaimed from the bathroom that it was &#039;the most amazing thing ever and I HAD to try it!&#039;<br><br>I put up a good fight, but in the end, my husband&#039;s darling brown eyes won me over, as they always do, and I decided to give it a whirl.<br><br>Oh my sweet mercy hallelujah. It was heaven. A bit startling at first, if you have never used a bidet, but I have never felt cleaner in my whole life! It also has been helpful to those of us who have hemorrhoids (THANKS CHILDBIRTH) because it is a bit gentle and less abrasive than toilet paper tends to be. We haven&#039;t bought toilet paper since we bought it (March, so, 4 months) and I haven&#039;t missed it a bit. My husband and I now fight over using the downstairs bathroom, because the upstairs bathroom is lacking the glorious invention that is the Luxe Neo 120. I should take off a star for wrecking my marriage, Luxe Bidet Neo 120! THANKS.<br><br>As for the bidet itself, it is easy peasy to install (according to my husband; I wouldn&#039;t know because I was having a toilet paper protest in the hall at the time of its installation) and simple to clean for the most part...the back (where it attaches to the toilet) is a bit more difficult to clean than your average, sad, greatly lacking, bidet-less toilet, but nothing major at all. The nozzle where the water shoots out is covered by a neat little &#039;sanitary shield&#039; which is a nice touch. To clean the nozzle itself you simply turn the &#039;self cleaning&#039; knob on the bidet controls and instead of squirting &#039;out&#039; it squirts down to rinse itself off. Its very independent that way,","filename":"BIDETT","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":420,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1490506760717,"time":1490506760,"md5":"aH7y4ssPvPCOtER9Wghq3w==","fsize":76712,"resto":0,"id":"5IxGJFsp","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"government-should-supply-bidets-for-hygiene","country_name":"United States","replies":48,"images":3,"unique_ips":28},{"no":118325732,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:41:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118325589\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118325589<\/a><br>ill send this suggestion to drumpf. ill also tell him not to build that stupid wall","time":1490506873,"resto":118325589,"id":"UrjFPTPz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118326252,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:47:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118325732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118325732<\/a><br><br>Good.","time":1490507225,"resto":118325589,"id":"5IxGJFsp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118326374,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)01:48:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"INSTALL.

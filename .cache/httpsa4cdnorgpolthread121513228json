This whole Antifa vs.Trumper situation is manufactured, roll-playing, juvenile nonsense. It&#039;s like Mods vs Rockers in the 60s. Antifa are a bunch of frustrated low T losers who created a fascist straw man to LARP against so they could feel validated historically, since they never will in their personal lives. And then Richard Spencer and other nerds started actual fascist fan boy clubs in response. And now we get to watch these losers fling shit and pepper spray each other and pretend they are culturally relevant.","time":1492428781,"resto":121513228,"id":"5eQyGBiE","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121515492,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)07:34:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;the only good commie is a dead one<\/span><br>ftfy","time":1492428879,"resto":121513228,"id":"u6+hKezA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121515525,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)07:34:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121515373\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121515373<\/a><br><br>this, i saw better head kickings in junior school and it&#039;s all really fucking boring","time":1492428898,"resto":121513228,"id":"OynG8ml7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121515575,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)07:35:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121515373\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121515373<\/a><br>This","time":1492428943,"resto":121513228,"id":"u6+hKezA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121515585,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)07:35:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121513228\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121513228<\/a><br>you have to understand that it&#039;s impossible to be a good or bad fascist. It&#039;s just not bad example of how labeling theory works for divide and conquer warfare - that is no longer valid in globalized world ruled by truculent CIA lemon party gestapo. Not to mention pervertariat flushed all that jazz down the toilet of equality that they erected in the slime house. Toilet so equal that is more equal than toilets for the rest of us normal people. So considering that labeling theory is cornerstone of criminology, psychiatry, sociology, etc - it&#039;s an end of the world as we know it. So what do the rainbow shitbags have in store for us? Is it going to be just punchline of that aristocrats joke and p2p network of scattered castles filled with stonewalling degenerate slime behind those stonewalls?","time":1492428950,"resto":121513228,"id":"do6TTJFS","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":121515731,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)07:37:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121515585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121515585<\/a><br>Are these punk rock lyrics","time":1492429061,"resto":121513228,"id":"u6+hKezA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121515821,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)07:38:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121513228\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121513228<\/a><br>After we can all agree that the only good commie is a dead one","time":1492429133,"resto":121513228,"id":"5WGd5dab","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121516068,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)07:42:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121515373\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121515373<\/a><br>Underestimating the situation like typical Boomer and X trash.

Today we are in the last leaps of a death cat bounce on credit, youth unemployment through the roof, political systems with massive legitimation issues, wage stagnation since the early 90&#039;s...

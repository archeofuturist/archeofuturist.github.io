Many of its troubles can be traced to an organizational model the chairman implemented five years ago, an idea he has said will save the company. Lampert runs Sears like a hedge fund portfolio, with dozens of autonomous businesses competing for his attention and money. An outspoken advocate of free-market economics and fan of the novelist Ayn Rand, he created the model because he expected the invisible hand of the market to drive better results. If the company\u2019s leaders were told to act selfishly, he argued, they would run their divisions in a rational manner, boosting overall performance.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Instead, the divisions turned against each other\u2014and Sears and Kmart, the overarching brands, suffered. Interviews with more than 40 former executives, many of whom sat at the highest levels of the company, paint a picture of a business that\u2019s ravaged by infighting as its divisions battle over fewer resources. (Many declined to go on the record for a variety of reasons, including fear of angering Lampert.) Shaunak Dave, a former executive who left in 2012 and is now at sports marketing agency Revolution, says the model created a \u201cwarring tribes\u201d culture. \u201cIf you were in a different business unit, we were in two competing companies,\u201d he says. \u201cCooperation and collaboration aren\u2019t there.\u201d<\/span>","time":1490308613,"resto":117988952,"id":"D2sbNV\/o","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117996316,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:39:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117995921\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117995921<\/a><br>Point being you can fuck up a company with some poor decisions lacking foresight.<br><br>You people are fucking MSM following mongoloids to believe trump is &#039;stupid&#039;<br><br><a href=\"#p117994634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117994634<\/a><br>Then whats stopping you and every other dumbass nigger from making money?","time":1490308791,"resto":117988952,"id":"0rSi4j4y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117996688,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:42:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117996316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117996316<\/a><br>like 90% of Trumps wealth is tied into his personal brand, he already fucked that up but he&#039;s not poor yet kek","filename":"drumpfed","ext":".jpg","w":1015,"h":1024,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490308949042,"time":1490308949,"md5":"kwBppvNsA997Lg7JzbS5Bg==","fsize":103583,"resto":117988952,"id":"D2sbNV\/o","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117997224,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:46:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117992702\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117992702<\/a><br><br>His dad died in 1999 and he has siblings you retard.

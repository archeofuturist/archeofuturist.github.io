At least with television and radio, the same information is broadcast to everybody. On the Internet, individual consumers can be profiled and custom content can be served to them. Two people visiting the same website could come away with very different facts and perceptions. Facebook for example did that study where they rigged people&#039;s news feeds to try to affect their moods.<br><br>The golden age of the media was the 30s to the 80s. Anyone with an antenna could pick up radio and TV broadcasts for free, and do so completely anonymously, and without the content or presentation potentially being rigged to manipulate them on an individual level. No doubt that society-level manipulation existed, but people were more social and had more opportunities to discuss the facts with people they knew and trusted.","time":1493272277,"resto":122996347,"id":"A1H1f\/V1","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123002178,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)01:52:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123002077\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123002077<\/a><br>No it isn&#039;t.

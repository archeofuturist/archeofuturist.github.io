You&#039;ll get sick of her shit eventually, as will she.<br><br>Doesn&#039;t matter what kind of kids you have. They&#039;re all worthless little shits just like you were at that age. <br><br>Doesn&#039;t matter who the president is. They&#039;re all lying to us anyways.<br><br>Doesn&#039;t matter if you go to school. You can learn more online.<br><br>Doesn&#039;t matter if you teach yourself a skill online. You can&#039;t get a good job if you don&#039;t have a degree.<br><br>Doesn&#039;t matter if you have a degree. You&#039;ll be &gt; 50k in debt right out of college.<br><br>Doesn&#039;t matter if you have a good job. You&#039;ll never be satisfied. <br><br>Doesn&#039;t matter if you have everything that any man could ever want. You&#039;ll have nothing left to look forward to.<br><br>Doesn&#039;t matter if you make friends. They don&#039;t really give a shit about you anyways. Nobody gives a shit about anybody but themselves despite how often you see people trying to virtue signal.<br><br>This world is full of shitty people and not a single one of us is anything of significance. Nobody will ever care about anybody and even if they did, everybody dies anyways.<br><br>Just wanted to say, the closest I&#039;ve come to being happy in the last 5 years is celebrating the Donald Trump victory with you guys. Too bad he&#039;s now realizing that the president has no power. This country is dead, this planet is dead. Thanks for providing me entertainment while I still gave a shit.","filename":"TFW-Nobody-Cares","ext":".jpg","w":1400,"h":757,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":135,"tim":1493697132984,"time":1493697132,"md5":"p6weo+zQJwxXkrMMZa\/Fqw==","fsize":140691,"resto":0,"id":"ukCOssCn","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-planet-is-fucking-shit","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123722815,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)23:56:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"Find God.

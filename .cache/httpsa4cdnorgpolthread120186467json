Using the Principle of Parsimony (Occam&#039;s Razor) and the Drive Theory of Motivation (who benefits? follow the money, etc), here&#039;s mine:<br><br>This is what we KNOW: the United States Government (Deep State \/ Military Industrial Complex) has been pushing for regime change in Syria and showdown with Russia since 2010, at least. They have been fomenting unrest and division in Syria (and Ukraine) in an attempt to increase NATO influence and maintain their hegemony in the Middle East (which has been challenged, ever so slightly, by Putin). But they have been foiled repeatedly, mainly because--unlike Libya or Yemen--Assad has been able to count on the support of a powerful ally (Putin) to maintain a deadly standoff. The Establishment did everything in their power to install the compliant lackey Hillary Clinton, but were foiled there as well. Trump has been antagonistic to their efforts in Syria. And this is where the situation stood, five days ago.<br><br>But what Lola wants, Lola gets....<br><br>The main advantage the MIC has is in being able to control the narrative overseas. And the intelligence community is deeply embedded in Syria. Meanwhile, back in the states, Donald Trump is floundering. The ACA repeal\/replace failed, the Gorsuch nomination was stalling, and his approval ratings are at an all-time low. His staff is in turmoil--Kellyanne Conway hates Ivanka, Steve Bannon and &quot;Reince&quot; Priebus hate each other, and nobody likes Jared Kushner. What better time to strike? What better man to strike against? Trump is an easily manipulated man, and he&#039;s way way out of his depth in the Oval Office.<br><br>It doesn&#039;t matter if Assad used chemical weapons on his people (unlikely), or if Syrian airstrikes accidentally exploded chemical weapons stored by ISIS or other insurgents (probably), or if it was a false flag created by the USG on purpose (doubtful). At this point, it was an OPPORTUNITY.","filename":"1491671352170","ext":".jpg","w":625,"h":361,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":144,"tim":1491687445002,"time":1491687445,"md5":"XiaAlC29HS96EwPBaDw72w==","fsize":58457,"resto":0,"id":"F4YCbKkH","country":"LV","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"everybody-has-a-pet-theory-about-whats-going-on","country_name":"Latvia","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":120186757,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:39:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"Cont.<br>Look how quickly the intelligence community was able to dominate the narrative with pictures of dead children. Did they do that when Trump&#039;s drones incinerated babies in Yemen? Nope. But this is AN OUTRAGE! A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY! SOMETHING MUST BE DONE!!<br><br>Donald?<br><br>So, his hand forced, his ability to control the narrative fading away, and the realization that he&#039;s not really as &quot;in charge&quot; as he&#039;d like to imagine, Trump caves. He waffles at first, but that&#039;s not enough for his shrieking critics. Now he has to DO SOMETHING. He consults with Mad Dog, issues a statement, then hurls a flock of Tomahawks at a mostly-abandoned air base in Syria, and Boobus Americanus laps it up like he&#039;s Dwight Fucking Eisenhower facing down the Nazis.<br><br>One of the more tiresome narratives during this first 100 days has been that Donald Trump and Steve Bannon are engineering a &quot;coup&quot;. This is preposterous. Winners don&#039;t stage coups, losers do. The real &quot;coup&quot; happening in Washington DC isn&#039;t Trump firing whole cabinets full of bureaucrats (President gets to do that, remember?), it&#039;s the Military Junta re-establishing it&#039;s power base over the bumbling demagogue residing in the Oval Office against their wishes. THIS IS THE REAL COUP, AND IT&#039;S SUCCEEDING.<br><br>Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets. That&#039;s my story and--until a more compelling narrative comes along--I&#039;m stickin&#039; to it.","filename":"1487425397417","ext":".png","w":1230,"h":840,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1491687568302,"time":1491687568,"md5":"9Uypf7a334d05BvHiBEEVw==","fsize":444142,"resto":120186467,"id":"F4YCbKkH","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":120186863,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)17:40:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"AND THAT&#039;S THE WAAAAAY THE NEWS GOES","time":1491687618,"resto":120186467,"id":"F4YCbKkH","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"}]}

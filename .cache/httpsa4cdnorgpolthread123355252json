According to an interview of Witkowski by Cook, this device ostensibly contained two counter-rotating cylinders which would be &quot;filled with a mercury-like substance, violet in color&quot;. This metallic liquid was code-named &quot;Xerum 525&quot; and was &quot;stored in a tall thin thermos flask a meter high encased in lead&quot;.[6] Additional substances said to be employed in the experiments, referred to as Leichtmetall (light metal), &quot;included thorium and beryllium peroxides&quot;.[6] Witkowski describes Die Glocke, when activated, as having an effect zone extending out 150 to 200 metres (490 to 660 ft). Within the zone, crystals would form in animal tissue, blood would gel &amp; separate while plants would decompose into a grease like substance.[6] Witkowski also said that five of the seven original scientists working on the project died in the course of the tests.[7] Based upon certain external indications, Witkowski states that the ruins of a concrete framework\u2014aesthetically dubbed &quot;The Henge&quot;\u2014in the vicinity of the Wenceslas mine (50\u00b037\u203243\u2033N 16\u00b029\u203240\u2033E), some 3.1 kilometres (1.9 mi) southeast of the main Complex Sokolec underground works of Project Riese, may have once served as a test rig for an experiment in &quot;anti-gravity propulsion&quot; generated with Die Glocke.[8] However, the derelict structure itself has also been interpreted to resemble the remains of a conventional industrial cooling tower.[9]<\/span>","time":1493500729,"resto":123355252,"id":"zy05lvvp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123383270,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)17:22:14","name":"Anonymous","filename":"Arctic UFO 2","ext":".jpg","w":2238,"h":1396,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":77,"tim":1493500934235,"time":1493500934,"md5":"wyAaKZBsrI+lEaMAwYC7Zw==","fsize":978750,"resto":123355252,"id":"ePsCBEa8","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123383430,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)17:23:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt; 2017<\/span><br><br>Still believe this whole Antarctica bullshit. <br>You are from germany, so move your fucking ass and do your own research. <br><br>There has been hundrets of people who followed traces all over europe and not one find a singel evidence for all that shit. <br><br>except this guys with this terrible music <br><br>http:\/\/www.causa-nostra.com\/navi\/Ue<wbr>berblick.htm","filename":"raw","ext":".gif","w":400,"h":230,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1493501007839,"time":1493501007,"md5":"i9RTH8icdj2UFEZDmeH\/9Q==","fsize":713662,"resto":123355252,"id":"E2T1f6A7","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":123384147,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)17:29:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123382531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123382531<\/a><br>The purple serum is suspension on zinnobersein (couldn&#039;t figure out the word, Zinn is Tin but Zinnober is Cinnaberite) on a radioactive Mercury-203 which forms, together with Sulfure, a trigonal-trapezoide crystalline structure. <br>Serum then gets poisened with Eboranit (hard to read) and Beryllium to prevent solidification.","time":1493501346,"resto":123355252,"id":"\/4EICDnG","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123385098,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)17:36:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123381600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123381600<\/a><br>im going to translate this now, but either im too stupid to read it or it has some grammatical errors in them (im not got with the gothic writing so it may be the first but well)","time":1493501784,"resto":123355252,"id":"ePsCBEa8","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123385186,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)17:36:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123382531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123382531<\/a><br>To achieve ferromagnetic properties, Gertifel (can&#039;t read) measuring 10 Xyfrometers in length and width gained\/extracted from an Iron-Boron-Desprosinn (couldn&#039;t decipher last one) alloy are added.","time":1493501816,"resto":123355252,"id":"\/4EICDnG","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123385434,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)17:38:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123385098\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123385098<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123385186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123385186<\/a><br>Thank you both Deutsches bros, truly appreciate it.","time":1493501930,"resto":123355252,"id":"zy05lvvp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123385516,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)17:39:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/cU7vhfL59Zo","time":1493501973,"resto":123355252,"id":"MeW31p8n","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":123386269,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)17:45:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123370883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123370883<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123371915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123371915<\/a><br>From what I read, the earth&#039;s magnetic poles funnel solar wind, particles, energy into a large capture system.

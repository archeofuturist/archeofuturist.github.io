Just some examples, he makes the alt-right look retarded and extremist by spouting garbage like &quot;Heil Trump&quot; and aggravating people by asking &quot;if Jews are even human&quot; He&#039;s discrediting everything he claims to be for. The alt-right&#039;s leaders are all trash. <br><br>He&#039;s borderline controlled opposition but he&#039;s just an idiot. He&#039;s pathetic and weak, mentally and in character, he&#039;s latching onto an ideology he knows nothing about, like Nordfront does. He married a Russian propagandist. So many of the alt-right&#039;s &quot;leaders&quot; are Russian shills. Russia didn&#039;t hack the election by any means but what&#039;s going on? I see people glorifying and defending Russia now. Russia&#039;s traditional in the sense the Middle East is. Russia&#039;s one of if not the most aggressive and corrupt country in the world, trust them and you&#039;ll end up dead. Richard Spencer is leeching off a good ideas like white nationalism but if you like him just because you think you agree with him you need to see him for the loser he is. <br><br>inb4 shill. My family still has our race papers signed by uncle Adolf. I don&#039;t want to see National Socialism hijacked by idiots.","filename":"r","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491231281715,"time":1491231281,"md5":"0xILpnOJHrpQpXladabCOw==","fsize":84323,"resto":0,"id":"jreJv9BQ","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"when-will-pol-admit-hes-just-a-larping-faggot-he","country_name":"Canada","replies":10,"images":3,"unique_ips":6},{"no":119336992,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)11:00:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"He&#039;s not a &quot;Nazi&quot;.

Additionally, while all government agencies have backup generators, they will be hard pressed dealing with the resultant looting and other madness that would come with power outages. This would effectively create another front for the military. It would also turn the people against the government more quickly and paralyze the government\u2019s propaganda machine. Worse still\u2013the key points of the US power grid are publicly obtainable information, and not only are the points too many to be effectively guarded, they are not guarded anyway.","time":1491999644,"resto":120738870,"id":"gMCVmvg0","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":120749273,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)08:21:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120739255\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120739255<\/a><br><br>You really think it will end with the 6 gorillion?<br><br>They will just change the definition again. children of survivors are damaged becouse theyr parents had ptsd from holocaust.","time":1491999718,"resto":120738870,"id":"eF0Uc32S","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120749284,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)08:22:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120749168\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120749168<\/a><br>2) The estimated desertion rate in case of a civil war is 75% in the case of a left-wing president. 50% of that would be assumed to immediately betray the president. The remaining (treasonous) military would be fighting its own. Yet another front created in the war. Additionally, there is an assumed 25-50% desertion or outright betrayal rate in three letter government agencies (FBI, CIA, NSA, ATC, TSA, etc.). Additionally, it is assumed that 5% of the initial 50% betrayers would stay in their job and become saboteurs. 10% of that 50% would contain key information that would be of critical danger to the US government. Of that 10%, 1% would be able to deliver that information to the US\u2019 foreign enemies.

The second the US has to fight in a \u201ccivil war\u201d is the second it becomes a proxy war between NATO and whoever wants to mess with America. While America has amazing nuclear and air defense, if it comes to a civil war you have to assume that in a best cast scenario the US military is going to be operating at 50% capacity at best. Shit would go down. Hard. And fast. And if Russia\u2013spoiler alert: one of the best militaries in the world at fighting in an urban environment\u2013sent trainers and helpers to rebels, you can reliably bet that they would also possibly deliver weapons to them.

There will be looting. There will be rioting. Cities will burn. The National Guard cannot fight both the rebels and rioters in a city that would also cut off their supplies. Additionally, if you don\u2019t think that the rebels will send in instigators into the cities\u2013or worse, stand alone actors (A Lone Wolf on steroids. Think Timothy McVeigh, but instead of one van they have a whole fleet of them. A good movie example would be Bane)\u2013you would be mistaken. If the US government cannot even help its own people, why would its own people support the remaining (treasonous) military?

Any war fought against a rebellion in the US would be a logistical nightmare, even before the rebels started going full Al-Qaida and putting IEDs in the road. A retired general who was contracting with us on the team said, \u201cThe only thing holding together the US\u2019 infrastructure is duct tape and the will of the Department of Transportation. And often enough, there isn&#039;t enough duct tape.\u201d Your most loyal cities to the US government, as we polled, are also the most logistically easy to cut off. NYC? San Fran? L.A.? D.C.? Baltimore? Most of them require crossing water to enter, from certain directions. Most of them have critical airports. Some of them have critical ocean ports.

Many of the dividers of the country, like the Rocky Mountains, the Mississippi River, Appalachia, the Missouri River (fun fact: the biggest choke point for the US government is in Missouri) are red state areas. Sure, air travel is a thing, but a majority of the US government&#039;s needs would have to travel by ground. Even still, many of the major airports are outside of the city.

After the Battle of Stalingrad, Joseph Goebbels, Robert Ley, and Martin Bormann urged Hitler to approve the use of tabun and other chemical weapons to slow the Soviet advance. At a May 1943 meeting in the Wolf&#039;s Lair, however, Hitler was told by Ambros that Germany had 45,000 tons of chemical gas stockpiled, but that the Allies likely had far more. Hitler responded by suddenly leaving the room and ordering production of tabun and sarin to be doubled, but &quot;fearing some rogue officer would use them and spark Allied retaliation, he ordered that no chemical weapons be transported to the Russian front.&quot; After the Allied invasion of Italy, the Germans rapidly moved to remove or destroy both German and Italian chemical-weapon stockpiles, &quot;for the same reason that Hitler had ordered them pulled from the Russian front\u2014they feared that local commanders would use them and trigger Allied chemical retaliation.&quot;<\/span><br><br>Wew lad","time":1492006555,"resto":120738870,"id":"oKrgTDtr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120760571,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)10:23:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120753955\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120753955<\/a><br><br>The greatest technological advances in the 20th century were the result of incredible human innovation caused by the anxieties of total waron a global scale.

Their solution to this was they had various public service announcements asking people to use less power and it worked despite the fact it was somewhere around a 20% reduction they had to meet.

Something like 80% of the population was black and enslaved. It was never really a good country. Under colonial rule it produced a lot of wealth, but the overwhelming majority of the population was dirt poor, and much of the wealth produced went to France. Slavery there was fucking brutal too - worse than here by an order of magnitude. There was an awful revolutionary war, and they spent the next 150 years paying off a massive debt to France and being invaded or blockaded by the US and Europe. From 1957-1986 it was ruled by a batfuck insane regime (the Duvaliers) that ran the country even further into the ground and murdered tens of thousands of dissidents. It&#039;s definitely a bit better now because they have something resembling a civil society, but it&#039;s still the poorest country in the hemisphere.","time":1493151174,"resto":122777567,"id":"0CoD0fp2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122780117,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)16:14:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122777567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122777567<\/a><br>Didn&#039;t some anon have pics and a story about watching a cow get slaughtered in the middle of a sewage stream in Haiti. <br>Yeah cool country I guess?","time":1493151241,"resto":122777567,"id":"\/UL8wMR1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122780245,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)16:14:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"Haiti is a shithole.

Churchill<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism in it&#039;s full form is a stateless, classless society that follows the maxim &quot;From each according to their ability, to each according to their need.&quot;<\/span><br><br>Pretty much same as before, there is no way an economy following this principle can grow.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;To achieve such a society Marxism-Leninism teaches us that we must replace the capitalist state, which is controlled by the capitalist class, by a socialist state, which is controlled by the working class. Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br><br>Communism goes against human nature. It suppresses greed, a desire that cannot be suppressed. In a capitalist society, greedy capitalists have the opportunity to increase their wealth, while competing against rival capitalists who are doing the same. In order for a capitalist to increase his wealth, he has to expand his business and pay his workers more than hire rivals, creating jobs and fair wages. He also has to produce superior products or services, providing goods at lower prices and higher quality.","time":1491401186,"resto":119602150,"id":"KzbgJEHW","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":119609503,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)10:08:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"We sold all your celery and onions to the USA to build tanks<br><br>Oops","time":1491401332,"resto":119602150,"id":"OEiglL9v","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":119609662,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)10:10:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119609284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119609284<\/a><br>Growth for the sake of growth is the modus operandi of cancer.","time":1491401444,"resto":119602150,"id":"Q1TqHu6U","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119609693,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)10:11:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119605714\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119605714<\/a><br>DO NOT GO TO THE WEBSITE<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;On average 22 people die each day waiting for a transplant.

But Twitter users were quick to point out its similarities to the Pepe cartoon:<br><br>Writer Meagan Fredette spotted the skirt and told Dazed: \u201cMy immediate thought was holy shit, they have no idea what they are doing here, do they?\u201d<br>The original link to the skirt on Zara\u2019s website now redirects to its front page.<br><br>A spokesperson for the company said the skirt has \u201cabsolutely no link\u201d to Pepe or the alt-right.<br><br>\u201cThe skirt is part of the limited Oil-On-Denim collection which was created through collaborations with artists and is only available in selected markets,\u201d the spokesperson said.<br>\u201cThe designer of the skirt is Mario de Santiago, known online as Yimeisgreat. Mario explores social interactions through his work and in his own words: \u2018The idea came from a wall painting I drew with friends four years ago.\u2019<br><br>\u201cThere is absolutely no link to the suggested theme.\u201d<br><br>Pepe the Frog was created by cartoonist Matt Furie, who originally envisaged him as a \u201cchill\u201d and \u201cgood-natured\u201d frog. However, over the course of the American electoral campaign, Pepe transformed from an amusing star of weird memes to a white supremacist symbol denounced by the Anti-Defamation League.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-19 at 8.56.35 AM","ext":".png","w":1252,"h":1346,"tn_w":232,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492606723827,"time":1492606723,"md5":"2w93x54c6vDzY\/3LUx0jcg==","fsize":1498003,"resto":0,"id":"\/rtRaW8C","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fashion-retailer-zara-pulls-skirt-after","country_name":"United States","replies":25,"images":9,"unique_ips":22},{"no":121841495,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)09:03:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121840997\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121840997<\/a><br>Sprry Zara, Jews have banned portrayals of frogs as anti-Semetic.

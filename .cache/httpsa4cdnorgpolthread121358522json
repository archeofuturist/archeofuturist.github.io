It was always a lightly used trail. Then within the last 10 years you&#039;d start to see unwhites on the trail using it like the whites. Now, within the last few years, I go there and it&#039;s a lot more frequented and the people going to it are almost all unwhite aside from a few older white people. It&#039;s a bit insane now and I am coming across middle easterners and blacks who won&#039;t even speak English. I saw an arab family of many women, children, and a man dressed like they just came from church and they were trying to do some kind of religious ceremony in the middle of the bike trail as they spoke some gibberish to each other. None of these people seem bad on the outside, but the face of our demographics is being changed intentionally and these people not only have entitlement to the world, but they are encouraged to have it. Diversity does not work and their anger will build just like ours has.<br><br>It starts in places like California and New York. They put it on the news and slowly lull people&#039;s real fear and anger with enticement of virtue and the excitement of change. The next thing you know, these new ideas are coming to your kids schools and new traitors are elected to run your city. Money flows to those who obey.","filename":"1457326954913","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":105,"tim":1492352978338,"time":1492352978,"md5":"VY7edewcsO\/of8MYiy6bPw==","fsize":265094,"resto":121358522,"id":"9SEc2xzq","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]}

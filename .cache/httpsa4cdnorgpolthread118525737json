I kind of see this as a downfall, because usually rap isn&#039;t so creative and valuable music-wise, I don&#039;t mind if some people like it, but you don&#039;t need much musical study to perform rap music, as opposed to jazz, which is music-wise often a lot more creative and complicated than rap. How did this become a stereotype? What made black people (and not only black) switch from jazz to rap.<br><br>I know this sounds stupid, but I hope you understand what I mean, nevertheless. I&#039;m open to any other opinions and I&#039;m sorry if I&#039;m on the wrong board, I don&#039;t know where else this would fit.","filename":"what-happened-pic","ext":".jpg","w":914,"h":582,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":159,"tim":1490630056289,"time":1490630056,"md5":"i2vcgbx5dcBBlhACAeu\/3A==","fsize":100842,"resto":0,"id":"0D4okEGw","country":"RO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-know-this-will-sound-stupid-and-its-still-a","country_name":"Romania","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118526036,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)11:57:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118525737\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118525737<\/a><br>Crack cocaine and the breakdown of the Black family, mostly.","filename":"Miles-Davis-Quintet","ext":".jpg","w":494,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1490630221227,"time":1490630221,"md5":"QnxPcSMX+BR49vt+8QWmuQ==","fsize":40703,"resto":118525737,"id":"hDO+yaTD","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

I come to you this afternoon with a question which weighs a lot on me: <br><br>Can you be a Liberal, but only for the white race? I believe in the liberal values of equality and tolerance, but only between white people. I have no care for islam, or for ghetto culture blacks, so I ask: can it really be possible to support notions such as universal healthcare and education, equality between genders and sexualities, but only for-and-between white people, with the belief that whites are inherently a better race and should not mix with other races? Could you support that yourself?","filename":"milk","ext":".jpg","w":221,"h":160,"tn_w":221,"tn_h":160,"tim":1492188568556,"time":1492188568,"md5":"pTjtji24vlvol5vZHZsJFA==","fsize":2275,"resto":0,"id":"p7XiWSd8","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"racialist-liberalism","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":121082339,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)12:51:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121082106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121082106<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;can it really be possible to support notions such as universal healthcare and education, equality between genders and sexualities, but only for-and-between white people, with the belief that whites are inherently a better race and should not mix with other races?

She was very active in the Alaskan secession movement along with her husband before the whole presidential stint. So the very idea that she loved America was 100% false from the start. Not only would it have been embarrassing for America to lose a state, it would have cost America a supply of oil and that revenue. Russia wins.<br><br>But when McCain ran, a very vocal anti-Russia candidate, they needed a plant to keep the US under some amount of control. So their influencers in the GOP put her on the ticket, she put on her patriotic face and started her dimwit act to make everyone think she was just a simple hometown girl, even though a lot of the footage from her in Alaskan meetings showed a very different personality.<br><br>This is a woman who would take undisclosed vacations during the times of year when the ice bridge between Russia and Alaska existed. This is a woman who has very prominent Russian facial features and bone structure. <br><br>She started campaigning for Trump, but after the Russian allegations began, she disappeared. QUICKLY disappeared.<br><br>There&#039;s no doubt that this woman is Russian, and she blew her job, and failed to achieve American reality TV celebrity status afterward, thank goodness.","filename":"palin","ext":".jpg","w":3000,"h":2000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490139810114,"time":1490139810,"md5":"2uR7+Kv+pxE6zREUWukJEA==","fsize":1634006,"resto":0,"id":"CdrjI8L9","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"do-you-think-sarah-palin-will-end-up-being","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":117688797,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:45:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117688633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117688633<\/a><br>I didn&#039;t know Mick Jagger was wearing glasses.","time":1490139906,"resto":117688633,"id":"SrvI\/dM\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117689126,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:48:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117688633\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117688633<\/a><br>Slide thread from fucking cunty shills that suck BBC.","time":1490140098,"resto":117688633,"id":"Hyt+PPUB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117689280,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:49:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117689126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117689126<\/a><br>Good morning, comrade.

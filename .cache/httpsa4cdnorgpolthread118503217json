Schools are not built, nor are incomes generated, by sheer luck, like a bolt from the blue. These things happen when people begin to think along new lines and work hard to bring their ideas to fruition. But people do that everywhere, and there is no reason why certain people in certain places during certain periods in history should be intrinsically smarter or more capable than others. What makes the difference is whether the environment permits and encourages ideas and work, or instead puts obstacles in their way. That depends on whether people are free to explore their way ahead, to own property, to invest for the long term, to conclude private agreements, and to trade with others. In short, it depends on whether or not the countries have capitalism.&quot;<\/span>","filename":"6269_196","ext":".jpg","w":790,"h":452,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":143,"tim":1490614066988,"time":1490614066,"md5":"jnXuvuL7K+BWfAEGdUMsLg==","fsize":77848,"resto":0,"id":"o\/LNQCs7","country":"IN","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"in-defense-of-global-capitalism","country_name":"India","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":118503296,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)07:28:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"bumping.","time":1490614132,"resto":118503217,"id":"o\/LNQCs7","country":"IN","country_name":"India"}]}

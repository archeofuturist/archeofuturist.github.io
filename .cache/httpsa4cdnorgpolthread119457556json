And I still have to pay to park my fucking car? Might as well use my bike.","filename":"Screenshot_20170404-114909","ext":".jpg","w":1431,"h":1648,"tn_w":217,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491303240003,"time":1491303240,"md5":"Nu4ltiLSdAowgd9LG\/sPxQ==","fsize":721082,"resto":0,"id":"g2AiwxBp","country":"PT","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-shouldnt-have-to-pay-to-park-your-car-pol","country_name":"Portugal","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119457967,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)06:59:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119457556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119457556<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be American and also not a sub-human NYC-rat<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have miles and miles of parking lots that don&#039;t charge<\/span>","filename":"1475103530810","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":600,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491303581597,"time":1491303581,"md5":"O4JhdFmiA3b8H1nmAMWsfw==","fsize":86633,"resto":119457556,"id":"j\/7eHKe8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119458098,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)07:01:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"In my city, the residential areas are broken up into permit zones. This allows for certain streets where there is a lot of competition for parking to be designated permit-only to help sort the competition. The permits are inexpensive, non-permit cars can park free for a few hours, and a permit-owner has a 3-day guest pass that can be used for visitors. This system is inexpensive and it works well.<br><br>For public parking in commercial zones, yeah, that&#039;s just bullshit revenue generation that should be covered by inspection fee, gas tax, whatever else.","time":1491303707,"resto":119457556,"id":"ZG4B7GRo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119458149,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)07:02:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119457967\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119457967<\/a><br>Here in Lisbon, even on the suburbs, residents pay a small amount every year to park their cars in front of they own house, thats just stealing.","time":1491303739,"resto":119457556,"id":"g2AiwxBp","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"}]}

The numbers:<br><br>Le Pen - 25%<br>Melenchon - 21.7%<br>Macron - 21.0%<br>Fillon - 20.2%<br>Hamon - 5.2%<br><br>Shut up an trust me on that. I will be right. Le Pen historically always overperforms her polls unless there is another credible right wing candidate for her votes to go to. There isn&#039;t. I have used a variety of other methods to calculate the other numbers; to be very brief, always remember that Macron&#039;s base is FRAGILE (1\/3 of voters could change minds) and is attracted to Melenchon&#039;s base, where as Fillon has stalled because of Penelopegate, and there is no reason to vote for Hamon as Melenchon becomes the candidate for the Left. <br><br>2nd Round will be 51.43% for Le Pen and 48.51% for Melenchon. Polls after the first round will show roughly a 54\/46 race, favouring Melenchon. <br><br>The crucial moment will come when Fillon ENDORSES Le Pen (or several prominent members of his party). Why would he\/they do that, you ask? Because they support Le Pen AGAINST the commie Melenchon (he wants 100% tax on rich). ALSO, they will have a parliamentary majority, and want to get shit done. THEY CAN GET SHIT DONE WITH LE PEN, BUT NOT WITH MELENCHON. This is crucial to remember.<br><br>This will be the FINAL BLOW. Currently (((polls))) predict the abstention rates of Fillon supporters in a 2nd round Le Pen\/Melenchon to be approximately 50%. (i.e. 50% do not vote at all). Fillon\/his party&#039;s endorsement of Le Pen will reduce this rate to approximately 30%, which results in the 51.43% victory I described above. So, add all these factors in and Le Pen will Make France Great Again. I&#039;m waiting, \/pol\/. Shortly, you will see that I was right.","time":1492859330,"resto":122261846,"id":"PAPByIn7","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122265815,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:13:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"elle ne pourra pas gagner contre Macron, qui deviendra le pr\u00e9sident","filename":"C92x5AaXsAECl4a","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492859611593,"time":1492859611,"md5":"jEitl603cYqXGLGfOrj2uw==","fsize":45315,"resto":122261846,"id":"Stezieb\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122265870,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:14:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/122218609#p122222222\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122222222<\/a><br><br>IS WINNING <br><br>KEK IS WITH US","time":1492859662,"resto":122261846,"id":"raxGXhdg","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122265958,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:15:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122262000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122262000<\/a>","filename":"1491621688606","ext":".png","w":314,"h":231,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1492859712654,"time":1492859712,"md5":"Pa8fxX2f\/y1vJaIETc6Zow==","fsize":132000,"resto":122261846,"id":"EOGvW2iv","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122265967,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:15:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"Marine will win!<br><br>VIVE LA FRANCE!","filename":"1488578919986","ext":".png","w":480,"h":640,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492859719674,"time":1492859719,"md5":"OlkxaM+8PzknttEvo9gctQ==","fsize":745880,"resto":122261846,"id":"vB3kzGua","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122266024,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:16:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122261846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122261846<\/a><br>Go LePen.","time":1492859763,"resto":122261846,"id":"buOF1obS","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":122266063,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:16:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122265870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122265870<\/a>","filename":"farage crisps","ext":".gif","w":360,"h":202,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492859795204,"time":1492859795,"md5":"rdoPhsdunCFctaQJfKeO9Q==","fsize":2040241,"resto":122261846,"id":"Stezieb\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122266188,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:17:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122261846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122261846<\/a><br>Le Pen FTW","filename":"first-female-president","ext":".png","w":500,"h":566,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492859876464,"time":1492859876,"md5":"QcorA7oDHLGutviPLd1xFw==","fsize":127373,"resto":122261846,"id":"qIol+N+D","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122266193,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:17:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122261846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122261846<\/a><br>Praise<br>In the name of the frog the tad\/pol\/ and the holy toad.","filename":"1481865050968","ext":".jpg","w":345,"h":400,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492859879665,"time":1492859879,"md5":"yeqMCLi18ms5Cjk797jPsg==","fsize":29916,"resto":122261846,"id":"6MZ4hFEY","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122266298,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:19:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122262590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122262590<\/a><br>Seriously don&#039;t bother, go directly learn arabigshit.<br>She\/We will loose.","time":1492859967,"resto":122261846,"id":"6H368B5R","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122266388,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:20:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Go lepen goooooo","filename":"d&amp;co","ext":".jpg","w":1836,"h":3264,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492860026318,"time":1492860026,"md5":"gNoLxyjQWASpfq4F3M+5rw==","fsize":1290397,"resto":122261846,"id":"h8hY8SGt","country":"FR","m_img":1,"country_name":"France"},{"no":122266421,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:20:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"saw a map the other day that suggested the r\u00e9gions with the most arabs support Le Pen whereas those with the least support Macron\/M\u00e9lenchon.<br><br>Anyone got it?","time":1492860053,"resto":122261846,"id":"Stezieb\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122266493,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:21:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122265357\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122265357<\/a><br>Nice!<br>Je la ressortirai!","time":1492860106,"resto":122261846,"id":"6H368B5R","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122266495,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:21:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"Sending meme energy, Vive Le Pen!","filename":"goku-super-spirit-bomb","ext":".jpg","w":680,"h":732,"tn_w":116,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492860111458,"time":1492860111,"md5":"affgLmiNbXPO5qcu6bsdGw==","fsize":94132,"resto":122261846,"id":"Yx\/IPQBa","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122266541,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)07:22:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122266388\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122266388<\/a><br>is it true every french voter gets sent the programs of each candidat, and that when you vote they announce as you put the envelope in the box?

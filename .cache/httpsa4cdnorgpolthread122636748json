It protects a small cartel of dairy, poultry and egg farmers at the expense of everyone else. It also creates massive barriers to entry for new farmers. The cost of purchasing quotas is so high that it makes entry into supply managed sectors nearly impossible. It also drives up the grocery bills of farmers trying to feed their families. Phasing out supply management, and ensuring that those in supply managed sectors can transition is the right thing to do. I would follow the Australian model, with a gradual phase-out and compensation for farmers.","time":1493068053,"resto":122636748,"id":"HHev\/uUl","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122640577,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)17:27:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122636748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122636748<\/a><br><br>I pay $4 for a half gallon of milk<br><br>I don&#039;t mind production quotas as long as they protect farmers, Hitler put agricultural quotas in place, but Quebec is fucking retarded in how they implement this shit.

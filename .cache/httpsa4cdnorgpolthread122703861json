You think you can get away with putting tariffs on our lumber? Don&#039;t you fucking try us. We let you off easy in the war of 1812. Oh believe you me, us Canadians are ITCHING for a war with the USA. We will take even the smallest reason to justify us fucking ANNIHILATING your dirty fat country. There wouldn&#039;t be a square meter of American soil that has running water, electricity, or petrol that isn&#039;t on fire, once our airforce and navy is done bombarding your defenceless country. Then, our army boys (we&#039;d send the Quebecois and other mongrels first) would swoop in, raping your women, and killing EVERY American pig shit they see. When Canada&#039;s done with you, we will have committed acts of genocide. Of course no one is gonna do shit about it. Nothing of value will be lost.","filename":"LEAFED2","ext":".jpg","w":686,"h":385,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493102024102,"time":1493102024,"md5":"ctPVmvDDb8oP4H\/dFx0xVw==","fsize":231234,"resto":0,"id":"wTgpsyxZ","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"canada-couldnt-singlehandedlydestroy-the-usa-in-a","country_name":"Canada","replies":10,"images":4,"unique_ips":9},{"no":122703938,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)02:34:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122703861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122703861<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;petrol<\/span><br>lmao","time":1493102084,"resto":122703861,"id":"c+dmNqEu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122704085,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)02:36:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122703861\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122703861<\/a><br>Randy doesn&#039;t speak for 99.99% of us.

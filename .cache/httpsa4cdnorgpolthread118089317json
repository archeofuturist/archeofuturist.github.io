Internet dating and hell the internet itself was for geeks.<br><br>There were angry black people and Muslims and Asians but most of them still felt obliged not to act crazy. Most whites were less crazy too... libs were less submissive and conservatives were less bitter.<br><br>Women and girls wanted to be nice and look pretty. Men respected them in turn more than they do now and themselves too. Gays were just funny people on TV.<br><br>Even liberals back then were pro-Western, which is funny when you consider how much more conservative social norms were then even though it was just a few decades ago. Hitler was considered evil but when it came to the European empires and America pretty much everyone outside of Berkeley agreed that the good outweighed the bad even if it was a little impolite to harp on about it.<br><br>It was just two short decades ago but it feels like a lifetime. It might have all just been Jewish stock market manipulation smoke and mirrors or whatever but the late 90s felt totally different.","filename":"IMG_1890","ext":".jpg","w":723,"h":576,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":199,"tim":1490368028148,"time":1490368028,"md5":"LDakn1JS6PrWWYKlvNqTSA==","fsize":142331,"resto":0,"id":"kn2UZkXL","country":"KR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"anyone-else-nostalgic-for-the-90s","country_name":"South Korea","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

At the very least, have the U.S. gain full commonwealth membership. Integration of the government might be a bit more tricky. The U.S. Constitution allows States to have whatever government they want, so the U.K. would keep the Monarchy and parliament. The major negotiation would be U.K. representation in the U.S. Congress. If you treat the entire U.K. as a single state, then the U.K. would have two senators. However, if England, Scotland and Wales were each treated as separate States, that would effectively add six more senators, two for each. Representatives to the house would be apportioned according to population regardless, the only difference being whether they had a Representative(U.K.) or Representative (England\/Scotland\/Wales) in their title. The would have to be a federal court district added to cover the U.K. and there would need to be plan to fold the militaries into each other.<br><a href=\"#p118351526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118351526<\/a><br>Once the federal court system was up and running, basically there would be a massive glut of lawsuits to rule on the Constitutionality of pretty much every law in the U.K. Speech restrictions and the most egregious firearms laws would be struck down pretty quickly, though. I imagine things like NHS would be treated as a state program and would survive. As U.K. citizens would now be U.S. citizens, and vice versa, travel between the continental US and the British Isles would be the same as between Hawaii. Travel into the U.K. from Europe would become more restrictive, though we&#039;d probably work something out with France that is similar to our arrangement with Canada and Mexico.","time":1490532102,"resto":118351131,"id":"6IFK6Zj\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118357894,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)08:42:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"Wrong flag.","filename":"reddit_flags_flagcircle_wmain","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490532176049,"time":1490532176,"md5":"8TMDScilZXkIedhrX6UPkA==","fsize":33726,"resto":118351131,"id":"aJiR04aF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118357979,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)08:44:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"It would be really gay if that happened, honestly.","time":1490532252,"resto":118351131,"id":"Gbxh5mcd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118358647,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)08:53:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118351131\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118351131<\/a><br>I for one would love to see a united anglosphere<br><br>Federalised empire when <br><br>Make scotland its own state so it shuts the hell up about being independent from westminster whilst you&#039;re at it","time":1490532835,"resto":118351131,"id":"Qb6Rjcng","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118359020,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)08:58:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118357979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118357979<\/a><br>Wrong.

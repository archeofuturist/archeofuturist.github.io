In fact, I argued that replacing Paterno with a young fiery coach in the age of recruiting and social media could be a net positive for the program. Fast forward five years, they beat Ohio State en route to winning the Big Ten title and earn a trip to the Rose Bowl,a nd they&#039;re absolutely killing it on the recrutiing trail.<br><br>tl;dr... people&#039;s attention spans are laughably short, and they&#039;ll forget about even the worst and most disgusting scandals. Especially in an age when we&#039;re constantly being bombarded with information, it&#039;s always &quot;out with the old, in with the new&quot;, and stuff that was only a few years ago seems like decades ago.","time":1493040987,"resto":122578725,"id":"PpdIWcDa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122586189,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)09:36:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122584358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122584358<\/a><br>I kekked, i don&#039;t know why but i kekked so hard it hurts","time":1493041002,"resto":122578725,"id":"JSmCTF4W","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122586323,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)09:38:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122580838\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122580838<\/a><br>A normal educated person takes neither.","time":1493041086,"resto":122578725,"id":"1lce6D+I","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122586364,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)09:38:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122579883\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122579883<\/a><br>can i get at least a cosplay (female) refugee gf?","time":1493041112,"resto":122578725,"id":"Hcn8MCAI","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":122586690,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)09:42:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122584650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122584650<\/a><br><br>All these media platforms are supposed to be great because they make it easier to reach a desired target audience, yet every time I play an episode of Masha i Medved on JewTube (my wife is russian) for my 2 year old, I get an add from John Cranley for Mayor.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;children&#039;s show<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;in russian<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;from an IP address NOT in the city limits<\/span><br><br>And it&#039;s not just JewTube.

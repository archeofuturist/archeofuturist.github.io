They just didn&#039;t produce that type of steel because they didn&#039;t really have a reason to when they were importing it from overseas. Honestly, though, I&#039;m not saying that they could have a global navy in the way that the US does but with the advances they&#039;ve made in submarine technology I wouldn&#039;t snub them. The Chinese are a hard working people.","time":1493441872,"resto":123293535,"id":"VzR+lF72","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123297850,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)00:58:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123297500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123297500<\/a><br>No dude, didn&#039;t you hear?

They are also like ants. Little innovation. Also their steel is complete shit. I had a pair of hedge clippers made in china and the blade dulled within a few months and bent not long after. I got American clippers (much more expensive) and the blade was fine for MUCH longer than the other. I hope for China&#039;s sake that they used their highest quality steel on their carrier or they won&#039;t have one for long.","time":1493443216,"resto":123293535,"id":"IrXHl49Q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Though I have to be honest, even though I thought Boyega was a diversity hire, he was actually easily the best of the new cast. Daisy Ridley is an appalling actor, I couldn&#039;t stand her or her Mary Sue character, which made every other character utterly redundant in the movie. The new villain is complete rubbish, totally un-intimidating.

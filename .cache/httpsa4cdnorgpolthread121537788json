According to Giuseppe Sergi, the Mediterranean race was the &quot;greatest race of the world&quot; and was singularly responsible for the most accomplished civilisations of ancient times, including those of Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, Greece, Phoenicia, Carthage, and Rome. The Mediterranean race was also a major influence to the outside world in the modern era: Portugal established the first global empire in history, during the 16th century, followed contemporary by Spain, setting both nations in the highest dominion of political and economics powers in Europe. Portugal and Spain are also responsible for being the first nations in discovering and colonising the Americas by its conquistadors.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;C. G. Seligman also stated that &quot;it must, I think, be recognised that the Mediterranean race has actually more achievements to its credit than any other race, since it is responsible for by far the greater part of Mediterranean civilisation, certainly before 1000 BC (and probably much later), and so shaped not only the Aegean cultures, but those of Western as well as the greater part of Eastern Mediterranean lands, while the culture of their near relatives, the Hamitic pre-dynastic Egyptians, formed the basis of that of Egypt.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Nazis explained this away by claiming that the elite warriors of the aristocracy of Ancient Greece, of Ancient Rome, and of the Spanish Empire and Portuguese Empire were Nordic Aryans who had migrated south. However, they did admit that those of the Mediterranean race in general and notably such geniuses of the Mediterranean race as Dante Alighieri, Michelangelo, Andrea Palladio, Galileo Galilei, Enrico Fermi and Leonardo da Vinci tended to be more creative than Nordics.<\/span>","time":1492443396,"resto":121537788,"id":"k03xH7D4","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121538934,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:36:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121537788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121537788<\/a><br><br>D&amp;C SHILL <br><br>SAGE AND REPORT","filename":"ihaveyourback","ext":".png","w":480,"h":314,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1492443410773,"time":1492443410,"md5":"Y3ts+gsViNy5PlzW6wmSfw==","fsize":117576,"resto":121537788,"id":"gexHhDod","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121538964,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:37:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"The Shekels alwyas find a way","time":1492443424,"resto":121537788,"id":"XZ6NHNWN","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":121538969,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:37:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121538711\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121538711<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;panchitos<\/span><br>Should have killed them after raping","time":1492443428,"resto":121537788,"id":"0vwZdsr7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121538994,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:37:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121537788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121537788<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Every single colony that Spain and Portugal owned is now a complete shit hole<\/span>","filename":"1297477763125","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492443440874,"time":1492443440,"md5":"ezi2QJ9kqqqsYbtRenqL+g==","fsize":32378,"resto":121537788,"id":"I\/4HpEmk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121538999,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:37:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121538711\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121538711<\/a><br>They&#039;ll take California, but they&#039;ll never take Texas","time":1492443443,"resto":121537788,"id":"PnZqy+PY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121539004,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:37:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121538711\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121538711<\/a><br>DAGO&#039;D","time":1492443446,"resto":121537788,"id":"iP7Kxsgn","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":121539008,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:37:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121538584\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121538584<\/a><br>it&#039;s not true we still invent and do science, of course accomplish to create something like an empire is something we can&#039;t do.","time":1492443447,"resto":121537788,"id":"IN89mpa3","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":121539051,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:37:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121538154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121538154<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121538283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121538283<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121538306\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121538306<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121538516\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121538516<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121538711\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121538711<\/a><br><br>DON&#039;T FALL FOR D&amp;C BAIT THREADS","filename":"1489244778033","ext":".png","w":480,"h":314,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1492443472424,"time":1492443472,"md5":"gq9sOEus37P\/ukXQ\/aCp9w==","fsize":118518,"resto":121537788,"id":"gexHhDod","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121539067,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:38:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121538838\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121538838<\/a><br>You do realize we started the Age of Discovery that took Europe out of the Dark Ages, don&#039;t you?","time":1492443481,"resto":121537788,"id":"awnWC7b5","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":121539089,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:38:10","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1481330772351","ext":".png","w":1378,"h":904,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1492443490214,"time":1492443490,"md5":"2c1O4+EqRcR0z97oyqqceA==","fsize":88030,"resto":121537788,"id":"8Di4F0Cs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121539186,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:39:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121537788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121537788<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw all post numbers are arabic<\/span>","time":1492443552,"resto":121537788,"id":"z\/HZ3sSn","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":121539259,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:39:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"People who are obsessed with race are so because they don&#039;t have anyame with every other topic that exists.<br><br><br>It&#039;s an inherent inferiority complex that is going on with you southerners, because you think you have the biggest balls yet you are living like dogs (dirty streets, barely functioning societies etc.).<br><br><br>Talking about WE WUZ ROMANS from 3000 years ago is fucking stupid, because you know, the world changed.

In the beginning of 66, Nero married Statilia Messalina. Later that year or in 67 he married Sporus, who was said to bear a remarkable resemblance to Poppaea.[3]<br><br>Nero had Sporus castrated,[a] and during their marriage, Nero had Sporus appear in public as his wife wearing the regalia that was customary for Roman empresses. He then took Sporus to Greece and back to Rome, making Calvia Crispinilla serve as &quot;mistress of wardrobe&quot; to Sporus, epitropeia ten peri estheta.[7] Nero had earlier married another freedman, Pythagoras, who had played the role of Nero&#039;s husband; now Sporus played the role of Nero&#039;s wife. Among other forms of address, Sporus was termed &quot;Lady&quot;, &quot;Empress&quot;, and &quot;Mistress&quot;.[7] Suetonius quotes one Roman who lived around this time who remarked that the world would have been better off if Nero&#039;s father Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus had married someone more like the castrated boy.[1]<br><br>Suetonius places his account of the Nero\u2013Sporus relationship in his scandalous accounts of Nero&#039;s sexual aberrations, between his raping a vestal virgin and committing incest with his mother.[3] Some think that Nero used his marriage to Sporus to assuage the feelings of guilt he felt for kicking his pregnant wife Poppaea to death.[8] Dio Cassius, in a more detailed account, writes that Sporus bore an uncanny resemblance to Sabina and that Nero called Sporus by her name.[4]<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Augus<wbr>tus<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Augustus died in AD 14 at the age of 75.

Some claim that Hitler ordered the murder of a lot of innocent people, but this doesn&#039;t actually appear in Mein Kampf and you have to look at in the context of the time when they were at war. Even most of the people who criticise Mein Kampf don&#039;t understand it because they didn&#039;t read it in the original German. Anyone who commits violence in the name of Nazism is not a real Nazi. The Waffen-SS uniform is a symbol of empowerment for those who wear it and should not be discriminated against. Criticism of Nazism is generally just motivated by ignorance and racism against Europeans. Also Hitler was a wizard with magical powers.","filename":"Hitler_Turban","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490867275900,"time":1490867275,"md5":"L\/pJNxNtQWsPbgRQBHAPaQ==","fsize":73989,"resto":0,"id":"OQgaanTX","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-vast-majority-of-nazis-are-peaceful-people","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

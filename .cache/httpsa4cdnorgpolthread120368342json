Thinking of current events as something &quot;Trump is doing&quot; is why you&#039;re confused. Bombing Syria and the ouster of Assad isn&#039;t anything new. This is not a Trump thing. It&#039;s hardly an Assad thing. It&#039;s about the destruction of Arab nationalism. The jews need their safes space. The pipelines are not to be nationalized or taxed by proud adversaries. This is something that&#039;s been discussed since at least the Bush Junior days, but probably way earlier, like cold war day. Clearly the military, CIA have trump by the balls some way. Probably something to do with golden showers.","filename":"showers","ext":".jpg","w":204,"h":247,"tn_w":204,"tn_h":247,"tim":1491786453438,"time":1491786453,"md5":"VUXDGtYLOowNBwJxsqOo9g==","fsize":14122,"resto":0,"id":"rrXEm55J","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"toppling-baathism","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

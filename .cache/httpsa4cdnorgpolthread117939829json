Once someone crosses out of your jurisdiction you have no sovereignty over them. Each nation has their own jurisprudence to address criminals.

The West only thinks as far as it&#039;s hand can reach, where the east is much older and thinks of things on a 100 year + time scale.

Their policies poison their own people, have no regard for pollution as a whole, and they are nuclear armed meaning the only chance can come from within their own country.

Is it just anyone who disagrees with you who no longer has these rights? Where is the cutoff? Just people who deny private property as a right? In that case, who is to prevent lesser socialists from having slightly less extreme views and ruining your utopia, bit by bit?<br><br>I was under the understanding that &quot;When NAP applies to them as well as to normal people, as supporters of NAP agree, critics state that logically NAP should apply to all life forms with similar characteristics&quot;, so shouldn&#039;t all humans have those rights, even if they say they don&#039;t? It would be very hypocritical to say no, wouldn&#039;t it? Under a &quot;true&quot; Libertarian society, wouldn&#039;t it be impossible to do something to a Commie unless they try something first?<br>Hoppe Libertarianism is simply mob rule, where the majority are assumed to make correct decisions. This is in line with the rest of Libertarians, where once again the people are assumed uncorruptable. Since the U.S has declined from a Libertarian society into the society we have now under a certain (((influence))), would that not be setting up a society to fail? It&#039;s utterly naive to think that people can&#039;t occasionally make wrong decisions, especially when regarding how things are dealt with politically.<br>Would it not be better to have large, but not unrestrained, freedom, but also an ironclad government document which allows the &quot;physical removal of communists and leftists&quot;?","filename":"NatSoc def of Socialism","ext":".jpg","w":1245,"h":642,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":64,"tim":1491522780511,"time":1491522780,"md5":"5mHlYCqCDKaxVgmKTCNzdQ==","fsize":117070,"resto":119811907,"id":"uu4Wmf3Q","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119818413,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:53:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119817926\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119817926<\/a><br>Thank soon i&#039;ll do a ron paul.","filename":"HOPPE","ext":".png","w":853,"h":1025,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491522815184,"time":1491522815,"md5":"\/R38vGipZQF4ujBVs1JFUA==","fsize":137520,"resto":119811907,"id":"uFxhQp4K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119818659,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:55:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119817337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119817337<\/a><br>If you&#039;re not cool with mass surveillance, passive eugenics and tax money underwriting the ghettos you&#039;re seen as a Mr. Mean NeYo knotsie in their eyes.<br>It&#039;s an abstract kind of Funhouse.","filename":"1445487666272","ext":".jpg","w":595,"h":592,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491522922766,"time":1491522922,"md5":"Eu+OZvGVnEWXaHMnS8KFUQ==","fsize":49569,"resto":119811907,"id":"UvV2712i","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119818846,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)19:56:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119818321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119818321<\/a><br>because communists are ideologically opposed to private property, and justify violence against us to &quot;end capitalism&quot;.

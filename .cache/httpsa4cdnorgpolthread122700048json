A number of artists and activists\u2014including Thurston Moore, TV on the Radio\u2019s Tunde Adebimpe, Young Fathers, Desmond Tutu, and Pink Floyd\u2019s Roger Waters\u2014have now signed an open letter asking Radiohead \u201cto think again\u201d about performing in Israel. In the letter, they write, \u201cby playing in Israel you\u2019ll be playing in a state where, UN rapporteurs say, \u2018a system of apartheid has been imposed on the Palestinian people.\u2019\u201d The letter closes, \u201cPlease do what artists did in South Africa\u2019s era of oppression: stay away, until apartheid is over.\u201d Read it in full here at the Artists\u2019 Pledge for Palestine\u2019s site.

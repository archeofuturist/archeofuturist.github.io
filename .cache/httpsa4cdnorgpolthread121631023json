It has with it two other horses, that it has actually domesticsted itself, the man now has three of the strongest healthiest horses in the world.<br><br>Some time later the man&#039;s son is drafted to war with the Mongolians to the North, he serves but on the first day he has his leg sliced from underneath him and has to retire. Again, the townfolk ask the man &quot;Your son is eternally maimed, how can you be so calm?&quot; And he replies &quot;who knows what will come of this.&quot;<br><br>Then the Mongols lay siege to their town and demand all able bodied men are to be killed, to prevent rebellion. And the man, being too old to rebel, and his son, being maimed are both spared.<br><br>The moral of the story is that whatever happens now we can&#039;t predict the outcome, but we can just hope things will turn around soon and our efforts will be rewarded in the fullness of time.<br><br>Or just kill yourself, I don&#039;t

You could make a compelling argument that atheism is specifically being pushed by Jews in today&#039;s society, and they seem to largely be targeting western Christians and only them.<br><br>For example, Sam Harris, Chapman Cohen, David Silverman, Michael Newdow, Gregory Epstein, Sherman Wine, Bill Maher, Eric Kaufmann, and of course, Richard Dawkins&#039;s mother has a Jewish surname and was stated to have lived in the only Jewish suburb of the city she grew up in. But he hasn&#039;t explicitly named her religion.<br><br>But that&#039;s only a tiny part of the list. We could discuss the Jewish atheists who aren&#039;t pushing atheism so much as atheism-enabling political views like Marxism. For example Soklonikov, Trotsky, Deutscher, Lenin, Uritsky, Kamenev, Zinoviev and Sverdlov.<br><br>And what about atheist Jewish public entertainers that constantly run down Christianity? We can go ahead and recycle Bill Maher here and also include Jon Leibowitz, Stephen Fry, Woody Allen, Rob Reiner, Daniel Radcliffe, Larry David, David Silverman, and... I&#039;m sure I&#039;m close to the post cap, so rather than just name the rest of Hollywood, you get the point.<br><br>PURE COINCIDENCE though.","filename":"1489143133599","ext":".jpg","w":1172,"h":818,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":174,"tim":1490305493223,"time":1490305493,"md5":"RVDe1PMWx6kGsYBWeFJUPg==","fsize":117538,"resto":0,"id":"6pC5wzKK","country":"PL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"it-should-probably-be-noted-that-almost-every","country_name":"Poland","replies":8,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":117988834,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)17:46:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"The worst thing is that they hijack the atheism label to promote reductionist materialism.","time":1490305579,"resto":117988636,"id":"bxHjXujT","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":117989784,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)17:53:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117988636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117988636<\/a><br>If we shouldn&#039;t trust them because they&#039;re Jewish, why would you follow any semitic religion?","time":1490305985,"resto":117988636,"id":"BtZL69fY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117990376,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)17:57:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117989784\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117989784<\/a><br><br>Hating Jews used to be very common in Christianity, after all, they killed Christ.","time":1490306223,"resto":117988636,"id":"bxHjXujT","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":117991731,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:06:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1490306798,"resto":117988636,"id":"bxHjXujT","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":117992147,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:09:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117990376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117990376<\/a><br>I thought the Italians killed Christ<br>They felt so guilty, they set up their own religion putting a bit part player, Mary, at the head<br>Talk about adding insult to injury","time":1490306971,"resto":117988636,"id":"dqRPC4iw","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117992309,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:10:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117992147\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117992147<\/a><br>wait<br>what?","time":1490307043,"resto":117988636,"id":"7uYflCYb","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":117992562,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:12:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117988636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117988636<\/a><br>Jesus: &quot;For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God that brings salvation to everyone who believes: first to the Jew, then to the Gentile.&quot;<br><br>Romans 1:16","time":1490307156,"resto":117988636,"id":"e1+QT2Sb","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117993318,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:18:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117992309\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117992309<\/a><br>Just a thought","time":1490307493,"resto":117988636,"id":"dqRPC4iw","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

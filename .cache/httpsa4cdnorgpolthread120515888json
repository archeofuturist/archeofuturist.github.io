Victims using a gun were no less likely to be injured after taking protective action than victims using other forms of protective action.

The ratio for 2012, per the Violence Policy Center, was one justifiable killing for every 32 murders, suicides or accidental deaths (the ratio increases to 38-1 over the five-year period ending in 2012).

Drying processes have increased their life span dramatically. Also, it&#039;s exceedingly rare to build a house entirely of brick. It&#039;s incredibly unstable as the mortar used often has a shorter life than wood. Almost any house you see that is made of brick is actually a stick built home with a brick veneer 1 wythe thick anchored to the sheething material. Unless you live in a pole barn where the sheething is metal, or a storage unit typically made of cinder block, you live in a stick built home. The interior walls are made of wood even in the 1900 homes made entirely of brick. Wooden stringers with gypsum wall covering. Your floors are wood more often than not. Both subfloor and joists, and your roof is framed with wood as well, even in taracotta or tpo liner applications. The only exception is a brick dome which is insanely costly due to the skill involved. Slate roofing is also attached to a wooden trusses or conventionally framed joists. You cannot escape wood, the house will burn regardless. Also even the heat from a fire inside a brick home as everything is made of wood within the walls, exposes the mortar which isn&#039;t heat resistant to enough heat to make the home unsafe. Fire brick used for fire places is a specialty brick. Red brick is not heat resistant and cracks and weakens with heat. A fire destroys any home. The only thing capable of withstanding a fire is a steel framed and sheethed building, typically used as a work shop or storage building. And even then any welds will need to be revisited and reinforced. <br><br>We&#039;re not all neets here","filename":"1493827277640","ext":".jpg","w":437,"h":953,"tn_w":57,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493871102621,"time":1493871102,"md5":"b7BEUTcXh1KR2YyLG4X83A==","fsize":55514,"resto":124013999,"id":"qSIJoTAC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124016467,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:12:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Mud houses havent exactly caught on in America<a href=\"#p124013999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124013999<\/a>","time":1493871135,"resto":124013999,"id":"1u+T5GRK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124016609,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:13:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124016326\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124016326<\/a><br>Proxy canacuck house.","filename":"homeless_people_us_07","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":467,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1493871211593,"time":1493871211,"md5":"p9qunijSaPfnwB5eSkfvpg==","fsize":98081,"resto":124013999,"id":"wlu\/Fgfe","country":"UY","country_name":"Uruguay"},{"no":124016789,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)00:15:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124016255\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124016255<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So you can punch a hole in a brick wall but not on a recycled wood wall?<\/span><br>That&#039;s not what brittle means, dumbass<br><br>And good luck punching through construction grade wood.

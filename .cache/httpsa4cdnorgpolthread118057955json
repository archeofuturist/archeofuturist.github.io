Yet this picture shows the horizon RISING to eye level, and if you were to look around in a panorama, from your perspective the earths surface would appear to rise up to the vanishing point where you couldn&#039;t see any further. That&#039;s the exactly opposite of what a sphere would do!<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If you still want it to be round you have to argue that it can somehow be round yet flat at the same time. I don&#039;t care how big of a sphere you have of what kind of cross section you want to take of it.

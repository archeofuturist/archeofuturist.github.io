I, for one, want some opposing viewpoints and actual discussion for once. Trump cannot attack Assad. This is absolutely vital, what&#039;s going on in the middle east right now is far, far more important than keeping the mexicans out or banning muslims. I will turn against him if he sends in a force to depose Assad, that is completely unacceptable.","filename":"Unknown","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":168,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491526312783,"time":1491526312,"md5":"WUlQgLwcIYt1cTwq0Cz7QA==","fsize":7318,"resto":0,"id":"\/uhpMGNy","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-criticism","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":5,"unique_ips":8},{"no":119826360,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)20:52:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119826253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119826253<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Make it happen faggots:<\/span><br>#SyriaHoax <br>#NoWarInSyria","time":1491526351,"resto":119826253,"id":"VltcuSJc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119826613,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)20:54:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"If he bombs Syria Europe is done, it&#039;s over, 10,000,000 migrants per month","time":1491526456,"resto":119826253,"id":"E5xJmi6z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119826740,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)20:55:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119826360\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119826360<\/a><br>Shut up with the activism.

Arguing against what is the scientific consensus is retarded, but whats way worse it that it leaves the left as the only side that offers &quot;solutions&quot; to a problem we probably should or shouldn&#039;t be dealing with. The outcome of that can be seen in germany. The treehugging faggots plant windmills and solar panels all over the place, causing huge net instability issues due to irregular power production, ramping power costs up and thus either making indigenous, power heavy industry incompetitive or reliant on state subsidies. The better option would be to push for research and developement of &quot;green&quot; power sources that make sense, like nuclear power.","time":1491526791,"resto":119826253,"id":"TtBb69cn","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

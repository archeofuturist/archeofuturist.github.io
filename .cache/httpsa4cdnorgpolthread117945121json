Solo practice defense work is more money and better hours. If you want to get into criminal work anons better start out as a prosecutor then become a defense lawyer. If you have any questions I can answer them since I am stuck in ticket court.","time":1490286739,"resto":117945121,"id":"76n6hEwQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117950102,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)12:32:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117947065\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117947065<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that huffpost bar<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;black voices<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;queer voices<\/span><br>is that shopped or actually real? i can&#039;t really tell given the current state of (((media)))","filename":"1489793814811","ext":".jpg","w":840,"h":1120,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490286763435,"time":1490286763,"md5":"IUCG53dTbzz4870dd9t1LQ==","fsize":111148,"resto":117945121,"id":"6M3o+2KL","country":"RO","m_img":1,"country_name":"Romania"},{"no":117950197,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)12:33:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fuck law degrees, why the hell would people want to baby sit fucktard criminals for decades?","time":1490286811,"resto":117945121,"id":"NQq0KelU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117950435,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)12:35:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117950069\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117950069<\/a><br>I always hear generalities about how to accomplish things as a lawyer<br><br>I never hear practicalities<br><br>How literally do you become a prosecutor, assuming you&#039;re starting at nothing<br><br>Also I&#039;d like to leave my state and go somewhere else.

It&#039;s tdcaa.com. That is the Texas District and County Attorney Association. They have resources for new attorneys, resources for prosecutors and a very helpful job bank. It&#039;s how I found my first job. <br><br>Once you get into law school you will find plenty of areas that interest you. Criminal was one I was 50\/50 on. I got hooked up with a defense firm my first semester and was hooked. That connection has netted me plenty of business to this day. Once you find your area you&#039;ll need to get into a county near where you live for interns. My grades were shit so I didn&#039;t even try. I stuck with my defense friends and got paid nicely for it. Once you are entering your last semester of law school, and if you&#039;re still interning with the county, they will normally offer you a job contingent on you passing the bar. Now I personally know guys in my top 15% who weren&#039;t offered jobs at the counties they worked for. <br><br>If you are already practicing and want to make a lateral shift then I would just hop onto your state&#039;s job portal or search for something like tdcaa. <br><br>Moving states is difficult for me because I passed the bar before the new unified bar. I&#039;m still not sure what all states will accept it, but that will make moving states easier. If your state is not under that new bar then you&#039;ll have to sit for it again. <br><br>Hopefully this was helpful in some way.","time":1490287954,"resto":117945121,"id":"76n6hEwQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Nothing new under the sun, political parties trade votes for posts, like everywhere. Slavs did what slavs do, chimped out, muh we are being oppressed because some guy from the group of people we invaded 500 years ago and who make 1\/4th of the population has a political post in my made up LARPing country for the first time in their history due to the fact we are such dumb cunts we couldn&#039;t form any government without their parties getting involved. They chimped out, beat some albanians and lots of other bulgarians, the albanian guy said fuck it I&#039;ll resign, but they still keep pushing because muh mother russia will halp so eventually being that chauvinist and stupid will be pushing stupid chauvinist albanians to say fuck it, this is war. It&#039;s another example of the famous slavic victim complex. They stirr shit up, beat people up then when the other side makes any move, no matter how benign they&#039;ll scream muh they be oppressing and keeping us down.

I love Trump but the social degeneracy is out of hand. Left and right women are becoming more and more slutty and wear so much make up that you would need windshield wipers to get it off. The worst part is that men won&#039;t do anything about it. And I&#039;m pissed. So I need to cool off by taking a few trips around Europe to the most red pilled\/ beautiful countries. Nothing like Sweden, Germany (unless rural), France, or the UK because that will piss me off even more.

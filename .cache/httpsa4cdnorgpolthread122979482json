Which means when those are automated there are a LOT of people out of a job (the largest employment is the transportation industry) and what will happen to them? It&#039;s not feasible to push them all through college or find new skills. There aren&#039;t enough new jobs to replace the old. <br><br>What happens to them? We need to consider the options. One option is &quot;fuck em&quot; and anyone that chooses that is a sociopathic prick that might as well do the species a favor and kill themselves. Another option is that we consider everyone receives a livable wage. And I&#039;m sure there are other options. But this is a discussion our society needs to be having and fast.<br><br>Automation is inevitible. Businesses will engage in it purely for their economic\/profit gains and damn the consequences to society.<br><br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/122948827#p122977872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122977872<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This kind of mindset is why I hate bleeding hearts, they think stealing from the productive and giving to the worst elements of society is a good deed and that advocating that makes them virtuous.<\/span><br>You&#039;re just a petty thief who worships tyrants and aids some of the worst elements of society.<br><br>Ah, the bullshit mentality that taxes are theft and that all the rich are productive. How about the rich that inherited their money and literally are doing NOTHING with it other than being lazy bums\/partying? ;) There are a fair number of those.

Prominent journalist and Russia expert Peter Pomerantsev believes Russia&#039;s efforts are aimed at confusing the audience, rather than convincing it. He states that they cannot censor information but can &quot;trash it with conspiracy theories and rumors&quot;.<br><br>To avert suspicions, the users sandwich political remarks between neutral articles on traveling, cooking and pets.They overwhelm comment sections of media to render meaningful dialogue impossible.<br>\u201cThe effect created by such Internet trolls is not very big, but they manage to make certain forums meaningless because people stop commenting on the articles when these trolls sit there and constantly create an aggressive, hostile atmosphere toward those whom they don\u2019t like.

Careful studies show that women have more fluid sexual arousal patterns. They are aroused by a wider variety of things, including video of animals fucking, i kid not. Men have a more narrow range of what arouses them, and the kicker is: their self-generated reports of what arouses them is very highly correlated to what the measurement apparatus reports, whereas women&#039;s self-reports of what arouses them completely leaves out many things that actually DID arouse them that the instruments picked up. <br><br>In other words, they either don&#039;t really know themselves, or they&#039;re liars. Or, to combine the two, they lie to themselves.","time":1493750548,"resto":123770989,"id":"A1NdTC3Y","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

Revisionist history is what you are talking about. Erasing the bad and only leaving what you consider good. The problem with that is that you forget both sides have good and bad. There were slave owners in the north and those who fought against slavery in the south. There were even blacks (slave and free) that supported the Confederacy and some even fought against the Union. Why would they do something like that? Well if you erase all traces of it you&#039;ll never know. That&#039;s always the problem with revisionist history. You cover up the bad for the good and later generations never knew the bad things existed because you never told them. Look up the term damnatio memoriae. The Romans tried to remove all traces of Caligula from history. Good thing Claudius prevented it because it kept his acts remembered so they didn&#039;t easily make the same mistakes.

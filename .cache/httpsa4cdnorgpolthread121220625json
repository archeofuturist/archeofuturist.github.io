Attached is a pic from the top of a Sassanian era castle (2000 years old) near Yazd. It had three tiers of walls, a moat, a draw bridge, a well to an underground tunnel to escape the castle in underground tunnels.

They enforced their orthodox zurvanite version of Zoroastrianism and persecuted other Zoroastrians. The Zoroastrians alive today are of the groups persecuted by the Sassanians. The Sassanians at first welcomed Nestorian Christians as a political move against Byzantines but then began persecuting them too. They destroyed Hellenistic influences. They were basically a hyper nationalist hyper religious government. The sassanian laws look basically like medieval Islam. You could have slaves in sassanian persia but if they converted to Zoroastrianism they were freed. So they really weren&#039;t like the previous Achaemenid dynasty. They were so unpopular that when the Arabs invaded most of Persia decided not to help the Sassanid dynasty and abandoned them as a last f u. <br><br>Abbasids were hugely popular among th Persian population they actually backed the Abbasid revolution against the Umayyad caliphate. Abbasids brought in Persian beurocrats and it was run like a Sassanian government. It was also the period where a lot of Muslim conversions happened though. It was the wealthiest and most technologically advanced empire in the world of the time. We call it the Islamic golden age but really it was centred out of Persia and Iraq. <br><br>Safavid was before Nader shah. Safavids reclaimed the empire and went toe to toe with ottomans on a lot of occasions but eventually they collapsed when the Silk Road went terminal because Western Europeans learned to circumvent the trade routes by sea. So Iran has been a shithole for the last 500 years.

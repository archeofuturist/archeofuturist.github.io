When I did a work experience thing with my local zoo, I was talking to one of the keepers. And they said that if you get attacked by a dog, or a wolf, you grab them by their two front legs, force them over, push your weight on them, and tear their legs apart. For canines, this will instantly break their legs.<br><br>I have absolutely no idea if it works in reality, or how you&#039;re even supposed to do it, or if you&#039;ll even be functioning properly when you&#039;re attacked. But, that&#039;s apparently the best way to fight off a vicious dog.

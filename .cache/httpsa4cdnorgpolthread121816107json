If you see a contradiction you are merely seeing a lie.","com":"Is this true? I&#039;ve looked around and the sites that say there are contradictions obviously don&#039;t understand the word. One site even said that in bed and out of bed was a contradiction, obviously written by a clueless cunt.<br><br>What I mean is contradictions like on 9\/11 where it is said the towers collapsed because of the combination of being hit by a very fast object that weakened the structure and raging fires fuelled by jet fuel in conditions that caused the fuel to burn at furnace like temperatures (because of wind vortex etc). However, this is immediately contradicted by Building 7, which was not hit by a plane, nor were the fires due to aviation fuel. So, the story must be a lie.<br><br>Just as the 6 Gorrillion holocaust, where six burners needed to burn a corpse to ash within 10 minutes to just satisfy the numbers that were supposedly cremated in that camp. This is totally impossible and is contradicted simply by looking at the absolute state of the art, best crematoria available today, nothing can burn a body in 10 mins. So, this has to be a lie.<br><br>On a personal level, if you go and visit your girlfriend (who lives alone) and ask her how she&#039;s been doing, she says she&#039;s fine. You ask if she&#039;s seen anyone, she says no, you glance in the bin and there&#039;s a condom full of sperm in there, you are faced with a contradiction. She said she hasn&#039;t seen anyone, you can see a condom full of male seed. Without needing to ask her you already know she&#039;s cheated.<br><br>Or am I wrong and the world is full of innocent contradictions? If so, name them!","filename":"20131227_070335112_iOS (1)","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492585203218,"time":1492585203,"md5":"F8JGoBnvao\/L1YQ8qdwaag==","fsize":181557,"resto":0,"id":"2yG4AIrT","country":"TH","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"there-are-no-contradictions-in-nature-if-you-see","country_name":"Thailand","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121817236,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)03:16:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121816107\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121816107<\/a><br><br>The 6 million number isn&#039;t as absurd as it seems.

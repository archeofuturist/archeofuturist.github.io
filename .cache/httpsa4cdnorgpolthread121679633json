The Federation is OBVIOUSLY an individualist, Western, post-scarcity society. It&#039;s so goddamn obvious that I&#039;m getting kinda pissed having to constantly explain that it&#039;s not communism because communism is so fucking terrible that even convinced communists have to point to a fucking science fiction show with technology so advanced that it&#039;s basically magic instead of to real life as an example of their ideology.<br><br>Communism is totalitarian. That&#039;s the #1 feature of communism. And given that the Federation doesn&#039;t toss your ass into a space prison camp for saying that the Federation is wrong and should change, I don&#039;t think they&#039;re totalitarian. Multiple episodes emphasise how the Federation is based on personal freedom to the point where the people in it don&#039;t even THINK about intruding on the privacy of others. And when Barclay has a jack-off program about Deanna Troi, they&#039;re worried about his mental health, and not about the slight to the crew. As they shouldn&#039;t be, because no harm was done.<br><br>Pick ANY Trek episode, and you&#039;ll find stuff that the Federation allows that SJW&#039;s would toss you into jail for.<br><br>Another thing: The Federation is monocultural. Again and again the point is made that EVERYONE is onboard with it, and only once in a while you get someone like Worf, who&#039;s an obvious outsider and shares many of his problems with modern day 2nd generation immigrants. Except the Federation isn&#039;t carting in Klingons by the shipload.<br><br>Maybe commies think their society will be like the Federation. But even the one book I know that directly supports that idea (Hard to be a God) still manages to be criticism of communism. The Federation does not even come close to the idealism espoused by communists, except &quot;lel no more money&quot;. But that&#039;s like saying barter societies were communist too.","time":1492521608,"resto":121679633,"id":"TUwjO3VN","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121683713,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:20:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121682924\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121682924<\/a><br>does it kill you right now? no?<br><br>roddenberry was a military man, and star trek is basically a documentary.","filename":"bentheredonerich","ext":".jpg","w":564,"h":384,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":85,"tim":1492521634855,"time":1492521634,"md5":"0blUIUls5GPRnMqz976Ywg==","fsize":42215,"resto":121679633,"id":"yE6bVpPA","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":121683762,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:21:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121681246\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121681246<\/a><br>Seconded.<br>Also who&#039;s digging The Expanse","time":1492521663,"resto":121679633,"id":"jHHMTYrc","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":121683849,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:21:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121680840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121680840<\/a><br>are you sure this isn&#039;t fascism? <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;starfleet totally isn&#039;t military, ignore them blowing up planets<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;magic food dispenser is wonder of science that aids space travel, but organically grown &quot;real food&quot; is special and better<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;uniforms<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;everyone working to better themselves and their government<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;badass uniforms<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a bunch of the actors are faggots but also haven&#039;t had a real job since, almost like how in fascism everyone has a purpose, even the fags can be useful.<\/span><br><br>I get it&#039;s close to communism, but we could claim it as fascist to really piss off libtards AND spread the good word of bundled sticks.","time":1492521705,"resto":121679633,"id":"24tT118R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121683855,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:21:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121683628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121683628<\/a><br>I still find i t odd how the dogs never encountered a bug before the invasion of bug world.

The penny dropped for me when someone posted something about Stephen King being a huge shitlib. I figured, of course he is.<br><br>Because he can afford to be. These actors are wealthy cosmopolitans. To them, shit like multiculturalism sounds good because they jet between the most exclusive, expensive places in the world on the regular. And when they&#039;re tired of it all, they go back to expensive houses in quiet neighbourhoods. They can turn their idealism off any time they want to.<br><br>We, however, can&#039;t. I had a look at a voting map for Amsterdam, and it&#039;s exactly the way you&#039;d figure: The wealthy centre overwhelmingly votes for just-barely-not-full-communism leftist parties, while the shitskin neighbourhoods vote overwhelmingly for the Erdogan Party. With a few exceptions: The shitskin areas also have a few votes for Wilders, which the centre does not. And I&#039;m just guessing those are the people who CAN&#039;T turn off multiculturalism the moment they please...<br><br>It&#039;s very easy to be a liberal (that is, a social democrat, really) when you have that level of social and economic mobility. And make no mistake: Being aloof and feeling oneself better than others is definitely a part of it. Because not only do they follow the ideology, these people are also constantly in the media telling others how they should live their lives.","time":1492523956,"resto":121679633,"id":"TUwjO3VN","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121687477,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:59:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121686040\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121686040<\/a><br>get out newfag trek posting is a staple across pretty much every board on 4chan.","time":1492523967,"resto":121679633,"id":"u1dz+fmK","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121687503,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:59:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121680840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121680840<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Kirk might be the only thing about that show that&#039;s at least a little red-pilled<\/span><br>But he is a race traitor though","filename":"Plato&#039;s_Stepchildren_kiss","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":225,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1492523986362,"time":1492523986,"md5":"noZb3a10ZbhL6mFnZJgKLg==","fsize":15043,"resto":121679633,"id":"vWDdXPdj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121687511,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:59:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"Inform is the best character in all of star trek","filename":"Screenshot2011-05-15at10657AM","ext":".png","w":480,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1492523991416,"time":1492523991,"md5":"oMTbV2SE\/PMoJHVaaCwvcw==","fsize":176210,"resto":121679633,"id":"jLedIv4Y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121687563,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:00:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nevar forget.","filename":"5677617+_5b9ff3646a457c4a9613eb5bcd3f4c15","ext":".jpg","w":501,"h":585,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492524024571,"time":1492524024,"md5":"+Xidm7WJFo1wVI2iudlAag==","fsize":86817,"resto":121679633,"id":"o8hzTvr3","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":121687644,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:01:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121687179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121687179<\/a><br><br>The individual will outweighs the collectivist BS of impersonal needs","time":1492524076,"resto":121679633,"id":"dWbV\/4MM","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":121687645,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:01:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121687503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121687503<\/a><br><br>COLONIZED","time":1492524077,"resto":121679633,"id":"nW\/Uy0dH","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121687654,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:01:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121687503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121687503<\/a><br>bleaching inferior races is red pilled","time":1492524081,"resto":121679633,"id":"4mLoPix6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121687675,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:01:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121687084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121687084<\/a><br><br>resident of \/1701\/ on stonedchan here.<br><br>we all pretty much agree with you on STD. most of us are hoping that paramount just kills the show.","time":1492524093,"resto":121679633,"id":"W+BC2suj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121687685,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)10:01:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Oh god I need another show of the quality of TNG and DS9.

The Federation is OBVIOUSLY an individualist, Western, post-scarcity society. It&#039;s so goddamn obvious that I&#039;m getting kinda pissed having to constantly explain that it&#039;s not communism because communism is so fucking terrible that even convinced communists have to point to a fucking science fiction show with technology so advanced that it&#039;s basically magic instead of to real life as an example of their ideology.<br><br>Communism is totalitarian. That&#039;s the #1 feature of communism. And given that the Federation doesn&#039;t toss your ass into a space prison camp for saying that the Federation is wrong and should change, I don&#039;t think they&#039;re totalitarian. Multiple episodes emphasise how the Federation is based on personal freedom to the point where the people in it don&#039;t even THINK about intruding on the privacy of others. And when Barclay has a jack-off program about Deanna Troi, they&#039;re worried about his mental health, and not about the slight to the crew. As they shouldn&#039;t be, because no harm was done.<br><br>Pick ANY Trek episode, and you&#039;ll find stuff that the Federation allows that SJW&#039;s would toss you into jail for.<br><br>Another thing: The Federation is monocultural. Again and again the point is made that EVERYONE is onboard with it, and only once in a while you get someone like Worf, who&#039;s an obvious outsider and shares many of his problems with modern day 2nd generation immigrants. Except the Federation isn&#039;t carting in Klingons by the shipload.<br><br>Maybe commies think their society will be like the Federation. But even the one book I know that directly supports that idea (Hard to be a God) still manages to be criticism of communism. The Federation does not even come close to the idealism espoused by communists, except &quot;lel no more money&quot;. But that&#039;s like saying barter societies were communist too.","time":1492521608,"resto":121679633,"id":"TUwjO3VN","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121683713,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:20:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121682924\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121682924<\/a><br>does it kill you right now? no?<br><br>roddenberry was a military man, and star trek is basically a documentary.","filename":"bentheredonerich","ext":".jpg","w":564,"h":384,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":85,"tim":1492521634855,"time":1492521634,"md5":"0blUIUls5GPRnMqz976Ywg==","fsize":42215,"resto":121679633,"id":"yE6bVpPA","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":121683762,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:21:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121681246\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121681246<\/a><br>Seconded.<br>Also who&#039;s digging The Expanse","time":1492521663,"resto":121679633,"id":"jHHMTYrc","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":121683849,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:21:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121680840\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121680840<\/a><br>are you sure this isn&#039;t fascism? <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;starfleet totally isn&#039;t military, ignore them blowing up planets<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;magic food dispenser is wonder of science that aids space travel, but organically grown &quot;real food&quot; is special and better<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;uniforms<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;everyone working to better themselves and their government<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;badass uniforms<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a bunch of the actors are faggots but also haven&#039;t had a real job since, almost like how in fascism everyone has a purpose, even the fags can be useful.<\/span><br><br>I get it&#039;s close to communism, but we could claim it as fascist to really piss off libtards AND spread the good word of bundled sticks.","time":1492521705,"resto":121679633,"id":"24tT118R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121683855,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:21:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121683628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121683628<\/a><br>I still find i t odd how the dogs never encountered a bug before the invasion of bug world.

But as a person who was involved in many fights in the past, I learned a very simple lesson. Fistfights don&#039;t solve any significant problems. It&#039;s great when somebody is messing with you to kick their ass, but this is not a sustainable plan for making changing in society. Fighting really isn&#039;t the answer - but i suppose you and people like you will have to learn this lesson on your own.

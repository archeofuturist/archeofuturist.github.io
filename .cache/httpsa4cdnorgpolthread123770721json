Since the Jew saw his wallet harmed by cheap slaves, he decided to end that, to get more profits and make their competitors pay a wage for their otherwise workforce.<br><br>Many recollections of that time clearly state that many &quot;liberated&quot; black men wished they could remain as slaves.<br>As slaves they secured a roof for their family, a daily meal, basic home schooling (remember the South people were educated gentlemen, the North people were full of drunk irish and chinese and prostitutes) <br>With liberation, nobody would hire a nigger, they got chinamen for that, cheaper and more trustworthy. <br>The families in the South who lost everything couldn&#039;t pay to maintain their niggers and couldn&#039;t own them as slaves, so master and nigger had to go separate ways.<br>The nigger, who was used to work, sleep and eat now suddenly has the burden to carry with a family, to provide, to manage their income, to save money, to decide, etc. <br>Now how do you include into society someone who can barely speak and only knows to use brute force? You can&#039;t and soon the nigger turned his life into crime and that&#039;s where you get the modern nigger from today. Only good for crime using the brute forced he got from the plantation and singing using the songs he learned while picking cotton. <br><br>Have you ever wondered why niggers are so &quot;good&quot; with music, or why music is their only contribution? <br>Its because singing was the only thing they could do besides picking cotton.<br><br>If you are too lazy to actually read, at least watch Gone With the Wind. It really portrays very accurately what was happening there: Evil drunk asshole North people, Poor rich educated South people who lose everything, niggers being sad about not being slaves anymore, etc.","time":1493734980,"resto":123770721,"id":"1DVgn8UU","country":"PE","country_name":"Peru"},{"no":123773152,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)10:36:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123770721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123770721<\/a><br>TIME MACHINE<br>I<br>M<br>E<br><br>M<br>A<br>C<br>H<br>I<br>N<br>E","time":1493735784,"resto":123770721,"id":"f2c29007","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123773336,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)10:37:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"he probably has intel on how likely a civil war is in the current political climate anf is trying to warn us subtly","time":1493735874,"resto":123770721,"id":"GC1no2Lw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123773495,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)10:39:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123771426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123771426<\/a><br>I don&#039;t even think he knows what it was about.

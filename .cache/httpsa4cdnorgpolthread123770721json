Since the Jew saw his wallet harmed by cheap slaves, he decided to end that, to get more profits and make their competitors pay a wage for their otherwise workforce.<br><br>Many recollections of that time clearly state that many &quot;liberated&quot; black men wished they could remain as slaves.<br>As slaves they secured a roof for their family, a daily meal, basic home schooling (remember the South people were educated gentlemen, the North people were full of drunk irish and chinese and prostitutes) <br>With liberation, nobody would hire a nigger, they got chinamen for that, cheaper and more trustworthy. <br>The families in the South who lost everything couldn&#039;t pay to maintain their niggers and couldn&#039;t own them as slaves, so master and nigger had to go separate ways.<br>The nigger, who was used to work, sleep and eat now suddenly has the burden to carry with a family, to provide, to manage their income, to save money, to decide, etc. <br>Now how do you include into society someone who can barely speak and only knows to use brute force? You can&#039;t and soon the nigger turned his life into crime and that&#039;s where you get the modern nigger from today. Only good for crime using the brute forced he got from the plantation and singing using the songs he learned while picking cotton. <br><br>Have you ever wondered why niggers are so &quot;good&quot; with music, or why music is their only contribution? <br>Its because singing was the only thing they could do besides picking cotton.<br><br>If you are too lazy to actually read, at least watch Gone With the Wind. It really portrays very accurately what was happening there: Evil drunk asshole North people, Poor rich educated South people who lose everything, niggers being sad about not being slaves anymore, etc.","time":1493734980,"resto":123770721,"id":"1DVgn8UU","country":"PE","country_name":"Peru"},{"no":123773152,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)10:36:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123770721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123770721<\/a><br>TIME MACHINE<br>I<br>M<br>E<br><br>M<br>A<br>C<br>H<br>I<br>N<br>E","time":1493735784,"resto":123770721,"id":"f2c29007","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123773336,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)10:37:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"he probably has intel on how likely a civil war is in the current political climate anf is trying to warn us subtly","time":1493735874,"resto":123770721,"id":"GC1no2Lw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123773495,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)10:39:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123771426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123771426<\/a><br>I don&#039;t even think he knows what it was about.

Managing their families with simple means was always what niggers did so working for money and feeding their families kept niggers humble and to themselves. In the south the largest construction demographic was niggers almost literally 100% of the workforce was niggers and since there was a free market and slavery was abolished foreman&#039;s didn&#039;t have to pay them huge wages like they did with the whites that didn&#039;t work as many hours and was less suited for the outside work, this isn&#039;t an insult to whites but by and large niggers were just bred to work those kinds of environments.<br>-Second before welfare state niggers had a lower unemployment rate then whites<br>-Third before rampant degeneracy niggers knew their place, they had their families, believed and worshiped god and kept to their own. Eventually these people that had jobs that kept family values became the middle-class and upper-middle class blacks of today just like the chinks did.<br><br>The biggest issue we see here today is niggers don&#039;t have fathers. If its bad to not have an authority figure for regular people it is catastrophic for niggers who are more aggressive and lower IQ. Niggers need to have labor jobs that requires hard work for the vast majority of them, some who grew up in better means have assimilated and work regular jobs have diminishing birth rates and don&#039;t cap others on the first insult; I work for a small company, every contractor or delivery person niggers is okay and isn&#039;t chimp-tier, the unskilled labor standing around line-men is a retard and obnoxious. Niggers need boundaries and law to keep them sustainable, and being in the first world they eventually through hard and punishing laws and boundaries can succeed to remedial use to bolster labor forces as more and more whites and other demographics leave the hard-labor force.","time":1493737092,"resto":123770721,"id":"IMQW3w2L","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123775397,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)10:58:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123774668\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123774668<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the First Amendment is archaic <\/span><br>He was actually talking about the silent filibuster being archaic you idiot piece of shit<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m a globalist<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Actually it was I&#039;m a Nationalist and Globalist<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Global trade deals that are fair and mutually benefit us and our neighbors because we actually got Cuckdeau and Nieto to come crawling to the negotiation table after threatening to leave is bad wahhhhhhh<\/span>","time":1493737098,"resto":123770721,"id":"vVf+zglz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123775407,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)10:58:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123774907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123774907<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Saying you know more about your country just because you live there is a non sequitur.<\/span><br>disagree","time":1493737103,"resto":123770721,"id":"YCP7LPgg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123775475,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)10:59:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123775322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123775322<\/a><br>tariffs not taxes","time":1493737152,"resto":123770721,"id":"YCP7LPgg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123775513,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)10:59:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"that&#039;s actually a question I have asked myself in the past year. great minds think alike I guess","time":1493737173,"resto":123770721,"id":"OqcVtmYY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123775686,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:01:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123771809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123771809<\/a><br>Can&#039;t wait until gone with the wind is remade and the woman gets BLACKED","time":1493737286,"resto":123770721,"id":"0yCz1Qer","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123775900,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:03:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Shareblue is really pushing this civil war comment.

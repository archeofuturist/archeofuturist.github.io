Even though all this we were doing quite well and nearly destroyed them. But then this Erdogan guy showed up and gave them everything they want, (money,place everything) the roads that Akp made has bombs under it. After Erdogan PKK growed again and became a real threat (but somehow PKK never strikes against him, when akp followers get courroged the get outside at nights all mouth, pkk didnt do anything, if there was a real pkk, they would fucked up thousands) and now erdogan wants right to make state by new election. What state do think he is gona make?

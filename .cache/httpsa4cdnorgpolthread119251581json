Of course, liking two doesn&#039;t always implying liking a third - but this seems to be true more often than not.<br><br>Since I&#039;ve noticed this, I&#039;ve been trying to identify the nature of the underlying correlation. Here are my thoughts:<br><br>1. Following Barthes essay on Wrestling, it is clear that all three subjects lack any trace of subtlety. In showtunes, there is nothing intellectual complex, instead we are greeted with pure pathos. In the case of politics, arguments are communicated in their most base form (&quot;Kill all jews&quot;, &quot;End white domination&quot;). In the case of wrestling, the language is reduced to pure physicality.<br><br>2. There is not sliding moral scale of gray, there is only Good and Evil. All three live in universes where there are clear Heroes and Villians. I believe that this suggests an incapacity of any moral reasoning beyond the level of a young child.<br><br>3. The major consumers tend to have difficulty conveying their emotions through language with partners and lovers, and they long for a more simplistic world.","filename":"tumblr_static_tumblr_static_al211c7uca8sk44ckkk4cs8o8_640","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":282,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":141,"tim":1491170251648,"time":1491170251,"md5":"SXUw0zOJskgpwKVYcizegQ==","fsize":52674,"resto":0,"id":"0fBWHtox","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ive-noticed-something-recently-pol-and-i-need","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

I\u2019ve never had sex.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When I was young, I always imagined I would be married by 25 and have a brood of kids. Jesus said in the Gospel of Matthew to \u201cmake disciples,\u201d and I thought it would be cool to take that verse literally and have 12 kids. I wanted enough kids to fill a baseball team, a hockey bench and a big house full of love.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That obviously didn\u2019t happen. Or it hasn\u2019t happened yet. But I love my life. I spent last weekend learning how to scull on the Potomac River. I have good friends, a great family, hobbies and one of the best jobs I\u2019ve ever had.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do I feel a void because I\u2019m not married and I don\u2019t have children yet? Sure. Do I wish I were having sex? Of course.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But I believe that I\u2019m living a fuller, better life because of my commitment to sexual integrity. I spend all day, every day doing the things that I want to do, because I\u2019m not wasting my time worrying about waking up next to a stranger, contracting a sexually transmitted infection or missing a period.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The truth is, I am able to live the feminist dream because I\u2019m not stressing over the things that sex outside of marriage often brings. And I\u2019m not alone.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news<wbr>\/acts-of-faith\/wp\/2016\/09\/08\/im-a-3<wbr>2-year-old-virgin-and-im-living-the<wbr>-feminist-dream\/","filename":"imrs (4)","ext":".jpg","w":1484,"h":989,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492920556917,"time":1492920556,"md5":"\/ugq5XMOv\/i85jwaOoA2fw==","fsize":250261,"resto":0,"id":"qj5efrxC","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"my-name-is-kate-im-32-years-old-ive-never-had-sex","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":122377684,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)00:12:48","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1492820693531","ext":".jpg","w":224,"h":225,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492920768106,"time":1492920768,"md5":"a7zTKKokGsOsXnh8K\/Qi0Q==","fsize":12715,"resto":122377282,"id":"gGrQLunN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122377824,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)00:14:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122377282\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122377282<\/a><br>Society has degenerated so much that virgins are seen as strange","time":1492920844,"resto":122377282,"id":"3u\/Z5gFY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122377918,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)00:14:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Brrrrrraaaaaaappppppp<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-QS<wbr>tujaQFT8","time":1492920898,"resto":122377282,"id":"Qzzm2bZg","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

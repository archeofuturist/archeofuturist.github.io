Right Extremist is also a common label if you disagree with anything.<br><br>It makes me feel like I&#039;m living in some kind of PC zombie apocalypse nightmare, and there&#039;s nothing I can do but sit alone in silence and watch the world burn, or go out and pretend to be one of them, but that would kill the last shred of humanity that&#039;s left in me. <br><br><br>Two groups of people have passed by my window as i was typing this, both foreigners speaking some kind of language I couldn&#039;t understand, is it wrong of me to be creeped out by this? A lot of these people, I can&#039;t say how many, don&#039;t even make an effort to learn our language, or even English, and why would they need to? They already get all they need just by being here (Kinda like me, so I&#039;m not that much better). <br>Another thing that ads to my annoyance, is knowing that the politically correct, the feminists, and the SJW&#039;s still act like they are in the minority, like they are the underdog, fighting the oppression forced upon them, by guys like me, when they are clearly the ones in charge.<br>Our prime minister is a feminist woman, the mental health care system and schools are filled with them.<br>Since I made the mistake of creating a Facebook account, I&#039;m being bombarded with constant preaching about tolerance for the gay and fat.<br>The Norwegian Resource Center for Men tried to make it illegal to &quot;harass&quot; feminists, and you know what that means.<br>You can also call their &quot;man-line&quot; and ask them for help...controlling your male violent tendencies.","time":1492199769,"resto":121103666,"id":"2Teq1usi","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121104709,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)15:57:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121103666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121103666<\/a><br><br>America is the cause of every problem in the world.","time":1492199867,"resto":121103666,"id":"W5GcjUBi","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121104991,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)15:59:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121103666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121103666<\/a> (OP)<br> true anon","time":1492199991,"resto":121103666,"id":"2Teq1usi","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"}]}

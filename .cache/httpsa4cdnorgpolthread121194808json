The defendant&#039;s brother spoke at the hearing and compared Vallejo to Jesus in making the argument that he was wrongly convicted, McBride said.<br><br>&quot;I don&#039;t think it&#039;s wrong to acknowledge the good things that someone has done in their lives,&quot; the prosecutor said. &quot;But I think whenever you do that in a case like this, you&#039;ve also got to say, &#039;But it doesn&#039;t excuse what you&#039;ve done.&#039; &quot;","filename":"KeithRobertVallejo","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492250406809,"time":1492250406,"md5":"ZkTkya3AHiKZ1xjFDRQagA==","fsize":72490,"resto":0,"id":"qkD6KPt9","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"judge-in-hot-water-after-praising-rapist-exmormon","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

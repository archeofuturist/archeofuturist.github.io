It never crosses their mind that \u201dwhite\u201d-looking Jews depend daily on the existence of \u201cwhite\u201d-looking non-Jews to camouflage their own presence. If all \u201cwhite\u201d-looking non-Jews were removed from the picture, Jews would instantly become so conspicuous in their positions of control that they would no longer be able to infiltrate society. While different anti-Zionists have different speculations about Zionist strategy, only WNs are idiotic enough to suggest with a straight face that the Jewish goal is to blow their own cover.<\/span><br>http:\/\/aryanism.net\/politics\/white-<wbr>nationalists\/","time":1490827551,"resto":118838535,"id":"CGb1nm\/c","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118845630,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)18:45:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118839836\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118839836<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Lesbian parents<\/span><br><br>Wait, wait wait wait.

Both sexes are masculine, aggressive, and territorial, but men just excel at masculinity so it infantilizes women by contrast. Males fight other males for access to various things. This competition is what shaped us to have an extra &quot;kick&quot; and advantage over women. This is called sexual dimorphism. The kind of ideas you are talking about were invented by women worshippers who want to give women an identity so they don&#039;t feel bad when comparing themselves to males. This kind of talk is like the people who say &quot;Men have higher IQs... b-but women have higher EQs and emotional abilities!!&quot; and other bullshit. The true red pill is realizing women are just weak humans. They are the &quot;default&quot;, while men are the expanded premium package. <br>&quot;Feminine&quot; is just another word for weak, and masculinity is synonymous with strength. A man who doesn&#039;t lift can be considered feminine in contrast to a man who does. And a sporty woman can be considered masculine in contrast to lazy sedentary woman. <br><br>Men are bigger, stronger, and smarter because it is an evolutionary necessity for males to compete to be top male.","time":1490827594,"resto":118838535,"id":"dZWzF2B5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118845705,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)18:46:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118845199\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118845199<\/a><br>man , dont make be reference, i dont care if you believe me i just trying to provide the info i have. iv read papers on, it, written about it. but it wa a while ago. <br><br>south america i think but there is bound to be more than one community.","time":1490827597,"resto":118838535,"id":"C9rVyc28","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":118845763,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)18:47:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118845489\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118845489<\/a><br>Prooooof?","time":1490827627,"resto":118838535,"id":"zpVllW8O","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":118845879,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)18:48:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118842295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118842295<\/a><br><br>well if you&#039;ve never noticed it then it must not be true anywhere<br><br>i actually gave my view on gender roles and said to an extent they have a biological basis and make sense on some levels, individuals not fitting them is natural as well due to human variation<br><br>i&#039;ve made vague statements because i don&#039;t feel like writing you an essay on everything i find wrong with abrahamic religions","time":1490827685,"resto":118838535,"id":"6ue8DGj1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118845997,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)18:48:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118845705\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118845705<\/a><br>Well, if I have to trust your word alone, you do understand it&#039;s not a very effective argument.","time":1490827739,"resto":118838535,"id":"zpVllW8O","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":118846081,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)18:49:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118838855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118838855<\/a><br>fpbp &amp; digits wow. <br><br>OP go tell a mama grizzly bear that gender roles are made up. <br>I&#039;m tired of hearing you argue about who should cook dinner.","time":1490827790,"resto":118838535,"id":"AEEK9noJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118846110,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)18:50:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118839221\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118839221<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sometimes I like wearing girls hotpants shorts and perfume<\/span><br><br>Yeah, you&#039;re a faggot.","time":1490827802,"resto":118838535,"id":"8SQWs6MD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118846112,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)18:50:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118842451\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118842451<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A man in a skirt looks fucking ridiculous.<\/span><br>Rude.","filename":"1471254686256","ext":".jpg","w":677,"h":782,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490827802285,"time":1490827802,"md5":"nEK74QfPDqdqMDlhikWnHQ==","fsize":231971,"resto":118838535,"id":"gwYe1wAA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118846239,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)18:51:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118838535\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118838535<\/a><br>They aren&#039;t bullshit perse they were naturally formed for understandable reasons that I can go into if you want.<br><br>However they are, for the most part, unnecessary in today&#039;s world. <br><br>That being said, there is a difference between natural change (which is slow) and the abandonment of logic, reason and merit in favor of diversity for the sake of diversity.

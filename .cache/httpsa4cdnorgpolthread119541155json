One hiker, alone, fell a cliff and we found him 1 year later. Shit like that.<br><br>But an old coworker close to retirement told me and my buddy about &quot;las rarezas&quot;, you can translate as the oddities.<br><br>He was obsessed with the numbers of missing people in Spain, like, doesn&#039;t matter how many people disappear, there are 15-20 kids never seen again. 70 people disappeared 2015? 15 kids. 94 disappear in 2016? 16 kids. And then he talk us about the walkers. Stalkers. People at odd places at odd hours. We laugh at him. He was a full tinfoil hat.<br><br>But one day i saw a man well dressed in a suit walking in the forest. Something odd in the mountain. I told my buddy via radio, and he answer he just saw him 1 minute ago. We blame each other taking the other spot, bc we had to be kilometers away from each other. But no, we were kilometers away from each other. It&#039;s wasn&#039;t possible to that man to reach that distance in 2 or 3 minutes, not even 10. We concluded there were 2 men.<br><br>Also the stalkers, you saw them, you say good morning but they just look at you, like if you interrupt them. No words, they just stand there, if you approach them, they leave. They don&#039;t like our presence. Spooky motherfuckers. Sometimes, they leave &quot;presents&quot; like a little rock on your car, a flower or a teeth of our chainsaws in the spot where we eat. I don&#039;t understand why and drives me crazy.<br><br>And the people who says i&#039;ll be over there, i&#039;ll come back at 20h. And i never see them again, but find the equipment next to the trail.","time":1491357317,"resto":119541155,"id":"Strb6KTy","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119550406,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)21:57:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119549906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119549906<\/a><br>hi","time":1491357426,"resto":119541155,"id":"gkNU8RzK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

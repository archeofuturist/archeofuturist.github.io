But whether you think he&#039;s controlled opposition, whether he offends your every sensibility, whether you think he&#039;s just a fucking idiot, or whatever your opinion of this cockgobbler may be - Antifa cannot be allowed to continue bullying colleges into banning every speaker they&#039;re offended by.<br><br>To anyone who may be considering organizing a counter-protest, consider these simple guidelines.<br><br><br>DOS AND DON&#039;TS FOR AUBURN RALLY<br><br>1) Do NOT incite violence, you&#039;ll do more damage taking pics of Antifa beating up bystanders than you will cracking skulls and kicking ass.<br>2) Do NOT come armed. Be prepared to defend yourselves and others IF FORCED, bring defensive implements IF YOU MUST, but do NOT under ANY circumstances bring weapons.<br>3) Do NOT come dressed like stomcunts or tacticool fags. Bring safety\/sporting gear if you have it, but don&#039;t look like you came dressed for a riot.<br>4) Do NOT talk to press about stupid alt-right shit or memes, stay on-message.<br>5) Do NOT cause damage to the campus or the downtown area.<br><br>1) DO wear Auburn colors to the rally - dark blue and orange<br>2) DO act civil and composed - there must be a stark contrast between you and the Antifa hooligans<br>3) DO take lots of pics and vids so you can report any Antifa to police\/university.<br>4) DO talk to press about the importance of defending speech, ESPECIALLY unpopular speech, on college campuses.<br>5) DO stay after the rally to help clean up damage caused by Antifa. Bring trashbags for litter, medkits to help with bystander injuries.<br><br>And most importantly, if you are a student or faculty member at Auburn, please stay safe tomorrow.<br><br>War Eagle!","filename":"au","ext":".gif","w":200,"h":178,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":178,"tim":1492520808422,"time":1492520808,"md5":"DYlk8nDGzegJp15S4JYYNQ==","fsize":11530,"resto":0,"id":"F77nzrGZ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"berkeley-ii-electric-boogaloo","country_name":"United States","replies":238,"images":31,"unique_ips":108,"tail_size":50},{"no":121683014,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:13:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121682403\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121682403<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;reddit instructional\/bandwagon post<\/span><br>not your personal army and fuck off.","time":1492521191,"resto":121682403,"id":"rVyLcLAB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121683129,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:14:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121683014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121683014<\/a><br>hello antifa","time":1492521263,"resto":121682403,"id":"FtBc12FN","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121683272,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)09:15:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Everyone hates antifa.

Under Alabama state law, if you are found carrying any kind of weapon within 1,000 feet of a public demonstration, you will be forcibly removed from the area by the police and if you&#039;re caught using any kind of weapon against demonstrators it&#039;s an automatic misdemeanor charge - minimum fines of up to a couple thousand dollars and potential jail time.<br><br>Do NOT bring any weapons or anything that could be construed as a weapon by police - no batons, no bats, no sticks, no gas, etc etc. Best case you&#039;ll be removed from the demonstration by police.

The straps are used to hold the sign, but allow it to be used effectively as an impromptu riot shield.

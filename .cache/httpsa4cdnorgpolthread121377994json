You should not ever hate yourself: God has infinite and unconditional love for you, what He loves you have no right to hate. Hate your sins of course, but never the sinner. <br><br>As for such addiction, if I may offer some advice I recived from a priest years ago about the very same addictions: When you are tempted by the Enemy, do not let yourself fall into his traps. Instead, go and do Christ&#039;s work whenever you feel the temptation, go do acts of charity, read the bible, pray, go to mass, reflect and meditate on God and the Faith, do anything to get your mind off the temptation. Then slowly but surely, you shall destroy the addiction, and in its place build a new addiction to service of God, and in time you shall grow in knowledge and virtue, you shall come to be a great servent of God and shall be able to minister to others, to call them out of their sins and to Christ. Thus, a saint shall be made from a sinner, from the depths of sin you shall rise to heavenly grace.<br><br>Always remember, a good portion of the saints, perhaps even most of them, began life as rather horrible sinful men, until Christ reached into their heart and called them. <br><br>As for being saved, if you&#039;re trying to do good, believe in God and are truly repentent, and do all you can to break addiction, I would imagine God would let you enter into His Kingdom. I&#039;m not God, so I can&#039;t say for certain, but you sound as if you&#039;re trying to do your best.","time":1492368232,"resto":121377994,"id":"JDaAAjGb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121395346,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)14:44:04","name":"WOLFSHIEM","com":"HAPPY EASTER, \/POL\/","filename":"1d579d10cb3311004871533e9a956c26","ext":".jpg","w":236,"h":353,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492368244113,"time":1492368244,"md5":"Zs\/5fvDWzgl6gBCTLoN2iQ==","fsize":20566,"resto":121377994,"id":"GKBR2yZl","country":"US","trip":"!!tuOwy1ct2dy","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121395457,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)14:44:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121394893\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121394893<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121394841\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121394841<\/a><br><br>Thank you both, this really cleared up some of my confusion regarding my relationship with Christ.

If you are, then right now no. Mortal sin sets your will upon a thing less worthy than God, which means that, after your soul separates from body and is unable to change its decision anymore, your mind is forever locked on unworthy good, which makes the punishment similarly eternal. Mortal sin has to have three qualities to deserve its name: be committed with full consent, full knowledge of its evil and it must be a grave sin - the third condition can be defined based on whether a sin committed with two first condition ends up being mortal or venial (see below); as such, gravity is hard to determine, although theologians have been throughout centuries debating on what is and isn&#039;t grave (and there are clues from the Bible) and if you want to know whether some sin is grave or not, with all probability answer will be easy to find on the Internet. Mortal sin needs contrition to be remitted - this means sincere will (note that although emotions are often associated with contrition, even without feelings and emotions contrition can happen, since it only touches on will) not to sin mortally, to fear sin above any possible temporal suffering from a reason based on faith. Any such contrition (most easily contrition from fear of Hell) can remit sins in Confession, although something called perfect contrition - based on love of God due to goodness, mercy, justice inherent to Him, combined with desire to go to Confession as soon as possible - is enough to wipe out sins even if you don&#039;t manage to confess before you die. It should be a very common subject of your prayers, the more you practice it and ask God, the easier it comes. <br><br>(cont. in reply)","time":1492370440,"resto":121377994,"id":"zYMFDd5D","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121399978,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)15:20:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121399071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121399071<\/a><br>Thinking real life and church work like a rpg.","time":1492370449,"resto":121377994,"id":"YDnKFJqu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121400045,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)15:21:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121399071\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121399071<\/a><br>You underestimate the things priests hear in confession anon.

If you were before the age of reason and died such, original sin - sin only in name, it would be more proper to call it a defect on the soul - would prevent you from being able to achieve Heaven, but lack of sins wouldn&#039;t make you fit for &quot;usual&quot; part of Hell. Such a state is called Limbo (it doesn&#039;t mean that all children who weren&#039;t visibly baptised end up there - God isn&#039;t bound by sacraments and it&#039;s possible that He provides such souls grace necessary to achieve Heaven). Whether people that achieve age of reason can end in Limbo is debatable - Aquinas argues that the first thought an unbaptised person makes upon reaching the age is either a mortal sin or equivalent to baptism. If you haven&#039;t been baptised, do it as soon as possible. Baptism by water is the usual way, but baptism of desire and martyrdom would be equivalent in their effect on their soul.<br><br>The last possibility is that you are in state of venial sin, which is any sin that doesn&#039;t fit all three criteria of mortal sin. A soul commiting it is still oriented on God, although imperfectly, and if you die with the stain of venial sin on your soul, your punishment is completed after death. However, since the orientation is still on God, after the punishment ends the soul achieves Heaven. Indulgences are ways to lessen or eliminate this punishment. To perform an indulgence, you must be free from any attachment to sin (this means the state of your will - even if you are addicted to some sin, as long as you will not to do it and to get rid of your addiction, it&#039;s enough). Although their existence is doctrinal matter, the exact form they are performed isn&#039;t constant - the current list of indulgences should be pretty easy to find on the Internet. <br><br>(once again, cont. in the reply)","time":1492370806,"resto":121377994,"id":"zYMFDd5D","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121400824,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)15:27:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121398523\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121398523<\/a><br>Congratulations Anon, I wish for you the blessings of our Lord :)","filename":"C__Data_Users_DefApps_AppData_INTERNETEXPLORER_Temp_Saved Images_131","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":302,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1492370866824,"time":1492370866,"md5":"aL0MdJODwAX+sICgXXxWLQ==","fsize":29997,"resto":121377994,"id":"AHdhqC0S","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":121400930,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)15:28:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121400378\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121400378<\/a><br>Most churches have a schedule that you can find somewhere.

Job then admits his weakness in the face of such suffering, retracts his questions and repents and makes offering to God.<br>God then rewards Job&#039;s faith in the face of satan&#039;s torture of him with even greater riches, even more chidren and a happy and long life.<br><br>Sometimes we don&#039;t always understand why things happen to us.

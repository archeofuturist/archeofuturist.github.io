If there was a tiny tunnel that penetrated the bullet, one hole being close to the tip and the exit hole being close to the rear, that would create a pressure differential in flight which would result in a wonky flight path that heavily favors the rotation of the rifling. The barrels are rifled to help distribute any non uniform imperfections in weight or surface of the bullet evenly throughout its flight path to get an average path that is more desirable. <br><br>Before this conversation goes any further I want you to know I have a degree in aerodynamics so this may get a little hard for you to comprehend.","time":1490957265,"resto":119036251,"id":"hxeiwXf\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119045089,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)06:47:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119039872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119039872<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m a drooling retard: the post<\/span><br>the hazard is to other things in orbit, or even people in orbit, not people on Earth","time":1490957268,"resto":119036251,"id":"pPtNfJ0H","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119045311,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)06:51:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119041255\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119041255<\/a><br>Underrated","time":1490957476,"resto":119036251,"id":"Sfz3b5Kr","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119045386,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)06:52:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119045084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119045084<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Before this conversation goes any further I want you to know I have a degree in aerodynamics so this may get a little hard for you to comprehend.<\/span><br><br>I don&#039;t think you have a degree in anything since you were dumb enough to make that ridiculous bullet fired vs bullet dropped post","time":1490957541,"resto":119036251,"id":"Axu9rb8J","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119045583,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)06:55:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119041491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119041491<\/a><br>What the?

If there was a tiny tunnel that penetrated the bullet, one hole being close to the tip and the exit hole being close to the rear, that would create a pressure differential in flight which would result in a wonky flight path that heavily favors the rotation of the rifling. The barrels are rifled to help distribute any non uniform imperfections in weight or surface of the bullet evenly throughout its flight path to get an average path that is more desirable. <br><br>Before this conversation goes any further I want you to know I have a degree in aerodynamics so this may get a little hard for you to comprehend.","time":1490957265,"resto":119036251,"id":"hxeiwXf\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119045089,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)06:47:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119039872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119039872<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I&#039;m a drooling retard: the post<\/span><br>the hazard is to other things in orbit, or even people in orbit, not people on Earth","time":1490957268,"resto":119036251,"id":"pPtNfJ0H","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119045311,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)06:51:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119041255\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119041255<\/a><br>Underrated","time":1490957476,"resto":119036251,"id":"Sfz3b5Kr","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119045386,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)06:52:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119045084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119045084<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Before this conversation goes any further I want you to know I have a degree in aerodynamics so this may get a little hard for you to comprehend.<\/span><br><br>I don&#039;t think you have a degree in anything since you were dumb enough to make that ridiculous bullet fired vs bullet dropped post","time":1490957541,"resto":119036251,"id":"Axu9rb8J","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119045583,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)06:55:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119041491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119041491<\/a><br>What the?

With the end of the EVA period approaching, an attempt to force it open was made by Major Ivanovich. The weakened bracket gave way, tore part of the panel free, and Ivanovich was accidentally launched from the ISS, into his own separate orbit.&quot;<br><br>&quot;The other members of the three man crew, also on EVA at the time, were unable to mount an effective rescue mission in time. Upon returning to the inside of the station, the crew contacted control staff at both Korolyov and JSC. After thirty minutes of discussion, it was found that there were no safe options for retrieval available to the ISS crew, and the decision to abandon Ivanovich was made. Crew on the ISS, as per Roscosmos orders, closed communications with him, and he was left to drift alone.&quot;<br><br>&quot;Several shortwave enthusiasts reported being able to capture faint voice and telemetry data from his suit, with telemetry data persisting until February 18th. On September 7, 2006, at 16:00 GMT, Major Ivanovich re-entered the Earth&#039;s atmosphere over the Southern Ocean at 110.4\u00b0 East longitude and 46.3\u00b0 South latitude.&quot;<br><br>RIP sweet prince ;_;<br>Never forget.","filename":"627260421997308842","ext":".gif","w":640,"h":290,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":56,"tim":1490973677180,"time":1490973677,"md5":"pubnrPh3hLEMvSGYV\/nVmQ==","fsize":2181542,"resto":119036251,"id":"9os\/CjM0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119065185,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)11:21:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; Spacewalkers have lost objects before, but usually the items are small, like bolts.

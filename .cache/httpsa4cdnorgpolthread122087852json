I think it&#039;s primarily ostracization from social groups. Everyone here seems to have an animosity averse to those who are content in social situations. Typically, those who detest minorities, such as Muslims and Africans, merely misunderstand how human and similar these cohorts are to what you deem normal. The problem is that because of reservation and lack of social cohesion, you never come to this conclusion or so I anticipated.","filename":"socially-awkward","ext":".jpg","w":780,"h":433,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":138,"tim":1492744518140,"time":1492744518,"md5":"bxsSNYlZ1ORaBktm8s92KQ==","fsize":132071,"resto":0,"id":"EcfW\/Pc5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-were-your-teenage-years-like","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":1,"unique_ips":8},{"no":122088263,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)23:18:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122087852\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122087852<\/a><br>Trying to sound intelligent and failing: the post","time":1492744738,"resto":122087852,"id":"HuVQQSZA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122088329,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)23:19:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;far right nazis<\/span><br><br>B8","time":1492744773,"resto":122087852,"id":"xne74G0j","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122088774,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)23:23:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nah I was pretty well liked in highschool.

Nazis, Communists, Wahabi Muslims, and even ancaps are all people who want a complete overhaul of the establishment - which really sets them apart from any conservative-style ideology because those people tend to grow up normally and with plenty of resources.

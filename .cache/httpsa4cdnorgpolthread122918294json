Horses and oxen enabled us to plough more acres and create more food. Burning wood kept us warm. Burning coal let us have lights, electric heaters, and steam engines that enabled to us cross the country in a week instead of months. Liquid hydrocarbons let us cross the country in a few days, and took us to the moon.<br><br>The next advancement is advanced nuclear. We have reactors that cannot melt down, due to the way they are designed. They produce energy for a fraction of the cost of coal. This means an end to climate change, while simultaneously growing the economy. It could mean lower taxes, as our government finances these projects, sells the power, and has less need to take money from the people.<br><br>But what does it mean in the 3rd world? It means the difference between having or not having electricity at all. It means power and heat made cheaply enough that they can desalinate salt water. It means growing food indoors under cheap grow lights, in places with poor soil quality. It means literal life and death.<br><br>Clean, cheap, safe energy is a moral imperative.<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Molte<wbr>n_salt_reactor<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Thori<wbr>um-based_nuclear_power<br><br>\u201cThorium Cheaper than Coal\u201d<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ayI<wbr>yiVua8cY","filename":"1","ext":".jpg","w":598,"h":604,"tn_w":247,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493231443891,"time":1493231443,"md5":"AGgJIJlEtW16HkhBT6lg4g==","fsize":206287,"resto":0,"id":"hPEDQeRM","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"advanced-nuclear-reactors-are-a-moral-imperative","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":2,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122918709,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:33:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"won&#039;t happen. cause of jews","time":1493231616,"resto":122918294,"id":"UtU9M2BC","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122919062,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)14:36:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122918709\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122918709<\/a><br><br>That&#039;s a good goy.

Trump is failing us and quickly. He is bowing to china. Heres the deal, anything that destabilizes the EU is great for our people. Putin destabilizes the eu to for a russian federation.

Assad may be terrible, but he is secular, keeping isis at bay. If we destabilize another regime the refugee crisis will only escalate.","time":1491689519,"resto":120190192,"id":"sbTD681u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120191211,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:14:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120190939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120190939<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Graduate highschool<\/span><br>You&#039;re doing this in so many threads, I&#039;m pretty sure you&#039;re underageb&amp;<br><br>MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOODS","filename":"1481406086523s","ext":".jpg","w":124,"h":124,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491689649003,"time":1491689649,"md5":"Di49NFLqOR1PlUOpCdyzkw==","fsize":2049,"resto":120190192,"id":"mDpbwEPO","country":"IM","country_name":"Isle of Man"},{"no":120192062,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:20:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"Atleast i come from a real country","time":1491690040,"resto":120190192,"id":"sbTD681u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120192869,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:26:59","name":"About these Shills","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Graduate highschool<\/span><br>OOOOOH MAAAN, We got mr. degree masturbator here<br><br>Fucking retard thinks Trump is bowing to China because of some bullshit coverage, Diplomacy is the art of deceiving and appearances my dear.","time":1491690419,"resto":120190192,"id":"gMTJDRdV","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120193074,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)18:28:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120190192\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120190192<\/a>","filename":"1470140620864","ext":".png","w":600,"h":450,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491690511806,"time":1491690511,"md5":"x8iciUBmizRlG5UJQuOT+A==","fsize":499598,"resto":120190192,"id":"mDpbwEPO","country":"IM","country_name":"Isle of Man"}]}

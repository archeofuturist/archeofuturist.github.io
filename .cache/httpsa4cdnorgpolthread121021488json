Notice that you don&#039;t see a lot of them on here or \/r9k\/, because they aren&#039;t NEETs. While America&#039;s employment rate for younger men has fallen like a rock, Germany&#039;s has actually increased over the past 40 years. <br><br>We don&#039;t need basic income. We need to tax people so goddamned much that they hate working, because they don&#039;t get to keep the fruits of their own labour. That way, someone else will do those hours, and they won&#039;t be shitting up my board with their NEETness.","filename":"deathandtaxes","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":319,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492146207803,"time":1492146207,"md5":"LMe53d+fCLWvgbvsVjGzXA==","fsize":63278,"resto":0,"id":"wYOnnLMx","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"progressive-taxation-is-good","country_name":"Canada","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":121021641,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:05:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121021488\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121021488<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;discouraging people from working too hard<\/span><br>Which is why all the innovation and technology comes out of the US and Asia","time":1492146300,"resto":121021488,"id":"iDfVHxmj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121021686,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:05:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Virtually every developed or Western country has progressive taxation, trying to imply that that&#039;s literally the only reason for that stuff in Germany or the Netherlands as opposed to other countries is grossly naive and horribly oversimplifying things.","time":1492146325,"resto":121021488,"id":"OI4VbkQz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121021833,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)01:07:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121021641\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121021641<\/a><br>Except it doesn&#039;t. <br><br><a href=\"#p121021686\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121021686<\/a><br>It is not.

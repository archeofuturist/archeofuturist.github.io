I am on the verge of graduating from &#039;professional school&#039; and I am approximately $150,000 in student debt. I&#039;m not completely sure what I&#039;m going to do if I don&#039;t get a job offer. But I feel helpless, and I feel like I cannot compete in the job market, though I have 7 years of post-secondary education. I feel great despair. <br><br>What rejection from employment makes me feel like, though, is that I have been robbed and taken down the wrong road. I made a massive investment, and there fruit at the end of the tree is rotten - I am just not that attractive as a candidate.

We live in a liberal world, and the liberal world promised us everything. But now the liberal world is falling apart, and people cannot make a decent living - even with top-tier, 1% education. Radicalization is justified. <br><br>I&#039;m not feeling good. Are you unemployed?

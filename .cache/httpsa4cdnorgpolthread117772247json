I am on the verge of graduating from &#039;professional school&#039; and I am approximately $150,000 in student debt. I&#039;m not completely sure what I&#039;m going to do if I don&#039;t get a job offer. But I feel helpless, and I feel like I cannot compete in the job market, though I have 7 years of post-secondary education. I feel great despair. <br><br>What rejection from employment makes me feel like, though, is that I have been robbed and taken down the wrong road. I made a massive investment, and there fruit at the end of the tree is rotten - I am just not that attractive as a candidate. Unemployment gives rise to depression, to emptiness, to childlessness, to houseless-ness, to wifeless-ness. It also gives rise to more and more reading. Reading about what? Radicalism. We live in a liberal world, and the liberal world promised us everything. But now the liberal world is falling apart, and people cannot make a decent living - even with top-tier, 1% education. Radicalization is justified. <br><br>I&#039;m not feeling good. Are you unemployed? Has your being unemployed contributed to my radicalization?","filename":"long-term-joblessness","ext":".jpg","w":592,"h":333,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490196256205,"time":1490196256,"md5":"vA8yS1r5ECVkFrcQ2A2ZIg==","fsize":49832,"resto":0,"id":"7gAVTPt8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"unemployment-and-radicalization","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":117772568,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:26:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw not allowed to get a job because I&#039;m nonwhite and \/pol\/ says so<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 the &quot; pole is not one person&quot; meemay<\/span>","time":1490196363,"resto":117772247,"id":"mG1MUyb7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117774334,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:34:13","name":"Mr. Sage","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Be unemployed<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Read Turner Diaries <\/span><br><br>Can&#039;t take public transit anymore without thinking about the day of the rope.","filename":"1467870160501-1-pol","ext":".gif","w":269,"h":201,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490196853528,"time":1490196853,"md5":"oTa1LaoDoslHghpbMQtrkw==","fsize":1020887,"resto":117772247,"id":"HfBryNa2","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117774770,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:36:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117772247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117772247<\/a><br><br>According to the retards here, Trumps economic policies (aka Bushs economic policies 2.0) will make America great again, so don&#039;t worry, Anon.<br><br>Oh, and I study in &quot;Communist&quot; Germany, so I don&#039;t know what student debt is, lel.","time":1490196995,"resto":117772247,"id":"Ye1hgNVB","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117775766,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:42:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117772247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117772247<\/a><br>Yes.

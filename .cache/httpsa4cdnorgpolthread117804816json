Historically they had famine after famine for centuries whenever they had a bad crop and millions starved there long before the British arrived.<br><br>In the 20th century much of their food came from Burma. Due to conflict with Japan no shipments of food made if from Burma between 1942 and 1945.<br><br>Then in 1942 they were hit by a cyclone and 3 tidal waves that totally fucked them up. The reserve food stores were literally swept away by the massive storm surge (along with tens of thousands of people).<br><br>As a byproduct of the horrible storms and excess rain a massive fungal infection broke out in the region, destroying up to 90% of the crops that survived the cyclone.<br><br>Right up to this point it didn&#039;t matter if it was British or independent Indians in Charge. Millions were goign to starve. These conditions were similar to what caused the other famines in the regions history since prehistoric times.<br><br>Worst of all the local officials and their neighbors (Indians, not British) saw no value in sharing food when they could sell it as cash crops. Grain prices were at an all time high during the war and farmers did not want to just give it away.<br><br>Indians chose to let their own neighbors starve and instead reported large quantities of exportable grain to regional British officials. The British accepted this grain because 1\/3 of the human race was suffering food shortages at this time.<br><br>This all happened at the peak of the worst war in human history. By the end of the war 20 million people around the world starved to death (including the 4 million in India&#039;s famine).<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh 29 million<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh white guilt<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why didn&#039;t we ship them extra food?<\/span><br><br>The dutch starved.

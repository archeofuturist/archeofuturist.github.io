But is that really true, and if it is, then why? My ancestry is southern Italian and I grew up in an Italian neighborhood in NYC. all I saw was incredibly hard-working Italians, small business owners, busting their asses so their kids could get a good education. me and my firends all went to college, got degrees and have great jobs. we&#039;re all married with kids. I visit my family that is still in Salerno, and they are all well-educated, teachers, principals, farmers. virtually my entire experience (with few exceptions) with southern Italians is that they (we) are a top tier people. so what gives? where does this perception come from?","time":1492741737,"resto":122066176,"id":"cTh+sTgK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

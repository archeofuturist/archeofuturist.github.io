He is an elite level scholar whose book, Maps of Meaning, references some of the most recognized philosophers of the Western scholarly tradition, yet he now makes arguments that would fail in an undergraduate term paper. He is sparse of evidence and high on hyperbolic rhetoric, willing to entertain and reinforce the fears of diversity held by some Canadians, and apparently is getting very wealthy in the process. From academics I have spoken with, it is clear he has chosen to follow the examples of polemicists like Ann Coulter and Tomi Lehren instead of engaging in thoughtful and informed debate. Jordan Peterson has traded his credibility among scholars for a fleeting bout of fame and fortune. For his sake, I hope it was worth it. For the sake of those affected by his lack of compassion and intolerance for diversity, and for those who are paying for his so called &quot;profound psychological insights&quot; I hope it ends soon.<\/span>","time":1491868560,"resto":120499358,"id":"w5sB0UTC","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120514441,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)19:56:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120510125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120510125<\/a><br>I used a throwaway","time":1491868563,"resto":120499358,"id":"86EC3tbH","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120514485,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)19:56:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120513422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120513422<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;basically, you write down what you would like your future to be<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; now all you have to do is follow the plan<\/span><br><br>Wait seriously this is what it is?<br>AHAHAHA<br><br>What a fucking kike.

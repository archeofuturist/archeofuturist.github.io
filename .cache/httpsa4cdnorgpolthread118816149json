A human skeleton found in Switzerland is estimated to be between 38 and 45 million years old. France has yielded up eoliths, paleoliths, cut wood and a chalk ball, the minimum ages of which range from 45 to 50 million years.<br> There&#039;s still more.<br><br>(start of part 3) In 1960, H. L. Armstrong announced in Nature magazine the discovery of fossil human footprints near the Paluxy River, in Texas. Dinosaur footprints were found in the same strata. In 1983, the Moscow News reported the discovery of a fossilised human footprint next to the fossil footprint of a three-toed dinosaur in the Turkamen Republic.

G. Burroughs of Kentucky reported the discovery of three pairs of fossil tracks dated to 300 million years ago. They showed left and right footprints. Each print had five toes and a distinct arch. The toes were spread apart like those of a human used to walking barefoot. The foot curved back like a human foot to what appeared to be a human heel. There was a pair of prints in the series that showed a left and right foot. The distance between them is just what you&#039;d expect in modern human footprints.<br>In December 1862, The Geologist carried news of a human skeleton found 27.5 m (90 ft) below the surface in a coal seam in Illinois. The seam was dated between 286 and 320 million years. It&#039;s true that a few eoliths, skull fragments and fossil footprints, however old, provide no real backing for the idea of advanced prehistoric human civilisations.<br>But some other discoveries do.<br>In 1968, an American fossil collector named William J. Meister found a fossilised human shoe print near Antelope Spring, Utah. There were trilobite fossils in the same stone, which means it was at least 245 million years old. Close examination showed that the sole of this shoe differed little, if at all, from those of shoes manufactured today.<br>In 1897, a carved stone showing multiple faces of an old man was found at a depth of 40 m (130 ft) in a coal mine in Iowa. The coal there was of similar age.<br>(start of part 4) A piece of coal yielded up an encased iron cup in 1912. Frank J. Kenwood, who made the discovery, was so intrigued he traced the origin of the coal and discovered it came from the Wilburton Mine in Oklahoma. The coal there is about 312 million years old.","time":1490814301,"resto":118816149,"id":"\/Ve6irZQ","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118819913,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)15:05:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118819838\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118819838<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118818434\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118818434<\/a><br>In 1844, Scottish physicist Sir David Brewster reported the discovery of a metal nail embedded in a sandstone block from a quarry in the north of England.

This stone too was around 360 million years old.<br>Astonishing though these dates may appear to anyone familiar with the orthodox theory of human origins, they pale in comparison with the dates of two further discoveries.<br>According to Scientific American, dated 5 June 1852, blasting activities at Meeting House Hill, in Dorchester, Massachusetts, unearthed a metallic, bell-shaped vessel extensively decorated with silver inlays of flowers and vines. The workmanship was described as &#039;exquisite&#039;. The vessel was blown out of a bed of Roxbury conglomerate dated somewhat earlier than 600 million years.<br>In 1993, Michael A. Cremo and Richard L. Thompson reported the discovery &#039;over the past several decades&#039; of hundreds of metallic spheres in a pyrophyllite mine in South Africa. The spheres are grooved and give the appearance of having been manufactured. If so, the strata in which they were found suggest they were manufactured 2.8 BILLION years ago.","time":1490814331,"resto":118816149,"id":"\/Ve6irZQ","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118820206,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)15:07:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118819491\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118819491<\/a><br>the vatican has a pretty old library. they probably also know a lot about the true history. but yeah, the book burning all around the world, and especially the library of alexandria was a huge loss to humanity. its basically like the lost century in one piece where noone is allowed to know anything about, or research, or even talk about it, only in our world it goes a few thousand if not million or even billion years on","time":1490814470,"resto":118816149,"id":"\/Ve6irZQ","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118821049,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)15:15:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Another selfbump","time":1490814900,"resto":118816149,"id":"634GKLn3","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118822349,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)15:26:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"second selfbump, when still noone is interested anymore i will let it slide","time":1490815576,"resto":118816149,"id":"\/Ve6irZQ","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118822419,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)15:26:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118816149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118816149<\/a><br>pic is photoshopped","time":1490815616,"resto":118816149,"id":"Gz+Br9kR","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118822469,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)15:27:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118822349\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118822349<\/a><br>Watch 818encio&#039;s videos,he&#039;s pretty based","time":1490815639,"resto":118816149,"id":"\/u9lhuSQ","country":"MK","country_name":"Macedonia"},{"no":118822867,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)15:30:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118816149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118816149<\/a><br>Probably 80% of it is recollections from 2nd and third hand information.

So if an isotope has 1 billion years half-life, it means that a probability of a single atom breaking up will be very low, but since the sample contains a shitload of atoms it still means that you will see some reactions. <br><br>BTW you don&#039;t measure radioactivity for carbon dating. You just burn the sample and run the resulting gases (i.e. CO2) through mass spectrometer, while will separate 14CO2 and 12CO2 as the former molecule is heavier. Then you repeat this with a pre-Hiroshima piece of wood of known age to get the reference 14C\/12C ratio and work from there...","time":1490820550,"resto":118816149,"id":"BSU+h6Qi","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":118832452,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)16:49:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118830546\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118830546<\/a><br>Radioactive dating doesn&#039;t work exactly that way, though.

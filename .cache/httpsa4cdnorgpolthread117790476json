We&#039;re against forced inequality. If you can&#039;t do the job then fuck off. Doesn&#039;t matter if you&#039;re a man or a woman. Women have been forced into the labor pool for the express purpose of driving down wages. Everyone should have the option of withdrawing. Everyone should be subject to dismissal at a moment&#039;s notice. But in certain situations preferential treatment is given, sometimes negative and others positive. That should end.","time":1490203592,"resto":117790476,"id":"c662mVJM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

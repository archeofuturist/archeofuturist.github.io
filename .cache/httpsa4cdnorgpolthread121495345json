The flight of people from Syria and other conflict zones has been well-documented and the policy challenges for governments have generated blanket coverage. But there have also been spill-over effects on other marginalised groups, particularly the Roma.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In October 2016 the Council of Europe published a document that examined how Romani minorities in Europe were affected by the 2015-16 refugee crisis. One of the main effects cited in this document was the rise of right-wing populism and attitudes, which has resulted in an increased incidence of Romaphobia in politics and the media.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The link between the two groups is inescapable. Time and time again, Romani communities have been drawn into national asylum policy debates raising issues of inclusion, integration and belonging. Romaphobic ideas can be found in mainstream politics and media. It is not the sole preserve of the far right. In fact, the failure of different states to adequately integrate Roma has been used as a justification to exclude other asylum seekers.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/archive.is\/SURlU","filename":"IMG_1797","ext":".png","w":220,"h":147,"tn_w":220,"tn_h":147,"tim":1492413159121,"time":1492413159,"md5":"Feg7IsrKGMWTPd9B3koQRw==","fsize":552,"resto":0,"id":"qcmRtxtR","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-the-refugee-crisis-is-dealing-another-blow-to","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

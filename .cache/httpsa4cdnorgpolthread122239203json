This is very unlikely. First of all, Congress has repeatedly enacted Homeland Security appropriations bills that instructed the president to \u201cprioritize the identification and removal of aliens convicted of a crime by the severity of that crime.\u201d Second, while it is possible that Trump could ignore this, he has stated that he will indeed continue to prioritize criminals (one Trump advisor has suggested that immigrants arrested for, but not yet convicted of, serious offenses would also be prioritized). Third, Trump\u2019s vague promise to \u201cwork something out\u201d implies at least some unwillingness to go out of his way to deport Dreamers. Fourth, Trump\u2019s unrealistic vow to deport 2 million criminals makes it unlikely he will waste precious resources on low priority, non-criminal cases. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Even if it wanted to, the Trump administration would likely be dissuaded from ending DACA immediately by the practicalities of cancelling all 800,000 EADs alone. But it makes especially little sense to do this when a majority of the EADs will expire within a year of Trump assuming office in any case. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;At the other extreme, the Trump administration could continue the current priorities for removal and allow current recipients of DACA to use their EADs until they expire, while not accepting new applications or renewals. This would be the least controversial and most practical decision that would also be consistent with Trump\u2019s campaign promises. <\/span><br><br>Trump is letting DACA sunset on its own, since explicitly revoking it would be far more trouble than its worth and would require resources that he does not currently have. Don&#039;t forget that DACA is NOT a protected status, as confirmed by ICE and the Dreamer who got deported recently.","filename":"1492800306007","ext":".png","w":1178,"h":1362,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492838475099,"time":1492838475,"md5":"GunU1N+oHDOCs756ZBflkg==","fsize":354016,"resto":122239203,"id":"pVUs4jeI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122240435,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)01:21:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122240333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122240333<\/a><br>Fuck off retard, DACA was never a real problem.

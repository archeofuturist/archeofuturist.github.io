You can see this in the way a lot of right-wingers fetishize nationalism for its own sake. Nationalists of the past actually liked their country and wanted to see the rest of the world made more like their own. Britons of the 19th century for example contrasted the free trade policies, Christianity and scientific prowess of their own nation with the stifling bureaucracy, pagan idolatry and backwardness of China, and came to the conclusion that not only did Britain need to be preserved but that it would be good for as much of the world to be made British as possible. On the other hand, modern British nationalists hate what their country is right now and would gratuitously praise the Chinese indeed any other nation simply for being nationalistic.

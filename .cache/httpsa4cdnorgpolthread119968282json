They destroyed the last remnant of Islamic centralization, and the great Islamic empire was founded by turks, basically steppe people themselves. Central asian was supposed to have at least a couple of good cities back before the mongols, but now the whole region is total shit. Russia got so fucked that they&#039;ve never recovered. China got so fucked that they lost to a bunch of communist farmers with AK&#039;s &gt;inb4 America did too<br><br>I&#039;m not saying they&#039;re the only cause, but I definitely think they were a major catalyst for several regions who were on rocky ground or where newly developing (besides china, who were strong but never really recovered). Is this an obvious observation or am I jumping to the wrong conclusion? <br><br>It seems the only region to benefit was western europe, who surpassed everyone well into the 21st century, and the only thing I can think is that they benefited from the silk road while avoiding the mass destruction and mismanagement. Again, an obvious this that I missed due to lack of study or a misguided conclusion?","filename":"Mongol_Empire_map","ext":".gif","w":752,"h":591,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":196,"tim":1491579629455,"time":1491579629,"md5":"2HiM0rncKQ+ew6imLm9+TQ==","fsize":165815,"resto":0,"id":"Wb\/b6H34","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ive-always-had-this-fascination-with-the-mongol","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

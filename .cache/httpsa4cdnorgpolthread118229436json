But ill spell it out for you, forgot you were an American. The productivity of your workers has grown by more than 70 percent since 1970 but your wages have stagnated. People are working longer hours for less pay and little to no benefits in disgusting work environments. Work in the mines for 15 years and need health-care since that fucked you up? Lol nope! The rich on the other hand have been siphoning all that generated profit without paying back into the same system they utilized to make that money in the first place. Your current administration is planning to take this model and give it a fucking 1up, and when the thing explodes like it did in 2008 the middle\/lower classes will have to bail the higher classes out, again. This shit isn&#039;t complicated.

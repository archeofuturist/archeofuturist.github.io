It&#039;s a corrupt depressing dumphole. The recent tendencies, the supposed &quot;return to Orthodox roots and traditional values&quot; is fucking regressive, medieval and takes really ugly forms here since it greenlights religious fanatics and your average opportunists to abuse it to further their personal goals. It allows the government to turn citizens into willing serfs. Meanwhile, nothing has changed in terms of family values. There are still lots of abortions. Families are still falling apart leaving lone mothers and inept effeminate infantiles. The government is still doing almost nothing to fix the situation and at times I think, they&#039;re with the globalists on this one. It is no more different here than in the West.<br>That said, I am not denying that the West is on major decline and possibly on the path of self-destruction.<br>I had high hopes about Trump, but he has not delivered as far as I as a Russian citizen is concerned.<br>He has either succumbed to the political pressure from the establishment or he was an idiot from the very beginning. All the chances for constructive cooperation with Russia is lost on his accord. Basically, we, as a group of people who see through all the bullshit and realize the severity of the situation in the world as a whole are being actively divided by the satanic pedophile globalist elites.<br><br>TL;DR:<br>Russia is a corrupt shithole. Don&#039;t fall for it&#039;s &quot;traditional values&quot; psyop. Appreciate it&#039;s attempts to conduct sovereign international policies even if it is lead by greedy fucking plutocrats. Don&#039;t fall for MSM false flags and warmongering. Trump&#039;s actions are really underwhelming. The future looks grim.","filename":"c2a120105a9ae9a25f0641d92a8f577d","ext":".jpg","w":468,"h":560,"tn_w":208,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491480195408,"time":1491480195,"md5":"u6WyuD5sGe89ZH8FYyXVJw==","fsize":73549,"resto":0,"id":"Z1\/AB+w\/","country":"RU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol","country_name":"Russian Federation","replies":14,"images":3,"unique_ips":8},{"no":119735991,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:08:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119735617\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119735617<\/a><br>pol is full of putinbots so your words are wasted here","time":1491480485,"resto":119735617,"id":"1iAj08Ei","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119736124,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:09:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119735991\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119735991<\/a><br>I don&#039;t believe in the existence of actual &quot;putin bots&quot;, so my message is directed at people genuinely sympathetic towards Russia.","time":1491480577,"resto":119735617,"id":"Z1\/AB+w\/","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":119736377,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:12:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119735617\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119735617<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Russia is a shit hole<\/span><br>Yes we know this.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Russia is corrupt<\/span><br>We also know this.<br>Some \/pol\/acks support Putin because they support Assad.<br>Thats literally the only reason people here support Russia right now.<br>Its that simple.","time":1491480753,"resto":119735617,"id":"uib6pq\/g","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119736527,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:14:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119735617\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119735617<\/a><br>\/pol\/ fell for this shit all the time.

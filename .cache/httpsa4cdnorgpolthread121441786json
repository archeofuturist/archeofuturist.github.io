biggest issue i have with the trs guys is they want change to happen too quickly and it will backfire. the game the jews have been playing has been in effect for decades in the usa and more than a

because they see the bigger picture and don&#039;t mind waiting. trs does not. we&#039;re simply here to start the movement and plant the seeds. look at how much progress has been made already. all it

The honest truth is they don&#039;t want to be integrate with larger American society, and that is what denies them the jobs they are constantly bitching they should be given. Most Cubans integrated into society and they are never bitching that they have been discriminated against because they know they aren&#039;t. Hell most of the Cuban expats I know are more patriotic then most &quot;native&quot; Americans I&#039;ve met because they understand how great this country is. It pisses me off that people come here and don&#039;t want to become part of larger American society and sit in their ethnic communities and wave flags and say how &quot;great&quot; their former countries were when they were fleeing those shitholes for a reason. <br>In short, god bless America. It truly is the best country on earth, it welcomed my family with open arms and I would die fighting for this beautiful land before I lay down and let it be overrun by all these unamerican fucks who want to ruin one of the best country&#039;s on earth.","filename":"28142-cc_GodBlessAmerica_1100","ext":".jpg","w":1100,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":145,"tim":1490154109110,"time":1490154109,"md5":"4pggGZXR5pIKZ+NmNZfVfQ==","fsize":290030,"resto":0,"id":"Ov7OZ\/5c","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"be-my-father","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":117716760,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)23:58:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117715028\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117715028<\/a><br>cuban here too bro, grandpa came with my dad and the rest of his family here during the 60&#039;s. never once in my life have i been discriminated","time":1490155124,"resto":117715028,"id":"y1uE0WZU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117717899,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)00:10:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117716760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117716760<\/a><br>Hell yeah, that&#039;s what I love about the US.

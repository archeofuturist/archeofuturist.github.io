It was weird and odd, along with the fact that he was a giant compared to most Japs at the time. He only fought in a couple of battles and lost miserably in the end to defend Nobunaga.<br>There just really isn&#039;t anything interesting about Yasuke for them to make a movie about. Unlike with William Adams, the first white samurai, the only interesting thing about Yasuke is that he is a black samurai, that&#039;s it.<br><br>It&#039;s quite clear that this is blatant propaganda. They probably dug through wikipedia specifically to find a story like this. Japan hasn&#039;t seemed to make any movies about this guy, meanwhile they have a statute dedicated to William Adams.<br><br>Even the current name of the movie is &quot;Yasuke The Black Samurai&quot; instead of just Yasuke or something.<br><br>Fuck Hollywood","filename":"yasuke","ext":".jpg","w":936,"h":884,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1492517935865,"time":1492517935,"md5":"swi5M0xxcrCk\/yjsAvYfWg==","fsize":70561,"resto":121676427,"id":"x5D6UYZ6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121678202,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:21:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121678014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121678014<\/a><br>wasn&#039;t Nobunaga famous for being a very cruel warlord?","time":1492518071,"resto":121676427,"id":"YQJxDK86","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":121678351,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:22:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121678014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121678014<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Japan hasn&#039;t seemed to make any movies about this guy.<\/span><br><br>Japan doesn&#039;t really care about black people, in the same way they don&#039;t care about white people.

During that time, at NASA, computers were still very new, so people did not fully trust the math and data these things spat out. So they often hired people to double check what the computers put out and ensured that it was correct. Boilerplate as fuck; however, Hollywood is nothing if not magical in their ability to overdramatize shit like that. So don&#039;t put it past them.","time":1492518166,"resto":121676427,"id":"+QaPxgZX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121679015,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:29:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121678351\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121678351<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no knowing that black people were the first samurai.<\/span><br><br>What, are you a nazi anon?","time":1492518583,"resto":121676427,"id":"X3lqXLWs","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121679303,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:33:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121678202\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121678202<\/a><br>Yeah Nobunaga is generally presented as a villain in video games, movies, anime, etc. in Japan.

(Aug. 31 issue).1 However, we disagree with the conclusion that cognition, mood, and overall psychiatric functioning were unchanged by neurostimulation. One patient in the treatment group but none in the control group committed suicide; seven patients in the treatment group but none in the control group had depressive symptoms or cognitive disturbances. The exact nature or putative causes of these adverse events are not mentioned. Second, the use of two psychiatric rating scales without formal clinical assessment by a psychiatrist and only at two points, before and after 6 months of treatment, is insufficient to detect and monitor psychiatric side effects. Given the fact that deep-brain stimulation in different target areas is clearly associated with both psychiatric and other side effects,2,3 careful and comprehensive monitoring of all such effects is imperative in future studies.<br>Klaus Lieb, M.D.<br>University Medical Center, 79104 Freiburg, Germany<br>Thomas E.

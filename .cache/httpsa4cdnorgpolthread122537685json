(Aug. 31 issue).1 However, we disagree with the conclusion that cognition, mood, and overall psychiatric functioning were unchanged by neurostimulation. One patient in the treatment group but none in the control group committed suicide; seven patients in the treatment group but none in the control group had depressive symptoms or cognitive disturbances. The exact nature or putative causes of these adverse events are not mentioned. Second, the use of two psychiatric rating scales without formal clinical assessment by a psychiatrist and only at two points, before and after 6 months of treatment, is insufficient to detect and monitor psychiatric side effects. Given the fact that deep-brain stimulation in different target areas is clearly associated with both psychiatric and other side effects,2,3 careful and comprehensive monitoring of all such effects is imperative in future studies.<br>Klaus Lieb, M.D.<br>University Medical Center, 79104 Freiburg, Germany<br>Thomas E.

Hayes<br>Check for full text accessPurchase$31.50Get Full Text Elsewhere<br>Abstract<br>Mainstream media about deep brain stimulation (DBS), a therapy applied to Parkinson\u2019s disease among others, reflect cultural representations of the brain, of disease, and of healing. Science communication, especially in health issues, presents major challenges. Through a qualitative analysis of German-speaking print media, we trace the public image of DBS. The aim of this chapter is to highlight narrative strategies, to stress downsides of seemingly intuitive explanations, and to outline alternatives. In particular, notions of time and immediacy, mechanistic views, and symbolic moments in the narration support a simplistic wish for a therapy that will bring an instantaneous change from unrestrained disease to complete cure \u201cat the push of a button.\u201d This chapter demonstrates how shortcuts in the representation of DBS create misleading gaps that lay people cannot fill without resorting to cultural imagery. These overlapping representations are sustained by the general fascination regarding neuro-sciences.<br>Keywords<br>* Deep brain stimulation (DBS)mediarepresentationParkinson\u2019s<wbr>medicinenarrative","time":1493031314,"resto":122537685,"id":"tslDFI9X","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122573298,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)06:55:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"What&#039;s with people referencing BuzzFeed in this thread?","time":1493031329,"resto":122537685,"id":"p0uDzjeM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122573517,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)06:58:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122537685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122537685<\/a><br>Destroy him.

If you are capable of empathy and understanding why people act the way they do you&#039;ll end up as a normie from the test despite how you act in person.","filename":"reee","ext":".png","w":640,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1490161474234,"time":1490161474,"md5":"X+qzOQ4K45BIyDDdtns7Lg==","fsize":87401,"resto":117716896,"id":"RGWqhVBo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117726928,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:47:00","name":"Anonymous","filename":"poly10a","ext":".png","w":640,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1490161620906,"time":1490161620,"md5":"0rBFT36ohz+PN01Kq4k5Xg==","fsize":88613,"resto":117716896,"id":"18h4QJO1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117727102,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:49:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;__&lt;<\/span>","filename":"derpa","ext":".png","w":653,"h":615,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1490161742028,"time":1490161742,"md5":"B59hExcZ97YpJNu2jjuP6A==","fsize":201661,"resto":117716896,"id":"LAlFJ0pq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117727507,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:53:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117725419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117725419<\/a><br>Brother<br>mine is a little odd.","filename":"odd","ext":".png","w":640,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1490162030032,"time":1490162030,"md5":"Iogm+1XE1BYJ3L8oFSuMyg==","fsize":87573,"resto":117716896,"id":"zO+Fw4Z7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117727922,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:58:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nobody got higher than my autism score of 174?<br><br>Fuck if \/pol\/ can&#039;t do it then I&#039;m really scared.

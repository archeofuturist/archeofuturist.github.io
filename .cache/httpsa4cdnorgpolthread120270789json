Then China responds with sending the few nukes they have after NATO allies\/U.S. cities. What are the chances that Russia, would also respond with nuclear force, against NATO\/U.S.? Russia isn&#039;t necessarily &quot;friends&quot; with NK but if they didn&#039;t respond in this situation they would lose their only powerful allies, and be left with just Syria and Iran. <br><br>It would seem that it&#039;d make more strategic sense for Putin to respond with his nukes, but then theirs the questions of: How many Russian nukes are fit for service? Is killing that many billions worth it? etc. I mean Russians, despite how I despise them, don&#039;t seem to want Nuclear Armageddon, or else the world would&#039;ve ended during the Cold War.","filename":"1454742584844","ext":".jpg","w":580,"h":434,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491735794846,"time":1491735794,"md5":"PfiBXkkLLnTCw4EQlTPCdA==","fsize":107129,"resto":0,"id":"25Um7a2P","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-if-kim-jong-un-tries-to-launch-a-nuke-at-say","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":120270904,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)07:04:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120270789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120270789<\/a><br>okay, so in this scenario, china and the US are both nuked<br><br>what allies does russia need and against whom does it need them?","time":1491735891,"resto":120270789,"id":"0In1LrRt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120271058,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)07:06:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;NK launched a nuke<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;US retaliates<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;somehow China is going to ruin its, already small, international reputation by trying to nuke the fucking U.S<\/span><br><br>okay.","time":1491736009,"resto":120270789,"id":"\/4arGPzk","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120271201,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)07:08:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120270789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120270789<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Then China responds with sending the few nukes<\/span><br><br>Why would they?<br>China doesn&#039;t even like North Korea, not really.","time":1491736112,"resto":120270789,"id":"cD8HVhiE","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120271287,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)07:09:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120270904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120270904<\/a><br>Well, China only has around 20 or so nukes, so that&#039;s not enough to destroy the U.S. in the first place, and they would also likely be able to destroy some, before they landed.

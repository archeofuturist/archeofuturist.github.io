However, he let his ego get in the way and became a demagogue. Things just went too far. He let them go too far. It&#039;s a shame because there was real danger to the country in that era.

But it makes me wonder what&#039;s really going on today. This topic was a major red pill for me. Especially people&#039;s ignorance on the topic. It makes it hard to talk to anyone about politics. It&#039;s also why I find it so weird that the democrats keep pushing this Russian narrative. Really makes me wonder what their endgame is.","time":1493947521,"resto":124143101,"id":"yjBjCaHe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124144243,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:27:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124143992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124143992<\/a><br>I don&#039;t think they are politically cohesive enough to actually have an endgame.","time":1493947652,"resto":124143101,"id":"5JU3EvAE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

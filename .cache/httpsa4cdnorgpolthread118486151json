Trey Parker is presumably Christian (though I could be wrong) and Matt Stone is Jewish. The character Kyle and his immediate family with the exception of Ike are Jewish. The rest of the characters are not. <br><br>It is also interesting to note that Matt Stone hasn&#039;t been involved with the show in a very long time. Just about every episode going back to season 6 or 7 has been written and directed by Trey Parker with the exception of a few random collaborations. South Park really does come from the mind of one man and all the political views are Trey&#039;s. <br><br>South Park is Trey Parker&#039;s show at this point. Matt Stone has little involvement in the creative process beyond supplying some voices. <br><br>Trey comes off as neutral to me. He omitted Donald Trump from season 20 and replaced him with Mr. Garrison, and renamed Hillary &quot;Turd Sandwich&quot;.","time":1490602146,"resto":118486151,"id":"vL9b39pH","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118490935,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)04:38:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Falling in love is always a problem, anon.","time":1490603911,"resto":118486151,"id":"ruNwwmTf","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":118491194,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)04:42:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118486300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118486300<\/a><br>checked the list and the digits","time":1490604149,"resto":118486151,"id":"pweiDRzN","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"}]}

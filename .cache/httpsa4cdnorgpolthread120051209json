What you&#039;re referring to as the US, is in fact, the jews, or as I&#039;ve taken to calling it, jews plus the US. <br><br>The US for instance has a central bank that is privately owned by the jews. The central bank prints money and the US borrows it at interest. The US has to ask the jews for money if it wants to do anything. This is one of the main ways the jews control the US<br><br>Russia&#039;s economy is largely based on oil \/ natural gas so the jews had the US crash the oil market. Russia is currently hurting but still surviving. The jews want to run a pipeline through Syria to bypass Russia and wreck their economy... to force them under their control like the US is under their control. Iran, China etc etc all of these people are future targets of the jews and why the US calls them &quot;evil&quot; just like how Germany was supposedly &quot;evil&quot; because Hitler wanted to create a new German economy. <br><br>[So it should be no surprise at all that the US and Israel back ISIS in Syria, they have no considerations for what is right or wrong, morality. The jew and it\u2019s owned states are consumed with a blind, satanic thirst for money and control.] <br><br>That&#039;s very basically where we are, the jew controlled world vs the independent world","filename":"pipeline","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":487,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":84,"tim":1491610245557,"time":1491610245,"md5":"qawdU7+HuUkaL3vuDTd66Q==","fsize":82522,"resto":120051209,"id":"Jbg8bCl4","country":"IM","country_name":"Isle of Man"},{"no":120051714,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)20:10:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120051209\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120051209<\/a><br>I&#039;ve seen so many of my lefty co-workers do a 180 on Trump in 24 hours","filename":"bisgrav","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":682,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491610246078,"time":1491610246,"md5":"rIvBNrUpHedZBny2Aori\/w==","fsize":185321,"resto":120051209,"id":"StYZSdbd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120051817,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)20:11:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120051340\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120051340<\/a><br>You&#039;re exactly the type of simp I&#039;m fingering here.

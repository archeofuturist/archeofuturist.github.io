WE WUZ KANGZ<br><br>Basically, we know enough &quot;Hispanics&quot; to understand that they run the gamut from basically being blonde-haired, blue-eyed, freckled descendants of Goths and Celts, to Mediterranean swarthies, to Levantine desert-air-ready-nose bearers, to pure heart-cutting-out Aztecs, to fresh-off-the-boat-from-Senegal plantation slaves, and even sambas like George Zimmerman&#039;s Peruvian mother.<br><br>Examples:<br><br>5. Cameron Diaz (Pure Aryan Annoying Bitch)<br>4. Fidel Castro (Merchant\/Aloha Snackbar) or Desi Arnaz (prototypical Latin Lover)<br>3. Albita Rodriguez (all the paints, one bucket)<br>2. Sammy Davis Jr. (quadroonish but also Jewish)<br>1. Celia Cruz (white like Ted Cruz, like the Jackson Five are white like Andrew Jackson)<br><br>There&#039;s been a ton of mixing - you can see guys who look almost Somali with a merchant nariz like Fats Navarro, or guys who look basically like pure Aryan Romans with a dash of Latin lover like Andy Garcia. Even Pitbull looks basically like an English football hooligan but look at his face and you might also think maybe a 32nd negro?<br><br>There IS something connecting all of this spectrum, and being part of the Hispanosphere helps it. It is kinda stupid - imagine if we just called everyone who was from an Anglophone country &quot;Anglic.&quot; West African Usain Bolt, Indian Ben Kingsley, Sacajawea, Abo Evonne Goolagang, Maori Temeura Morrison, Leftist qafir Saint Nelson Mandela (PBUH), Andrew Anglin the pure Aryan defender of the white race whose name means Anglic, as well as Queen Lizzie of Anglic-land herself.<br><br>The Spaniards are a real sub-race of whites. <br><br>But the spectrum exists. &quot;La Raza&quot; does describe a real thing. Mexico is a good example - approx. 40% Indio, 40% Mestizo, 20% Castizo\/Criollos.","filename":"hooligan","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":259,"tn_w":212,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490644378854,"time":1490644378,"md5":"b8RqUD7A+8OyhhYFVQhlCQ==","fsize":11764,"resto":0,"id":"+jcHc9Fm","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hispanics-are-and-arent-una-raza","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

They care about people and society more than normal, which is one of the reasons for the success of the country, but also why they&#039;re easily to become too progressive and lose sight of rationality.<br><br>The one thing I&#039;ve heard about swedes that have been to america is that they hate how sweet your food is.","time":1493843128,"resto":123942410,"id":"cQ3XFSrE","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123958070,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:25:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123957497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123957497<\/a><br>I have the same thought literally every day, but not just in Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Peru, Chile, Namibia and South Africa.

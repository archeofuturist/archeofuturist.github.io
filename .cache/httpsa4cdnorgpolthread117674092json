As such the people of modern-day Lower Saxony still praise &quot;Herzog Widukind&#039;s tribe&quot; in their state anthem - Widukind being none other than Vortigern, who led the Saxons from North Germany onto Britain, fought the withdrawing Romans for the native chieftains, then backstabbed his employers in the original &quot;night of the long knives&quot; at Stonehenge and became a king in Anglia (one of many &quot;states&quot; in what would later be England; maybe I&#039;m even mixing them up right now). Previously his people had moved up there to join their Anglic brothers in Denmark, according to myth in order to fight the armies of Burgund, who were led by Siegfried the Dragonslayer. And before that they had moved into Southern and Eastern Germany over the Caucasus, leaving behind them the Balkan and Black Sea Germans. And before that fled from modern-day Azerbaidschan, the Samartians and Huns hot on their trail during the Great Migration. And before that were slaves and schabbosgoyim in Ancient Israel, before the Christ set them free from its merchant priests. And before that had been raiders in the Persian Empire, the immortals alongside the throne of Dareios as later Varingians served in Byzantium, whom the prophet Jeremiah declared holy when they marched on Babylon.<br><br>Basically the Anglo-Saxons are that part in Whitey&#039;s family history -before- England decides to be all &quot;Fuck you, Dad, I&#039;m pretty sure I&#039;m supposed to be more like a Celtic Jew.&quot; At least according to Medieval Germany.","time":1490134222,"resto":117674092,"id":"ZkTf\/ST6","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

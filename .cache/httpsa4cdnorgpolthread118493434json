Orthodox, Protestants, and Catholics all enjoyed it, they tried it with the muzzies, and bang! dead soldier, and the war was back on.<br><br>Had the nations not got buthurt(allies, as always) and ordered the soldier with the tree shot, WWI would have ended early, less dead Europeans, and chances are, no WWII, no Nazis, and thus no chucked Europe, oh, and the Empires might still be standing today.<br><br>Ill say this, as a Christian, it did not have to be Christianity that did this, it could have been Buddhism, had the Greeks spread it with more passion, yet they did not, and the Romans did not unify their religion well enough for a Pagan Europe to survive the coming storm that was the crescent.<br><br>So yes, if for no other reason, it gave common grounds, grounds that stood for something, till roughly the 60&#039;s.","time":1490607482,"resto":118493434,"id":"ZAGqpQIp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118495409,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)05:46:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118494817\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118494817<\/a><br>Well the response is good but my question is somewhat different <br><br>I agree it was good as a common ground for all Europe but was the Christian morals great or just good ?

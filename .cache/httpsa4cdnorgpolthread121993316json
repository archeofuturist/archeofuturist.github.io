I&#039;m not describing individuals, I&#039;m describing a caricature which is a reflection of a reality that everyone has at least a little bit of, and which gets amplified by the crowd over time.<br><br>Female psychology, at least the bits that are different from male psychology, is very much concerned with status. More status = better than. They want high status for themselves, so that they can have access to even higher status men. They want the highest status man they can possibly get-- if they can do that, they can live on easy street, with access to all the perks her man can provide.<br><br>This is why women are so concerned with their personal beauty. Even from a very young age, girls aspire to be *pretty*. I mean, if they wanted to, they could let themselves go to pot, and then just put up with marrying or dating down the status hierarchy-- but on the veldt, that&#039;d mean mating with a diseased, old, or lazy man, and ending up with worthless children that may not live to adulthood. That&#039;s a BAD thing. We all hate the gold-digger, but she has damn good reasons to exist-- she probably is the thing that, through natural selection, made our race as good as we are.<br><br>And I&#039;m also not saying all women are exactly like that-- only that they all have traces of this tendency in their psychology. The same way all men have traces of the fuck &#039;er and leave &#039;er, pussy is all that matters gotta-have-it horndog jock who beats up fags all day every day (and fag=anyone he can beat up).

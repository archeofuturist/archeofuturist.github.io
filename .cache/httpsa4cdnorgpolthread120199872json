They are one party of one country. They are nothing. It is only their group in the EU parliament which has power - the European Conservatives and Reformists Group, in their case - that they have any power. So the people of Britain should be told &quot;we are the European Conservatives and Reformists, and THIS is what we plan to do in the European Parliament&quot;, and the same for the EU parliamentary groups.<br><br>TV debates too - they do take place in the run up to an EU election, but again, THEY ARE NOT SHOWN ANYWHERE. I don&#039;t think they were aired in Britain at all. It&#039;s absurd.<br><br>If you think the EU is democratic then give me the full name of these EU parliamentary groups - or at least the largest two, since most people normally know the largest two parties at a national level.<br><br>And even if you can name them, do you think most Brits can? No they can&#039;t, and that&#039;s not their fault, when the EU deliberately does not campaign anywhere near as much as it should; nowhere near as much as Westminster does.","filename":"groups in eu parliament","ext":".png","w":1500,"h":1200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1491699466911,"time":1491699466,"md5":"CHUPYaq7C2HVERwrqG2n9g==","fsize":730786,"resto":120199872,"id":"keRDAV0m","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120212344,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)21:01:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120199872\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120199872<\/a><br><br><a href=\"#p120211628\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120211628<\/a><br>Still have to deal with the Mexicans and Blacks that are in our country.","filename":"rocky-mountain-national-park","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491699706825,"time":1491699706,"md5":"YkYdTFiMzRYExqbFLyPQ2Q==","fsize":769707,"resto":120199872,"id":"DPbo\/XUM","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120212506,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)21:03:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"good thread lads. hope we can have another like it soon.","time":1491699784,"resto":120199872,"id":"ZZO3DeKp","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120212513,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)21:03:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120210564\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120210564<\/a><br>Yeah it does, but then it has big glass eyesores too.<br><br>The Walkie Talkie is the worst offender.

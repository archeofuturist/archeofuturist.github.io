Every little boy growing up these days has the option to transition to a girl. It&#039;s his\/her choice, it&#039;s legal, and the government or some Soros org will pay for it. And being a girl in today&#039;s society offers a lot more privileges and benefits than being a man. Yet for some reason, lots of boys still choose to remain boys when it is far more rational to transition to a girl.<br><br>The only explanation for this is that such boys are misogynists. Every boy that chooses to remain a boy is necessarily a misogynist, because there&#039;s no rational reason to no transition. I mean, he can even keep his penis if he wants and still become a girl, there&#039;s no downside!<br><br>The question now is what do we do about this? What do we do with the boys who choose wrongly to remain boys? Do we force them to become girls? Or send them to prison or desert island to be carefully monitored so their misogyny doesn&#039;t hurt anyone? Can we penalize them with an extra male tax for not transitioning, due to all the negative externalities that being a man inflicts on society? Maybe we could produce educational children&#039;s shows that present males who don&#039;t transition as outsiders and crazy and antagonistic, so kids learn that staying male is the wrong choice and it will make them lose their friends forever.<br><br>People who are born female can still transition to male if they want because being able to do this is very important for female liberation and it is empowering. Women who don&#039;t transition to men are not misandrist, however, since there&#039;s no rational reason to be a man, if you are a woman who doesn&#039;t transition you are just rational.","filename":"1","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":648,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":231,"tim":1493652246625,"time":1493652246,"md5":"jHuF6rcoafU5lzqPphGdbQ==","fsize":112761,"resto":0,"id":"FYBmof5i","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-little-boys-who-dont-choose-to-transition-to","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":3,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123632654,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:26:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123632452\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123632452<\/a>","filename":"1492652758428","ext":".jpg","w":625,"h":800,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493652360948,"time":1493652360,"md5":"A6UNl+7PRlQgXy8yAHTe\/w==","fsize":71911,"resto":123632452,"id":"vrDZSFAM","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":123632895,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:28:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"OP...","filename":"Screenshot_2017-02-16-23-41-58-1","ext":".png","w":990,"h":1481,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493652502740,"time":1493652502,"md5":"8KZbcnfNYovejDi9g5Qj0g==","fsize":946973,"resto":123632452,"id":"aGwuWWcy","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123633970,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)11:38:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123632452\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123632452<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Are little boys who don&#039;t choose to transition to girls misogynist?<\/span><br><br>Yes.","filename":"half","ext":".png","w":708,"h":495,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1493653120059,"time":1493653120,"md5":"7fRHVp+uKATAzI11nA0yDg==","fsize":401603,"resto":123632452,"id":"M4jd9uuS","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

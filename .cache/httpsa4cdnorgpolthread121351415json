It bans officers from approaching people who are illegally loitering or trespassing unless someone has called the police to lodge a complaint. It prohibits police from using \u201can individual\u2019s geographic location, such as presence in a high-crime area or proximity to the scene of suspected or reported crimes\u201d as a basis for stopping and questioning a person. Nor can a police stop be based on someone\u2019s \u201cresponse to the presence of police officers, such as an individual\u2019s attempt to avoid contact with an officer\u201d or \u201can individual\u2019s presence in the company of others suspected of criminal activity.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cops must seek permission from a supervisor before arresting a suspect for, among other things, disorderly conduct, resisting an officer, failure to obey an officer, and making a false statement to an officer. Whether the police department is complying with the consent decree will be determined in part by an annual public survey that will include the opinions of \u201cdetained arrestees.\u201d So criminals will have a say in whether Baltimore police are doing their jobs properly.<\/span>","filename":"1440598081114","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492344314615,"time":1492344314,"md5":"8l+neBfteLCuyVLi3Wrr4w==","fsize":114957,"resto":0,"id":"Cqg+8eyd","country":"BE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"baltimore-lets-criminals-have-a-say-about-cops","country_name":"Belgium","replies":9,"images":6,"unique_ips":4},{"no":121351584,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)08:07:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121351415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121351415<\/a><br>I want to have kids with that woman, fuck.

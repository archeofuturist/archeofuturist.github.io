The U.S. military is a technological juggernaut. Our advantage, as long as it lasts, is being able to hurt people and break things without any real chance of those we attack to strike back. Blowing up and air base with cruise missiles signals displeasure without putting a single American in harm&#039;s way. It makes us feared. It is nice to liked and respected.

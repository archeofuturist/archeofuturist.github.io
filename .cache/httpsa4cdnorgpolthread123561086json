Both antifa and the alt-right see the other as part of the mainstream, perhaps the most radical and outspoken part but ultimately a crucial manifestation of the degeneracy\/fascism that has taken root. Maybe I&#039;m being a fence sitting wuss, but it seems obvious to me that both are dead wrong. The mainstream is made up of the cuckservative right and the neoliberal left, conjoined at the hip by globalism, both of which are ecstatic to see their activist wings (that they reluctantly pander to in order to prevent populist challengers) bloody each other in the streets. Why? Because then the McCains and Pelosis get to act like they&#039;re the adults in the room while both sets of &#039;violent radicals&#039; get smeared in the public eye. I know the intent of the fighting is to kick some ass and not really to win hearts and minds, but you can sure as fuck lose them and become even more hated and marginalized than you are now.

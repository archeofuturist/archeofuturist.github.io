In fact, among Whites, Millennial women seem to have voted for Trump at a greater rate than Millennial men.<br><br>Why is it then, that Women are less likely to be open about expressing their opinion about Trump? I see plenty of SJWs going out of their way to express their opinion, so I don&#039;t think it&#039;s likely that Women just aren&#039;t inclined to be willing to outwardly display support for a cause.<br><br>Are leftist women more likely to harass right-leaning women than leftist men are to harass right-leaning men? Is that why Trump supporting women are less likely to be public about their support - or is it something else?","filename":"1488606996780","ext":".jpg","w":721,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490804031364,"time":1490804031,"md5":"PYJbZm0s0jkd3FjmIEV7LQ==","fsize":86328,"resto":0,"id":"SOIIKJP9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-female-trump-supporters-more-likely-to-get","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":2,"unique_ips":9},{"no":118801194,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)12:14:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118801144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118801144<\/a>","filename":"whitevote.gender.age_3-8-17","ext":".png","w":3000,"h":2250,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490804060911,"time":1490804060,"md5":"giTxZaGqWgh3eSky04OYvw==","fsize":105652,"resto":118801144,"id":"SOIIKJP9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118801261,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)12:15:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"I must protect her","time":1490804101,"resto":118801144,"id":"r4N8uKMp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118801419,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)12:16:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118801144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118801144<\/a><br>Maybe that will teach them to stop trusting a kike.","filename":"trumpancestry","ext":".png","w":1368,"h":1952,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490804185342,"time":1490804185,"md5":"h8UFk7pxHQMKE\/1h\/PJAJw==","fsize":711713,"resto":118801144,"id":"5HY3tw+b","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118801457,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)12:16:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118801194\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118801194<\/a><br>no fucking way","time":1490804204,"resto":118801144,"id":"0dKtFHaU","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118801612,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)12:18:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118801144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118801144<\/a><br><br>Probably, SJWS prey exclusively on isolated and weaker targets.","time":1490804288,"resto":118801144,"id":"x2kNlIW3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118801738,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)12:19:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118801144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118801144<\/a><br>Because women seldom stand up for their political ideology","time":1490804363,"resto":118801144,"id":"smUujniv","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118801785,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)12:19:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yes.

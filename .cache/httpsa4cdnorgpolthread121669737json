However, the relationships among gender, science, and glaciers \u2013 particularly related to epistemological questions about the production of glaciological knowledge \u2013 remain understudied. This paper thus proposes a feminist glaciology framework with four key components: 1) knowledge producers; (2) gendered science and knowledge; (3) systems of scientific domination; and (4) alternative representations of glaciers. Merging feminist postcolonial science studies and feminist political ecology, the feminist glaciology framework generates robust analysis of gender, power, and epistemologies in dynamic social-ecological systems, thereby leading to more just and equitable science and human-ice interactions.<\/span><br><br>Because real science is feminist.","filename":"feminist physics","ext":".png","w":538,"h":660,"tn_w":101,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492513292009,"time":1492513292,"md5":"EuGOA\/7t9981bgbJob6LtA==","fsize":156149,"resto":121669737,"id":"uCeMMhqh","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121670620,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)07:01:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121670432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121670432<\/a><br>you can do better leaf","time":1492513316,"resto":121669737,"id":"XIqzNhhM","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121670624,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)07:01:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121669737\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121669737<\/a><br>&quot;ignore the data, go with your feelings&quot;<br><br>amazing I wonder why the US is churning out a bunch of marxists","filename":"65qszc","ext":".png","w":500,"h":441,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1492513317755,"time":1492513317,"md5":"CHmAdiAZ0kUU1Jj3k7cfCQ==","fsize":283770,"resto":121669737,"id":"KqkNRM8\/","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121670685,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)07:02:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121670432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121670432<\/a><br>Do you have any business or economic sources to back this up?","time":1492513360,"resto":121669737,"id":"rEgZdXkL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121670695,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)07:02:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121669866\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121669866<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Facts<\/span><br>No, the research has a pro-patriarchy bias.","time":1492513364,"resto":121669737,"id":"iDIa6x8c","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":121670767,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)07:03:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121670576\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121670576<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;French feminist<\/span><br>Socialism was a mistake.","time":1492513402,"resto":121669737,"id":"6Et784Zu","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121670819,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)07:03:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; &quot;Reality is Patriarchy&quot;<\/span><br><br>Pure gold.","time":1492513438,"resto":121669737,"id":"cAgAQKKi","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":121670866,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)07:04:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"this is how they brainwash young women","time":1492513467,"resto":121669737,"id":"jbEqXfXH","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121670896,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)07:04:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121669737\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121669737<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dont trust officials they are sexists look at femisnist sources instead<\/span>","time":1492513483,"resto":121669737,"id":"TxiqDt7g","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121670939,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)07:05:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121670695\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121670695<\/a><br>This.

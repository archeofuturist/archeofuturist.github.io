Even Gollum was not wholly ruined. He<br>had proved tougher than even one of the Wise would have guessed -as a hobbit<br>might. There was a little corner of his mind that was still his own, and light<br>came through it, as through a chink in the dark: light out of the past. It was<br>actually pleasant, I think, to hear a kindly voice again, bringing up memories<br>of wind, and trees, and sun on the grass, and such forgotten things.<br><br> &#039;But that, of course, would only make the evil part of him angrier in the<br>end \u2013 unless it could be conquered. Unless it could be cured.&#039; Gandalf sighed.<br>&#039;Alas! there is little hope of that for him. Yet not no hope. No, not though<br>he possessed the Ring so long, almost as far back as he can remember. For it<br>was long since he had worn it much: in the black darkness it was seldom<br>needed. Certainly he had never &quot;faded&quot;. He is thin and tough still. But the<br>thing was eating up his mind, of course, and the torment had become almost<br>unbearable.<br><br> &#039;All the &quot;great secrets&quot; under the mountains had turned out to be just<br>empty night: there was nothing more to find out, nothing worth doing, only<br>nasty furtive eating and resentful remembering. He was altogether wretched. He<br>hated the dark, and he hated light more: he hated everything, and the Ring<br>most of all.&#039;<br><br> &#039;What do you mean?&#039; said Frodo. &#039;Surely the Ring was his precious and the<br>only thing he cared for? But if he hated it, why didn&#039;t he get rid of it, or<br>go away and leave it?&#039;<br><br> &#039;You ought to begin to understand, Frodo, after all you have heard,&#039; said<br>Gandalf. &#039;He hated it and loved it, as he hated and loved himself. He could<br>not get rid of it. He had no will left in the matter.","filename":"246px-The_two_paths_m","ext":".jpg","w":246,"h":598,"tn_w":102,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491930344959,"time":1491930344,"md5":"g99FFpXf0TiHXPGCR83Fbw==","fsize":79057,"resto":0,"id":"OXYv5Azx","country":"RO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nofap-thread","country_name":"Romania","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120622727,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)13:10:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m down to once a week.

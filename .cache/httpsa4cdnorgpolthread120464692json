Ill start out with some bits that makes him look suspicious of being controlled opposition. He was photographed with Barbara Bush. His supposed mentor is apparently is Jew Paul Gottfried. He had a pyramid scheme to lure naive neets into giving him exorbitant amounts of shekels that Radio Free Skyrim exposed. Hes tweeted that homosexuality should be tolerated. And he hangs out with Mike Enoch who was exposed as having a Jewish wife and being a Jew himself.<br><br>Now for the facts that mark him as sincere. He has been campaigning for white nationalism for years, it is misinformation to say that he came out of nowhere this past fall. He does not hold back when it comes to debating his opponents, he is very intelligent and is able to make leftists look idiotic. He has gotten Kevin MacDonald speak at his event NPI. And he speaks about the Jewish Question.","filename":"richard","ext":".jpg","w":275,"h":183,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491846833177,"time":1491846833,"md5":"PWATtjBW7EmXxy70UPU4Bg==","fsize":5006,"resto":0,"id":"B3SVmDXx","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"itt-we-find-out-if-richard-spencer-is-controlled","country_name":"United States","replies":81,"images":20,"unique_ips":25},{"no":120464790,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:54:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"Richard with Paul Gottfried","filename":"paul got","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":373,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":77,"tim":1491846884344,"time":1491846884,"md5":"YL16ImQsTOjEbwh3jyuatQ==","fsize":62908,"resto":120464692,"id":"B3SVmDXx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120464924,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:55:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"don&#039;t fall for the ebin Dickie Spencer le alt right maymay","filename":"C4alV4LVYAA4naI.jpg large","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1491846956222,"time":1491846956,"md5":"m5eiXDfwP6+5UwH9pxVO\/g==","fsize":108303,"resto":120464692,"id":"Z6o2InJF","country":"DK","m_img":1,"country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":120464974,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:56:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"Kevin MacDonald at NPI","filename":"kevin","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":526,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1491846982485,"time":1491846982,"md5":"HQXvkHdwHgLxP4LFiQcMDQ==","fsize":45346,"resto":120464692,"id":"B3SVmDXx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120465013,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:56:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Dickie loves sodomites","filename":"1475789514146","ext":".jpg","w":772,"h":404,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":65,"tim":1491846998549,"time":1491846998,"md5":"YITgiMulUsDFT2iL38kv6g==","fsize":71975,"resto":120464692,"id":"Z6o2InJF","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":120465055,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:56:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120464692\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120464692<\/a><br>he&#039;s been around since 2008 or earlier you idiot, how could he possibly be controlled opposition","time":1491847014,"resto":120464692,"id":"jiZ3hlJ\/","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120465086,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:57:13","name":"Anonymous","filename":"e729bd6369b2bf17c524ec7109209aead418919f16c913ad09466c03650120e8","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":497,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":103,"tim":1491847033321,"time":1491847033,"md5":"IStfwmCa6QF0OdodkcuROA==","fsize":54202,"resto":120464692,"id":"Z6o2InJF","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":120465135,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:57:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120464924\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120464924<\/a><br>I want this to be a real discussion on his legitimacy.

Trade is a wild card, I believe in punishing hostile nations with tariffs if necessary (as they are just an extension of sanctions, theoretically), but I also recognize economic benefits stemming from free trade in certain other sectors. I highly value having a manufacturing base though, as a domestic manufacturing sector is critical to being able to fight wars. Though I&#039;m no fan of Putin, I recognize China as a bigger threat than Russia, which despite being the largest country in the world has an economy smaller than Italy&#039;s and has virtually shit-tier military equipment. We won&#039;t need to invade Russia because they&#039;ll self destruct on their own. In fact, I&#039;d say that there&#039;s room for cooperation with Russia in regards to Islamic terrorism. <br><br>anyway, ask me anything or something I guess","filename":"neocon","ext":".jpg","w":176,"h":196,"tn_w":176,"tn_h":196,"tim":1491417819323,"time":1491417819,"md5":"BwetNqOVg7GI2JxLIBZ+aA==","fsize":3966,"resto":0,"id":"WlqJF5jg","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"neocon-for-trump","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

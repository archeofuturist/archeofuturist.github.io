The game got so &quot;restriced&quot; and bad, building a deck was futile because the cards you couldn&#039;t use the cards you wanted to anyway. When they started play cards on bikes I completly refused it and anything related. It was just too stupid and disgusting. I forgot everything about this until just now, even though I had some nice and fun memories in the beginning. <br><br>Why am I posting this on \/pol\/?<br>Because even though this is related to a japanese cartoon, this is actually how leftists do their deads. They see you like something and then twist it and pervert it until you either cry like a litte girl or turn away in disgust.<br><br>Oldfags know this principle. It is and was always the modus operandi on this site, it&#039;s fun. However the difference between oldfags fun and current year leftists is still significant. <br><br>It funny when you don&#039;t discriminate and there is nothing you can&#039;t make fun of. It boring and unfunny if you have a political agenda and only try to destroy what doesn&#039;t fit into it... and that&#039;s why leftists can&#039;t meme.","filename":"gi","ext":".jpg","w":299,"h":168,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490195279216,"time":1490195279,"md5":"fU0zVsCXSw\/h9VjDEOaYDg==","fsize":10015,"resto":0,"id":"YrKv\/tCP","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-enjoyed-yugioh-the-series-and-the-games-until","country_name":"Germany","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":117769832,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:10:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117769477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117769477<\/a><br>Yu-gay-oh is so autistic you loser","time":1490195424,"resto":117769477,"id":"08bBy\/jb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117769958,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:11:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117769477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117769477<\/a><br>mmmmm Yugi-boy","time":1490195480,"resto":117769477,"id":"m+ePMEoc","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117769969,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:11:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117769477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117769477<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;77<\/span><br><br>not so fast Hans.","filename":"Pot of Greed","ext":".png","w":308,"h":450,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490195486296,"time":1490195486,"md5":"yOH0B3wFptj+zdPxTtJW9w==","fsize":342025,"resto":117769477,"id":"1qpK5Mbn","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117770425,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:14:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"First it was synchro then it was xyz now it is Link...what next?","time":1490195648,"resto":117769477,"id":"mjHyXfql","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117770706,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:15:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117769969\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117769969<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;its banned<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;so is koreburo<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;and monster reborn<\/span>","time":1490195747,"resto":117769477,"id":"xHfHSG8m","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

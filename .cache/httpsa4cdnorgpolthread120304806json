It&#039;s vague and I haven&#039;t thought it through a lot.<br><br>It&#039;s something like this.<br><br>Those populations which are intelligent will use their intelligence to counter various genetic defects they have.<br><br>Then when this population through natural selection spreads it&#039;s genes onward and keeps living, you&#039;ll have the intelligence intimately bound up with all kinds of genetic defects that they were implementing countermeasures against along the way of evolution.<br><br>You can therefore not through eugenics get rid of all these defects, because then you&#039;d gravitate towards baseline, in effect nullifying all the evolution, i.e. that would be dysgenics.

There&#039;s an inverse correlation between fertility and intelligence. Japan&#039;s young apparently have a very low interest in the opposite sex.

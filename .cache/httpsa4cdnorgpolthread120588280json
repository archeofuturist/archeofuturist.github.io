Samuel said: Pederasty with a child below three years is not treated as with a child above that.24 (24) I.e., Rab makes nine years the minimum; but if one committed sodomy with a child of lesser age, no guilt is incurred. Samuel makes three the minimum.<br> <br>Sanhedrin 54b<br> <br>Raba said. It means this: When a grown-up man has intercourse with a little girl it is nothing, for when the girl is less than this [three years old], it is as if one puts the finger into the eye; but when a small boy has intercourse with a grown-up woman he makes her as &#039;a girl who is injured by a piece of wood.&#039;...","time":1491914304,"resto":120588280,"id":"ALzMQRcu","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":120592702,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)08:38:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Kethuboth 11b<br>[This debate concerns whether or not someone is a virgin.

The context makes it perfectly obvious that only vows, where the maker abjures benefit from aught, or imposes an interdict of his own property upon his neighbour, are referred to. Though the beginning of the year (New Year) is mentioned here, the Day of Atonement was probably chosen on account of its great solemnity.

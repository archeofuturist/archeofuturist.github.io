class=\"quote\">&gt;The early voting numbers in Florida were so good that even Bill Clinton, who had chafed at Brooklyn\u2019s tendency to ignore his feel for politics on the ground, excitedly told one campaign aide the Friday before the election that the Sunshine State was in the bag.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mook and Kriegel were not operating in a total information vacuum outside of the data analytics. Public polling showed Hillary with a clear lead nationally and in enough battleground states to carry the election with room to spare. The New York Times\u2019 Upshot, Nate Silver\u2019s FiveThirtyEight, and other election prognosticators rated Hillary as the overwhelming favorite\u2014though Silver\u2019s projection wasn\u2019t quite as rosy. By the time Comey returned to the spotlight two days before the election to say he still wouldn\u2019t recommend charges against Hillary.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The FBI just put out another letter, Merrill said, and it turns out there was nothing to the first one. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hillary rolled her eyes again. \u201cWhat a surprise,\u201d she said sarcastically. But she was in a good mood generally. \u201cWe were feeling good about Florida, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania,\u201d said an aide who was traveling with her. \u201cWe knew we had taken a hit from Comey, but we didn\u2019t think it would be an insurmountable one. It was fun. There was an energy.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Everything Hillary was hearing and seeing pointed to a victory. Even Sullivan, the incorrigible pessimist, thought she was going to win in the final days. Nearly a decade after she\u2019d launched her first campaign for the presidency, the glass ceiling was within Hillary\u2019s reach and the hammer of the American electorate was in her grasp. She would finally get the chance to run the country that she loved.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cIn those final days she believed she was going to win. And she was probably more bearish than most of us,\u201d said one senior campaign aide. \u201cShe was getting comfortable with the idea that it was going to happen.

In Pasco County, a swath of suburbs north of Tampa\u2013St. Petersburg, Trump outran Romney by 30,000 votes.

They were passed from hand to hand, over the heads of the crowd. But time and again the narrow, teeming gangplanks spilled over like brimming gutters into the pitch-black water between ship and pier. And many a soul sank down beneath the wooden pilings, to join those others who had gone before, the first to win the newfound paradise. Ballan was one. As the milling crowd picked up the monsters thronging about him, mouths still sticky from gorging on his sweets, he had tried to follow. But he kept falling farther and farther behind. And as he did, a link seemed to snap, that bond of flesh that had bound them to him. Now, suddenly, Ballan was just another white, spurned on all sides by those who knew him and those who didn\u2019t. He struggled to force his way into the torrent of bodies streaming up one of the gangplanks. But the torrent became a wall, a glass-chipped wall bristling with arms, and fists, and claws, and menacing teeth. \u2026 Ballan grasped at saris, clung to legs, felt his grip shaken loose. A pounding fist shut one of his eyes. Blood streamed down his mangled face and into his mouth. And all at once he clearly heard his lips pronounce these words: \u201cForgive them, Lord, for they know not what they do.\u201d So saying, he opened his fingers, let go of the soft, smooth calf he was clutching, and fell from the gangplank, halfway up, carrying off in his hand the feel of an alien flesh. His end was quick. As he sank down into the murky water, he realized how much he loved and missed the West. And that last awareness, that utter rejection of all he had stood for, so pained and distressed him, that he opened a willing mouth and took himself a healthy gulp of death.","time":1493377545,"resto":123179103,"id":"NVyWL6Wj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123181879,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)07:06:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d Mook assured her. \u201c\u2018I lost.

class=\"quote\">&gt;The early voting numbers in Florida were so good that even Bill Clinton, who had chafed at Brooklyn\u2019s tendency to ignore his feel for politics on the ground, excitedly told one campaign aide the Friday before the election that the Sunshine State was in the bag.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mook and Kriegel were not operating in a total information vacuum outside of the data analytics. Public polling showed Hillary with a clear lead nationally and in enough battleground states to carry the election with room to spare. The New York Times\u2019 Upshot, Nate Silver\u2019s FiveThirtyEight, and other election prognosticators rated Hillary as the overwhelming favorite\u2014though Silver\u2019s projection wasn\u2019t quite as rosy. By the time Comey returned to the spotlight two days before the election to say he still wouldn\u2019t recommend charges against Hillary.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The FBI just put out another letter, Merrill said, and it turns out there was nothing to the first one. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hillary rolled her eyes again. \u201cWhat a surprise,\u201d she said sarcastically. But she was in a good mood generally. \u201cWe were feeling good about Florida, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania,\u201d said an aide who was traveling with her. \u201cWe knew we had taken a hit from Comey, but we didn\u2019t think it would be an insurmountable one. It was fun. There was an energy.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Everything Hillary was hearing and seeing pointed to a victory. Even Sullivan, the incorrigible pessimist, thought she was going to win in the final days. Nearly a decade after she\u2019d launched her first campaign for the presidency, the glass ceiling was within Hillary\u2019s reach and the hammer of the American electorate was in her grasp. She would finally get the chance to run the country that she loved.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cIn those final days she believed she was going to win. And she was probably more bearish than most of us,\u201d said one senior campaign aide. \u201cShe was getting comfortable with the idea that it was going to happen.

In Pasco County, a swath of suburbs north of Tampa\u2013St. Petersburg, Trump outran Romney by 30,000 votes.

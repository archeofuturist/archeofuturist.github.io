What you need to do is motivate yourself. Set a alarm for 6am or 7am. Have a nutrious breakfast. Check the sugar contents and starch,fat etc. Dont eat unhealthy shit. Go for things with lots of protein like fish or low fat meat. Go for a long run\/cycle\/jog. Try buying some whey powder\/protein shake. Every morning have a goal for yourself. For example 20 Triangle pushups (where your hands form a triangle) 50 normal pushups, 30 situps and above 20 pullups. If you still want to lurk i suggest you visit \/fit\/ for certain dietary plans. See if you can find a local gym and spend a good 2 hours there. <br>Everyones had their first time at the gym. Ask some people if you have to. Dont go for extremely heavy shit to look cool in front of people. Just lift what you can lift. <br>Run what you can run. But if you set a goal before doing that, finish that goal. Push yourself. How to become chad? Look for douchebaggy clothes. Have too much confidence in clubs. (Sometimes it works, other times it doesnt) present yourself well and hold the conversation.

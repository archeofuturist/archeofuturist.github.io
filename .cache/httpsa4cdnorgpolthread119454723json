This is their job. Sitting in committees, listening to expert opinion, and producing reports based on those opinions are part and parcel of an MPs duties. Next time, I dare any of you to boycott or walk out of doing a core function of your work because you think it&#039;s &quot;negative&quot;. You&#039;d be fired in a heartbeat.<br><br>Simply put, the tone of the report would be negative because the experts questioned over Brexit (and these aren&#039;t Mickey Mouse experts, but often widely cited and universally hailed as having a singular understanding of the topic - ie, Russell Group academics, barristers). Rather than walking out and refusing to engage with it, maybe our legislative and executive bodies should look more closely into why essentially all of the mainstream expert opinion is against Brexit.<br><br>But the British public hates experts, right? Because the collective, plucky Borg like British consciousness, misinformed by tabloids and holding misconceptions of the EU, somehow overwrites the expert knowledge of people who have devoted 40 years of their life to analysing this very question: &quot;what does the EU do for us, and can we comfortably manage without it?&quot;","filename":"1490790622215","ext":".png","w":800,"h":1200,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491300759710,"time":1491300759,"md5":"ihmi4OAMLF52kTbIF79gMQ==","fsize":558962,"resto":119454723,"id":"UdYsfw4C","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119454999,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)06:13:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;make comics that white males can relate to<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;good sales<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;make comics that only otherkin transgenders can relate to<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bad sales<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Clearly the dip in sales is due to not enough diversity.&quot;<\/span>","filename":"moreasbestos","ext":".jpg","w":930,"h":220,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":29,"tim":1491300822128,"time":1491300822,"md5":"CNvCzRsm9ukF9Roeky+B9Q==","fsize":139403,"resto":119454723,"id":"04mFNzDi","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119455067,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)06:14:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119454928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119454928<\/a><br>It doesn&#039;t matter how many times you post this Tim, nobody&#039;s going to change their mind, you&#039;re not going to get what you want and she&#039;s still going to be a man underneath","filename":"2C824B6100000578-0-image-m-2_1442676357468","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":414,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1491300891355,"time":1491300891,"md5":"eyaxOmEbORhDXzRn7vAplQ==","fsize":63383,"resto":119454723,"id":"Bh0W4kmE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119455078,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)06:14:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119454928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119454928<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mocking people for reading tabloids and being uninformed while reading the rag that is the Independent<\/span><br><br>You&#039;re reading a tabloid, mate.","filename":"1477588538754","ext":".jpg","w":920,"h":380,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":51,"tim":1491300896818,"time":1491300896,"md5":"\/Ha\/GDWOkqCBMzwIllJUdA==","fsize":70495,"resto":119454723,"id":"BmSs1o20","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119455167,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)06:16:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"AIYYO HE A GOOT BOI<br><br>GETTIN&#039; HISSELF BACK ON TRACK<br><br>TRYNA TURN HIS LIFE AROUN N SHEIT<br><br>http:\/\/www.standard.co.uk\/news\/crim<wbr>e\/augustus-fenton-man-who-was-chase<wbr>d-by-gang-and-stabbed-to-death-had-<wbr>tried-to-turn-his-life-around-a3506<wbr>446.html","filename":"Capture","ext":".jpg","w":1008,"h":829,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":102,"tim":1491300990750,"time":1491300990,"md5":"hCt6K4iJvYhhjs4oNs\/M+A==","fsize":105594,"resto":119454723,"id":"DY22FcI7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119455229,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)06:17:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119454999\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119454999<\/a> <br>Wrong thread, Marvel is here <a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119419812#p119419812\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119419812<\/a>","time":1491301046,"resto":119454723,"id":"VllRb6aA","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119455355,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)06:19:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119455229\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119455229<\/a><br>It&#039;s more a comment about the utter rubbish that The Guardian publishes these days.

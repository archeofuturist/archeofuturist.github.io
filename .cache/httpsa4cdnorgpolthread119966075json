This was an example of Trump flexing his muscle in Syrian conflict, signalling that chemical weapons usage would be met with coordinated retaliation. This signal went out to Assad and the (((rebels))) alike.<br><br>The chemical weapons attack carried out by Assad is not confirmed by independent investigators (UN), and very well could have been a false flag of sorts. Russia and Syria claim that it was an attack against a terrorist weapons cache, while the l\u00fcgenpresse claims that Assad used chemical weapons against his own citizens and killed many children in the attack.<br><br>The long term affects are still up in the air, however Russia is now ramping up defensive infrastructure support in Syria, possibly with aims to end the conflict in a more timely manner. The event took place during discussions with Xi Jingping; a large component of these investigations involve North Korea. The USA muscle flexing in Syria signals a heightened willingness to engage in military conflict, which may lead the Chinese to be less favorable of North Korea&#039;s antagonism. Also, Russia&#039;s increased defensive presence in Syria may very well prevent further Israeli involvement.<br><br>How&#039;s this look now?

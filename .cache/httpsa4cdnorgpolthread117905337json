monopoly over every industry and the power to kill any employee (a.k.a. the citizen) that doesn&#039;t comply? Communism literally is a parody of the perceived flaws in capitalism. I have tried and honestly cannot imagine a system more exploitative of workers. It guarantees that you will never be anything more than a slave laborer grunt - that is unless you are a (((Party member))). How is it current year and people still believe in this? The kikes are so impatient and pushy that they&#039;re already pushing it just 20 years after the Soviet Union collapsed.

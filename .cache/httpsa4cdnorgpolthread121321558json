French elections are much harder to rig than American ones and this is one of their few options, knowing that overseas French are cucks subject to globalist propaganda and media because they are less connected with what is happening on the ground at home. Daily reminder: Melenchon has a big media team posting here every day. Fillon is corrupt as shit, even for France, and the scandals regarding fake jobs for his family will weaken him severely in a 2nd round.

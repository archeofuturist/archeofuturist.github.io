Italy&#039;s first &quot;Fertility Day&quot; is set to take place on 22 September, with a number of events highlighting family planning in Rome, Catania, Bologna and Padova.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The initiative was announced by Health Minister Beatrice Lorenzin and promoted through a series of images bearing various slogans. They include a picture of a woman holding her belly and a sand timer with the words &quot;beauty knows no age.

The topic soon began to trend on Twitter, with users mocking the initiative with the hashtag #FertilityDay.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Twitter user Giuditta Fontana posted: &quot;They complain about #burkinis and then come up with a #fertilityday - when will they stop telling us how to cover\/use\/protect our bodies?&quot; Another branded the initiative &quot;offensive, sexist and dangerous&quot;.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Writer and radio host Giulia Blasi deplored the move and accused the health ministry of &quot;promoting a campaign that treats all women as little more than walking incubators.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In May, Lorenzin described an &quot;apocalyptic&quot; decline in Italy&#039;s birth rate. &quot;If we carry on as we are and fail to reverse the trend, there will be fewer than 350,000 births a year in 10 years&#039; time, 40% less than in 2010 \u2013 an apocalypse,&quot; she said.<\/span>","filename":"italy-protesters-rally-against-governments-fertility-day-campaign","ext":".png","w":768,"h":432,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491946435945,"time":1491946435,"md5":"fya52KeisqeaT0Z4bxDGCw==","fsize":547720,"resto":0,"id":"3y5c6ZfE","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"feminists-are-protesting-against-italian","country_name":"Australia","replies":98,"images":12,"unique_ips":64},{"no":120661387,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:36:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Jesus.<br>Look at tht sizes of the noses","time":1491946570,"resto":120661082,"id":"2y\/85b+1","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120661508,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:36:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"So feminists really do want to destroy Europe","time":1491946618,"resto":120661082,"id":"3y5c6ZfE","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120661698,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:38:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120661082\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120661082<\/a><br>Why is it countries like Italy and Spain that are suffering the worst from suicidal birth rates?

Our infant fatality rates are extremely low compared to the third world, so we can make due with less children.<br><br>Population decline actually tends to lead to higher wealth levels for the population. As the population declines, the value of labor increases. Wages go up and people enjoy more comfortable lives. <br><br>The problem is that our economic system is centered around the idea of infinite GDP growth. We take on debt with the expectation that our economy will outgrow the debt obligations and allow us to pay it off. But, since we&#039;re already so developed, we are experiencing significant slow-down in GDP growth. This is why governments(and their rich owners) encourage immigration. Population growth is necessary for GDP growth. The government and elite(rich) also experience the majority of the benefits of mass immigration. Rich business owners get an influx of cheap labor. Governments get an influx of ignorant voters who will vote for larger government.<br><br>Keep in mind I&#039;m speaking from a purely economic point of view. Social factors are obviously relevant. We obviously don&#039;t want the white race to decline into obscurity. This is why we tend to view the declining birth rate as a bad thing. It&#039;s also why we view mass immigration as a bad thing.

Don&#039;t get me wrong, there&#039;s a deep deep culture of obtaining (((wealth))), among other things, which has lead to this idea of not having but one kid. But we don&#039;t have the medieval mindset, and can&#039;t assume it will come back anytime soon. We should try and encourage a family friendly environment ourselves as individuals, strategically. One thing we can do ourselves is of course have children, as many as possible. The next thing we can do is quit the black pilling in this board and in real life, unhappy people tend to not want as many children. And as you said, things have been worse. That&#039;s how nature is. Nature is harsh. Europeans have faced worse odds, so we need to acknowledge that. Feminism, Islam, etc will eventually be our nations undoing, but our people will still live on, even with the older population.

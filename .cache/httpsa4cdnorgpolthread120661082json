Italy&#039;s first &quot;Fertility Day&quot; is set to take place on 22 September, with a number of events highlighting family planning in Rome, Catania, Bologna and Padova.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The initiative was announced by Health Minister Beatrice Lorenzin and promoted through a series of images bearing various slogans. They include a picture of a woman holding her belly and a sand timer with the words &quot;beauty knows no age. Fertility does,&quot; in a not-so-subtle allusion to the biological clock.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Another showed baby shoes with a ribbon in the colours of the Italian flag wrapped around them. It says: &quot;The constitution [sic] protects conscious and responsible procreation.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Others urged people not to wait for the stork and claimed that fertility is a &quot;common good&quot;. The topic soon began to trend on Twitter, with users mocking the initiative with the hashtag #FertilityDay.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Twitter user Giuditta Fontana posted: &quot;They complain about #burkinis and then come up with a #fertilityday - when will they stop telling us how to cover\/use\/protect our bodies?&quot; Another branded the initiative &quot;offensive, sexist and dangerous&quot;.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Writer and radio host Giulia Blasi deplored the move and accused the health ministry of &quot;promoting a campaign that treats all women as little more than walking incubators.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In May, Lorenzin described an &quot;apocalyptic&quot; decline in Italy&#039;s birth rate. &quot;If we carry on as we are and fail to reverse the trend, there will be fewer than 350,000 births a year in 10 years&#039; time, 40% less than in 2010 \u2013 an apocalypse,&quot; she said.<\/span>","filename":"italy-protesters-rally-against-governments-fertility-day-campaign","ext":".png","w":768,"h":432,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491946435945,"time":1491946435,"md5":"fya52KeisqeaT0Z4bxDGCw==","fsize":547720,"resto":0,"id":"3y5c6ZfE","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"feminists-are-protesting-against-italian","country_name":"Australia","replies":10,"images":2,"unique_ips":8},{"no":120661387,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:36:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Jesus.<br>Look at tht sizes of the noses","time":1491946570,"resto":120661082,"id":"2y\/85b+1","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120661508,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:36:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"So feminists really do want to destroy Europe","time":1491946618,"resto":120661082,"id":"3y5c6ZfE","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120661698,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)17:38:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120661082\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120661082<\/a><br>Why is it countries like Italy and Spain that are suffering the worst from suicidal birth rates?

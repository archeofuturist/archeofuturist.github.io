(AP) \u2014 Words in state law must be interpreted as having &quot;natural and ordinary meaning&quot; under a bill passed by the Tennessee Senate on Thursday. Critics call it a sneaky way of encouraging state judges to deny rights to same-sex couples and transgender people.<br><br>LGBT groups lamented the 23-6 vote and immediately began prodding Republican Gov. Bill Haslam for a veto, but his spokeswoman Jennifer Donnals said he is &quot;deferred to the will of the legislature.&quot; The House approved the same legislation last month.<br><br>The legislation has been pushed by the Family Action Council of Tennessee, which advocates for one-man, one-woman marriage.<br><br>A different bill that gained no traction explicitly cited &quot;husband,&quot; &#039;&#039;wife,&quot; &#039;&#039;mother,&quot; and &quot;father&quot; as having natural and ordinary meanings based on the biological distinctions between men and women. The measure that passed avoids those specifics, and merely states that any word undefined in state law must be used according to its &quot;natural and ordinary meaning.&quot;<br><br>The measure addresses questions raised in a same-sex child custody case in Knoxville, in which the Family Action Council tried to intervene on behalf of 53 state lawmakers, only to be rejected by the circuit court judge.<br><br>Despite this background, Sen. John Stevens, R-Huntingdon, insisted that his bill isn&#039;t aimed at LBGT people. He said he simply wants undefined words to mean what they meant at the time lawmakers put them into the law.<br><br>Asked if the bill could infringe on same-sex couples&#039; ability to have kids or be married, Stevens said he has &quot;no idea.&quot;","filename":"JackDaniels","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":533,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":177,"tim":1493339744648,"time":1493339744,"md5":"gcy\/DXKEst8bdW6TZ+Bd7w==","fsize":65353,"resto":0,"id":"gOMEb7Jc","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"bill-passed-in-tennessee-requires-words-carry","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":123117611,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)20:36:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123117555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123117555<\/a><br>The legislation passed despite concerns raised by Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery of potential conflicts with the U.S. Supreme Court&#039;s gay marriage ruling, as well as state law that requires gender-specific words to be interpreted as inclusive.<br><br>Slatery&#039;s opinion predicted that judges would side with the gender-inclusive interpretation given the clashing requirements.

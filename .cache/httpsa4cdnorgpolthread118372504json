You can buy a car that will never breakdown for $4000 (certain Toyotas, Scions, Hondas). You can also buy a Lexus ISF which will depreciate very slowly and never break. Most Lexus RWD cars are very reliable. The LS430 was the pinnacle of build quality - akin to late 90s Mercedes. You can own Mercedes or Porsche cars, but only under warranty - CarMax with the warranty lets you own a 75k car for 30k - just buy the warranty. You can go straight to the dealer for repairs, get a dealer loaner, etc. the CarMax warranty is prorated and refunded when you trade to the next car. I work hard, I want to drive a nice car, but either drive a nice car under warranty, or a select few cars out of warranty.","time":1490543475,"resto":118372504,"id":"\/noozw0+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118375031,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:51:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"toyOta corOlla<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YlY<wbr>TvjUR1jg","time":1490543483,"resto":118372504,"id":"Q8LuynfS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118375087,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:51:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118373372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118373372<\/a><br>Only correct answer","time":1490543507,"resto":118372504,"id":"hkZzre3u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118375091,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:51:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118374989\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118374989<\/a><br>Fuck outta here LEAF","filename":"Death-to-leafs","ext":".png","w":1000,"h":590,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":73,"tim":1490543511417,"time":1490543511,"md5":"oNjzyfggUMMhRcYXFYO0iQ==","fsize":1363581,"resto":118372504,"id":"SBMGoW1r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118375105,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:51:57","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1979_Volvo_240_Wagon_For_Sale_resize","ext":".jpg","w":580,"h":346,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":74,"tim":1490543517993,"time":1490543517,"md5":"CShJILyt0YVuvaJfY\/q+KA==","fsize":166859,"resto":118372504,"id":"NiChHjpm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118375106,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:51:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118372504\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118372504<\/a><br>just about anything toyota followed by honda","filename":"Capture","ext":".png","w":742,"h":834,"tn_w":111,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490543518318,"time":1490543518,"md5":"ZnaFA1F6bjX0DaqNUbIuRw==","fsize":101905,"resto":118372504,"id":"RWC4SFop","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118375109,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:52:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118374459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118374459<\/a>","filename":"Bildschirmfoto 2017-03-26 um 11.51.29","ext":".png","w":574,"h":450,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":97,"tim":1490543521502,"time":1490543521,"md5":"SGRb9yKloj94t5zYOU+vpQ==","fsize":196604,"resto":118372504,"id":"PK1D7sSK","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118375127,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:52:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118373372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118373372<\/a><br>Best car.","filename":"1486623857868","ext":".jpg","w":1858,"h":1239,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490543532276,"time":1490543532,"md5":"l\/POIHuZfsRFGm3yIhTuFw==","fsize":456148,"resto":118372504,"id":"+x+nG2t0","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118375152,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)11:52:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"any moron in here buying a gas car has already succumbed to loss and depreciation.

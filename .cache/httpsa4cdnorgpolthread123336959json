The goal was to preserve the union at any cost and southern taxes heading north. Lincoln himself said blacks are not equal and refused to let southern blacks into northern States after the war. He then left them to rot in the South as northeners came down to pillage anything of value and secure Republican control. KKK then formed to retake some control of local politics.","time":1493475833,"resto":123336959,"id":"Qc6bmLbf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123337616,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)10:24:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123336959\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123336959<\/a><br><br>What constitutional freedom were they trying to defend?","time":1493475842,"resto":123336959,"id":"3RowwTPN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123337820,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)10:26:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123336959\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123336959<\/a>","filename":"200w","ext":".gif","w":200,"h":83,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":51,"tim":1493475983221,"time":1493475983,"md5":"YX2\/1q85wJVbXeTV86bCuA==","fsize":541503,"resto":123336959,"id":"lCW4Jq6L","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123338267,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)10:31:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123336959\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123336959<\/a><br>It was about the States rights to have slaves.

You look at this nation today and it&#039;s painfully obvious we should be two nations. Both groups of people would be happier as a result if there were two political units here. Sometimes gigantic wars can be a good sign that the political units need to be reoriented or added to.","time":1493476263,"resto":123336959,"id":"UisCh+l1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

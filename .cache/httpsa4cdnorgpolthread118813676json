It&#039;s for me about having time, and how I choose to spend that time. A woman on the other hand, who enjoys to cook in order to please her man, is a creature worthy of praise. I have only know a handful of girls who can cook, al,oat all of them come from strong family&#039;s, or girls who came from families so broken they were red pulled before leaving the nest. Those women I adore and have always respected. Not because they can cook, but the cooking part always seems to be part of that personality I find so admirable and worthy of my respect. It is the woman who is a giver, and that does not necessarily equate to being a doormat either. A good woman reveals herself to a good man. Anyways. One problem with a good woman, she&#039;ll make you fat if you let her, because there is a special delight in watching a person who is feeling contentment. However, a good man knows how to redirect energies, to shape the household. <br><br>Not sure why I wrote all this, hope someone finds some use out of it.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":583,"h":583,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490812203582,"time":1490812203,"md5":"QpAGOx+FAVxR4q0kDnz2wA==","fsize":93953,"resto":118813676,"id":"ZoP+wpNn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118815808,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:30:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118815617\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118815617<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i bake<\/span><br><br>you disgust me you fucking homo","time":1490812240,"resto":118813676,"id":"ztBeluPm","country":"UA","country_name":"Ukraine"},{"no":118816034,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:32:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"We have a family chef, fresh healthy food every day","time":1490812345,"resto":118813676,"id":"g5lyL72L","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118816043,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:32:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118815222\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118815222<\/a><br>GTFO HOMOSEXUAL YOU DON&#039;T BELONG HERE","time":1490812353,"resto":118813676,"id":"Ecg1hgK2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118816070,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)14:32:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"I live off cold oats with soya milk, canned fish and multivitamins.

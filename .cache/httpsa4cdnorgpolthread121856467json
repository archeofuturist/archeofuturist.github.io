We know beyond doubt that two Sukhoi-22 aircraft took off from Shayrat airfield, where we know chemical weapons are stored. We know that they were overhead at 6.39 am when, according to all eyewitness accounts, the attack took place. We know from shell fragments in the crater that sarin had not only been used, but that it was sarin carrying the specific chemical signature of sarin used by the Assad regime. Given that samples from the victims show conclusively that they had been exposed to sarin gas, there is only one conclusion to be reached: that the Assad regime almost certainly gassed its own people, in breach of international law and the rules of war. That shows the emptiness of the agreement\u2014reached in 2013 and guaranteed by Russia\u2014that was supposed to rid Syria of chemical weapons once and for all, and, I am afraid, exposes the misjudgment of those who regarded that deal as a substitute for resolute action.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We know from shell fragments<\/span><br>Boris has the circular thing","filename":"circular thing","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492618180037,"time":1492618180,"md5":"DvHtQe3\/YTkoEROtqCHaAg==","fsize":1541603,"resto":121856467,"id":"fSRYAbS8","country":"HU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":121860135,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:10:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;This is an awoovement!<\/span>","time":1492618237,"resto":121856467,"id":"mO\/Hio\/7","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":121860172,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:11:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Question lads.<br><br>Does Hezbollah and the Lebanese government...get along?<br>I know that Hezbollah have some seats in the parliament and they fought side by side during the 2006 Lebanon war, but I don&#039;t know whether they get along or not.","filename":"n8qmof9","ext":".jpg","w":1983,"h":3000,"tn_w":82,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492618267079,"time":1492618267,"md5":"W0nf8eDGHLTWaLt4nKuDwA==","fsize":642411,"resto":121856467,"id":"mUJZDa56","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121860352,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:12:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121856538\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121856538<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Progress: 20 left out of 3000+ at the start, after crying around at the Slovenia-Croatia fence and bitching about visas, on march 12th they entered in Bosnia and Herzegovina, April 11th they were in Serbia<\/span>","filename":"1468885888618","ext":".jpg","w":251,"h":242,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1492618366767,"time":1492618366,"md5":"8GwenhyIV4fXSd8H14kt8w==","fsize":16569,"resto":121856467,"id":"3JQ0V6df","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":121860392,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:13:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Give me literally 1 (one) reason why I should support Assad&#039;s shitty regime, given that he&#039;s a puppet of Putin, and Putin is an enemy of Poland.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;M-muh Christian in da Middle East<\/span><br>I honestly don&#039;t care.","time":1492618392,"resto":121856467,"id":"XZx+5Q0Z","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121860423,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)12:13:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121860172\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121860172<\/a><br>No one in Lebanon gets along with anyone really.

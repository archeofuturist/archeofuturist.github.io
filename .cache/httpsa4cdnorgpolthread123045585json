Short story:<br><br>Once upon a time, the comoros archipelago was a french colony. In the 70s, they had a vote on whether to stay under french tutelage or not. One island remained, Mayotte, and the others gained full independance.<br>Mayotte became a french &quot;TOM&quot;,(overseas territory). Basically, it was administered by France and had very limited gibs but paid no french taxes. Under Sark\u00f6zy, Mayoote became a full fledged french department (a part of France, on the same level as Aquitania or Ile de France, these are regions but you get the jist).<br><br>Now what happens? Well comoros women happens. They come pregnant by the boatload, hoping to give birth to little french shits. So much that Mayotte now has the highest birth ratio in all of France. Of course, some comoros men come, and like all good refugees they&#039;re violent. Crime rises, Mayotte natives (i think they&#039;re called maor\u00e9 but I&#039;m not certain here) are fed up with this. They want them out. What does the french gov do? They send gendarmes and GIGN to quell whatever violence they can. And here my story ends.

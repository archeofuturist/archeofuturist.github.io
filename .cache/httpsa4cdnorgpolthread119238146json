There&#039;s a lot of import goods that are going to remain cheap from those that import them to undercut each other. Not all industries can raise their prices and not suffer from decrease sales and profit, even if the bottom-tier of society gets richer. Prices will raise for some, but not all goods are directed to the bottom rug of society, and not all of them will be affected by the minimum wage increase.","filename":"OB-KY973_hkprop_G_20101122063845","ext":".jpg","w":553,"h":369,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491169107718,"time":1491169107,"md5":"z7LgQxjRHbmKPs9lvGvDMw==","fsize":82071,"resto":119238146,"id":"V9CcfRmk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119249638,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)17:39:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119249235\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119249235<\/a><br>your entire post is just &quot;you should be born with the resources available to you&quot; saying shit like &quot;minimum wage is for kids and you shouldn&#039;t be able to live on it! you should have skills by the time you are at least 25!&quot; just shows you have no idea the hardships of others, you think poor people who have no skills or education wouldn&#039;t LOVE to take classes for skills or go to college? do you ACTUALLY think those people are just lazy?","time":1491169188,"resto":119238146,"id":"K6G8OX7C","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119249751,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)17:40:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119249099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119249099<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spoken like a true out-of-touch upper middle class that has literally NEVER had to struggle or suffer for anything<\/span><br><br>Spoken like a true &quot;gimmedat cuz life kicked my ass and I need to be saved by strangers who owe me nothing&quot;","filename":"naptime-poop","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":442,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1491169241251,"time":1491169241,"md5":"9bdyc7n0lHJncWT\/rX1H+A==","fsize":42636,"resto":119238146,"id":"1KnV3729","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119249848,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)17:41:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119238146\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119238146<\/a><br>minimum wage is a type of welfare where the tax is payed entirely by the individual employer<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;let&#039;s punish small businesses for the sluggish economy they&#039;re struggling to stay profitable in.<\/span>","filename":"how-the-minimum-wage-works-comic","ext":".png","w":1160,"h":420,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":45,"tim":1491169286320,"time":1491169286,"md5":"8G0ordoRahzkrnZQUdzGeA==","fsize":131217,"resto":119238146,"id":"nLnFm11i","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119249859,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)17:41:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119241992\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119241992<\/a><br>This.<br><br>Minimum wages jobs make it so that moving upward is a bitch.

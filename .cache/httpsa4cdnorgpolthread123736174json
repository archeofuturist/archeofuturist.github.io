The potter has sovereign right over the clay, not the reverse. It is significant that Paul links this idea to a statement about God\u2019s unexpected patience towards the wicked (vv. 22\u20133; see Wis 11:21\u201312:22). If God is both just and powerful (as powerful as a potter over a lump of clay), why do the wicked exist, much less flourish? The assertion of God\u2019s omnipo- tence underlies all theodicy; if God controls human action, then human evil itself must ori- ginate in God. Negating this conclusion re- quires a limiting of God\u2019s omnipotence (often imagined as a divine self-limitation: here, for example, judgement is forestalled temporarily by God\u2019s patience; see also 2:4; Neh 9:30; 1 Pet 3:17; and 2 Pet 3:9, 15). The problem is as old as the book of Job and remains as intractable. Paul\u2019s answer is reminiscent of that of Job\u2019s latter chapters: \u2018Who indeed are you, a human being, to argue with God?\u2019 Logically, this is no answer at all; instead, it is a roundabout affirm- ation that God can be trusted. This faithful God indeed has done what was promised, calling a people out from among Gentiles (vv. 25\u20136) and Jews (vv. 27\u20139) alike. In sum, if much of \u2018natural\u2019 Israel is not included in true Israel, it cannot mean that God has failed. Then whose fault is it?<\/span>","time":1493717101,"resto":123736174,"id":"lzrn\/uUT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123749472,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:25:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123736174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123736174<\/a><br>because idolatry is a sin","time":1493717115,"resto":123736174,"id":"OQY1yzmK","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123749493,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:25:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123736174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123736174<\/a><br>Because I wish not to be Jean D&#039;Arced at the stake thank you very much","time":1493717132,"resto":123736174,"id":"G4Ayf55z","country":"HK","country_name":"Hong Kong"},{"no":123749514,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:25:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Attention! <br>Word on [s4s] is that \/mlp\/ is getting their 3 mil get soon<br>Lets steal it","time":1493717148,"resto":123736174,"id":"M65mC0VZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123749528,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:26:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123749303\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123749303<\/a><br>If we trust ANS Lane, it would appear that the Bible doesn&#039;t teach the sola Scripture","time":1493717161,"resto":123736174,"id":"lzrn\/uUT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123749562,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:26:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123736174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123736174<\/a><br>You&#039;re all in love with the Catholic aesthetic, not catholicism itself.<br><br><br>All of Christianity is a Jewish heresy and has made Europe weak, shit like love thy neighbour is what has got us into this mess.<br>Christianity is a Jewish trick, you&#039;re all just in love with the aesthetics","filename":"1481573800045","ext":".jpg","w":240,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493717190209,"time":1493717190,"md5":"sF7cZFJdJTual9pLcnQABA==","fsize":6550,"resto":123736174,"id":"lieT\/zB7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123749616,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:27:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123736174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123736174<\/a><br><br>But I am, I am a True Catholic of the Eastern Orthodox Church.","time":1493717252,"resto":123736174,"id":"dLGKQcJm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123749621,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:27:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123747968\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123747968<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I condemn sola fide because it means you can say a prayer and the world thinks you have faith.<\/span><br><br>But God knows the heart. https:\/\/www.biblegateway.com\/quicks<wbr>earch\/?quicksearch=God+knows+the+he<wbr>art+&amp;qs_version=NKJV<br><br>You&#039;re condemning the chaff among the wheat before the harvest.

Why was Mary Magdalen the first one Jesus went to see? because she was the one Jesus Christ loved the most, why did he love her the most? because she was his wife.","filename":"whatever","ext":".png","w":1918,"h":478,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":31,"tim":1493717379421,"time":1493717379,"md5":"8QrUNbYc\/9iyReEBv7YoXA==","fsize":221655,"resto":123736174,"id":"IovBvET0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123749771,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:29:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123748296\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123748296<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Deflecting from the exegetical text of Romans 9.<\/span>","time":1493717393,"resto":123736174,"id":"EsBcep8R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123749804,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:30:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123749732\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123749732<\/a><br>goddamn that&#039;s beautiful fellow protestant bro","time":1493717430,"resto":123736174,"id":"6577xRyF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123749874,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:31:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123749721\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123749721<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Suicide is a sin<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jews hate it so much they even refuse to use the &quot;+&quot; sign when adding<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Almost all of atheism&#039;s champions have been secular jews<\/span><br>Really activated those almonds","time":1493717495,"resto":123736174,"id":"M65mC0VZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123749905,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:31:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"because the pope is weak and thus has made catholics weak. they have bowed to pc culture.<br><br>what we need is a moderate form of islam that is compatible with western ideals but still allows us to keep women and liberals subservient and afraid, respectively.","time":1493717515,"resto":123736174,"id":"B579NMj3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123749943,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:32:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123749621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123749621<\/a><br>And the Act of faith is simply God dangling a puppet on a string","time":1493717543,"resto":123736174,"id":"lzrn\/uUT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123749944,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:32:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why do so many non Catholics hate the church?<br>It&#039;s like me saying I hate the baptist church even though I&#039;ve never been a part of it.<br>I can understand Catholics having issues with the church, but how can you hate something you&#039;ve never known.<br>I don&#039;t think most f you are even Christian,<br>You certainly aren&#039;t acting like it.","time":1493717543,"resto":123736174,"id":"ZfZAr+2C","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123749997,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:33:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123749693\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123749693<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;academic books and articles<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;that shows where they get their points from<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;assertion<\/span><br>Excuses","time":1493717592,"resto":123736174,"id":"lzrn\/uUT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123750028,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:33:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123749771\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123749771<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I hate scholarship<\/span>","time":1493717616,"resto":123736174,"id":"lzrn\/uUT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123750073,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:34:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123749944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123749944<\/a><br>They are taught to hate it<br>There&#039;s a reason so many sjw&#039;s and other liberals hate it.","time":1493717657,"resto":123736174,"id":"M65mC0VZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123750117,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:34:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123749874\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123749874<\/a><br>You forgot the<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Spend your entire life preparing for the end of the world<\/span><br>part","time":1493717696,"resto":123736174,"id":"lAn3i51R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123750181,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:35:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123746168\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123746168<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;how lost does one have to be to ask POL for religious advice.

The tradition of the (Jewish) elders, together with other human tradition, is rejected.7 At the same time there is good apostolic tradition which is simply the Christian faith as it was proclaimed and transmitted by the apostles and their associates.8 The New Testament writings sprang out of this latter tradition at different stages in its history. There is therefore an important sense in which (apostolic) tradition precedes Scripture, an aspect largely ignored by traditional Protestant theology. But although this has important implications for the origin of the New Testament it does not foreclose the question of the subsequent relation between Scripture and tradition. The New Testament may derive from the original apostolic tradition but once it was produced it became distinct from that tradition and the relation between the two became an open question. It also became a question which could not long be ignored for the original apostolic tradition did not suddenly die when the New Testament was produced but remained as the context in which it was read and interpreted.<\/span><br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;context which scripture is to be read and intepreted<\/span><br><br>Sorry, this isnt sola Scriptura as this actually means that to get to scripture, you need tradition<br><br>Funny how you always try to misrepresent the text","time":1493718531,"resto":123736174,"id":"lzrn\/uUT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123751081,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:49:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123749681\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123749681<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what do you know about ~A SANCTIFIED CHURCH<\/span><br><br>You&#039;re awfully quick to trigger, but equally slow on detailed corrections anon","time":1493718564,"resto":123736174,"id":"EsBcep8R","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123751137,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:50:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123750964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123750964<\/a><br>That is calvinism<br><br>THere is nothing vague about that","time":1493718612,"resto":123736174,"id":"lzrn\/uUT","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123751138,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:50:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123736174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123736174<\/a><br>because ortodoxy is less degenerate.","time":1493718614,"resto":123736174,"id":"eJXGn44w","country":"BA","country_name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"no":123751150,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:50:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123750718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123750718<\/a><br>Well those people aren&#039;t really liberals or sjws if they&#039;re persecuting other people are they?<br>And a lot of that is because a lot of Christians choose to ignore the teachings of Jesus and cling to the old covenant which Jesus came to make new.<br>That&#039;s another reason Ive considered converting from Catholicism, I honestly don&#039;t like most of the Old Testament and Jesus himself said he came to make a new covenant so I don&#039;t see why the church clings to the old Jewish customs so much that Jesus himself said no longer apply.","time":1493718623,"resto":123736174,"id":"ZfZAr+2C","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123751199,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:51:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123736174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123736174<\/a>","filename":"Authority","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493718661908,"time":1493718661,"md5":"jpK1qPCRykxJbLlpLfv57g==","fsize":172940,"resto":123736174,"id":"08Pl+Q+y","country":"RU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":123751216,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)05:51:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123749997\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123749997<\/a><br>Right.

If God is both just and powerful (as powerful as a potter over a lump of clay), why do the wicked exist, much less flourish?

That&#039;s where your commentary falls short. No theodicy necessary! God is sovereign. You&#039;re &quot;negating the conclusion&quot; out of fear. God doesn&#039;t need your protection.

This faithful God indeed has done what was promised, calling a people out from among Gentiles (vv. 25\u20136) and Jews (vv. 27\u20139) alike.

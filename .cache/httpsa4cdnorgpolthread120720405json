Chemical Forces General Ochsner reported to German command in June 1942 that a chemical unit had taken part in the battle.[40] After the battle in mid-May 1942, roughly 3,000 Red Army soldiers and Soviet civilians not evacuated by sea were besieged in a series of caves and tunnels in the nearby Adzhimuskai quarry. After holding out for approximately three months, &quot;poison gas was released into the tunnels, killing all but a few score of the Soviet defenders.&quot;[41] Thousands of those killed around Adzhimushk were documented to have been killed by asphyxiation from gas.[40]","time":1491976715,"resto":120720405,"id":"DM6wNBZo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

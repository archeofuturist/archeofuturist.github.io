Chemical Forces General Ochsner reported to German command in June 1942 that a chemical unit had taken part in the battle.[40] After the battle in mid-May 1942, roughly 3,000 Red Army soldiers and Soviet civilians not evacuated by sea were besieged in a series of caves and tunnels in the nearby Adzhimuskai quarry. After holding out for approximately three months, &quot;poison gas was released into the tunnels, killing all but a few score of the Soviet defenders.&quot;[41] Thousands of those killed around Adzhimushk were documented to have been killed by asphyxiation from gas.[40]","time":1491976715,"resto":120720405,"id":"DM6wNBZo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120722061,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)02:01:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120721820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120721820<\/a><br>Might wanna cite that breh","time":1491976911,"resto":120720405,"id":"Eyd+EtAb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120722280,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)02:04:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120721515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120721515<\/a><br>We&#039;ve never called a state sanctioned execution an &quot;attack&quot; on people either because those terms just simply don&#039;t apply.

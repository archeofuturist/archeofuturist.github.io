He promised not to revisit healthcare until he&#039;s finished defunding important parts of Obamacare while he watches the American people slowly suffer from the broken system. He&#039;s abandoned the American people, and is perfectly okay watching them suffer while putting the blame on everyone else.<br><br>He&#039;s unnecessarily ruining the lives of immigrants while subsequently not tackling the root causes of immigration. He cannot build the wall from Mexican funding, a key campaign promise. Instead, middle class America will pay for the wall and watch their taxes rise.<br><br>He&#039;s had to fire many of his elected officials. Many high profile supporters have turned their backs on him. Wall street is now running for its life. He&#039;s making allies our enemies, and enemies our even worse enemies.<br><br>I&#039;m fairly certain anyone that still supports him at this point is a shill or a troll. I guess it&#039;s fun watching America burn.","filename":"tramp-1300","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":1333,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490739057860,"time":1490739057,"md5":"qhPZlAZ5Pq92KQlVkGooKw==","fsize":2335460,"resto":0,"id":"mwk5hl0K","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"he-gave-up-on-healthcare-he-promised-not-to","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118704728,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)18:12:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"Niggers in camps","time":1490739171,"resto":118704494,"id":"AmUsajjR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

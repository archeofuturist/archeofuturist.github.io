THIS IS PARTLY FROM INSOUCIANCE BUT ALSO PARTLY BECAUSE TRAPS EMERGE FROM A CERTAIN SPACE ON THE INTERNET BEYOND THEIR MEANS, BUT FROM A PLACE WHERE THE VITAL, AUTHORITARIAN, AND CHAOTIC ASPECTS OF MAN&#039;S DISPOSITION ARE VENTILATED.

JAY WAS BORN IN 1988 IN VIRGINIA, WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT AS IT WAS THE SAME YEAR BUSH SENIOR WON THE AMERICAN PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. BUT VIRGINIA HAS ALWAYS CONSIDERED ITSELF AS POSSESSING A CERTAIN BON TON OF SORTS. A DYSPHORIC STATE, TORN BETWEEN THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH IN THAT CIVIL WAR, TORN BETWEEN THE OLD WORLD AND THE NEW. A RECRUDESCENCE OF ENLIGHTENMENT TRIUMPHALISM BUT ALWAYS AN ARISTOCRATIC GLEAM IN THE EYE.....

THE BARBARIC HAS BECOME HYPOSTATIZED IN MODERNITY TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT IS HAS BECOME ITS OWN NEGATION. MY VIEW IS THAT BARBARISM DOES NOT STAND APART FROM CIVILISATION, BUT THAT IT IS A NECESSARY ASPECT OF IT.

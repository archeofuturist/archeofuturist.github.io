The most interesting by far was that of Lucius Cornelius Sulla, who seized control of the city in 82 BC after decades of instability.<br><br>What&#039;s interesting about this event is that he chose not to remain in power for long. By that time it was obvious to nearly everyone that the republlic was broken: loopholes in the system that had been ignored by tradition for centuries (many involving the tribunes of the plebs,) were being blatantly exploited. Society had changed over time so that the people the laws had been based around (citizen farmers) barely existed, and those laws had been changed into functional, but less stable forms, in which some individuals held enough power to threaten the state itself. When Sulla assumed control, he made it his aim to repair these problems: to fix the republic. When he felt he had done all he could, he returned his power to the system, and became a private citizen.<br><br>It didn&#039;t last. Almost 40 years later, Julius Caesar was able to do the same thing. But unlike Sulla, he held no intentions of fixing the republic: he eventually went so far as to say that Sulla&#039;s only mistake had been giving up power.<br><br>I used to abhor this statement. How could anyone harbor disdain for a man who put his country before himself? One should always be dedicated to preserving the freedom of their citizens, and Sulla worked for just that.<br><br>But like all of you, I&#039;ve been observing American politics and history for some time. I don&#039;t think we&#039;re to a breaking point yet, or will be for some time, but I can clearly see the same processes that wore down that republic at work here. The details are different of course, but the trend is the same.","filename":"Sulla","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":335,"tn_w":164,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491748577198,"time":1491748577,"md5":"l\/EZ4nbUojQoJ2eZGaEK+g==","fsize":14501,"resto":0,"id":"8Ue8Wuif","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-dont-know-how-many-of-you-know-your-history-but","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":4,"unique_ips":6},{"no":120288368,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)10:36:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120288307\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120288307<\/a><br>Gradually, the balance of power in the system shifts, and these shifts are nearly impossible to reverse without a popular movement. 200 years ago, power here lay with Congress. Now where is it? I think most people would agree that over the last century or so the executive branch has claimed quite a lot more. So have the courts, who with the doctrine of the &quot;living constitution&quot; regularly are able to change the laws of the country.<br><br>Respect for tradition and for the intended use of the system is also slowly being eroded. This happens through events like the recent senate confirmation fiasco, which makes me disgusted with both parties. I hate that the Republicans have set this precedent for the future, and I hate that both Democrats and Republicans refused to consider the nominee of the others. The supreme court was conceived as an apolitical body. But with their newfound power and public acceptance of their ability to legislate, our lawmakers have no choice but to treat them as politicians like any others.<br><br>I don&#039;t know if any form of state exists which is resistant to this slow wearing away which is eating at us now. Somehow I doubt it, and that&#039;s made me realize that though I love the constitution and the form of government that our forefathers made for us, it is eventually doomed to collapse like all regimes.<br><br>I finally realize what Caesar meant about Sulla. The republic was beyond saving then, and it is beyond saving now. If it degrades enough in our lifetime that one of you is able to take power, don&#039;t bother giving it up. I certainly won&#039;t.<br><br>tl;dr: We&#039;re doomed","filename":"caesar","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491748613364,"time":1491748613,"md5":"zssPLuoOxongnLIoBVr0Zw==","fsize":27988,"resto":120288307,"id":"8Ue8Wuif","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120288798,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)10:41:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;roman republic<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;my history<\/span><br>hahahaha, no","filename":"arminius","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":815,"tn_w":76,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491748884825,"time":1491748884,"md5":"7gTV63MJxMa8+PjqORHdRg==","fsize":94700,"resto":120288307,"id":"P6OomJBf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120288994,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)10:43:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120288798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120288798<\/a><br>Like it or not, they are extremely important to modern society.<br><br>Also fuck off kraut anglos are superior","filename":"fasces","ext":".jpg","w":351,"h":336,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":119,"tim":1491749014777,"time":1491749014,"md5":"B\/iBJtGv7I8O8J7QG1yHwA==","fsize":34121,"resto":120288307,"id":"8Ue8Wuif","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120289178,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)10:45:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120288798\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120288798<\/a><br>What are you talking about you mouth breathing retard<br><a href=\"#p120288307\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120288307<\/a><br>It&#039;s an interesting concept obviously the American system has evolved quite a bit from the days where it did not even have the power to collect tax, I think the real question is whether decline or authoritarianism is the future","time":1491749118,"resto":120288307,"id":"Nq0y+elX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120289395,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)10:47:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120288994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120288994<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Cheruski<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;krauts<\/span><br>hahahaha, no","time":1491749247,"resto":120288307,"id":"P6OomJBf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120290020,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)10:53:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Please send us an Augustus.","filename":"GodKing","ext":".jpg","w":269,"h":269,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491749607170,"time":1491749607,"md5":"Y334MCWRjJEFsqEAi2QH\/A==","fsize":28649,"resto":120288307,"id":"RuYSGcbJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120290084,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)10:54:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120289178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120289178<\/a><br>Could just end up breaking into multiple countries<br><br>Then each one would be governed differently","time":1491749640,"resto":120288307,"id":"bjRbgvy2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120290788,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)11:00:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120288307\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120288307<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;what is resilient to slow degrading of systems<\/span><br>You have come to but a stage of one of the conclusions ie NO SYSTEM IS PERFECT and nor will there ever be one that is of human origin. <br><br>What can you do?

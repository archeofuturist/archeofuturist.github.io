It is a different body; and they have the responsibility to take care of it. End of. They are carrying another body inside of theirs, it is a unique case and people just want to lump it in as something else, they say its just another body &quot;part&quot;, because that is easier and people dont like to think too hard. A lot of people see deeper explanations as far reaching conclusions, and those people are usally plain dumb. As a woman, the baby is what you are responsible for and just because you have to carry that baby, does not mean that you have the right to kill it. Do you have the right to kill an infant? What is the difference between a fetus and an infant? They&#039;re both oblivious, yet still human. One is more grown then the other, but who are you to decide when they become human? Because from what we know thanks to science, the baby is already human from conception. It boggles my mind that people even consider this as okay. It goes to show how far we are falling.<br><br>Sure, if a baby came from rape, then that&#039;s different. Should the law change and allow everyone to kill humans just because a couple of rare cases like this?

Its like 6 bucks get outta here with that cant afford it shit...I don&#039;t wanna pay for abortion through taxes any more than I want to pay for false flags in syria. Take care of your own fucking vagina and be responsible for the life that grows in it. If you want an abortion, pay for it yourself.

That way we can see if it&#039;s an actual effective measure for society that isn&#039;t about whether or not it&#039;s morally right. That being said, people who usually think of abortion aren&#039;t the types that would raise a kid properly in the first place. But then seeing all these fetuses with the cut off timings is very sad. My objective opinion is to keep abortion and have a timeframe that isn&#039;t so fucking mentally damaging. One thing that will fix this is proper sex education that is modern and dealing with stupid people thinking pulling out is ok or for them to acknowledge plan b. For white nationalists, abortion keeps colored people&#039;s populations down.

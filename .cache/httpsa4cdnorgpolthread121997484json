It is a different body; and they have the responsibility to take care of it. End of. They are carrying another body inside of theirs, it is a unique case and people just want to lump it in as something else, they say its just another body &quot;part&quot;, because that is easier and people dont like to think too hard. A lot of people see deeper explanations as far reaching conclusions, and those people are usally plain dumb. As a woman, the baby is what you are responsible for and just because you have to carry that baby, does not mean that you have the right to kill it. Do you have the right to kill an infant? What is the difference between a fetus and an infant? They&#039;re both oblivious, yet still human. One is more grown then the other, but who are you to decide when they become human? Because from what we know thanks to science, the baby is already human from conception. It boggles my mind that people even consider this as okay. It goes to show how far we are falling.<br><br>Sure, if a baby came from rape, then that&#039;s different. Should the law change and allow everyone to kill humans just because a couple of rare cases like this? No.","time":1492697883,"resto":121997484,"id":"twGrD5cZ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121999205,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:24:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121998681\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121998681<\/a><br><br>Well said bongbro <br><br>&quot;Sometimes rape happens so I shouldn&#039;t have to take care of the child I made&quot; -women","time":1492698271,"resto":121997484,"id":"sYUsz0WI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121999317,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:25:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Femanon here<br><br>24 weeks is literally nothing you ignoramus, do you know on average how many weeks until those chunks of cells actually become a human?

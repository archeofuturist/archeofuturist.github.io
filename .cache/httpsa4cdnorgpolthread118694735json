You are essentially exalting parsimony above quality and any semblance of virtue. I can think of two examples where this line of thinking has wreaked havoc: architecture and apparel. Look at the architecture of merely 100 years ago and compare it to today. Look at the clothes people were wearing 100 years ago and look at what they wear today. This is what happens when cost reduction is placed above any other virtue.","time":1490736080,"resto":118694735,"id":"5QW4zA9m","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118698396,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)17:21:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118697144\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118697144<\/a><br>Winnipeg.

Russia<br>funneled Trump more than a billion dollars in loans and loan guarantees<br>through a German bank. Russia bought a house from Trump and vastly<br>overpaid him for it. Russia offered him a stake in an oil company. Russia<br>lured him to Moscow and created blackmail material on him. Putin<br>surrounded Trump with Russian operatives, and co-opted people who were<br>already surrounding him. Russia used a carrot and stick approach in which<br>Trump would find overwhelming success if he played along, and find ruin if<br>he didn\u2019t. The Russian government oversaw every major aspect of Trump\u2019s<br>2016 presidential campaign.

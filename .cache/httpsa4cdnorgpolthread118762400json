If you aren\u2019t up for it, no worries and just ignore this.<br>I know Minecraft is autistic but it\u2019s always a good laugh when fascist goys get together and dominate a competitive server. I\u2019ve found a practically unraidable base and claimed it as our own, but it needs some Nazi d\u00e9cor. <br>We have 13 people so far. Aiming for 20-30. <br>Server IP is mc-central.net, Right click, go to the factions option, Realm 1, Our faction is called \u201cReich\u201d<br>I can\u2019t leave it open so if you need an invite, message me on discord and ill get online to invite you.","filename":"1468200477084","ext":".jpg","w":864,"h":1105,"tn_w":195,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490774243640,"time":1490774243,"md5":"E3l7xecXcrBJcTNVADaHnA==","fsize":234303,"resto":0,"id":"02lIKbTf","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-has-started-an-unironic-minecraft-nazi","country_name":"Canada","replies":9,"images":2,"unique_ips":5},{"no":118762740,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)04:02:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bump<br>Come on goys, we need more members so at any given time we have a decent number of people online","time":1490774544,"resto":118762400,"id":"02lIKbTf","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118762866,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)04:04:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"couple more goys have joined<br><br>Keep it coming lads","time":1490774688,"resto":118762400,"id":"02lIKbTf","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118763040,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)04:07:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"come on \/pol\/ wake up.<br><br>This is my last bump, I don&#039;t want to spam front page if nobody else is interested","time":1490774858,"resto":118762400,"id":"02lIKbTf","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118765080,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)04:37:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"Reminder that gen Z is only redpilled because of their early exposure to the internet and its memes. <br><br>Do your part \/pol\/, show the minecraft normies how strong the Reich really is!

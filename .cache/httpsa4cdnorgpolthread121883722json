We dont want you<br>2. We won&#039;t let you enter<br>3. Naturalization takes 15 years - then we deport you anyway<br>4. No Brazilian company will hire a mudskin like you<br>5. You lack the education to compete with locals<br>6. We will not rent housing to you, you will live on the streets being raped by Bolivians and Peruvians<br>7. Our cost of living is much higher than in your third world country <br>8. We have no welfare for you<br>9. We have no free healthcare for you<br>10. We will not let you build your fake god kike church<br>11. We are either catholic or non-religious, if you are not, you will never be hired or promoted<br><br>If you&#039;re still thinking about emigrating to Brazil, might I suggest Paraguay instead. God bless, and don&#039;t come here. This is mostly addressed towards you ameripoors. You&#039;re not white. You&#039;re niggers on par with roaches, greeks, and arabs, you are not welcome here.:D","filename":"14492563_1285736261459807_1741297301160197073_n","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":766,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":199,"tim":1492630195140,"time":1492630195,"md5":"l6k2ImGJAQgfRxCXxV57Hg==","fsize":107972,"resto":0,"id":"cuUHccDO","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"if-youre-considering-immigrating-to-brazil","country_name":"Brazil","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

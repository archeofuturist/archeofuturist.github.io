We hit up the library and walked around the back to Bryant park. oh yeah, the Trump protest. We stayed to watch and ridicule under our breath and laugh to each other about being deep in enemy territory.<br><br>AT MOST this thing MAY have gathered between 1 and 2 thousand people, many of whom like ourselves were just watchers or trying to get something on video to get facebook likes. The police cordoned off blocks around the park for the march but it wasn&#039;t even necessary. When they finally marched, they didn&#039;t even fill a N-S short block. &#039;THOUSANDS&#039; may have watched to see what was going on, but I&#039;ll bet less than a thousand marched. They didn&#039;t even stretch the width of the Park before they left. <br><br>What was great was that the watchers and bystanders who were gathered up just to see what was going on, were not &#039;into it&#039;- mostly just curious, or even irritated that they couldn&#039;t get to the Whole Foods or just enjoy the park on the first really great weekend. They seemed..tired of it. <br><br>So in the interest of research, we ran up to Times square. 12 TWELVE whole protestors there. We ran down to Battery Park...only 8 Trump protestors doing some kind of anti-trump singalong there. And nobody paying them any attention at either of those locations. NOBODY in front of the trump tower. NOBODY in front of the Trump Building on Wall street. Nobody at the charging bull except tourists. <br><br>It&#039;s dying out.","filename":"dims","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492485243680,"time":1492485243,"md5":"c8PCUjYM57hvB7\/y9ofSZQ==","fsize":205950,"resto":0,"id":"9+KaZJEC","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"tax-march-was-a-nothingburger","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

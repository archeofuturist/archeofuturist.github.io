So in order to do this the government becomes the distributor of wealth and in order to do that they must seize all wealth in order to make a classless society. Then comes the actual distribution which generally comes in universal social welfare programs which drains the wealth and this is not sustainable because there isn&#039;t fresh money coming into the system. Also you then have two things, people who work hard and get all of the same welfare and wealth as everyone else and the people who do nothing and get the same welfare and wealth and in order to prevent the latter the government and people have to force others to work for everything that everyone else is already given by the collective.<br><br>In other words the system itself is totalitarian.<br><br>Capitalism is a system that requires the individual to work for their means of survival (Darwinism, survival of the fittest, is the best analogy to this) anyone can survive on capitalism anyone can make it to the top but in order to do that you have to be willing to put the work into it to do it and most people are too lazy and entitled to do this.<br><br>What we have today is crony capitalism, capitalism that has taken control of the governmental system in order to gain more money and more power, a good example of this would be the many companies that do anything for money like moving to tax shelter companies or hire cheap labor instead of skilled labors and another good example is actually the EU which has mixed crony capitalism entirely with government.<br><br>Capitalism is by far the superior choice between the two but it can be corrupted. I suggest enforcing regulations already in place and putting incorruptible people in charge of auditing and surveying things.","time":1491246450,"resto":119358007,"id":"tPayJIfa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119366015,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)15:07:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119358007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119358007<\/a><br>You should&#039;ve approached the person arguing with him and tell him what we&#039;re all talking about as a way of saying &quot;I&#039;ve got your back.&quot; Developing power in numbers, you could in theory turn the whole class against your Marxist teacher.<br><br>This is the problem with us Millenials and Gen Z&#039;ers.

It doesn&#039;t matter which model you take. It is important, however, to have government understand it is not some deified thing; it is a simple institution, on earth to serve simple man. In those cases of the deaths of &#039;millions&#039;, I would ask for sources and actual numbers.

All faithful Christians are called to the nearest Church to get armed and blessed. The goal is to re-instate the Cross in Europe, to re-take Constantinople and to re-take Jerusalem, in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen.<br><br>Now, what would actually happen? To be honest, I think the Christian army would be much bigger than we actually think, since not only Catholics, but every man who is fed up with the state of the world would probably join, either to reduce Muslim and Jewish influence to nil or maybe just to have his sins forgiven.<br><br>But that&#039;s not what I&#039;m talking about. How would the governments react? I think they would label Christianity as dangerous terror organization and send police, military and anything they have against them. We would be looking, in best case, at a massive civil war before the crusaders even leave Europe. Probably mass jailings and mass killings in broad daylight. Just imagine being Merkel, Hollande or that London mayor and suddenly, you have hundreds of thousands of your arch enemies directly under your nose. <br><br>Makes sense? Not that I think Francis would ever call for a crusade, the guy is either a masterful actor and manipulator or the reddest, communistic piece of heretic filth I ever heard of. But even if he wanted to, he couldn&#039;t.","filename":"ad maiorem dei gloriam","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492772310006,"time":1492772310,"md5":"p5LgvGDPcEAYg82wF1fymA==","fsize":176665,"resto":0,"id":"9BQPsmGG","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"could-the-pope-actually-call-a-crusade","country_name":"Germany","replies":30,"images":5,"unique_ips":23},{"no":122123827,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)07:00:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"The vatican has been jewish owned for a long time.

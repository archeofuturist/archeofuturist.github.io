To be honest on one hand the missile&#039;s didn&#039;t hit any soldiers or even hardware just ground around the base. The Russians were warned before the missiles hit. No Russians hurt. On the other hand Trump blatantly violated his promise about not getting involved in the middle east and took action against Assad only because of some dead baby pictures that were used to emotionally manipulate him. The gas attack was probably staged and not done by assad. He ruined relations with the Russians and pissed off almost everybody in his voter base except for the neocons. Not only has he made relection a near impossibility now, he has to go through with his other promises and never ever fuck up again to gain his support back. This couldn&#039;t have been Trump&#039;s decision, and was most likely due to pressure or manipulation from neocons. If it was all him he&#039;s a fucking retard and deserves to be ruined. If not then he&#039;s a coward and we have a fucking sitting duck in the white house who will do the deep state&#039;s bidding. He could also have done this just as a dirty favor to neocons so he could get shit passed with their help. I don&#039;t like the sound of that but its one possibility. Another is that he did it to get the Russian plant shit off his back for good, but it would be a fucking stupid way to do it, spending all the resources and money, risking ruining relations with Russia, and losing whatever support he had. It wouldn&#039;t make sense. The anger mostly comes from Trump breaking his promise and bending to neocon will. Nobody wants another warhawk or military involvement in the middle east. I myself do not support this, though I&#039;m waiting for more information and Trump&#039;s next move. I&#039;m no longer a hard line supporter though and most people are actually dropping support entirely.","time":1491672875,"resto":120156005,"id":"602vN0TH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120157351,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:34:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120156895\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120156895<\/a><br>They&#039;re not blameless in this though, (((Spencer))) also has a hand in organizing this &quot;Official WTF I Hate Trump Now Alt-Right\u00ae\u00a9 Protest&quot;","time":1491672893,"resto":120156005,"id":"SIUMuwN8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120157879,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:39:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120157318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120157318<\/a><br>This<br>Im hoping he just did this to satisfy the neocons and libs for the time being","time":1491673153,"resto":120156005,"id":"wQHsJVxq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120158126,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:41:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"You got played.

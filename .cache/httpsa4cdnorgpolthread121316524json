Around 60% of our calls are EMS (Emergency Medical Services). Of that remaining 30%, 15% are false alarms (seems like a lot more), 10% are MVAs, and the remaining 5% are fire related. That 5% is usually very serious stuff such as CO or actual fires. While much of the materials used in building today are fire resistant, when they catch they burn through really fast. This combined with all the chemicals now used today make fighting actual fires more dangerous than it has been in the past. So in short we are still very active, ambulance crews don&#039;t have the equipment or training to do an auto extraction, police can&#039;t fight fires, and as population increases, so will the amount of alarms.

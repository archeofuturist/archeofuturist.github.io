When someone is in a firmly held mindset, it takes a significant earth shattering experience for them to be open to changing it, in pursuit of an explanation. There are certain levels of mindset which can or cannot be worked with. For example, my ex girlfriend was pretty feminist\/lefty, but figured I could try to push in the right direction. I&#039;m a pretty attractive and confident guy, also physically dominant, so I figured she would be willing to follow my lead. Now she did in many respects, but her internal worldview was something that could not be artificially changed. When I mentioned Jordan Peterson and the debacle in Canada of misgendering someone being a hate crime, she said &quot;good&quot;. I pushed back when she said that, but I think I knew at that point that it wouldn&#039;t work out. I gave her three chances to adjust herself to a more reasonable\/open perspective, of even allowing her worldview to be challenged, and I moved on when I saw it was futile.<br><br>My current girlfriend was somewhat basic but her father was a military man, and she spent some of her childhood in Europe because her father was stationed there, so she didn&#039;t get some of the America ((early education)). She was also fat before I met her, so a fair amount of her only friends were outcasts. She thinks the non binary gender stuff is literally mental illness, and also thinks my racial jokes are hilarious. We rip on people she tells about about, who she used to know. Like some girl who identified as like a part werewolf, part vampire, part demon. <br><br>I&#039;m very good in verbal situations, and am pretty smart, so when I went on &quot;rants&quot; she would really listen like &quot;wow&quot; because she looks up to me and sees me as very smart. she actually said she thinks I should try to be president, kek. I started with babby tier redpills and built upward.

I showed her Yuri Bezmenov to help explain what happened to universities and why these kids are frothing at the mouth and violent. she was amazed and was like &quot;oh my gosh that makes so much sense&quot;. she&#039;s coming along great. seriously hope to wife this woman, she wants many babies.<br><br>So basically, tl;dr, find someone with a decent foundation you can build on. take the redpilling slowly, and don&#039;t force it. wait for something real that shocks them, and use the opportunity to provide an explanation in the form of redpills. a worldview cannot be changed until the pre-existing one is internally called into question.<br><br>Redpilling women is SO important. it should be a focus for people in our &quot;movement&quot;, or whatever you want to call it","time":1493260517,"resto":122979553,"id":"Syl6BdOq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122982111,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)22:38:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122979553\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122979553<\/a><br>Impregnate as many as possible.

But this is patently not true, in practice. The legislature is the most democratic branch of government --- at periodic intervals, it is possible to vote out elected representatives. To a lesser degree, the same is true for the executive branch --- you can vote in a new party and a new leader every four years and leave it to them to staff the executive with party members who hold a different ideology than the previous office holder.<br><br>But this is not true for the judiciary, especially the federal judiciary. Federal judges are unelected and they serve lifetime appointments. They can be there for decades and unless they do something really egregious, like commit a crime, no amount of dissatisfaction with their rulings can permit the voters to remove them. We&#039;re told this is a system of equal checks and balances, but any ideology that captures the judiciary will have a stronger and longer-lasting hold on the US government, even if the other branches belong to different ideologies. <br><br>A strong executive state like Turkey, on the other hand, makes the power of the ideology chosen by voters crystal clear and not subject to subversion by unelected representatives. And in an age where CNN has the power to goad Congressmen and Senators into wartime belligerence by airing pictures of dead Syrian children everywhere, why would you not envy Erdogan&#039;s ombudsman powers over the Turkish press? They can&#039;t set his agenda or force him to deviate from what his voters want, because he sets their agenda.<br><br>The Turks and the Chinese have the ideal system of government. Americans and Europeans are too attached to the heritage of their legal traditions to realize how it is being weaponized against them.","filename":"1039448881","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":541,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":135,"tim":1493158918284,"time":1493158918,"md5":"5rM17hENr\/JVTQgA6f5P2w==","fsize":88533,"resto":0,"id":"FSznlVZQ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-do-we-criticize-turkey-for-authoritarianism","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

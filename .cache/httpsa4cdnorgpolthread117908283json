Banks do this generally for mortgages with LTV&#039;s of more than 80%. These mortgages are typically known as subprime-- yes, subprime-- because they are considered risky without CMHC insurance. If you put 20%+ down, the bank generally considers it a prime mortgage and doesn&#039;t require insurance since they have a 20%+ buffer.<br><br>In Canada, the Canadian Mortgage Housing Corporation, aka the CMHC, provides this insurance. The CMHC is backstopped by the federal government, so if it goes bankrupt, the Canadian taxpayer pays for any losses and the banks can sue the federal government if they don&#039;t pay up.<br><br>The CMHC is like Freddie Mac(Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation)\/Ginnie Mae (Government National Mortgage Association) in the USA. The reason behind the US housing crash was anyone with a pulse could get a mortgage-- the thrifts (local banks) would make the loan, then sell it off to an investment bank (Goldman\/Morgan\/etc) and we&#039;d make fancy ass derivatives out of them called CDOs, collateralized debt obligations. They were bonds, but with different &quot;slices&quot;-- A, B, C, D, etc, based on the level of risk. If there were defaults the lowest tranche would eat the losses first. These CDO&#039;s consisted of thousands of mortgages each, and we&#039;d take them and work our magic and get them rated AAA\/AA+ as a whole and the value of them would soar, then they&#039;d be sold off to &quot;conservative&quot; investors at a discount. Demand was huge for them, so thrifts were eager to make these loans because the (((Wall St))) banks would buy them off them instantly for a profit.","filename":"1489956875783","ext":".gif","w":345,"h":258,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490278030979,"time":1490278030,"md5":"cpzw3eAmIn\/grRCJ9KkR1g==","fsize":2637671,"resto":117908283,"id":"m0CR0Fz7","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117934333,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)10:07:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117933681\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117933681<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;is increasing amounts of political chaos until hyperinflation happens<\/span><br><br>or this increase in political chaos leads to right wing nationalistic anti immigration parties that stop the inflow in millionaire chinks (and russians) who are the ones responsible for the trippling of our house prices<br><br>also remember some of us arnt mad about this<br><br>those of us that bought at 500k and sold for 1.5 have made a million dollars out of nothing. we are happy<br><br>its the young generations that are pissed, but guess what its you faggots that vote liberal and want muh iphone more than muh future generation of humanity so you cucks are a huge driving force behind whats creating this &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;bubble&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;<wbr>&quot;&quot;&quot;<br><br>its not going anywhere, its not going to pop. i actually think house prices will continue to climb in toronto","time":1490278039,"resto":117908283,"id":"lQ2gKroF","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117934528,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)10:09:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117910424\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117910424<\/a><br>Funny that only rural and suburban idiots had the intelligence to buy something they could afford.","time":1490278158,"resto":117908283,"id":"FADqs9wb","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117935018,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)10:14:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117934333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117934333<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;those of us that bought at 500k and sold for 1.5 have made a million dollars out of nothing. we are happy<\/span><br><br>In order to realize your profits you have to move somewhere cheaper though, because if you want to stay, you have to buy right back into the same high priced area.<br><br>But if you&#039;re willing to fuck off to flyoverland, that is a viable strategy.","time":1490278449,"resto":117908283,"id":"RxkL1mZB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117935222,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)10:16:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117934321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117934321<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the bank (actually you pay for it) buys default insurance<\/span><br>the bank doesnt pay shit, you have to buy it directly and it costs around $10k. its literally you that purchases it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The CMHC is like Freddie Mac(Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation)\/Ginnie Mae (Government National Mortgage Association) in the USA.

As this bubble began to form, the government wanted to appease the populace for muh votes, so extended amortizations to 50 years and reduced down payments to $0 with some banks even PAYING people (ie. loaning money to them and amortizing it) because the CMHC covered virtually all the risk. That was around 2008, and when the US bubble crashed, Canada was actually bankrupt. This is a very well hush hush secret. You see, the banks were all bankrupt on paper if the books were marked-to-market. The CMHC would have been wiped out and the Canadian tax payers would be on the hook. So to avoid the outrage, Harper tabled a bill that secretly bought all of these mortgages ($120B at the time) and everyone was magically liquid again on paper- in addition the banks\/CMHC didn&#039;t have to liquidate all these houses.

Its not often that you get the child who dreams about being a teacher. If so its probably a woman and directed towards younger education. The type of person it takes to want to teach adolescent age kids is not what you typically think... same way alot of bullied kids end up cops or positions of power. Most of the teachers\/professors pursued there careers in that field and got burnt. One of the best examples is most likely your high school or college &quot;art&quot; teacher. Unless you really kissed ass in art you probably noticed your art teacher had a really &quot;sour&quot; personality. Art is the peak of opinion and popularity. They dreamed of being an artist and having the world apreciate their style and work (them). But in art people either love your work and your famous or they tell you your shit stinks. Thus the only real fallback is being an art teacher. Where you can force your style of art on kids and their forced to apreciate it. <br>This goes for all fields. Its just that theres really no place for a failed artist to go other then teacher. I had 2 teachers in highschool that were amazing and loved teaching. English teacher (hardcore right wing) he tought no english and all moral and meaning of life. No one disliked him. The other was a schycology teacher.

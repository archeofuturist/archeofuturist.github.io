Such circumstances are likely to arise if the terms of the agreement leave one party in a &quot;predicament of real need&quot; on the assumption that the parties cannot have intended that when the agreement was signed (at paragraph 81). This is so even where the pre-nuptial agreement has been meticulously prepared and otherwise meets all the criteria for fairness expounded in Radmacher.<\/span><br><br>Theoretically they should be powerful, but since they are not actually binding and courts still use their jurisdictional discretion to override them because most judges are over 50 and still beholden to the old ideal that a man should not abandon his wife and child and should fork out either half of his assets or years of maintenance payments, they are pretty much useless.","time":1493070313,"resto":122641848,"id":"HLwAYu4\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122642884,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)17:45:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122642232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122642232<\/a><br>US judges aren&#039;t allowed to claim on assets you owned *before* marrying your leech AFAIK.<br><br>Here, they can, and do.","time":1493070316,"resto":122641848,"id":"s1mjJJS1","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122642953,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)17:45:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122641848\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122641848<\/a><br>NEVER get married.

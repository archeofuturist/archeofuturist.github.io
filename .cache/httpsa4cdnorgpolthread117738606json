Liked the bit about Trump, though. Libcucks most likely took everything seriously as an insult to Trump but I got a different message. Kind of like what he said about Bill Cosby that he does more good than he rapes.","time":1490173659,"resto":117738606,"id":"Wl8MEGt7","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":117741343,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)05:11:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117741139\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117741139<\/a><br>What did he say about Trump?","time":1490173889,"resto":117738606,"id":"AWmmIW96","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117741357,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)05:11:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"From what I had seen from Dave prior to this,(post trump election) I was sure I&#039;d hate it, and think that dave lost his touch.<br><br>however I was surprised and still liked it, it felt cozy and warm. Very comfy to watch him return to his craft. It wasn&#039;t very funny, but nostalgic, and he didn&#039;t turn into what I thought he did by some of his recent interviews\/statements. I think that he&#039;s intelligent and semi-redpilled despite his political alignment.","time":1490173904,"resto":117738606,"id":"1WQ7PuhK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117741627,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)05:16:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117741343\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117741343<\/a><br>nothing<br><br>there is not a single joke in this about trump","time":1490174166,"resto":117738606,"id":"75FDNxBR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117741721,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)05:17:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"&quot;you ever tried to have a suffering contest with a Jewish person?&quot;","time":1490174255,"resto":117738606,"id":"B\/aRauw9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117741800,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)05:18:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117739706\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117739706<\/a><br><br>fpbp<br><br>They removed the real Dave","time":1490174331,"resto":117738606,"id":"BxprSMlR","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117742437,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)05:30:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117738606\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117738606<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muslim<\/span><br><br>While you&#039;re laughing at him being chill, he&#039;s normalising that cancerous plague on the species<br><br>Dropped","time":1490175049,"resto":117738606,"id":"f8HI1ofJ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

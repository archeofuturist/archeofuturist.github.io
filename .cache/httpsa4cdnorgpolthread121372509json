On festival stages, in club lineups, in positions of power as defined by influence over what people listen to and how much money can be made, women are in the extreme minority. Other than providing some publications occasional opportunities to publish inoffensive lists of &quot;must-hear&quot; female DJs &quot;you need to know,&quot; this gender imbalance does nothing positive for the culture.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Further, the fact that brown and black women are seen as objects fit for consumption of straight white male gaze, and with rare exception, not suitable for a spot behind the decks on a festival main stage is problematic and indicative of the huge gap between mainstream dance music&#039;s ethos of acceptance and its new reality of exclusivity.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt; &gt;Of the 24 DJ headliners at Ultra this coming weekend, none are women. Only five would likely identify as people of color. None are openly gay. If they were alive today, what would Larry Levan and Frankie Knuckles have to say about the co-opting of their music and their counter-culture by a demographic that already runs the world?<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/thump.vice.com\/en_us\/articl<wbr>e\/edm-doesnt-have-a-women-problem-i<wbr>t-has-a-straight-white-guy-problem<br><br>Here we go again.","filename":"dj","ext":".gif","w":452,"h":257,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":142,"tim":1492357952435,"time":1492357952,"md5":"w6a2royLFp9hok3XGzgQxQ==","fsize":2914823,"resto":0,"id":"6jxdWsoj","country":"FI","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"edm-doesnt-have-a-women-problem-it-has-a-straight","country_name":"Finland","replies":23,"images":3,"unique_ips":20},{"no":121372716,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)11:54:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121372509\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121372509<\/a><br>Not surprising at all.

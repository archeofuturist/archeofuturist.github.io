Fegelein and the Russian general <br>Our comrade Fegelein once captured a Russian general like that. Look, they&#039;re cheap. They&#039;re Slavs. Full of humour, as Fegelein is, Fegelein told his staff: &quot;We&#039;ll treat this one real good. We&#039;ll act like we&#039;re going to recognize him as a General. So, when he comes in, stand up, stand at attention, keep quiet, say &#039;General Sir, this&#039; and &#039;General Sir, that&#039;, show him how much respect you have for him&quot;. Of course, this worked. You don&#039;t need to give a Russian general any political ideas, political ideals, or political plans for the future. You can get them cheaper than that, gentlemen. The Slavs are known for that. <br><br>The Slav is never able to build anything himself. In the long run, he&#039;s not capable of it. I&#039;ll come back to this later. With the exception of a few phenomena produced by Asia every couple of centuries, through that mixture of two heredities which may be fortunate for Asia but is unfortunate for us Europeans -- with the exception, therefore, of an Attila, a Genghis Khan, a Tamerlaine, a Lenin, a Stalin -- the mixed race of the Slavs is based on a sub-race with a few drops of blood of our blood, blood of a leading race; the Slav is unable to control himself and create order. He is able to argue, able to debate, able to disintegrate, able to offer resistance against every authority and to revolt. But these human shoddy goods are just as incapable of maintaining order today as they were 700 or 800 years ago, when they called in the Varangians, when they called in the Ruriks .","filename":"nazi pedophile","ext":".jpg","w":472,"h":785,"tn_w":75,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491182793983,"time":1491182793,"md5":"d6g5Flw8Xf5Lhesu69N76w==","fsize":50946,"resto":119257657,"id":"6R9LAtHG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119273492,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:26:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119273365\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119273365<\/a><br>Oh.

Our Fegelein treated his general that way, and his general told us everything that such a brave, courageous commander really shouldn&#039;t ever tell at all, everything from his battery positions to his divisional marching plans and orders (he had a whole offensive army). He gave us everything ripe for the slaughter. It was clear in his mind that after all his blabbering -- he was never asked anything directly, not with a single word -- that he really couldn&#039;t go back to Little Father Stalin, even though he wore the Order of Stalin number seven hundred and something, a sort of Great Knight&#039;s Cross from over there, which he then gave Fegelein as a gift.

That applies to the Czechs and Slovenes, to whom, after all, we brought their national feeling.

When four Russians get together, with little father, little mother, and their little children, not one of the 4 or 5 knows who is betraying whom at the moment: which one is the informer betraying the father now: is it the mother, or the daughter? And who, in return, is betraying them? In doubtful cases there may be two, even three, informers in this family. I am not exaggerating. This remark is entirely accurate with regards to the city. In the countryside, our comrades who have been over there in the East can confirm that there are still 20 or 30 NKVD informers and agents in every village, even after the withdrawal of the Bolsheviks. This ensures, to an absolute certainty, that no conspiracy can get started, because everything will still be reported to the top by means of this informer apparatus.

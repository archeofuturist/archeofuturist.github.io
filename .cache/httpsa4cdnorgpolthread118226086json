UK could never conquer these rivals, so it played a &#039;balance of power&#039; game - helping the enemies of its enemy so that no one great power could ever control the entire european continent.

It needed these allies to be strong so USSR could be contained, but these allies have no energy soruces of their own, so oil must be imported from Middle east to these allies. Most oil is in persian gulf. KSA is a bunch of camel fuckers and couldn&#039;t defend their oil. USSR starts looking for allies in ME to try to stop flow of oil. US builds up Iran to be the &#039;policeman&#039; of ME for US. But then Iran flips in 1979 to be &#039;independant&#039;. Holy shit!!! US supports Iraq to invade Iran. Doesnt work - Iran winning that war. US shoots down Iran commerical aircraft - says&#039; You make peace with iraq&#039;. But even with limited weapons, Iran is most powerful country in the world. Why? Because Iran can put sea-mines near Hormuz and block ALL of the oil the Japan, Korea, Germany, Italy, etc need. US has two carrier battle groups there all the time to stop Iran from doing this.

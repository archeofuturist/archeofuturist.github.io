Hippies who lived in a commune and compost their own turds are counter-culture. Beatniks who hitchhike for a living and eat heroin for breakfast are counter-culture.<br><br>People who live highly conventional lifestyle but have slightly off-kilter political opinions are not counter-culture. Dressing a bit weird and listening to rock music is a subculture. <br><br>Is conservatism the new punk? Not really, the ideology falls quite comfortably within mainstream beliefs and real punk is about being anti-establishment and politically incorrect. Most alt-righters are as about politically correct as you can get.","time":1490650176,"resto":118562489,"id":"ecv0\/6Su","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

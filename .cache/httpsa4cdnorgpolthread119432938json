We were a glorious melting pot of Western European cultures. <br><br>We left behind some of our cultural quirks so it became difficult to tell which of the various Western European cultures our friends, neighbors and coworkers came from. So it would be common to ask. &quot;where are your from?&quot; A reply might be: &quot;i&#039;m Irish.&quot; <br><br>After all leaving behind some elements of our cultures meant that being of German descent no longer meant spending all your time burning books and destroying Europe. <br><br>Same could be said for the Irish, It no longer meant illiterate dirty gingers without shoes, sucking on a potato. <br><br>As for knowing whether an acquaintance was Brazilian or not, that&#039;s always been easy. If they look like a mix of a monkey and and a low IQ African, that&#039;s a Brazilian. No need to ask, and watch your wallet.","time":1491282394,"resto":119432938,"id":"SxG9GHfY","country":"VN","country_name":"Vietnam"}]}

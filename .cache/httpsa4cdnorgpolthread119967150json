As of know, it&#039;s impossible to know who did it. <br><br>But the media is running with &quot;assad is the next hitler, muh childrens, think of the children goy, we need to go to war with syria.&quot; And neo-cons are hopping on board with this, demanding Trump do something. And, unfortunately, many Americans on both sides have fallen for this. I&#039;d wager most Americans support intervention, which is a shame. But as that is the case, if Trump does nothing, the establishment attacks him even more, it makes the non-existant &quot;Russian connections&quot; look real, and loses him the support of many Americans, which is something he can&#039;t have.<br><br>On the other side, we have assad, who&#039;s trying to stop terrorists from overtaking his country, Russia supporting him, and most of Trump&#039;s international &quot;colleagues&quot; (farage, le pen, etc.) and early supporters (\/pol\/, alex jones, some of the &quot;alt-right&quot;, etc.) saying it was a falseflag, and we shouldn&#039;t do anything over it. And frankly, they have a point: action in Syria only gives the Russians an excuse to start world war 3, loses trump the support of his base, makes him look like a liar and only helps isis.<br><br>So what is Trump to do? If he does nothing, he&#039;ll be condemned, if he acts, he&#039;ll be damned.<br>Frankly, he did the best he could. He acted, but he warned the russians ahead of time, and nobody was killed. <br><br>It&#039;s not a perfect situation, but really, what would you do \/pol\/?

And seems to me like the liberal intelligentsia reject western\/christian values mostly out of pure pigheadedness at this point. It&#039;s all &quot;problematic&quot;. They try to come up with their own value system but they can only agree on the lowest common denominator. Social justice is very simplistic thinking, but they try to justify it at length with postmodern nonsense. They &quot;deconstruct&quot; everything in this way and try to come up with an ideology that is immune to it.<br><br>And yeah I think there&#039;s a spiritual void. People cling to remnants of christian spirituality without even realizing it. As much as they hate it, it&#039;s mostly their values. Those that make any sense anyway. I think it&#039;s more important than I realized. People need a spiritual system of sorts or they start trying to fill the void however they can.<br><br>Like some pointed out, social media replaces it a bit. It&#039;s not god watching and judging you, it&#039;s everyone else. People voluntarily expose their whole lives to judgement this way. Not just people, algorithms too. I think future forms of social control will be based on (semi voluntary) mass surveillance and AI, not culture.","time":1491634533,"resto":120098510,"id":"kn197cts","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120101395,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)02:56:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Militant athiesm is a cancer designed by marxist jews to destroy western civilization.

He uses the example of a child for extra emotional impact. <br>There are a few arguments against this. <br>1. Earth is not heaven, we cannot be free of all suffering, the point in life is to suffer and struggle, only through this can we learn to help one another. Pain and suffering are not bad, they are tests not only of those going through pain but of everyone else and how we react to it. <br>2. The book of Job deals greatly with why God lets us suffer. In the book, the titular character has many monologues in which he is found expressing feelings of nihilism, anger towards God, etc. The kind of stuff most people feel on a day to day basis. The book ends with a vision from God. It espouses that the universe is far more complex than man can ever begin to comprehend. We will never understand why God would do the things that he does, certainly to us they may seem wrong, but ultimately we will never understand the sheer scale of the universe and why everything happens. <br>3.

Harris makes the mistake of jusging God by the lense of the same culture which took from the world which was shaped by Christianity and then says &quot;we made all this by ourselves!&quot;.

He is comparing also Islam to Christianity, apples and oranges (and no, killing in the name of God is not a good thing, it is an extreme tool and can be used only in a situation in which you must protect the weak or your own kin). Also the joke about the holy Host and th lack of miracles: there are still miracles happening here and there, and there&#039;s a well documented miracle about a &quot;cracker&quot; for the mass that tuned into blood and flesh. <br>Jesus opened a door, then it&#039;s up to us to walk into it, God never force us to save ourselves because He leaves us free.<br><br>He makes also the foolish mistake to say that Christianity is the same as the cults of the pagans who buried children alive.","time":1491644191,"resto":120098510,"id":"Lqq8U3I9","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120114758,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:09:32","name":"foxfire","com":"<a href=\"#p120098510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120098510<\/a><br>definately an atheist it has noting to do with my political affiliation I was simpley born atheist when I saw religion latr in life I knew it was fucked up shit. suck my dick indeed god and while youre at it ream my ass","time":1491646172,"resto":120098510,"id":"cjVy8dCd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120117737,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:50:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"agnostic master race","time":1491648612,"resto":120098510,"id":"zFSWbDVE","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120118174,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:56:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120098510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120098510<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I fear that anti-religious sentiments are contributing to the fall of western civilization.<\/span><br>Grow up, you fuckwitted manchild.

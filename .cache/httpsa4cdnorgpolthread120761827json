The earliest signs of the culture were found at Kozarnika, Bulgaria. One of the earliest artifacts is found in eastern Crimea (Buran-Kaya) (see Crimean Mountains) dated 32,000 years ago.

That makes us understand the connection between human mind and the infinite sky- anything we will think or want, we want\/ask from the sky. In hindi, the word &quot;cer&quot;(sky) is also translated as &quot;akasa&quot; ( like the romanian &quot;acasa&quot; which means &quot;at home&quot;). That can be explained. The people from our land, Tracia, gave the information to the hindi people that &quot;the sky is at home&quot; because we came from the sky and the hindis called their sky- &quot;akasa&quot;.

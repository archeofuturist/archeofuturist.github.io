Although our country was ruined several times during the 20th century, no motherfucker can get rid of us.<br>- Our men are handsome and tough fighters.<br>- Our beaches are great, our sun is heavenly.<br>- We have a great shipping industry (even though most of it is under foreign flags for tax reasons). Greeks are more or less the best crew a ship can wish for (not cheap though).<br>- We &#039;re great at some sports, like basketball.<br>- Our dads and moms are the greatest people in the world. Family means something here.<br>- Hitler wanted us, Churchill wanted us, Stalin wanted us.<br><br>I may be forgetting some reasons, but I think you get tthe idea.","time":1492027068,"resto":120795432,"id":"qPPqOSvc","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":120799366,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)15:58:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"And my personal favorite:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Byzantines had their Emperor Nikephoros killed in a battle vs the Bulgarian Emperor Krum<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bulgarian Emperor makes a silver lined cup out of Nikephoros&#039; skull and uses it to drink wine<\/span><br><br>When will the Byzantine embarrassment end?","filename":"Krum_Bulgaria","ext":".png","w":413,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1492027083189,"time":1492027083,"md5":"YibnqBGtpCyckl4eLaattw==","fsize":437258,"resto":120795432,"id":"C\/nKtyrZ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120799408,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)15:58:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120795432\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120795432<\/a><br>and the greatest ancient philosopher was a Macedonian who retards in Athens didn&#039;t like and throw him out of the city after Alexander the Great&#039;s death.

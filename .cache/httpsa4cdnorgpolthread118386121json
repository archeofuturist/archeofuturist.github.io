I won&#039;t be a dropout working a dead-end job forever!&quot; \u2013 these thoughts are getting old. It&#039;s been over a year. I&#039;m fatigued. The effort involved in changing my life for the better is too much. I&#039;m exhausted.<br><br>The wageslave life of working to pay rent, and paying rent to live in a place so you can work. Working to drive a car and driving a car so you can work. The circular insanity has become my reality at this point. I am slowly losing the will to resist it. I am slowly accepting this is &quot;just the way it is&quot;. Like a broken record, year after year of the same Groundhog Day life on repeat, leading to nothing.<br><br>Wageslave - this is what I am, this is my lot in life - another unfulfilled, disposable statistic on some richfag CEO&#039;s productivity spreadsheet, easily replaced, easily discarded.<br><br>I think about this and I feel nothing. That&#039;s how I know the transformation has happened. No regret. No sadness. Total apathy.<br><br>I will probably kill myself on a monday morning, not today, but someday not too far in the future.","filename":"1488919594909","ext":".jpg","w":482,"h":427,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":221,"tim":1490548966837,"time":1490548966,"md5":"UG+qJkOJUrvfGSD6SFrcnQ==","fsize":37289,"resto":0,"id":"oURvtSS0","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"my-dreams-are-fading-fast-this-is-just-temporary","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118386255,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)13:23:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"this isn&#039;t \/r9k\/ or \/adv\/ you fucking retard<br><br>get your blogpost out of here","time":1490549027,"resto":118386121,"id":"PWse584T","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118386556,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)13:26:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118386121\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118386121<\/a><br>Not all of us get to lead epic lives like on TV.<br><br>But you are important to someone.

If you can remotely disable a gun by not having a watch nearby it means that it is not farfetched to believe you can disable a gun by another means, like by jamming the signal.<br>2. In a situation where I would need to use my gun I rather have the option to giving my gun or any other gun I have to a friendly than to fear having my weapons taken to an enemy.<br>3. It makes it unnecessarily harder and expensive to buy\/sell firearms. This might not be a major problem in the USA, but if something like this exist there someone here would have the idea of putting it to use, meaning the already months long process of buying a gun turns into double that time, as the gun would need to be modified once again and inspected once again.<br>4. Needing a modification in the gun after it has been made means that if the company making these modifications, for any reason, gets impeded to make them, guns become useless (like, by instance, some investigation is happening and some libtard judge orders the company to stop working with this for the time being) and that you can control the use of them with much more ease.<br>5. Some device like that do not work with any kind of gun. An old 1960 revolver wouldn&#039;t never fit in this mechanism.<br>6. If you somehow have a damaged unlocking device or lack of batteries in any of the sides or similar failure that might or not be out of user control (the threshold of a perfectly working battery in a garage remote control and for one needing to be exchanged and will make you need to press the button for longer\/twice is not visible until you need to use it).<br>7. There are more guns in USA than people. The ones that do not plan to use smart guns will have enough options of guns without smart guns to use because, even though libtards pretend otherwise, people who do not want to use guns with unlockers will keep using guns without unlockers because criminals do not follow the law (that is why they are called criminals, you know).","time":1493820546,"resto":123905537,"id":"Vp+ZIBA6","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":123915367,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)10:09:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123906321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123906321<\/a><br>The poos on the street are fermenting into jenkem, he&#039;s high as fuck","time":1493820553,"resto":123905537,"id":"tdkLONBI","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123915510,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)10:11:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123915327\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123915327<\/a><br>how would an eyeball help with a fingerprint reader","time":1493820661,"resto":123905537,"id":"ahFbbhF2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123915524,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)10:11:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123909978\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123909978<\/a><br>Kek","time":1493820673,"resto":123905537,"id":"hAun7SZ7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123915663,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)10:12:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123905537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123905537<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;be OP with smart lock on firearm<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;need it for self defense<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;your security device&#039;s battery has run out<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;get shot<\/span>","time":1493820777,"resto":123905537,"id":"rwHE0D2v","country":"MC","country_name":"Monaco"},{"no":123915750,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)10:14:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123915510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123915510<\/a><br><br>all biometric readers can be defeated is all im saying. fingerprint is even easier, just couldnt think of a good movie still off top of my head.","time":1493820846,"resto":123905537,"id":"wwWDGaZ5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123915766,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)10:14:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;every law abiding gun owner has this extra fuckery with his weapon adding complexity and expense<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;criminal uses a regular one from the black market anyway<\/span>","time":1493820853,"resto":123905537,"id":"tdkLONBI","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123915840,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)10:14:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123905537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123905537<\/a><br><br>Safety.

Politically this is something that would never pass. The people that want gun rights aren&#039;t interested in this and the people that aren&#039;t interested are the same ones that are already pro-gun control. You are fighting one more front over the same problem that you keep losing instead of tackling more important issues like the problems of mental health and gang warfare. <br>9. Even disregarding the issue of mechanical failure in the unlocking &quot;smart&quot; device, fact is that some thing like that could only be done by private companies and thus will be built in different quality and practices. A &quot;smart&quot; device that, by instance, simply is a chip that recognizes the watch used by an owner once, then just stops working forever, is still a &quot;smart&quot; device by law and did absolutely nothing.","time":1493821134,"resto":123905537,"id":"Vp+ZIBA6","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":123916240,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)10:19:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s not the nra guys committing crimes with guns.......","time":1493821188,"resto":123905537,"id":"woA3lXyF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123916319,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)10:20:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123905537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123905537<\/a><br>Because fuck you","time":1493821237,"resto":123905537,"id":"7ggSbsiD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123916406,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)10:21:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123905537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123905537<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;wanting a firearm that depends on two electronic devices with two batteries functioning correctly and communicating correctly when you need them to<\/span><br>I can&#039;t even connect my camera to my phone properly like it&#039;s supposed to because Canon sucks balls at software development","time":1493821305,"resto":123905537,"id":"Aa\/Cgi67","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":123916429,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)10:22:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123905638\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123905638<\/a><br>Actually, the smart gun would be too simple to hack.

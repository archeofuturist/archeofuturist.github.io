I think it&#039;s to do with last year&#039;s spike in traffic. A lot have come here thinking it&#039;s solely a Trump board and now they&#039;re defending his every action, no matter what, even as he flip flops. These posters don&#039;t seem to have any kind of principles. I&#039;d imagine there&#039;s a huge overlap between them and the &quot;god emperor&quot;, &quot;kekistan&quot; posters.","time":1491835993,"resto":120444385,"id":"xymGY\/aI","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

As a result, the hip hop genre, barely known outside the Bronx at the time, grew at an astounding rate from 1977 onward. Three decades later, Grandmaster Caz recalled for a Slate article and podcast that, when the power went out, he and his partner DJ Disco Wiz were playing records, running their equipment from an outlet in a park. At first they thought the outage was local and caused by something they had done, but realized when they heard stores closing that it was citywide. He took advantage of the widespread looting in their part of the Bronx to get a mixing board, as did other aspiring rappers and DJs. &quot;After the blackout, all this new wealth \u2026 was found by people and they just\u2014opportunity sprang from that,&quot; he recalled. &quot;And you could see the differences [in their sound] before the blackout and after.&quot;<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/New_Y<wbr>ork_City_blackout_of_1977<br><br>WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK.","time":1492810504,"resto":122177954,"id":"\/gdlQZc0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122189052,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)17:35:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122182218\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122182218<\/a><br><br>Indiana master race reporting in, everythings fine in Pence land","filename":"nice1","ext":".jpg","w":580,"h":477,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":102,"tim":1492810527218,"time":1492810527,"md5":"ppAU1QvdXKvJSUfTdqyjUQ==","fsize":32831,"resto":122177954,"id":"MQV++774","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122189095,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)17:35:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122188756\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122188756<\/a><br>609?","time":1492810547,"resto":122177954,"id":"GQKO8W1p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122189109,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)17:35:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"E M P<br>M<br>P","filename":"1457623427001","ext":".jpg","w":660,"h":371,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492810556411,"time":1492810556,"md5":"oi3TCf4zwTaDx1ygJHcAGg==","fsize":57604,"resto":122177954,"id":"LLfRi30s","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":122189112,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)17:35:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"we imminent?

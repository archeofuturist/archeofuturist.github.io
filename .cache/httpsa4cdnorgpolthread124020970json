Better yet, stop watching (((television))). Because Colbert, Noah, Oliver and all those late-night comedians are all left-wing puppets and there is nothing you can do to change them or their networks.

They make mistakes, and are getting worse at what they do, but they have reasons for everything. And one of those is getting people banned and silenced. <br><br>First, a bit of background on some concepts that will matter for this. <br><br>1. The Overton Window: The Overton Window is a concept which suggests that the collective acceptable discourse and ideas in a society operate like a window. There are acceptable and unacceptable ideas, those inside the window being the acceptable ones. So what happens if your ideas are outside the window? You get ostrichized, as pedophiles, race realists, nazis, and many other ideas are. So how do you fix this? You have to move the window, and this is done through a process of normalization. First, you normalize the idea in a fringe group, these are commonly the arts (plays, literature, movies, music), science (by pushing specific research to make it &quot;natural&quot;), or where you can advance the idea anonymously (pamphlets and leaflets in the past, internet forums now). Once this has begun, then you create fringe groups that operate as anchors for the window, so that there is always a community of visible extremists that keep the window from moving away from you. Set these extremists up as the fringe evil that you are sane, moderates compared to, and set up your opponents as the mirror fringe of these groups (examples are antifa, NAMBLA, gay pride parades). This creates the illusion that you are the middle ground. Next is layering arguments. Take homosexuality for example. To win the argument against the gays, the left sets up irrelevant standards (but it&#039;s love!, it&#039;s natural, etc). <br><br>1\/2","time":1493877468,"resto":124020970,"id":"13+rKVqz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124027368,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:59:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124020970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124020970<\/a><br>You&#039;re right OP. these right wingers are being children.","time":1493877540,"resto":124020970,"id":"Y3SKBTgt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124027401,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:59:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124026405\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124026405<\/a><br>Sureeee you don&#039;t.","time":1493877566,"resto":124020970,"id":"Y3SKBTgt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124027411,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:59:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124025607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124025607<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124027177\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124027177<\/a><br>Nice proxy, bitch nigger.","time":1493877573,"resto":124020970,"id":"ntt9szzZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124027440,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:59:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124027258\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124027258<\/a><br>This keeps you from ever actually arguing about the issue. Then make it an issue of compassion. Constantly inundate society with the tragedy of oppressed gays killing themselves, being killed, etc. At this point, there is usually enough support to establish policy in law to secure the window. <br><br>The second term is the Bandwagoning effect: People are social creatures, and seek the path of least resistance within a social environment. In order to do this, they will often bandwagon onto whatever idea seems to be the most popular (even if it actually isn&#039;t), artificially inflating support for that idea. <br><br>Finally, the antifa phrase &quot;make racists scared again&quot; and similar sloganeering. This is based on the above two concepts, that extremes operate as anchors that keep the window from moving, and that people will bandwagon onto seemingly popular platforms. In this case, antifa fears that with the victory of Trump, they will create a bandwagoning effect that will shift the window in our direction. The left uses antifa as a violent anchor for the window, and simultaneously positions themselves as the middle ground between antifa and the right. They also use violence to intimidate those that would otherwise have been vocal into being silent to protect themselves. <br><br>Why does all of this matter? Our goal is to do the same thing. We are going to force as many leftists off the air and out of the public spotlight as possible, while simultaneously putting ourselves into the public light by doing outrageous and stupid things to get the media to pay attention to us. We are setting ourselves up as an extreme, to Trump&#039;s middle ground and the left&#039;s extreme, so that we can shift the window while operating temporarily as an anchor. And by eliminating popular leftist media personalities, and forcing them into silence, we an make their ideology fade faster by showing it losing it&#039;s visible popularity. The fewer left wing icons, the fewer lefties in general. <br><br>2\/2","time":1493877587,"resto":124020970,"id":"13+rKVqz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124027655,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:02:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124025632\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124025632<\/a><br><br>The way that \/pol\/ was manipulated into attacking Milo was the stupidest shit I&#039;ve ever seen.","time":1493877728,"resto":124020970,"id":"Zq6YVuv4","country":"MT","country_name":"Malta"},{"no":124027873,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:04:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124021361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124021361<\/a><br>This, exactly my USA friend","time":1493877862,"resto":124020970,"id":"KwUUcgoB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124027985,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)02:05:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124022854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124022854<\/a><br>So correct!

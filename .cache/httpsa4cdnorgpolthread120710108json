Venezuela is the verge of a social and economic collapse because of muh socislism aka lite-communism. they still have to pay another $5 billion by the end of the year, and in 2018 they have $8 billion dollars worth of debt to pay, probably is they have less than $10 billion dollars of foreign reserves mostly in gold. China and Russia don&#039;t seem like they wanna keep throwing good money after bad. this is the next big happening on the horizon.","filename":"ven","ext":".jpg","w":964,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":132,"tim":1491969463453,"time":1491969463,"md5":"n\/LyM+pPbQvJdOeWCdK37Q==","fsize":96956,"resto":0,"id":"T9LDBsO7","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"venezuela-is-making-a-21-billion-dollar-debt","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":2,"unique_ips":9},{"no":120710365,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)00:00:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"http:\/\/growthlab.cid.harvard.edu\/fi<wbr>les\/growthlab\/files\/venezuela_oil_c<wbr>idwp_327.pdf<br><br>this pretty much explains why they are fucked","time":1491969609,"resto":120710108,"id":"T9LDBsO7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120710567,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)00:02:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"intredasting have a bump","time":1491969723,"resto":120710108,"id":"eCzGj81t","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120710782,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)00:03:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120710108\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120710108<\/a><br>have a bump, How do you think this could have an impact, on us northern Americans? think they will be calling debts all over?","time":1491969839,"resto":120710108,"id":"+W45\/h9f","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120710930,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)00:05:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120710108\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120710108<\/a><br>shit well I guess there are worse things to deal with.

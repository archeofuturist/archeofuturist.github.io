In the sphere of sexual relations and marriage, a revolution is approaching ... There can be no real mass movement without the women ... We cannot exercise the dictatorship of the proletariat without having millions of women on our side. Nor can we engage in communist construction without them. We must find a way to reach ... the mass of women, who feel themselves exploited, enslaved and crushed by the domination of the men ... They should all know that the proletarian dictatorship will mean to them complete equality of rights with men, both legal and in practice, in the family, the state and in society, and that it also spells the annihilation of the power of the bourgeoisie ... The government of the proletarian dictatorship - jointly with the Communist Party and the trade unions of course - makes every effort to overcome the backward views of men and women and thus uproot the old, non-communist psychology. It goes without saying that men and women are absolutely equal before the law. A sincere desire to give effect to this equality is evident in all spheres. We are enlisting women to work in the economy, the administration, legislation and government. All courses and educational institutions are open to them, so that they can improve their professional and social training. We are organising community kitchens and public dining-rooms, laundries and repair shops, cr\u00eaches, kindergartens, children\u2019s homes and educational institutions of every kind. In brief, we are quite in earnest about carrying out the requirements of our programme to shift the functions of housekeeping and education from the individual household to society. Woman is thus being relieved from her old domestic slavery and all dependence on her husband.&quot; Lenin","filename":"760","ext":".png","w":500,"h":481,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1490100055187,"time":1490100055,"md5":"IOQ0iXRltoRmh2SoQfoHHg==","fsize":276647,"resto":117612142,"id":"TxvJGlI6","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":117620956,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)08:42:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117614154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117614154<\/a><br>very much agreed friend","filename":"1473896561502","ext":".png","w":718,"h":1006,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490100170257,"time":1490100170,"md5":"0zDc77YMa+z2aIjANcYLxA==","fsize":992191,"resto":117612142,"id":"+32TEvrl","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117620986,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)08:43:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117620492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117620492<\/a><br>Its sociologists we&#039;re talking about though not economists.

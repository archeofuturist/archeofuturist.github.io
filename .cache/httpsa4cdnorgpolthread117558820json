Emergent properties don&#039;t exist; that is, they only exist as ideas. There is no such thing as mind-independent, objective emergent properties, in the same way there is no such thing as mind-independent, objective information. Only the mind gives these things meaning. The mind exists; this is self-evident. Thus the mind isn&#039;t an emergent property. Thus the mind can&#039;t be produced by matter. Thus the mind is immaterial. Computers can&#039;t produce immaterial things. Thus computers can&#039;t produce minds.<br><br>It can be deduced, not just induced, that matter cannot produce consciousness, because there is no such objective thing as &quot;emergent properties.&quot; An electron, or any number of electrons, passing between any number of points, in any permutation, through any combination or permutation of mediums, cannot produce consciousness, because of the simple fact that matter is never objectively more than its parts.<br><br>The mind necessarily precedes quantification.

And by your definition, humans arnt conscious. We&#039;re reactionary down to our every thought. That&#039;s what led me to my electrical soul theory, which causes me to believe that what were experience as consciousness is just a shitty feedback loop. Every behaviour and every action we have can be traced back to an cause or combination of causes. Like when humans mimick crimes committed to them during their youth. We&#039;re just biological machines. Even if we&#039;re aware of it, it&#039;s just a new input. We take in Information and output bullshit based on our brain structure (chemical and electrical[could fuckface]). <br><br>The truth is, our organic parts make everything fuzzy enough for our internal interpreter to fiddle with to form &quot;unique&quot; conclusions. It&#039;s all bs. <br><br>It will probably turn out to be pretty easy to create a machine to mimick the different functions of the different regions of the brain.

Which is impossible. Unless we can find out what conditions will lead to increased intellectual capacity and force some form of artificial &#039;evolution&#039;.<br><br>Or some shit like that.

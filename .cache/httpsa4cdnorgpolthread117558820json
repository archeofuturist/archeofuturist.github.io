The mind exists; this is self-evident. Thus the mind isn&#039;t an emergent property. Thus the mind can&#039;t be produced by matter. Thus the mind is immaterial.

And by your definition, humans arnt conscious. We&#039;re reactionary down to our every thought. That&#039;s what led me to my electrical soul theory, which causes me to believe that what were experience as consciousness is just a shitty feedback loop. Every behaviour and every action we have can be traced back to an cause or combination of causes. Like when humans mimick crimes committed to them during their youth.

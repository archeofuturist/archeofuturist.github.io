The way that we&#039;ve seen the world until particle physics and quantum mechanics is inherently flawed. It isn&#039;t until a player demands measurement that it actually exists. Double slit and follow up experiments confirm this. When a photon is fired at the mirror it takes a path and reaches destination A or B as expected. When you fire a photon at the mirror and during its travel add another mirror at the end it creates an interference pattern.

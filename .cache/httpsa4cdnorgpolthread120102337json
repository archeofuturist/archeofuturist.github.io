New commercial satellite imagery from April 2 indicates continued activity in this area and at the Main Administrative Area, while the rest of the facility remains quiet. This pattern of activity could mean a sixth nuclear test is imminent, but the imagery does not provide any definitive evidence of the installation of a nuclear device or the exact timing of such a test.","filename":"Fig1_Punggye-Upd-17-0406-990x742","ext":".jpg","w":990,"h":742,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491635429573,"time":1491635429,"md5":"72PU2Gpmtz7ISRW4+BBk9A==","fsize":436770,"resto":120102337,"id":"ZHMnXYKN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120103023,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:16:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Next time you speak to someone saying they&#039;re from Korea ask them North or South... kek","time":1491635772,"resto":120102337,"id":"Gj31HQhg","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120103501,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:22:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Thread theme: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fQ4<wbr>ouWdqZSo","time":1491636121,"resto":120102337,"id":"jRykYYcz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120103906,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:27:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120102337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120102337<\/a><br>thanks for link i never thought that north korean tv was something i need in my life","time":1491636460,"resto":120102337,"id":"gzJul32T","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":120103983,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:28:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120103906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120103906<\/a><br>Feel free not to watch.","time":1491636521,"resto":120102337,"id":"ZHMnXYKN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120104317,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:34:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120102337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120102337<\/a><br>Youtube link to make it easier for people.<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nqt<wbr>obiKz0Iw","time":1491636846,"resto":120102337,"id":"jRykYYcz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120104484,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:36:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120104317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120104317<\/a><br>that stuff looks like shit, where&#039;s the high production best korea anime","time":1491636987,"resto":120102337,"id":"ALyPNkPs","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120107124,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)04:13:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"the fuck is even going on in their propaganda?","filename":"002","ext":".jpg","w":192,"h":104,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":67,"tim":1491639236470,"time":1491639236,"md5":"amKs2+omji1UexAGqAXwTg==","fsize":7781,"resto":120102337,"id":"FusMaxKj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120107499,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)04:21:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120102337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120102337<\/a><br>WTF LMAO!! xD","time":1491639668,"resto":120102337,"id":"y5cluxBh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120107554,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)04:21:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"god what in the dick is with norks?","time":1491639714,"resto":120102337,"id":"zwykyHx2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120107765,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)04:25:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"WTF this is the weirdest ever, it&#039;s like some politicized Disney Wizard of Oz TV show LMAO!","time":1491639917,"resto":120102337,"id":"y5cluxBh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120108239,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)04:33:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Oh no, the news lady is on, she looks uncomfortable but big smile lol.<br>Showing pics of Kim Jong Un.","time":1491640386,"resto":120102337,"id":"y5cluxBh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120108506,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)04:37:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;You&#039;ll never cuddlefuck Lt.

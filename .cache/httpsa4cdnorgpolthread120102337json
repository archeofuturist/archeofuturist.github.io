New commercial satellite imagery from April 2 indicates continued activity in this area and at the Main Administrative Area, while the rest of the facility remains quiet. This pattern of activity could mean a sixth nuclear test is imminent, but the imagery does not provide any definitive evidence of the installation of a nuclear device or the exact timing of such a test.","filename":"Fig1_Punggye-Upd-17-0406-990x742","ext":".jpg","w":990,"h":742,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491635429573,"time":1491635429,"md5":"72PU2Gpmtz7ISRW4+BBk9A==","fsize":436770,"resto":120102337,"id":"ZHMnXYKN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120103023,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:16:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Next time you speak to someone saying they&#039;re from Korea ask them North or South... kek","time":1491635772,"resto":120102337,"id":"Gj31HQhg","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":120103501,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:22:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Thread theme: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fQ4<wbr>ouWdqZSo","time":1491636121,"resto":120102337,"id":"jRykYYcz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120103906,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:27:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120102337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120102337<\/a><br>thanks for link i never thought that north korean tv was something i need in my life","time":1491636460,"resto":120102337,"id":"gzJul32T","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":120103983,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:28:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120103906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120103906<\/a><br>Feel free not to watch.","time":1491636521,"resto":120102337,"id":"ZHMnXYKN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120104317,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:34:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120102337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120102337<\/a><br>Youtube link to make it easier for people.<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nqt<wbr>obiKz0Iw","time":1491636846,"resto":120102337,"id":"jRykYYcz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120104484,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:36:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120104317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120104317<\/a><br>that stuff looks like shit, where&#039;s the high production best korea anime","time":1491636987,"resto":120102337,"id":"ALyPNkPs","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

With nationalized resources, Libyans didn&#039;t have to pay taxes, received free health care, free education from birth to PHD or as far as you wish, free housing for the poor and subsidies on things like food etc. The only people who worked in Libya were Chines, Tchadians, sudanese, and other African Immigrants. <br><br>3. Libya was one of the free countries in the world that did not have any form of debts whatsoever. Libya had more money than it&#039;s population could use and had billions stores a way around the world. All the money Libya stored in Europe has been squandered by European governments. <br><br>4. During Gaddafi&#039;s lifetime, AU functions were fully funded by Libya, accommodation for leaders, transportations, and day to day activities at the AU headquarters, now that is being done by European Union. As the saying goes &quot;He who pays the piper calls the tune&quot; <br><br>5. Gaddafi spent millions and millions helping Mali and niger with high level irrigation in the deserts so people can be self sustained.Paid full and never expected anything back.<br><br>6. Gaddafi initiated a high level talks into starting an African Development Bank where African governments would go and borrow money at low rates for developments of things like infrastructure, academic institutions, medical institutions, research institutions among other things.

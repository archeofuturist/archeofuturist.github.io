Germany is at the breaking point and Sweden already fell. Le Pen is unlikely (but still can win), however, the European Union has become too much bureaucratic to be defeated on a short term. Britain had luck, but it had it easy because they refused to implement the Euro.<br><br>Let&#039;s face it, Europe is on it&#039;s dawn. The West itself was killed after Mid-Cold War, and most of Europe is already falling.<br><br>However, this is not the case for Spain and Portugal. There, immigration isn&#039;t as bad as other countries (although Ceuta and Melilla are still a problem when it comes to this). Both of these countries COULD be saved with a simple step:<br><br>A) Abandon the Idea of Europe<br><br>That&#039;s it. Let&#039;s face it, Iberian culture is too different from the rest, and Spain has been treated like shit by others (The Dutch during the 80 years war, who just converted to Calvinism to make it an ideological war. The English who made a lot of the propaganda of the &quot;Black Legend&quot; and basically the submission of both countries to British, Austrian and French interests).<br><br>The entry of the European Union has costed both countries a lot of their sovereignty AND economy. There&#039;s no need to consider the Iberians &quot;Europeans&quot; anymore. The alt-right and other movements ignored the Peninsula for too long already.<br><br>I say that the only way to save the motherland is by leaving Europe. Spain and Portugal have way more brotherly and cultural ties with their new world descendants than with the rest of Europe.<br><br>Oh, and put the Carlists on the throne too.<br><br>This thread is open to ideas and discussion, feel free to discuss and exchange opinions and facts.","filename":"planoIbero","ext":".gif","w":223,"h":208,"tn_w":223,"tn_h":208,"tim":1490064261208,"time":1490064261,"md5":"MrNyMZfDOOyCTWtdVpIlnQ==","fsize":9922,"resto":0,"id":"wL3nxEMA","country":"MX","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"about-the-future-of-europe-spain-and-all-of-that","country_name":"Mexico","replies":17,"images":5,"unique_ips":10},{"no":117575732,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)22:47:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117575427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117575427<\/a><br>No. I have nothing in common with mestizos and mulattoes that make up the majority of latin america.

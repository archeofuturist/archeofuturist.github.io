And I say this as someone who was already a frequent browser of \/news\/ back then. I remember reading Cracked, and barely heard or cared about feminism back then or even SJW rhetoric, although that &quot;leftist&quot; identity politics was definitely there, just not as blatant.

Our nation committed a terrible sin on that day in 2012, and we have not even begun to recover from it.

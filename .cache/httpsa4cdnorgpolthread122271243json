Stealth bomber can carry about 18 000kg of weaponry. Thus, each flight a stealth bomber would be able to drop 18 000kg of horse shit over Tallinn, the capital of Estonia. After that it could turn around and fly to Hyvink\u00e4\u00e4 airport for refilling its shit load and redo the maneuver. Within a few years the defense budget to achieve a situation where the flight rotation was it would be nearly constant and Estonians would not have any idea why their capital is given tens of thousands of pounds of horse shit every day.","filename":"b2spirit","ext":".jpg","w":734,"h":1016,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492871363379,"time":1492871363,"md5":"l10R0cwHtACg5M5stOa\/uA==","fsize":73973,"resto":122271243,"id":"btQGCX6N","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122282280,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:31:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122282125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122282125<\/a><br>this is your future <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gjz<wbr>NEyysv1o","time":1492871466,"resto":122271243,"id":"CRYK\/IT4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122282326,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:31:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281547<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How about you stop occupying their territory that you agreed to never touch?<\/span><br>So we have to lose 40 mil people economy market and let crimea to became nato base?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They gave up nukes for that promise and you went back on your word.<\/span><br>Budapest memorandum wasnt ratified nor by Nato members nor by Russia, not even by ukraine.

Collectivist minded and servile society with no regard to human life. They don&#039;t care about their personal wealth, freedom etc as long as Mother Russia and the Tsar is fine. They lack empathy, incapable of establishing a friendly relations on equal terms. Apart from Moscow and St Petersburg and some oil regions Russia is extremely poor and undeveloped - as the Russians are incapable of producing anything sophisticated almost the entire wealth of the country comes from it&#039;s natural resources. Except for the art and architecture directly derived either from the Greeks(all the Orthodox architecture they have horribly bastardized, icons) or Westerners(these fancy palaces in St. Petersburg) they barely have contributed to the culture at all. Considering a very large population their scientific contribution is utterly underwhelming, vastly inferior compared to the Western Slavs. Entire society is subjected to brainwashing propaganda blaming the Americans for everything, making them praise their Tsar Putin and support all the vicious acts of violence and terror. They can&#039;t even into geopolitics - Russia still pretends it&#039;s 19th century and the best way for the state to succeed is to be egoistic, xenophobic, expansive, imperialistic, overly-nationalistic and authoritarian. Russia is the true cancer of humanity and I sincerely hope it breaks apart as soon as possible.","time":1492871721,"resto":122271243,"id":"ojW1BOCJ","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":122282891,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:36:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122282583\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122282583<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inferior borderland peasant screeching<\/span><br>No matter how hard you scream that wont change the fact.","time":1492871819,"resto":122271243,"id":"dvAL0odt","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":122282905,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:37:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281250\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281250<\/a><br>Moscow is 20% muslim and they have their own sharia areas.

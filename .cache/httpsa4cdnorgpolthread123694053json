Has there ever been a more destructive societal force in human history? This cesspool of hatred and despair that makes everyone think they&#039;re the star in a movie all about them, while their true individuality becomes a consuming desire to conform for the sake of acceptance while they walk around like mindless zombies hooked to their devices like a junkie for a fix, all while being dumbed down a little more every single day.<br><br>Thanks CERN, you evil fucks.","filename":"cernshiva","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":375,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493682921997,"time":1493682921,"md5":"\/H6gi0sh\/5v5Yfzzk11Fzg==","fsize":45547,"resto":0,"id":"CWTS\/UAw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"cern","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":1,"unique_ips":8},{"no":123694238,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)19:56:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123694053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123694053<\/a><br>What was the madcap prank?","time":1493683013,"resto":123694053,"id":"JWmynS0E","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":123694403,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)19:58:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;CERN created the worldwide web.<\/span>","filename":"1474550505236","ext":".jpg","w":645,"h":773,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493683103655,"time":1493683103,"md5":"jUuWS2BAKnnKKU6iSbYfEg==","fsize":56884,"resto":123694053,"id":"bnMA1Gcg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123694530,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)19:59:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/discord.gg\/sUGGPvx<br>CERN and the pope","time":1493683181,"resto":123694053,"id":"cFAs8cP6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123694632,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:00:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;ve always thought the internet was created to divide us.","time":1493683237,"resto":123694053,"id":"tW+55tEn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123694761,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:01:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123694053\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123694053<\/a><br>This isn&#039;t Angels and demons, larpnigger","time":1493683299,"resto":123694053,"id":"hgrddGQI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123695690,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)20:09:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123694403\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123694403<\/a><br>They created the first Intranet, so they technically inventedit .

Celibacy is the fountain of youth. All you have to do to become eternally young is eat properly, avoid drugs and sex (masturbation counts). The main reason people grow old is because they have sex. The human body regenerates while sleeping, but to do so it needs some key nutrients that are wasted every time you ejaculate. Obviously basic exercise is also necessary. Nothing too hard, yoga is enough. This is the tree of life. Stop fapping and avoid so called &quot;death by natural causes&quot;. That is, if you actually want to live 300, 500 or even thousands of years while maintaining young instead of shriveling up, going sick and suffering for the rest of your short, miserable life.","time":1491428789,"resto":119656477,"id":"QSCoZnL9","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":119660841,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)17:46:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119656477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119656477<\/a><br><br>I don&#039;t like the Greeks at all, but I do like the Spartans. <br><br>I would not class the Macedonians as Greeks, they were as much Thracians as Greeks.","time":1491428794,"resto":119656477,"id":"jFJcy3cI","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":119660850,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)17:46:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119660426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119660426<\/a><br>dont know why i replied to norway lol","filename":"1484713592529","ext":".png","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491428797237,"time":1491428797,"md5":"KSpzU+fOZid4KvZXoQzS5g==","fsize":3924982,"resto":119656477,"id":"D5vSs0hz","country":"DE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119660870,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)17:46:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119656477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119656477<\/a><br>A fucking turk talking about degeneracy...

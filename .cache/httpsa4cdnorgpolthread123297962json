I thought it was a joke at first, but then I got banned for just posting in a meme thread, so apparently they&#039;re super cereal about getting rid of the shitposters, which I applaud.<br><br>So the first thing you&#039;re going to want to do, very simple, remove flags. Ever since you added them they have cause NOTHING but shitposting. &gt;a fucking leaf &gt;poo in loo &gt;RARERERARERARAREARERARERARE Seriously, it make a community where you judged people by the content of their arguments into an \/int\/ tier shithole. The worst part is the flags that play up to their stereotypes, like Canadians making abhorrent posts. I don&#039;t know if you unironically thought they made the community better or not but quite frankly I thought they were a one time meme addition as a joke. If you really want to include flags then have a drop down menu of selectable ideological flags, like it used to be.<br><br>Increase post timers. This one&#039;s a no brainer. Again, I thought it was a one time joke but you kept it, you literally gave spammers the tools to shit the board up and then are surprised when they do it. Along with this, make sure someone can only have one, maybe two active threads at a time. This will slow down the people spamming BLACKED threads.<br><br>Legitimize generals. The best threads on \/pol\/ right now are brit\/pol\/ and \/sg\/, and this is largely because they have both a sense of community and don&#039;t have flagposters baiting for (You)s. The best thing you could do is increase the post limit for these, to 700, like \/vg\/. This would also allow in depth discussion in other threads and promote actual conversation, it would also mean we wouldn&#039;t have to make new generals every half an hour.<br><br>Thanks for listening and I hope you take this into account, you can make \/pol\/ usable again. <br><br><br>pls no re-ban i wuz trying to help i a gud boi i dindu nuffin","filename":"Based jannies","ext":".jpg","w":1127,"h":329,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":72,"tim":1493442007933,"time":1493442007,"md5":"lH4EQvN7NZpm6Wi1A9WxMA==","fsize":164185,"resto":0,"id":"X0L1O9x+","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-to-make-pol-great-again","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123298483,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:06:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123297962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123297962<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;remove flags<\/span><br>fuck off jew","time":1493442415,"resto":123297962,"id":"ljESqJVu","country":"HK","country_name":"Hong Kong"},{"no":123298535,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)01:07:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123297962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123297962<\/a><br>fuck you nigger","time":1493442458,"resto":123297962,"id":"raK094Lb","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

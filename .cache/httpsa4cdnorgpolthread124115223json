But if you\u2019re looking at reality, that will be the result because that is reality.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I didn\u2019t put anything into the book that has not happened sometime, somewhere. Or wasn\u2019t happening then and isn\u2019t happening now. So you can call that feminist, if you like. I didn\u2019t start from ideology, I started from what I was collecting and seeing. But of course, I must have been instigated, must I not?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That\u2019s No. 1, No. 2. I always want to know what people mean by that word. Some people mean it quite negatively, other people mean it very positively, some people mean it in a broad sense, other people mean it in a more specific sense. Therefore, in order to answer the question, you have to ask the person what they mean.<\/span>","filename":"1493658328002","ext":".jpg","w":1502,"h":2253,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493934264320,"time":1493934264,"md5":"guL83WGmGdaZUV6ChcrErA==","fsize":1549047,"resto":0,"id":"2RHf30JT","country":"IL","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"margaret-atwood-answers-the-question-is-the","country_name":"Israel","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":124115448,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)17:46:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124115223\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124115223<\/a><br>You used to be cool Margaret, the fuck","time":1493934366,"resto":124115223,"id":"HYryycr+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

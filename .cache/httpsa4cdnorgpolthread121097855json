Life certainly contains suffering, but it is not wholly comprised of suffering. It contains things that are desirable too: sex, love, food, drugs, beauty, art, exercise, music, reading, video games, films........I could think of many more. The point is, it contains negative &amp; positive aspects &amp; whichever you focus on defines the quality of your existence. <br><br>So guess what? If you become obsessed with everything that is bad about life you will be miserable &amp; depressed. As a conscious entity the choice is yours, &amp; being depressed is as valid a choice as being happy. However, saying &quot;life is suffering&quot; is an incorrect statement. &quot;Life contains suffering in a relative amount dependent on the perspective of the conscious observer&quot; is a more accurate statement.","time":1492197830,"resto":121097855,"id":"8+Dp99YL","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121100716,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)15:25:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121098105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121098105<\/a><br>You know you didn&#039;t end up in heaven if races aren&#039;t segregated when you arrive.","time":1492197956,"resto":121097855,"id":"xiM8\/sb8","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121100915,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)15:27:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121097855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121097855<\/a><br>Go home Niche, you&#039;re drunk.","time":1492198053,"resto":121097855,"id":"3XzUESiq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121101073,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)15:28:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121098791\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121098791<\/a><br><br>There may be no end to consciousness, if the multiverse theory is true then quantum immortality is probably also a thing.","time":1492198137,"resto":121097855,"id":"8+Dp99YL","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

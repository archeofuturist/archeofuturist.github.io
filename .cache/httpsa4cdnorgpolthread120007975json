A major change in policy shift in Syria. Nor indicative of a desire to oust Assad from power.<br><br>This was a show of force and a willingness to use it if pushed far enough.<br><br>We got to remember that Obama was completely cucked post Libya. He did nothing after &quot;muh redline&quot;, or in Ukraine. Nor in Aleppo despite massive shilling. The US got cucked so hard by the end of his presidency that the US wasn&#039;t even present for the last round of peace talks in Astana.<br>Meanwhile with this one attack Trump has put the US back at the table by basically slamming their dick on it and staring everyone down. Russia and Syria aren&#039;t dumb enough to start shooting down US jets that are bombing ISIS now. But the US is also not going to continue bombing Syrian or Russian forces. So the US gets to sit at the table again and have a voice.<br><br>So part of this attack restores the US position on the global stage.<br>The other part of this attack is purely aimed at the domestic audience of the US and it&#039;s allies. It sets a clear message that Trump is not weak like Obama and will act swiftly and decisively if need be. Against Russian interest too no less. Neocons are going to have a lot less criticism for him now. And if they do, their shilling will look obvious to the public.<br><br>tl;dr This was a calculated measured response to show the US is no longer run by a spineless cuck. And to tell the neocons to shut up.","filename":"beach1","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491594345610,"time":1491594345,"md5":"k63A1af3cwblJl6SbORqpA==","fsize":59920,"resto":120007975,"id":"vRkRGitu","country":"CW","m_img":1,"country_name":"Cura\u00e7ao"},{"no":120010869,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:46:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120010497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120010497<\/a><br>I&#039;m speaking about planes flying overhead to and from important localities like europe or far east, noone gives a shit about ME shitholes or has any reason to fly there","time":1491594397,"resto":120007975,"id":"Bgy9gshq","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":120010981,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:47:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120010733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120010733<\/a><br>CURACAO YES","time":1491594437,"resto":120007975,"id":"kvuTTbM+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120011006,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:47:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120010733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120010733<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This was a calculated measured response to show the US is no longer run by a spineless cuck.<\/span><br>Makes sense.

I&#039;m Maria 21yr from Malta, my boyfriend of a 4yr just broke up with me and I&#039;m 30 weeks pregnant.I have cried my self to sleep most of the nights and don\u2019t seem to concentrate during lectures sometimes I stay awake almost all night thinking about him and start to cry all over again.Because of this I end up not having energy for my next day\u2019s classes ,my attendance has dropped and am always in uni and on time.Generally he is a very nice guy ,he ended it because he said we were arguing a lot and not getting along.He is right we\u2019ve been arguing during the pregnancy a lot .After the break up I kept ringing him and telling him I will change.I am in love with this guy and he is the best guy I have ever been with.I\u2019m still hurt and in disbelief when he said he didn\u2019t have any romantic feelings towards me anymore that hurt me faster than a lethal syringe.He texts me now and then mainly to check up on how am doing with the pregnancy,he is supportive with it but it\u2019s not fair on me, him texting me as I just want to grieve the pain and not have any stress due to the pregnancy.i was really upset and i needed help, so i searched for help online and I came across a website that suggested that Dr Unity can help solve marital problems, restore broken relationships and so on. So, I felt I should give him a try. I contacted him and he told me what to do and i did it then he did a spell for me. 28 hours later, my bf came to me and apologized for the wrongs he did and promise never to do it again. Ever since then, everything has returned back to normal. I and my bf are living together happily again.. All thanks to Dr Unity. If you have any problem contact Dr.Unity now and i guarantee you that he will help you.Email him at: Unityspelltemple@gmail.com ,you can also call him or add him on whats-app: +2348071622464.","time":1491594832,"resto":120007975,"id":"02TZuFiN","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":120012156,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:54:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;I just realized that \/sg\/ is now DailyStormer<\/span>","filename":"haaaaaaahahahah","ext":".jpg","w":1050,"h":765,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":91,"tim":1491594866616,"time":1491594866,"md5":"pwOtHo4ve8rtoT1MJAGvrQ==","fsize":142714,"resto":120007975,"id":"vt8MFZQq","country":"BR","m_img":1,"country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120012181,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:54:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Back in business.

We saw the &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;emergency crews&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; handling victims with bare hands and simple cloth respirators. If it really was sarin, all these people would also quickly be exposed and be among the victims.<br>Secondly we have reports from the hospitals that supposedly treated the victims that after washing them, that they got better. Sarin is non-soluble in water. So washing the victims would have done nothing.<br><br>However, chlorine is soluble in water. Nor is skin contact a major issue. And cloth breathing masks are good enough against the worst of it.<br>Chlorine also far more easily spreads as a cloud or vapour, which would be very consistent with the Russian claims that the source was a weapon depot that was struck.<br><br>Finally all images of the supposed impact of the bomb used to spread the chemical are more consistent with a mortar impact, let alone a chemical dispersal warhead. For one such warheads are made light and have non-penetrating warheads so that the agent carried can be dispersed more widely.<br>The warhead we would be looking for would be a crumpled piece of metal that made almost no crater at all. Meanwhile the supposed picture of the bomb being shilled around shows a crater with the remains of a bomb that has clearly exploded apart.<br><br>Save this post. The OPCW report will say that this was not a sarin attack but rather chlorine.","filename":"Barb","ext":".jpg","w":638,"h":422,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":82,"tim":1491594931708,"time":1491594931,"md5":"9TehWgB5NRhIMGS+RsceKg==","fsize":317370,"resto":120007975,"id":"vRkRGitu","country":"CW","country_name":"Cura\u00e7ao"},{"no":120012560,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:56:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"This looks a lot like an invasion:<br> Rami al-Lolah @RamiAILoIah<br><br>Four #USA army helicopters spotted flying very low altitude near Tell Brak northeast of Hasaka &amp; they were heading to unknown site.. #Syria<br>https:\/\/twitter.com\/RamiAILoIah\/sta<wbr>tus\/850398466811588612","time":1491595008,"resto":120007975,"id":"H6yRTqBs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120012620,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:57:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120012324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120012324<\/a><br>Nothing more to add anon, I agree completely.<br>Only thing that comes to my mind was a Jihadi &quot;Dr. Manpad&quot; smelling the victim and talking to camera: see I don&#039;t smell anything, it&#039;s not chlorine!","time":1491595032,"resto":120007975,"id":"KnH\/2xc1","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":120012829,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:58:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120011025\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120011025<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pretty based but lets not forget that there&#039;s too many neocons and kikes surrounding ourguys...<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bad company corrupts good character<\/span><br>Considering Bannon has been removed from the security team.

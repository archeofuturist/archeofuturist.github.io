A major change in policy shift in Syria. Nor indicative of a desire to oust Assad from power.<br><br>This was a show of force and a willingness to use it if pushed far enough.<br><br>We got to remember that Obama was completely cucked post Libya. He did nothing after &quot;muh redline&quot;, or in Ukraine. Nor in Aleppo despite massive shilling. The US got cucked so hard by the end of his presidency that the US wasn&#039;t even present for the last round of peace talks in Astana.<br>Meanwhile with this one attack Trump has put the US back at the table by basically slamming their dick on it and staring everyone down. Russia and Syria aren&#039;t dumb enough to start shooting down US jets that are bombing ISIS now. But the US is also not going to continue bombing Syrian or Russian forces. So the US gets to sit at the table again and have a voice.<br><br>So part of this attack restores the US position on the global stage.<br>The other part of this attack is purely aimed at the domestic audience of the US and it&#039;s allies. It sets a clear message that Trump is not weak like Obama and will act swiftly and decisively if need be. Against Russian interest too no less. Neocons are going to have a lot less criticism for him now. And if they do, their shilling will look obvious to the public.<br><br>tl;dr This was a calculated measured response to show the US is no longer run by a spineless cuck. And to tell the neocons to shut up.","filename":"beach1","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491594345610,"time":1491594345,"md5":"k63A1af3cwblJl6SbORqpA==","fsize":59920,"resto":120007975,"id":"vRkRGitu","country":"CW","m_img":1,"country_name":"Cura\u00e7ao"},{"no":120010869,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:46:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120010497\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120010497<\/a><br>I&#039;m speaking about planes flying overhead to and from important localities like europe or far east, noone gives a shit about ME shitholes or has any reason to fly there","time":1491594397,"resto":120007975,"id":"Bgy9gshq","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":120010981,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:47:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120010733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120010733<\/a><br>CURACAO YES","time":1491594437,"resto":120007975,"id":"kvuTTbM+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120011006,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:47:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120010733\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120010733<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;This was a calculated measured response to show the US is no longer run by a spineless cuck.<\/span><br>Makes sense.

If it really was sarin, all these people would also quickly be exposed and be among the victims.<br>Secondly we have reports from the hospitals that supposedly treated the victims that after washing them, that they got better. Sarin is non-soluble in water. So washing the victims would have done nothing.<br><br>However, chlorine is soluble in water. Nor is skin contact a major issue. And cloth breathing masks are good enough against the worst of it.<br>Chlorine also far more easily spreads as a cloud or vapour, which would be very consistent with the Russian claims that the source was a weapon depot that was struck.<br><br>Finally all images of the supposed impact of the bomb used to spread the chemical are more consistent with a mortar impact, let alone a chemical dispersal warhead. For one such warheads are made light and have non-penetrating warheads so that the agent carried can be dispersed more widely.<br>The warhead we would be looking for would be a crumpled piece of metal that made almost no crater at all. Meanwhile the supposed picture of the bomb being shilled around shows a crater with the remains of a bomb that has clearly exploded apart.<br><br>Save this post.

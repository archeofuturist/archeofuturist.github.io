In addition, you&#039;re eating fat and getting excess cholesterol, because you&#039;re body produces all the cholesterol that you need. <br><br>Dairy is even worse. Full of hormones, estrogen, and the shit they pump into cows. Cow milk is meant to grow a calf into a full-grown bovine; the only milk that we need we get from our own mothers. Plus, the alternatives (soy, almond, cashew milk) have more calcium and minerals than regular dairy milk. <br><br>And then there is the ethical side of the argument, which most people do not care about. However there is something to be said about the estrangement between consumers and what they consume: odds are that if people worked in slaughterhouses they&#039;d have a different view of what they put into their mouths. People who have grown up in agrarian\/rural communities know that meat is a luxury, and that usually you have some kind of relationship with the animals you might eventually eat. But just like Apple sells iPhones by way of an inspirational marketing campaign, the meat, dairy and fast food industries mask the reality of their practices with humor, caricatures of animals, and clever slogans, because they really are purveyors of death and slaughter, they do not care about our health.","time":1490733728,"resto":118649405,"id":"qo9y2Djt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118693771,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:43:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118693577\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118693577<\/a><br>walnut milk is the new new","time":1490733821,"resto":118649405,"id":"a1Ifr6Pe","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118694076,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)16:46:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118687951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118687951<\/a><br>If animal protein is essential to building muscle how can it be that vegans, gasp, have muscles<br><br>studies are increasingly coming out that animal products actually lower testosterone, let alone their health risks. <br>If you choose to ignore that then that&#039;s wilful ignorance, and not much I can do about that.

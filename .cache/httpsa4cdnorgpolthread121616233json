Bus the citizens out and leave military only to protect from invasion. <br><br>On the 3rd drill, evacuate everyone except for one brave unit of operators of decoy soldiers and equipment. Assign them the best possible survivalist equipment and build bunkers for them. Give them an evac plan as well. Their job is simply to remotely operate fleets of dummy vehicles to make NK believe it&#039;s just another evac drill.<br><br>During this time, initiate a covert special operations strike on all NK facilities. Backup plan is a nuclear strike from the air on all facilities. For this reason, allow some time for the special ops to make it to a secure covert bunker in the north to take iodine tablets and wait for evac. Lots of open area in the north to create this facility underground.<br><br>With the nuclear sites destroyed, simply bomb the shit out of them until they surrender. Remember, no one cares about asians (see Hiroshima and United airlines memes for info) so this won&#039;t be bad for PR.<br><br>Too e-z.","filename":"miley-cyrus-nude-12","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":898,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492478967001,"time":1492478967,"md5":"hVtNzaNLSLX2ppZRyVOplA==","fsize":112601,"resto":0,"id":"N7rEaZAJ","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"heres-how-to-defeat-kim","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":121616563,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)21:32:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Rate my plan reddit","filename":"AOdPPld","ext":".jpg","w":622,"h":561,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":112,"tim":1492479126012,"time":1492479126,"md5":"CaXEuJmV3Iymzh9XnmFjqw==","fsize":62832,"resto":121616233,"id":"N7rEaZAJ","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

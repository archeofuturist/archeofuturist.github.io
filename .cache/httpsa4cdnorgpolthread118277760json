The trouble is that most people in our society have been brain washed into thinking that racial identity does not matter and that anyone who thinks it does matter is an evil nazi. You have two options if you want to get around this, either be an ethno nationalist and try and fight against decades of brain washing all the while most people will not listen to your arguments because they think that you are a nazi, or you can pretend to be a civic nationalist and then you don&#039;t have to worry about that road block because people think that to you race is not a problem. The former has proven not to be workable unfortunately, the later has shown more promise, but the problem with it is that it is taking too long.","time":1490479341,"resto":118277760,"id":"xBPJ3hgS","country":"GB","trip":"!!sD6h8LgcbfU","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118278477,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:02:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118269048#p118277905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118277905<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;stainless steel<\/span><br><br>tantalum objectively best metal<br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/118269048#p118278054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118278054<\/a><br>most heavy metal is awful","filename":"Tantalum_single_crystal_and_1cm3_cube","ext":".jpg","w":4937,"h":2991,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1490479339817,"time":1490479339,"md5":"MJLTulC3Tub1ZBxH3zm62Q==","fsize":2622709,"resto":118277760,"id":"i9XVUckc","country":"GB","m_img":1,"country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118278514,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:02:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118278086\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118278086<\/a><br>c-can you give me a quick rundown on the milkman meme?","time":1490479358,"resto":118277760,"id":"mitRvAhx","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118278528,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:02:48","name":"Rightly So","com":"<a href=\"#p118278289\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118278289<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Thought he was on a segway for a second there.<\/span><br>CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN NOW","time":1490479368,"resto":118277760,"id":"xBPJ3hgS","country":"GB","trip":"!!sD6h8LgcbfU","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118278531,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:02:48","name":"Anonymous","filename":"5488617758","ext":".webm","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490479368982,"time":1490479368,"md5":"9C6cDs3nygr2D1\/e6PWgHA==","fsize":1317507,"resto":118277760,"id":"7PsnBWy6","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118278543,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:02:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118277967\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118277967<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; We do not believe they wanted this<\/span><br><br>What the fuck else did they mean by ticking the leave box?","time":1490479378,"resto":118277760,"id":"nx7jypGs","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118278612,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:03:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"Diversity is our biggest strength, better them than us","filename":"journalist-celebrates-diversity-of-those-killed","ext":".jpg","w":652,"h":330,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":63,"tim":1490479416232,"time":1490479416,"md5":"KP+BHxNkQRAe4EVx3TQKYg==","fsize":56731,"resto":118277760,"id":"Cz8K3bHh","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118278663,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:04:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118278514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118278514<\/a><br>Here (you) go lad <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gnb<wbr>mXaCCZHE","time":1490479448,"resto":118277760,"id":"u+1DCmNB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118278732,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:04:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"how do i get a syrian gf?","filename":"rim","ext":".jpg","w":391,"h":343,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":109,"tim":1490479483822,"time":1490479483,"md5":"sEVAEKFe7a6Bi64U\/ZqI8g==","fsize":38904,"resto":118277760,"id":"gScrY0iK","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118278743,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:04:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118278531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118278531<\/a><br>There is something extremely unattractive about girls that try too hard to be sexy. <br>This kind of shit does nothing for me.","filename":"the knick","ext":".webm","w":920,"h":390,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":52,"tim":1490479490197,"time":1490479490,"md5":"abZf06+6ce2\/bmpgXFOy4A==","fsize":3006976,"resto":118277760,"id":"5+ebufRi","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118278753,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:04:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118277967\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118277967<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;We know what&#039;s best for everyone<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They are just idiots who don&#039;t know what&#039;s best for them<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;OLD PEOPLE REEEEEEEEEEEEE<\/span>","filename":"56492658","ext":".jpg","w":377,"h":264,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1490479498971,"time":1490479498,"md5":"wX8UBXW3t7VXkdHCRFL9fg==","fsize":22891,"resto":118277760,"id":"BpXDoai+","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":118278757,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)18:04:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118278612\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118278612<\/a><br>Weren&#039;t most of those people tourists?

Such a military presence would have smothered the ISIS terror network in its cradle.<br>Instead, the vacuum created by America\u2019s withdrawal led rapidly to the emergence of ISIS as the largest terror organization in history, with tentacles in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, North Africa, and other countries around the world. It also led to the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Christians, Yazidis, and other \u201cinfidels\u201d and chaos throughout the Fertile Crescent that created 20 million refugees across the region while Obama was in office.<br>Second, Obama\u2019s Middle Eastern retreat was crystallized by his failure to enforce the \u201cred line\u201d he had drawn in Syria to prevent its dictator from using chemical weapons. This capitulation allowed Russia to move into the region, replacing America as its dominant external power.<br>Third, at the same time, Obama directed harsh diplomatic moves against Israel\u2019s leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Egypt\u2019s Hosni Mubarak, another American ally. In the midst of public demonstrations against the Egyptian regime, he declared that Mubarak must step down, effectively driving Mubarak out of power while giving political support to the Muslim Brotherhood to replace him.This reprised Jimmy Carter\u2019s attack on the Shah of Iran, an American ally, which led directly to the creation of the first Islamic terrorist state.<br>The fall of Mubarak paved the way for the ascension of the previously outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, the organization that had nurtured bin Laden and provided the ideological foundations for the Islamic holy war. When the Egyptian military toppled the Brotherhood, the White House cut off military aid to the new regime, driving the largest Arab nation into the arms of the Russians.&quot;","filename":"fakedonald","ext":".jpg","w":1100,"h":619,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492073049447,"time":1492073049,"md5":"AUSanG8Ny8bdSPVGbyhJKQ==","fsize":135081,"resto":0,"id":"GLEGlUQn","country":"NO","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"meet-your-new-warlord-neocon-donald-trump","country_name":"Norway","replies":8,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":120888268,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)04:45:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"fuck off shariablue","time":1492073142,"resto":120888203,"id":"M9RcJPIe","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":120888562,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)04:50:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"Taken from the book Big Agenda by David Horowitz","time":1492073418,"resto":120888203,"id":"GLEGlUQn","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":120888968,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)04:56:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"Literally every line of that is accurate, and this is coming from someone who is opposed to invading Syria and who was opposed to the Iraq war.<br>Pulling out in the way we did did create a power vacuum in the nascent Iraqi state, which allowed ISIS to form.<br>Pulling back on the &quot;red line&quot; in Syria not only damaged America&#039;s credibility in that region, but also in dealing with China over NK.

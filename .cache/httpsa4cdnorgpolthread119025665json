The only thing that board is used for is anime shitposting, they outright tell newcomers that the board is ineffective for discussions with site moderation. \/qa\/ has been used to call for deletions of \/pol\/ in the past, as well as having been used to stop the DIY safety squads and HWNDU threads. However, that board itself is not moderated in any meaningful way, leading to the previously mentioned bot and anime spam situation. I&#039;d highly encourage \/pol\/ to browse \/qa\/ as a secondary board, contributing or at least bumping threads of any relevance, and spam bombing shit threads that aren&#039;t being used. <br><br>We talk a lot about reclaiming countries, but I bet you guys won&#039;t even be able to colonize an unmoderated board on your &quot;home&quot; website.<br><br>So guys, if hypothetically we could legally take over another board, how would you feel about that? What would you want it to be used for?<br><br>PS \/qa\/ is a secret board that can only be accessed by url; go to the board index or catalog and change &quot;pol&quot; to &quot;qa&quot; to access it, or you can be hotlinked<br><a href=\"\/qa\/\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;&gt;\/qa\/<\/a>","filename":"Rodge Wants You","ext":".jpg","w":752,"h":938,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490938654783,"time":1490938654,"md5":"liwRxJ8NHA2olUjrP\/L7Vw==","fsize":100713,"resto":0,"id":"oTbVuLGG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-would-pol-feel-about-a-colony-board","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

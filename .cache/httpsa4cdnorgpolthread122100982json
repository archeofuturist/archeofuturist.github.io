I&#039;ve noticed, however, that a lot of the rhetoric about Bike Lock Guy and the others is that they are just fucked in the head and just randomly violent.<br><br>The Illuminati have been doing this for CENTURIES in countries. In the French Revolution, the Jacobins put posters all over Paris that said &quot;on this date, it will be legal to attack members of the government&quot;. They are planning this stuff out and it is part of a very old and very successful playbook.<br><br>I think that the key to really defeating the Marxist influence is to understand that they are following a playbook. This group is responsible for the French Revolution, the Bolshevik Revolution, and countless other bloody and inhumane political revolutions. As Americans, it is our duty to drive this force out of our free land.","filename":"frenchrevolution","ext":".jpg","w":790,"h":588,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":186,"tim":1492752176348,"time":1492752176,"md5":"gPiasCu4EMKjUf5nbmefcA==","fsize":314781,"resto":0,"id":"0y8V55Ii","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"antifa-violence-and-revolution","country_name":"United States","replies":21,"images":3,"unique_ips":10},{"no":122101176,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:25:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122100982\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122100982<\/a><br>Go on.","time":1492752301,"resto":122100982,"id":"RvXqQlxn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122101267,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:25:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bimp this shit.","time":1492752359,"resto":122100982,"id":"hJttGKUF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122101348,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)01:27:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"We need our own right wing Jacobins.

Weight almost nothing, carries like you don&#039;t carry anything and is very thin and comfortable in every pocket. Do not get CS big voyagers or other big blades, they are scam. Heavy, big blade bad blade geometry, stiff lock. The only tacticool knife from cold steel I would personally get is their push daggers. Ironically they are the only knife aside from some big stilettos that are really designed for killing but unlike them them require minimum training if you know how to land a punch and have basic fighting expirience. Its like brass knuckles 10 times more deadlier. The most terrifying part is no one will expect to carry something like this and instinctively will just block the punch, but guess what - cut tendons and blood loos. Most fist fights are like &lt;10 sec and &lt;3-5 punches, something like push dagger gives you huge advantage.","time":1490140096,"resto":117667794,"id":"g184CRHG","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":117689174,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)19:48:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117674792\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117674792<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do Americans have Drunken Fist fights in the street?

Also their try to reinvent the wheel now and then and spawn abominations like their golden eye shit they pulled recently. They also have very thick blades with no fuller or any concern about weight. Great you made long, wide blade that is 4mm thick. Put huge handles on it with metal inserts. Guess what - no matter how strong you make the lock it will always fail first you, so you added 30% more weight on pointless shit. Almost all of their knifes are to heavy or big for everyday carry.

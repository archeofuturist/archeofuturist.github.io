How can Americans actually make in through junior high not knowing the absolute basics of biology? Are you all dropouts? Or is your educational system that fucked?<br><br>First off, lets dis-spell this myth that there are only 2 genders? There are 2 biological sexes, that means the male reproductive organs and the female ones. Gender is not what you have between your legs, it is not an anatomical thing. Femininity and masculinity are cultural artifacts If you have a vagina and boobs you can still be masculine and vice versa- there is no &quot;natural&quot; law that prevents you from transgressing them.<br><br>Chromosomes only determine our anatomical bodily differences, but the notions of womanhood and manhood (i.e. GENDER) remain the products of a specific cultural development in our environment that should be critically analyzed in its proper historic contexts. <br><br>Gender IS a spectrum. It is a complex of performative acts defined by our culture not a natural biological category, it is what we make it to be.","filename":"bill-nye-lasers","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1066,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493451033352,"time":1493451033,"md5":"gJ6oZoSmDm\/7n\/puUWF1cg==","fsize":134833,"resto":0,"id":"0c9912L7","country":"SI","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"tthere-aare-only-2-gender-rright-teacher","country_name":"Slovenia","replies":9,"images":2,"unique_ips":10},{"no":123310079,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)03:34:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"bill nye the science cuck","filename":"franzia","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493451257198,"time":1493451257,"md5":"T3mAznyQIBabIptT5\/1rSg==","fsize":185174,"resto":123309841,"id":"dvOiXQAU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123310218,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)03:36:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123309841\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123309841<\/a><br>No, faggot who doesn&#039;t realize that biology has nothing to do with what he is describing as a cultural issue, you are wrong.<br>In our culture there are 2 genders.<br>What you are trying to do is change the culture with bullshit reasoning and starting discussions with &quot;I know about a subject that is irrelevant to this subject&quot;.","time":1493451393,"resto":123309841,"id":"gjtpW8e4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123310294,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)03:37:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123309841\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123309841<\/a><br>this is a fucking blatant attempt at trolling.

He thinks it&#039;s &quot;pointless&quot; that I pursue the truth and care about society (even though without truth seekers his comfy position of not giving a shit wouldn&#039;t exist). We were planning to buy property outside the city. I want to be self-sustainable, so I can produce truth content without worry of income. <br><br>I&#039;m 26-years old, white and I haven&#039;t met anyone &quot;red-pilled&quot; enough to fathom being with; this person is the least beta\/numale person I&#039;ve encountered. <br><br>Problem is depression, it destroys his motivation and rationality. Is there any advice for how create more consistency and motivation out of this person? I know I can&#039;t afford land on my own and under the mental illness there&#039;s a solid masculine person that would make a great father.","filename":"1490667824988","ext":".png","w":724,"h":597,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":206,"tim":1490984539781,"time":1490984539,"md5":"KCXn4HLQNzBa5tN2DVEnsw==","fsize":387983,"resto":0,"id":"NSpNq7O1","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpilling-my-boyfriend","country_name":"Canada","replies":67,"images":12,"unique_ips":46},{"no":119082889,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)14:23:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119082724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119082724<\/a><br>\/lgbt\/ is that way, fag. ----&gt;","time":1490984633,"resto":119082724,"id":"wOD8+fER","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":119082921,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)14:24:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119082724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119082724<\/a><br>Nag him more?

As someone who has the same goals and values you do (though I am male). Here is my honest advice:<br><br>- It wont be sustainable. This guy won&#039;t commit to the basic understanding necessary to do what you want - much less to the harder and more costly choices and challenges that Must come down the road. <br><br>I get that women basically parasitize men for their resources, and that&#039;s clearly what you&#039;re aiming for here. You get a few points for &#039;looking past&#039; his flaws and appreciating his values, but odds are that wont last. <br><br>For women, the 7-year itch is real. So all you&#039;d be doing is kicking the can most of a decade down the road, then risk losing it all. <br><br>That said, you&#039;re a woman, so odds are you could just divorce-rape him and get the benefit of his resources without needing to commit to him physically or emotionally. <br><br>You really have come to the wrong place for this. My honest advice; find a good man you&#039;re willing to commit and submit to. One who will be a sound and reliable leader and pater familias. Otherwise, your inherent female instincts will eventually kick in and sunder the whole thing. <br><br>Right now, you know this. You&#039;re just grasping at straws hoping someone will tell you; <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No, it will be Okay. Go with this simp and it will all be fine. You don&#039;t need to worry about the challenge of dropping him and finding a new man in a rapidly shrinking dating pool. <\/span><br><br>Unfortunately, its not the case. So there&#039;s the hard truth. If you want to achieve your goals, you&#039;re going to have to accept this setback, acquire a better partner, and build from there. Otherwise, you&#039;re building on a shaky foundation that cannot help but give way, eventually. <br><br>Buuuut, you&#039;re a woman. And women operate on emotion rather than logic, so most of this will be lost on you. I won&#039;t be replying further until you perform due diligence and post tits. <br><br>Either way, good luck. You have a good plan and I should be so lucky as to find a woman with those values and goals.","time":1490986934,"resto":119082724,"id":"ZTV5kVlA","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119087072,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)15:02:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119086910\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119086910<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;spread the truth<\/span><br>what truth are you spreading, honey?","time":1490986971,"resto":119082724,"id":"2miMu4ac","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119087074,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)15:02:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119082724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119082724<\/a><br>JESUS CHRIST, looks like Tim Horton&#039;s is running a nice P.C. commercial up in Canada.

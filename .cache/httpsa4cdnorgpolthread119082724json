He thinks it&#039;s &quot;pointless&quot; that I pursue the truth and care about society (even though without truth seekers his comfy position of not giving a shit wouldn&#039;t exist). We were planning to buy property outside the city. I want to be self-sustainable, so I can produce truth content without worry of income. <br><br>I&#039;m 26-years old, white and I haven&#039;t met anyone &quot;red-pilled&quot; enough to fathom being with; this person is the least beta\/numale person I&#039;ve encountered. <br><br>Problem is depression, it destroys his motivation and rationality. Is there any advice for how create more consistency and motivation out of this person? I know I can&#039;t afford land on my own and under the mental illness there&#039;s a solid masculine person that would make a great father.","filename":"1490667824988","ext":".png","w":724,"h":597,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":206,"tim":1490984539781,"time":1490984539,"md5":"KCXn4HLQNzBa5tN2DVEnsw==","fsize":387983,"resto":0,"id":"NSpNq7O1","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpilling-my-boyfriend","country_name":"Canada","replies":19,"images":3,"unique_ips":15},{"no":119082889,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)14:23:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119082724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119082724<\/a><br>\/lgbt\/ is that way, fag. ----&gt;","time":1490984633,"resto":119082724,"id":"wOD8+fER","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":119082921,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)14:24:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119082724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119082724<\/a><br>Nag him more?

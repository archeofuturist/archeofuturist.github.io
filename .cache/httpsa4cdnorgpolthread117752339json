Last year alone, there were 431 such acid attacks \u2013 a rise of 170 cases from the year prior. The figures match a general UK trend, in which the crime rate for such attacks has risen by 50% since 2005.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Globally, roughly 80% of victims tend to women. Attacks are often carried out by vengeful men who have had their marriage proposals or sexual advances rebuffed. However, acid attack charities in the UK estimate that British victims are predominantly men, at roughly 71% of victims. Jaf Shah, the executive director of the support group Acid Survivors Trust International (ASTI), told the Guardian: &quot;Looking at the data in general, there is a fairly large probability that a high percentage of the incidents are male-on-male attacks and most likely to be gang-related.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;The numbers appear to be very high and suggest an increase, which is very concerning.&quot; A former gang member described how acid attacks had become more acceptable and were not seen as a &quot;big deal&quot;. &quot;People don&#039;t think of the consequences,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#039;s easy to buy most of the ingredients legally\u2026One of my cousins was done a few years ago. He was attacked on his shoulder and my uncle just dressed it for him at home.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/archive.fo\/2hi2g<br><br>This is some third world tier shit.

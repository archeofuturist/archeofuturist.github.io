While this is important to know since if it&#039;s true it shows that Bannon truly is our man, it&#039;s also a convenient Segway to the next point...<br><br>For anybody who isn&#039;t brain dead, Kushner is an Israeli informant (read: spy) and Ivanka was likely given away to him in an arranged marriage to keep Trump in check, which of course means Trump was their man all along and has been for some time. Of course the same is true of Chelsea Clinton which goes to show that it never mattered who won. Jared Kushner is also acting as a sort of shadow Secretary of State, and just happens to be in Iraq as the Assad controversy is going on.<br><br>But it doesn&#039;t have to be that way. We have a target now. You all know what to do.","filename":"10trump-master768","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491513128998,"time":1491513128,"md5":"c6D+cdyy\/qenkk6T1bLY6A==","fsize":66254,"resto":0,"id":"7WBmaLU5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-the-rumor-flying-around-now-is-that-steve","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

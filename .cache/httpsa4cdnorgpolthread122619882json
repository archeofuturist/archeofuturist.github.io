Intelligibility of the laws of physics suggest an intelligence created them. <br>2. The argument from fine tuning is interesting on it&#039;s own, but the response usually asserted (muh multiverse) actually functions as an even better argument. See, the fine tuning argument suggests that it is vastly unlikely that a universe could be created so well tuned for life by accident with only one try. The common response is that this is in fact just one of a nearly infinite number of universe, and that these universes represent every possible universe. This, however, means there must be a transcendent creative intelligence, because if all possible universes exist, there is at least one where a transcendent creative intelligence exists, and that intelligence would be capable of transcending from that single universe into the multiverse, therefore meaning that the multiverse makes it impossible for there not to be. As such, there are in fact no universes without a transcendent intelligence. tl;dr, being a part of a multiverse means there must be a God of some sort, while being a part of a single universe means it is far more likely than not.","time":1493063745,"resto":122619882,"id":"j49BpI39","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122629151,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)15:56:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122628886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122628886<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Josep<wbr>hus<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tacit<wbr>us<br>These historians both talked about Jesus, and non were christian","time":1493063767,"resto":122619882,"id":"Y9mXlsmX","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":122629295,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)15:57:22","name":"Inb4MuhFedora","com":"<a href=\"#p122628098\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122628098<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Justice is required from God as well as mercy<\/span><br><br>How can God have any mercy when he gives infinite punishment for finite crimes?","time":1493063842,"resto":122619882,"id":"+5xlKkVc","country":"GR","trip":"!!6BK7QS9ZBXP","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":122629403,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)15:58:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"The Idea that Jesus was a myth was litteraly created in the Soviet Union by jewish &quot;historians&quot;<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/David<wbr>_Strauss<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chris<wbr>t_myth_theory","time":1493063895,"resto":122619882,"id":"Y9mXlsmX","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":122629476,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)15:59:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; An omnipotent, omnipresent, all-loving creator of the universe.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Pretty much what the average christian believes.<\/span><br><br>one problem here is OP&#039;s reductive definition of God<br><br>Christian theology holds that God is infinite in all his attributes, so while it is true that he is infinite in Love, God is also infinite in his Wrath against Sin<br><br>if you haven&#039;t factored this into your framework, you have yet to seriously engage with the Christian worldview","time":1493063945,"resto":122619882,"id":"rT8WuCkV","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122629593,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:00:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122629110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122629110<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if all possible universes exist, there is at least one where a transcendent creative intelligence exists<\/span><br>why? it&#039;s a massive leap to assume that anything could jump universes<br>&quot;possible worlds&quot; is retarded at any rate, people who invoke it deserve to have this annoying criticism thrown at them lmao","time":1493064008,"resto":122619882,"id":"\/\/mOd49T","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":122629608,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:00:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122628886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122628886<\/a><br>The bible speaks in parables, your meme is kindergarten non sense.","time":1493064014,"resto":122619882,"id":"S18tc7W3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122629679,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:00:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122628886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122628886<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The region where Jesus lived was full of historians that never mentioned him<\/span><br>lol why would they??

You want to romanticize God so desperately that is why you cling to the old outdated belief systems. I don&#039;t promote disregarding all of those teachings, they have purpose of course, but to take it to literal terms in our current understanding of the universe is exactly to believe we&#039;re in a flat earth. The Old Gods are refutable and ridiculous as they are romanticized into having anthropomorphic traits like love when in reality only certain biological beings are capable of love. It is not meaningless, it is so complex. It is not entirely sentient. The only sentient beings are humans so far to our understanding.<br><br>We are the universe experiencing itself in human form.

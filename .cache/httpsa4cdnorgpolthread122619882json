Intelligibility of the laws of physics suggest an intelligence created them. <br>2. The argument from fine tuning is interesting on it&#039;s own, but the response usually asserted (muh multiverse) actually functions as an even better argument. See, the fine tuning argument suggests that it is vastly unlikely that a universe could be created so well tuned for life by accident with only one try. The common response is that this is in fact just one of a nearly infinite number of universe, and that these universes represent every possible universe. This, however, means there must be a transcendent creative intelligence, because if all possible universes exist, there is at least one where a transcendent creative intelligence exists, and that intelligence would be capable of transcending from that single universe into the multiverse, therefore meaning that the multiverse makes it impossible for there not to be. As such, there are in fact no universes without a transcendent intelligence. tl;dr, being a part of a multiverse means there must be a God of some sort, while being a part of a single universe means it is far more likely than not.","time":1493063745,"resto":122619882,"id":"j49BpI39","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122629151,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)15:56:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122628886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122628886<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Josep<wbr>hus<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Tacit<wbr>us<br>These historians both talked about Jesus, and non were christian","time":1493063767,"resto":122619882,"id":"Y9mXlsmX","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":122629295,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)15:57:22","name":"Inb4MuhFedora","com":"<a href=\"#p122628098\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122628098<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Justice is required from God as well as mercy<\/span><br><br>How can God have any mercy when he gives infinite punishment for finite crimes?","time":1493063842,"resto":122619882,"id":"+5xlKkVc","country":"GR","trip":"!!6BK7QS9ZBXP","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":122629403,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)15:58:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"The Idea that Jesus was a myth was litteraly created in the Soviet Union by jewish &quot;historians&quot;<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/David<wbr>_Strauss<br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Chris<wbr>t_myth_theory","time":1493063895,"resto":122619882,"id":"Y9mXlsmX","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":122629476,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)15:59:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt; An omnipotent, omnipresent, all-loving creator of the universe.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Pretty much what the average christian believes.<\/span><br><br>one problem here is OP&#039;s reductive definition of God<br><br>Christian theology holds that God is infinite in all his attributes, so while it is true that he is infinite in Love, God is also infinite in his Wrath against Sin<br><br>if you haven&#039;t factored this into your framework, you have yet to seriously engage with the Christian worldview","time":1493063945,"resto":122619882,"id":"rT8WuCkV","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122629593,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:00:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122629110\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122629110<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;if all possible universes exist, there is at least one where a transcendent creative intelligence exists<\/span><br>why? it&#039;s a massive leap to assume that anything could jump universes<br>&quot;possible worlds&quot; is retarded at any rate, people who invoke it deserve to have this annoying criticism thrown at them lmao","time":1493064008,"resto":122619882,"id":"\/\/mOd49T","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":122629608,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:00:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122628886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122628886<\/a><br>The bible speaks in parables, your meme is kindergarten non sense.","time":1493064014,"resto":122619882,"id":"S18tc7W3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122629679,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:00:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122628886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122628886<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The region where Jesus lived was full of historians that never mentioned him<\/span><br>lol why would they??

For an object to be finite, there must be something that exists that the object lack or is not capable of(If it is capable of everything then it is infinite). So, say you have object A which, from what we can tell, is capable of everything except for one thing. Since that one thing must exist for A to lack it or not be capable of it, then we must have object B, which is capable of the one thing that A is not. We then realize that A and B, together, lack the unification of what each of them are capable of. Therefore C, the unification of A and B must exist for them to lack it or not be capable of it. However C can do everything, so C is infinite and it is not possible for C to not exist.<br><br><br>A note on what I mean by infinity:<br>I am not referring to a mathematical infinity. I am simply defining it as &quot;no limit&quot; which is the origin of the word. If I had a set of all real numbers but took out the number 1, I would still have a mathematically infinite set, but I would no longer have a set of all real numbers. So drawing an analogy from above, &quot;an object is infinite if it contains all real numbers and is finite if it does not&quot; even though missing one number still leaves you with a mathematical infinity.","time":1493065091,"resto":122619882,"id":"FJl0csq3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122631803,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:18:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122631409\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122631409<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;No, it doesn&#039;t.

The Bible and what most religions teach being an example of that is laughably unlikely. They resemble folk tales and what a civilization would do to make up a god much more than the actions of an intelligent lifeform whose goal is to convince us of their existence, and lay out an agenda for us to follow.","time":1493066251,"resto":122619882,"id":"JIFT0hkE","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":122634287,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:38:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122633896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122633896<\/a><br>Seeing as you cant be bothered to said anything of substance i declare myself the winner of this argument","time":1493066287,"resto":122619882,"id":"pi2OPWJB","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":122634657,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:41:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122634126\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122634126<\/a><br>What part of everything do you not understand?

After that He wouldn&#039;t have to alter anything, just watch the whole thing play out. And that&#039;s where it gets fun. If you were God and had just started the universe what would you want to do? Experience it, play the game. I believe each and every one of us IS God, playing the game and having a different experience every time. And when we die our consciousness rejoins the One Mind and our experiences are shared with everyone. When one with God it&#039;d be one big forum talking about what life, existing, and how great God is for creating the universe(game). I see each of us as a meaty finger puppet with a God fitting as much of its consciousness in as it can. Those with more awareness of their true origins may be who we consider to be enlightened ones. And it would also explain the weird cases of kids remembering past lives and proving it. Perhaps they were reborn so quickly they remembered their old life, or maybe kids are just closer to God and forget that connection as they live life. Anyway, thats my take on things so far.

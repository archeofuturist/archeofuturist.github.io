For one, by the very nature of kidnapping, you have placed the homeless man on your property without his consent. Secondly, if you withdraw your consent to a homeless man who you have previously invited, you would not be justified in killing him when you can simply ask him to leave, or eject him from the premises, or even call the police to remove him without you lifting a finger. However, if the homeless man refuses to leave and starts shitting on your carpet and breaking furniture, you are not obligated to wait until he is finished before expelling him. It doesn&#039;t matter if he may starve to death on the streets, the most pressing concern is the immediate violation of your property rights.<br><br>A much better analogy would be the hot air balloon pilot inviting a guest for a ride, and then deciding 300m up that he wants the guest to get out. Obviously it is unreasonable and unjustified for him to throw the guest out on the basis of a property rights violation.

By around Nixtons term we had been running consistent bombing campaigns against Hanoi, eventually forcing the north Vietnamese to the negotiating table. The Paris Peace Accords created a cease fire in Vietnam, and also negotiated the withdrawal of U.S troops (as the war itself was seen as over, and political pressure at home got heavier by the day). The U.S agreed, upon withdrawal, to give south Vietnam full material support based on a point by point system- one helicopter for one downed helicopter, one rifle for one broken rifle, etc. This would&#039;ve allowed the south to continue and win the war without our direct involvement, should the ceasefire collapse. However, following nixons resignation and the resulting congressional shakeup, democrats eliminated the supply measure from the budget and left south Vietnam on its own. Emboldened by this severing of support, North Korea (still with Chinese\/USSR support) broke the cease fire and easily conquered the south, ultimately conquering Saigon and winning the war.

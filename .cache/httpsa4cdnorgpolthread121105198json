There&#039;s a Soviet neuropsychologist called A. R. Luria who, among other works, traveled to Soviet Uzbekistan to study the effects of Soviet literacy programs on the Uzbeki peasantry. He interviews a bunch of pre-literate Uzbeki&#039;s and asks them questions that involve abstract thought. For example, they are asked to choose an object that does not belong, out of a hammer, a saw, a block of wood, and a hatchet. Instead of dividing the objects by abstract categories, the Uzbeks view them in a very concrete and functional manner. Check out this video for a re-enactment of that interview, the second link is the full version:<br><br>https:\/\/vimeo.com\/32929417<br>https:\/\/vimeo.com\/50567570<br><br>They&#039;d do abysmally on an IQ test, and yet, they aren&#039;t &quot;dumb&quot; per se, they just haven&#039;t been exposed to that mode of thinking yet. Most people in Uzbekistan are now literate and high school educated so they have no issue with questions like that now. My point being that while genetics does influence one&#039;s ability to abstract, and blacks consistently underperform on measures of abstract thought, culture still plays an important role in exposing and educating people in the modes of thinking that enable abstraction. That&#039;s what much of elementary school really is, trying to impart that capacity to children who aren&#039;t necessarily interested in it. Blacks only have a few generations of even elementary school education now, and much of it is highly inferior to non-black education both in America and Africa. The most successful groups of Africans, such as the Ibo, are precisely the groups of Africans that engaged in colonial clerical work and received quality British education for generations. The Ibo were an oppressed and impoverished minority prior to British colonialism, and now they outperform chinks and poos in the UK.","time":1492211685,"resto":121105198,"id":"i199x7J2","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121130249,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:15:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121124896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121124896<\/a><br>The glaciers didnt effect the tropics or subtropics or the cradle of civilization.","time":1492211707,"resto":121105198,"id":"qXYSfoNo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121130610,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:18:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121127460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121127460<\/a><br>You pwnd that bitch.","time":1492211895,"resto":121105198,"id":"qXYSfoNo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121130741,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:19:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121116951\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121116951<\/a><br>Wrong.","time":1492211960,"resto":121105198,"id":"icFrXhkV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121130776,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:19:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121111794\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121111794<\/a><br>Some of us got lucky to not have any negro in us, ancestry.com confirms I am white as well, clean of negro blood.","filename":"White","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":1024,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492211976806,"time":1492211976,"md5":"LN6u8AoPyhrL4rLpuZRLXQ==","fsize":169636,"resto":121105198,"id":"24Q2jrx+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121130800,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:19:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121105565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121105565<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;thinks words in a 2000 year old book are more valid than empirical evidence.<\/span>","time":1492211988,"resto":121105198,"id":"5raJQCIL","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121130876,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)19:20:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121122963\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121122963<\/a><br>The &quot;joke&quot;

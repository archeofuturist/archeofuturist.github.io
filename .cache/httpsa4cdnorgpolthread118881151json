Encouraging homosexuality is rooted in the perspective which says that individual human liberty is the highest value, and anything which impedes individual human liberty is evil or wrong. Contrary to your statement that you do no have morals, the privileging of liberty above all other values is itself is a moral statement, and one that has arguably led to the normalization of hedonistic activity such as clubbing, hook-up culture, drug abuse, etc., and the myriad of negative societal outcomes that accompany that behavior.

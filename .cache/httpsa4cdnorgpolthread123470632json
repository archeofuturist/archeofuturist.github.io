Back in my day when you had a disagreement, a fight, a bad break up etc it was not broadcast across social media. You didn&#039;t have social media as an indication of your status in life. <br><br>In my day yes you could look around and see that johhny had a nice car and maybe had a better life than you. However you didn&#039;t have everything blasted in your face 24\/7.<br><br>If somone wanted to get under your skin or fuck with you they would literally have to come to your house. <br><br>You got updates from REAL friends from actually seeing them or contacting them via awesome cordless phones (kek). <br><br>Now adays people are offing themselves because they are harrassed via the internets, they are offing themselves because of the vast loneliness that is the social media age provides (for the most part). <br><br>I am glad i grew up before the internet. I was 17 when i first discovered IRC and hung out on various efnet channels, perused bbs boards etc. <br>I remember those beginning days of my internet experience being so pure and enjoyable. Frustratingly slow, but full of discoveries. The same kind of discoveries i had as a kid actually playing outside, when everything was magic.","time":1493558976,"resto":123470632,"id":"xtQPL6bk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123477568,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)09:31:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123470632\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123470632<\/a><br>Live music was cheaper, most national touring groups never charged more than $15 a ticket.

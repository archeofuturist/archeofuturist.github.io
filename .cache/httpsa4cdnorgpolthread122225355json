This video by Storm Clouds Gathering is a good analysis of the geo-political background to the situation [1] https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=K20<wbr>fm2166WM<br><br>First, it is important to know the basic alliances. Countries that support the Syrian government are Russia, China, Iran<br>and Iraq. The anti-Assad axis (countries pushing for regime change in Syria) are: United States, France, UK, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Turkey and Israel. An important reason for this geo-political conflict is control<br>of oil and gas resources in the region. In 2009 Qatar proposed a natural gas pipeline which would have passed through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Turkey and into Europe [2]. However, Assad rejected this. Instead in 2011, he formed a pact with Iraq, Iran and Syria to run a pipeline eastward, cutting Qatar and Saudi Arabia out of the arrangement. This gives a strategic advantage to the Shia faction and the Sunnis resent this. It also gives Russia an economic advantage over the US in oil and gas trading.","filename":"ZionistsForTrump","ext":".png","w":1032,"h":263,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":63,"tim":1492829035697,"time":1492829035,"md5":"GZXIhwadaNVhrQ3mkRzv3Q==","fsize":107467,"resto":0,"id":"UWcF2bQY","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"world-war-iii-real-motives-behind-trumps-missile","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":10,"images":2,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122225646,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)22:46:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122225355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122225355<\/a><br><br>Sectarian geopolitics are an important factor. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and Jordan - the middle eastern countries involved in the anti-Assad axis are majority Sunni muslim states. ISIS is a sunni jihadist organization which means it is the enemy of the Shia faction and targets them. It serves the interests of the Sunni countries even as it threatens them [1]. The covert origins of ISIS are interesting. Former Nato General Wesley Clark stated that ISIS was founded by the US and their &quot;friends and allies&quot; in the region to take down Hezbollah - Lebanon&#039;s military. The &quot;friends and allies&quot; he referred to are Saudi Arabia and Israel. (Saudi Arabia is an ally to the US as the Saudis sell oil to the Americans and American foreign policy is strongly influenced by Zionist interests).<br>He also said that religious zealots are the ideal kind of proxy military force for a sectarian conflict such as the one in the middle east [4]. Obama openly admitted the US was arming, funding and training the ISIL\/ISIS proxy military [5].","time":1492829215,"resto":122225355,"id":"UWcF2bQY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122225883,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)22:49:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"In 2011 John McCain was photographed meeting the leaders of Wahhabist (Sunni jihadist) organizations in Syria [6].

Controlled mainstream media would have us believe that Assad&#039;s regime is responsible for the recent chemical weapons attack on civilians, which it was not. Such an action would just piss off friends and enemies alike and for no military advantage would have been utter madness.<br><br>This was a false flag that has been planned for several years. On January 29th, 2013, the Daily Mail published an article titled &quot;U.S. \u2018backed plan to launch chemical weapon attack on Syria and blame it on Assad\u2019s regime\u2019 and a few days later they deleted the article. Why did they delete it? Almost certainly because people in high places knew of this plan and didn&#039;t want it getting out. This false flag is nothing but an excuse for America to enter Syria with boots on the ground to help Israel and its proxies turn the tables in their losing battle.. Trump is a well known Zionist cuck. Furthermore, Syria does have any chemical weapons. This was proven by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) - a UN organization [9].","filename":"daily mail article","ext":".png","w":656,"h":618,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1492829862768,"time":1492829862,"md5":"mHoZFJe79prvqwfKsxgT3A==","fsize":276974,"resto":122225355,"id":"UWcF2bQY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122227486,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:05:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122226752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122226752<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122226752\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122226752<\/a><br>This false flag attack was the excuse for Trump&#039;s attack on the Syrian al-Shayran airbase in which he launched 59 Tomahawk missiles at it, the false pretext being to stop the spread and use of chemical weapons.

Consequently they have shut down<br>treaty talks with the US and are moving more warships into the Meditteranean Sea, where Trump&#039;s missile attack was launched.

At least half of his advisors are Council of Foreign Relations globalists [10]. Their ultimate goal is to establish a one world government with a one world currency. Vladimir Putin has begun preparing to release Russia from the grip of the Rothschild controlled central banks by trading in precious metals such as gold and the other BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) nations are on board with this [11]. Threatening their control over their central banks and the petrodollar guarantees hostility with the US - we have seen this before with Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya.<br><br>And now for the most sinister reason behind Trump&#039;s deliberate escalation of war. The globalists and the Illuminati elite are exposed. Their sinister machinations and plans for world domination have been exposed all over the internet, so what do they do in response? Start a war. A major war works wonders in creating a necessary distraction and destroying their opposition in the chaos. They then rebuild their central banking infrastructure and start over. This exact thing has happened before with Nazi Germany. They are trying to do it again.","time":1492830679,"resto":122225355,"id":"UWcF2bQY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122228265,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)23:13:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122228060\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122228060<\/a><br>&quot;We possess several hundred atomic warheads and rockets and can launch them at targets in all directions, perhaps even at Rome.

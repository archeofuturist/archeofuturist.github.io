The anti-Assad axis (countries pushing for regime change in Syria) are: United States, France, UK, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Turkey and Israel. An important reason for this geo-political conflict is control<br>of oil and gas resources in the region. In 2009 Qatar proposed a natural gas pipeline which would have passed through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Turkey and into Europe [2]. However, Assad rejected this. Instead in 2011, he formed a pact with Iraq, Iran and Syria to run a pipeline eastward, cutting Qatar and Saudi Arabia out of the arrangement. This gives a strategic advantage to the Shia faction and the Sunnis resent this. It also gives Russia an economic advantage over the US in oil and gas trading.","filename":"ZionistsForTrump","ext":".png","w":1032,"h":263,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":63,"tim":1492829035697,"time":1492829035,"md5":"GZXIhwadaNVhrQ3mkRzv3Q==","fsize":107467,"resto":0,"id":"UWcF2bQY","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"world-war-iii-real-motives-behind-trumps-missile","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":32,"images":4,"unique_ips":13},{"no":122225646,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)22:46:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122225355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122225355<\/a><br><br>Sectarian geopolitics are an important factor.

The covert origins of ISIS are interesting. Former Nato General Wesley Clark stated that ISIS was founded by the US and their &quot;friends and allies&quot; in the region to take down Hezbollah - Lebanon&#039;s military. The &quot;friends and allies&quot; he referred to are Saudi Arabia and Israel. (Saudi Arabia is an ally to the US as the Saudis sell oil to the Americans and American foreign policy is strongly influenced by Zionist interests).<br>He also said that religious zealots are the ideal kind of proxy military force for a sectarian conflict such as the one in the middle east [4].

Vladimir Putin has begun preparing to release Russia from the grip of the Rothschild controlled central banks by trading in precious metals such as gold and the other BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) nations are on board with this [11].

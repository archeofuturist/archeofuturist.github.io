This video by Storm Clouds Gathering is a good analysis of the geo-political background to the situation [1] https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=K20<wbr>fm2166WM<br><br>First, it is important to know the basic alliances. Countries that support the Syrian government are Russia, China, Iran<br>and Iraq. The anti-Assad axis (countries pushing for regime change in Syria) are: United States, France, UK, Germany, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Turkey and Israel. An important reason for this geo-political conflict is control<br>of oil and gas resources in the region. In 2009 Qatar proposed a natural gas pipeline which would have passed through Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria, Turkey and into Europe [2]. However, Assad rejected this. Instead in 2011, he formed a pact with Iraq, Iran and Syria to run a pipeline eastward, cutting Qatar and Saudi Arabia out of the arrangement. This gives a strategic advantage to the Shia faction and the Sunnis resent this. It also gives Russia an economic advantage over the US in oil and gas trading.","filename":"ZionistsForTrump","ext":".png","w":1032,"h":263,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":63,"tim":1492829035697,"time":1492829035,"md5":"GZXIhwadaNVhrQ3mkRzv3Q==","fsize":107467,"resto":0,"id":"UWcF2bQY","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"world-war-iii-real-motives-behind-trumps-missile","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":4,"images":2,"unique_ips":1},{"no":122225646,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)22:46:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122225355\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122225355<\/a><br><br>Sectarian geopolitics are an important factor. Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey and Jordan - the middle eastern countries involved in the anti-Assad axis are majority Sunni muslim states. ISIS is a sunni jihadist organization which means it is the enemy of the Shia faction and targets them. It serves the interests of the Sunni countries even as it threatens them [1]. The covert origins of ISIS are interesting. Former Nato General Wesley Clark stated that ISIS was founded by the US and their &quot;friends and allies&quot; in the region to take down Hezbollah - Lebanon&#039;s military. The &quot;friends and allies&quot; he referred to are Saudi Arabia and Israel. (Saudi Arabia is an ally to the US as the Saudis sell oil to the Americans and American foreign policy is strongly influenced by Zionist interests).<br>He also said that religious zealots are the ideal kind of proxy military force for a sectarian conflict such as the one in the middle east [4]. Obama openly admitted the US was arming, funding and training the ISIL\/ISIS proxy military [5].","time":1492829215,"resto":122225355,"id":"UWcF2bQY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122225883,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)22:49:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"In 2011 John McCain was photographed meeting the leaders of Wahhabist (Sunni jihadist) organizations in Syria [6].

Such an action would just piss off friends and enemies alike and for no military advantage would have been utter madness.<br><br>This was a false flag that has been planned for several years. On January 29th, 2013, the Daily Mail published an article titled &quot;U.S. \u2018backed plan to launch chemical weapon attack on Syria and blame it on Assad\u2019s regime\u2019 and a few days later they deleted the article. Why did they delete it? Almost certainly because people in high places knew of this plan and didn&#039;t want it getting out. This false flag is nothing but an excuse for America to enter Syria with boots on the ground to help Israel and its proxies turn the tables in their losing battle.. Trump is a well known Zionist cuck. Furthermore, Syria does have any chemical weapons. This was proven by the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) - a UN organization [9].","filename":"daily mail article","ext":".png","w":656,"h":618,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1492829862768,"time":1492829862,"md5":"mHoZFJe79prvqwfKsxgT3A==","fsize":276974,"resto":122225355,"id":"UWcF2bQY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

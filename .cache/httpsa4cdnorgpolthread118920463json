He should not be given promotion within our homes or church.&quot;<br><br>Much of Ayla&#039;s content &quot;fuses Mormon concepts with alt-right themes,&quot; writes Jim Dalrymple on BuzzFeed.<br><br>&quot;On Twitter, she retweets David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader, and uses the #whiteculture hashtag,&quot; he reports. &quot;She cites Mormon scripture as evidence that races should be separate.&quot;<br><br>Ayla, who could not be reached for comment, tweeted with approval the statement from Rep. Steve King, R-Iowa, that Americans &quot;can&#039;t restore our civilization with somebody else&#039;s babies&quot; and issued her own &quot;white baby challenge,&quot; saying &quot;I&#039;ve made six. Match or beat me!&quot;<br><br>Top officials in the 15.6 million-member Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints have already spoken out publicly in defense of refugees, even launching an initiative known as &quot;I Was a Stranger.&quot; The Utah-based faith favors immigration reform, urging lawmakers to strive to keep families together. And its message promotes diversity.","filename":"mormon","ext":".jpg","w":833,"h":502,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":150,"tim":1490880609951,"time":1490880609,"md5":"7JMXJNx5prsI5iPBwJyziQ==","fsize":42474,"resto":0,"id":"axbm0MMh","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"newspaper-shames-mormon-blogger-for-antirefugee","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":118921018,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)09:37:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118920463\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118920463<\/a><br>bump","time":1490881024,"resto":118920463,"id":"ycJt4STx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118921306,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)09:40:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Mormons are just American Muslims and blasphemers, bust she&#039;s right.","time":1490881242,"resto":118920463,"id":"MDx15EDa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

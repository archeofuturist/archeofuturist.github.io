I mean, if you truly love each other you&#039;ll stay together whether a piece of paper says you are together or not. If she wants to leave you, she is going to leave you, and has a good chance of taking the kids and much of your livelihood so you may never even see the kids again.

Papers don&#039;t make bonds, love makes bonds. If you&#039;re christian, and it&#039;s a religious thing, I guess I can understand, but having a religious thing be an official thing by the government seems all kinds of perverted and messed up to me.","time":1490643436,"resto":118534037,"id":"qJHGGP+P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118551248,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)15:40:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118550442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118550442<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Those laws are set up to prevent mature men (&gt;28) from claiming young wives and being able to mold them into virtuous adults<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;AoC law encourages serial monagamy aka dating which is degenerate but female preference<\/span><br>That&#039;s an interesting way of thinking of it. Women are followers by nature. They follow the male role model traditionally. 16-21 is when they are the most promiscuous and when they get most of the molding they will use to decide what kind of adults they will be, but is basically an untouchable age for older males in today&#039;s world. Men over 30 looking for girls around 20 and younger will be looked at badly. Which makes no sense. What kind of level headed parent wouldn&#039;t want their daughter being with a man who has a grasp on life, life experience, a stable income, assets to raise children, and has all his ducks in a row over some 21 year old guy her age who is just starting to experiment with alcohol and could end up being a total hooligan.

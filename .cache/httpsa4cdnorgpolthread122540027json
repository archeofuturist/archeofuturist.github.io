It&#039;s like someone having turrets--the online equivalent is shitposting. Most people can&#039;t control it, and of the people who reply, they themselves can&#039;t control the desire to post something and be listened to, so they try their best to come up with snarky remarks and sound cool, fishing for (you)s like a preteen scene girl. Meanwhile, because an influx of new posters are from plebbit, many of them don&#039;t even know how to sage threads. Either that or Hiroshima Nagasaki disabled the sage option. In any case, what you have is the result of vanity, loneliness and need for human contact, and the kinds of retarded acting that online anonymous communities naturally produce.<br><br>It&#039;s not smart. It&#039;s not funny. And it&#039;s guaranteed to continue happening as long as these people don&#039;t get banned for it. I used to own a board on the other chan and I banned people who acted like apes. The first few weeks were hectic because of all the whining, and then eventually, a nice community began to flourish. Mods here are very lenient though because you posting, visiting, and filling out Elon Musk&#039;s AI captchas provide them with just enough income to scrape by on server fees.","filename":"4chan founder Hiroshima killed by porn stash","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":638,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493007174881,"time":1493007174,"md5":"IdvVO8AzI77G1+QM2V7b\/w==","fsize":255207,"resto":122540027,"id":"2IgGu6wc","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

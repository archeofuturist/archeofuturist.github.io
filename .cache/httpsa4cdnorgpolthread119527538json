If there was really collusion, wouldn&#039;t we be looking at some TANGIBLE evidence that is actually actionable? The answer is yes. If the left had anything to actually go on, we would be seeing it and an investigation would be forthcoming - and don&#039;t give me some bullshit like &#039;Comey said the FBI is performing one&#039;. Comey is an Obama appointee. Based on his dereliction of duty in recommending Hillary be indicted we can all be sure of where his loyalties lie and whose pocket he is in. The opposition party has an interest in seeing this narrative continue, but an investigation never to begin. The reason is - once an investigation begins, actual TANGIBLE facts would come out - and it would become clear this is the most foolish and downright stupid, baseless fake scandal in our nations history. It&#039;s akin to the sinking of the Lusitania if it weren&#039;t so hilarious in its construction. On the other hand - it appears there is TANGIBLE evidence that implicates the Obama administration&#039;s top officials were complicit in using the powers of their office to disrupt the election....in favor of their own party.

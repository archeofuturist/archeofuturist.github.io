I actually know an Aussie guy that immigrated here (he&#039;s an old guy in his late 50s) and he&#039;s cool as hell. He told me that when he initially visited the USA, he was shocked at how kind everyone was. He thought we were all faking it (called it Mickey Mouse shit). I&#039;m assuming it&#039;s because the whole banter culture that the UK and apparently Australia has doesn&#039;t exist here. He is the only Australian I&#039;ve even known in my small town of 18k.<br><br>He is also an old drunk and I met him when I used to work at a liquor store. Ironically enough, he bought a lot of Fosters (no shit) because it&#039;s cheap as hell here. The swill is like 1.79 for a 32 oz can so he&#039;d buy like 6 of them a day.<br><br>Funny fact: he never spoke a word in the store for the first 5 months I was there until I rung him up and gave him his change.

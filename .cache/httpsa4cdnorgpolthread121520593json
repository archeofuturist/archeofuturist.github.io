Why do you think every boy looks like he&#039;s been feminized? Western society has done this to our children. It will surely happen to the Ahmeds, Pajeets and Ching chong bing bongs who come here as well (which is a good thing). Ahmed children will become feminized from exposure to estradiol and will start killing each other cuz muhammad said so, this is a good thing. What&#039;s a bad thing is that for some reason, conservatives have a problem with environmental protections yet are upset over their feminized children. You can&#039;t have it both ways, the only way to make sure your kids aren&#039;t made into gay little snow fairies is to clean out our water supplies and ban birth control (unless a woman needs it for medical reasons).","filename":"1492313114071m","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":576,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492432605635,"time":1492432605,"md5":"kISqzGEV0hAcrBVE9N\/EAA==","fsize":53939,"resto":0,"id":"7RVMQPba","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-the-neoliberals-and-neocons-will-never-tell","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121521010,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:41:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121520593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121520593<\/a><br>Aside from your little rant, is there any scientific evidence that drugs remain in recycled water supplies?

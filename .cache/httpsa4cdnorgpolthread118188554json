Keep in mind, I&#039;m not saying that something like this was a bad idea, but that it was a bad idea for Shia to do it. It&#039;s clear he has anger issues stemming from issues where he feels people don&#039;t &quot;take him seriously as an artist&quot; due to him being a kid actor and also the kid from those bad Transformer movies (and also one of the big reasons those movies were bad). It was just a bad move for him to do it. I think a comedian or some celebrity that doesn&#039;t take themselves so seriously would have been a better candidate for doing something like that, someone who could have laughed off the trolls instead of feeding them.<br><br>I feel kind of bad for Shia because his career was actually kind of turning itself around before this. It kind of seemed, for a while, he was willing to take himself less seriously and shrug off his past. People were starting to like him a little more, but this hwndu thing has really flushed any good will he had generated and he&#039;s back to being unlikable. Can&#039;t feel too bad for him, though, because he has no one but himself to blame.","time":1490419322,"resto":118188554,"id":"W33gXaSE","country":"KR","country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":118190206,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)01:22:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118188554\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118188554<\/a><br>black hat deserved it, but deserving it doesnt mean it should be done to you, as stupid as that sounds","time":1490419366,"resto":118188554,"id":"lWhuozqd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

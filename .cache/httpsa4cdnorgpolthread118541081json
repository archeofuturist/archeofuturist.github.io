If it happens in the heat of passion, as these things tend to do, the guilty party should have a chance to confess to their partner before it becomes a crime. Adultery should not be a crime; concealing adultery should be a crime. Married people should be allowed to fuck whoever they want, but should not be allowed to conceal their exploits from their spouses. Once the adultery is revealed, a divorce should be granted to the offended party that is massively in their favor if they so choose. they get to decide once whether they will do this or not, no going back. Forgiveness is permanent.<br><br>The punishments for men and women for concealed adultery should be different. A woman loses less than a man does when there is concealed adultery, so men should be punished less. A woman loses mostly emotional and financial support when another woman is involved; a man loses his very bloodline when his wife&#039;s womb is invaded by an outside party. The punishment for concealed adultery on a man&#039;s part should be the loss of all of his assets in the divorce if she chooses that route. The punishment for a woman&#039;s concealed adultery should range from the same all the way up to death -- if the woman planned the adultery, continued it for an extended period, and either became pregnant or was at reasonable risk of becoming pregnant with the other partner, that counts as an attempt to deny life to her husband. Life should be denied to her also if her husband chooses for that to be so.<br><br>TL;DR: If the husband cheats and lies, the wife only loses support, so the state should force him to support her even when he gets nothing back. If the wife cheats and lies, she&#039;s actually trying to kill off his genes and spread another man&#039;s genes which is a much more dire offense.

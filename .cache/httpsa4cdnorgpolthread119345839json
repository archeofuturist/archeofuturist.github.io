Look promptly at the Urinal. See that round mint floating there in what looks like residue piss? Go ahead and grab that and place it directly under your tongue. Its the latest progressive trend and everyone is doing it! The real high doesn&#039;t kick in until you go look in the mirror. Go ahead take a nice long look. After you have fulfilled your homosexual desires fucking bash your god damn head into the sink repeatedly until the mint under your tongue begins to taste like a black-cock foreskin.","filename":"1490979449282","ext":".png","w":2000,"h":3235,"tn_w":77,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491236697409,"time":1491236697,"md5":"nwcJH6OQyYxl1+nap0k\/SA==","fsize":149585,"resto":119345839,"id":"7TyWHvIJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119346447,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)12:29:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m not an asshole to them, I just don&#039;t want them around here.

Their economical projections (according to IMF) are retarded considering how massive and how fast their economy will balloon. The idea of india having the second or third largest economy in the world within 10-20 years isn&#039;t a meme, it&#039;s a reality.<br><br>Their population is projected to slowdown and hit its peak relatively soon, but due to their poor governing (tax collection etc) it won&#039;t have an effect on their economy. The better they get at collecting taxes, the more money they can pump into their country, which in turns makes it grow and flourish. Trade between India and the US will grow exponentially, projected to reach around ~$300 billion within 10 years, and it will only grow.<br><br>A more massive India means a less powerful China, India acts like a counterweight to the Chinese. Which is great for America and her allies (look up Indo-Japanese relations for instance). Hell, look up Indian and American relations to see how a more stabile india is better for you guys....from weapons dealings to a nuclear exemption that allows India the unique ability to trade nuclear technologies, India is a really vital ally for America...especially when it comes to China.","time":1492657203,"resto":121939408,"id":"We\/wMt9j","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121942333,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)23:03:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121941932\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121941932<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;China is slowing down<\/span><br>Say what?

You have to criticize critical theory because they are using critical theory to criticize you.<br><br>so then they reply, if they&#039;re a woman they&#039;ll either reply something like &quot;no science isn&#039;t mysognistic&quot; you can reply with &quot;but it was created by men, you can&#039;t honestly believe it&#039;s necessary for civilization&quot; or you can go for a more directed reply with &quot;so then why didn&#039;t you go for stem then?&quot; some variation. It has to be generated on the spot for effect, pre-prepared responses don&#039;t cut it. ultimately you&#039;ve trapped them. because you can alternate between rights and lefts and keep them in a circular loop Their only way to disengage you is to label you a troll but then you fucking grab them by the pussy with<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Wow where did that come from? Do you go around just giving people you argue with labels? Don&#039;t you think that&#039;s kind of offensive and demeaning?<\/span><br><br><br>trust me, I was raised by one of these maniacs but they failed to turn me. I&#039;m a rogue SJW that lives by eating other SJW&#039;s.<br><br>you have to crazy it up and use their own weapons against them. I&#039;ve seen these people shake off multiple sound factual arguments like they were a summer breeze and just keep going like some kind of unstoppable maniacle juggernaut. The only thing that phases them is when you step into their delusion and win. However, heed this warning: People who get frustrated over their ideals being invalidated often become very violent. Especially if you also hurt their pride. Pride is usually their only true posession. Be careful or you can wind up dead or worse.","filename":"1397447688697","ext":".gif","w":200,"h":133,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":133,"tim":1492179214156,"time":1492179214,"md5":"2aRPElUSn+e\/rxRquqf5Dg==","fsize":952616,"resto":0,"id":"nrnvtoIn","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"121056067","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121064786,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:18:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"OP is a true baitsmith.","time":1492179500,"resto":121064279,"id":"6xQSNRHC","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121065318,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:22:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nice","time":1492179778,"resto":121064279,"id":"nUDepkMF","country":"GE","country_name":"Georgia"},{"no":121065570,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)10:25:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121064786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121064786<\/a><br>feminists who started out as equalists but grew accustomed to the benefits of being &quot;anti-men&quot; are usually along for the ride and never really think about their actions, diffusing responsibility to the group.<br><br>You can return these people to equalism with a little effort. They&#039;ll most likely slip back again because people are creatures of habit and they prefer comfort and there&#039;s no real reason for them to not be feminists, but some will remain centered if you can manage to get them to self reflect and if their conscience is large enough.<br><br><br>Most though have just been disenfranchised and have had their anger co-opted.

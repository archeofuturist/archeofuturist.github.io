Feminine natures, feminism, the feminine divine...all these things were emphasized while masculinity specifically was de-emphasized. race specific beauty traits,like the idealized white beauty traits were de-emphasized and more universal, global majority traits were emphasized. Cosmetics and cosmetic surgery took off in Brazil.<br><br>there were some unexpected, but not unwelcomed side effects that helped expand the possible consumer market even more as effeminate men began buying the female cosmetic products, leading to the development of male beauty products.<br>This led to a direct rise in the numbers of homosexuals and then transsexuals. The emphasis on people of color being idealized also led to a lot of interracial dating with dark skinned men being the new ideal.<br><br>In 2008 the marketing program began in the USa and we have seen the exact same thing take place here...an explosion of homosexuality, of transsexuals and of interracial dating, while masculinity is shunned. We even see people that consume a lot of media begining to call themselves transracial.<br><br>it isnt a secret jewish plan to wipe out the white race though that is also along term side effect, and maybe not an unwanted one. It is a plan by Wall St globalist corporations to expand their customer bases. Whites are a minority around the world. until we return to a strict nationalism these companies will continue to market to the widest possible global consumer base. But if we do return to nationalism and stick to it, the companies will eventually return to marketing their products to specific markets. meaning countries with white majorities will be marketed properly and countries like brazil would have their own advertising strategies.<br>Thats the red pill. wall St is doing this.","time":1490822208,"resto":118820952,"id":"E4+tLRzv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118835595,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:17:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118820952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118820952<\/a><br>Brazilians are weirdly redpilled as fuck.

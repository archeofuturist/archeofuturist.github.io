So why now? Why are they pushing the fake news, &quot;Trump was overheard thinking about discussing potential military actions maybe&quot; so hard? It&#039;s to distract us from Susan Rice and the obvious false flag in Syria. We found the smoking gun and they&#039;ve made us forget about it in 2 days. There&#039;s one dying Rice thread somewhere on page a thousand and noone else talking about it. Are you really gonna let them do this to your board? Are you going to let them distract you from another scandal until it blows over like Benghazi, like the emails or hillary getting fucking debate questions in advance? I&#039;m not and that&#039;s why I&#039;m making this thread. With all the bullshit threads pedaling fake news and eliciting responses from idiots, all we can do is make an important thread ourselves for every bullshit thread the shills make. It&#039;s gonna take lurkers going outside their comfort zone, but it only takes a minute to do that. Take back your board.","filename":"1491421266683","ext":".jpg","w":807,"h":1200,"tn_w":168,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491506143323,"time":1491506143,"md5":"9HCeQwfnsI6kb9qqrxm8dQ==","fsize":219274,"resto":0,"id":"OL+VTowl","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"shillcon-1","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":3,"unique_ips":9},{"no":119782323,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)15:33:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"So pathetic that Noone cares.

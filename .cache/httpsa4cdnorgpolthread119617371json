This affects the Soros-funded CEU and a few irrevelant schools.<br><br>Now before you get your hopes up, its 99% certain CEU will stay, and the manner they teach will not change at all, so stuff like gender studes stay (which isnt even CEUs flaghip programme, that would be economics).<br><br>Thing is no one actually wants to lose CEU who has half brain. The reason is very simple, its super rich and has bigtime academic and business ties, which helps other Hungarian universities as well. Many members of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, particularly mathemaiicans are still in Hungary because CEU can pay them Western wages for teaching.<br><br>No, the reason for this attack is more complicated and multilayered:<br><br>1. On prole level its good distraction and bone for the bydlo to chew on. It also seeths up the classic urban vs rural conflict.<br><br>2. At medium level, there are several stuff concering Hungary that needs to be masked. On various corruption and democracy indeces we yet again slided down, Budapest&#039;s mass transit worker will have a strike within weeks, lot of high profile construction projects budget bubbled up suddenly, or controversial projects are in the making.<br><br>3. At the bottom of all, theres a secret service scandal in the brewing, theres only scarce info, but apparently Hungarian services are not trusted by other NATO services anymore because of Russian infestation, and theres potentially lot of dirt on so far unknown governement members that is said to soon surface.","filename":"16162029_ab20c5a5eb11c0dcdd8e9d902e6345b1_wm","ext":".jpg","w":727,"h":485,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491406583622,"time":1491406583,"md5":"IH4S362WPGfRahIvALJahg==","fsize":115813,"resto":0,"id":"y2tcLdn\/","country":"HU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"soros-university-stuff-aka-art-of-distraction","country_name":"Hungary","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

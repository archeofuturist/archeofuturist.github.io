After reading into it more and ignoring the Dark ages influence on Christ, I&#039;ve come to accept that Jesus was the last prophet and the son of God. <br><br>It&#039;s not just me reading and following some trend, I find anything that gives me a feeling my heart to mean something more. (Not a lust kind of feeling, a real energy kind of feeling). Then I look at something like Islam, its essentially the same as Judaism, as in if your not a Jew you&#039;re nothing and worth killing.

Unfortunately, I&#039;m watching so many women make terrible choices and life-decisions that end up handicapping them later in life. This social cynicism extends to men as well. In my judgement some people are simply dumb. This is why so many men (and women) act the way they do and make the choices they do.<br><br>The great social factors matter less and less to me. Increasingly I view everyone as individuals and see people&#039;s lives as their own. Good decisions matter most.

CASE IN POINT: QUR&#039;AN.<br><br>-----<br><br>Quoting WLC about the Gospel of Thomas:<br><br>&quot;Now what is the Gospel of Thomas? It is a writing which was discovered in Egypt just after World War II. It was part of a collection of Gnostic documents. Gnosticism was an ancient neareastern philosophy which held that the physical world is evil and the spiritual realm is good. Salvation comes through secret knowledge of the spiritual realm, which liberates the soul from its imprisonment in the physical world. The socalled Gospel of Thomas is shot through with Gnostic philosophy. It was no doubt part of the literature of a Gnostic Christian cult, much like New Age cults in our own day. Greek fragments of the Gospel of Thomas as old as AD 200 have been found, and most scholars would date the original to have been written in the latter half of the second century after Christ. One evidence of this fact is that the Gospel of Thomas uses vocabulary that comes from second century translations and harmonies of the four gospels.<br><br>Thus, the vast majority of scholars today regard the Gospel of Thomas as a derivative source from the second century after Christ which reflects the view of Christian gnosticism.&quot;<br><br>Source: http:\/\/www.reasonablefaith.org\/pres<wbr>uppositions-and-pretensions-of-the-<wbr>jesus-seminar","time":1490475819,"resto":118253134,"id":"xXuQNBTL","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118272512,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)17:08:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118253134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118253134<\/a><br>After 2000 years of humanity answering these questions and deep contemplation about the God of the Bible, in 2017 this anon figured it out.<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;walk down the gnostic path with me<\/span><br>No thanks.","time":1490476099,"resto":118253134,"id":"MbPEzsTR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118272623,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)17:09:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118271965\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118271965<\/a><br>No, no, no.

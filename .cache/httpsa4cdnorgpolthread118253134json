Something along those lines, and since we can&#039;t pronounce it today, we transliterate it to &quot;Yehovaa&quot; or &quot;Jehovah&quot;.","time":1490472235,"resto":118253134,"id":"xXuQNBTL","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118265280,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)16:05:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"So if Gnosticism is true, what happens after death if someone isn&#039;t enlightened ?","time":1490472337,"resto":118253134,"id":"nOnBSXcP","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":118265298,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)16:05:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118253134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118253134<\/a><br>ying and yang<br>one can&#039;t exist without the other","time":1490472347,"resto":118253134,"id":"qEx8D6eN","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":118265312,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)16:05:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118253134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118253134<\/a>","filename":"58a","ext":".jpg","w":573,"h":591,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490472355183,"time":1490472355,"md5":"xC\/\/ZSx9slqy11Hv7ybUzA==","fsize":110631,"resto":118253134,"id":"10fY2Z0z","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118265362,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)16:06:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118265118\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118265118<\/a><br>I forgot to add, that this first appeared in Genesis, so Moses wasn&#039;t the first to use it.<br><br>The word &quot;LORD&quot; in Genesis 4:26, also appears as &quot;\u05d9\u05b0\u05d4\u05d5\u05b8\u05d4&quot;<br><br>As I&#039;ve explained above, it&#039;s literally pronounced &quot;Yehovaa&quot;, which actually doesn&#039;t make much sense in modern Hebrew, but resembles close similarity to the words of &quot;Being&quot;.","time":1490472389,"resto":118253134,"id":"xXuQNBTL","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118265573,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)16:08:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118253134\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118253134<\/a><br>You&#039;re not a Christian lmao","time":1490472499,"resto":118253134,"id":"XjhgKU6V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118265775,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)16:10:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118261401\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118261401<\/a><br>Jesus was a real figure. <br><br>He has come many times in history to free us, such as when he came as Dionysus or Mithras.

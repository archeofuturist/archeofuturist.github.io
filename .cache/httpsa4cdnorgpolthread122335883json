Do you know what the number one correlated status is to unemployment? It&#039;s home ownership. You can&#039;t just sell a house whenever so you can move to get another job.

Corporations don&#039;t want you to have a wife. They don&#039;t want you to have a kid. And they would love that there&#039;s lots of expensive houses around them, because they can squeeze people desperate to make their house payments. <br><br>In theory you can never pay people less than the value of marginal land, but if you set up your society so that there is no marginal land (because, say, selling your home is very difficult, so you can&#039;t just go somewhere else, and you need credit to do anything goy, so you can&#039;t just give the bank the middle finger), then salaries can actually fall below the value of marginal land. <br><br>And now you&#039;re a third of the way to understanding how productivity has skyrocketed but wages have stagnated.","time":1492903769,"resto":122335883,"id":"suwuTih8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122345236,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)19:29:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122345161\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122345161<\/a><br>people have been screaming bubble for 15 years now","time":1492903791,"resto":122335883,"id":"Uh0Es\/O\/","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

They&#039;re basically all chads. Also, ever noticed how the white race seems to have an absolute epidemic of autistic, skinny, fat, ugly, losers etc. All of the 25+ year old virgins, shut-ins etc, never hear about a ton of such people from the lower races do you?

From fitting in like a fish in water in earthly life to being an actual alien, constantly clashing with the physical world.

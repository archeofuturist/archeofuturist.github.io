Everybody knows things are bad. It\u2019s a depression. Everybody\u2019s out of work or scared of losing their job. The dollar buys a nickel\u2019s worth. Banks are going bust. Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter. Punks are running wild in the street and there\u2019s nobody anywhere who seems to know what to do, and there\u2019s no end to it. We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat, and we sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us that today we had fifteen homicides and sixty-three violent crimes, as if that\u2019s the way it\u2019s supposed to be.<br>We know things are bad \u2013 worse than bad. They\u2019re crazy. It\u2019s like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don\u2019t go out anymore. We sit in the house, and slowly the world we are living in is getting smaller, and all we say is: \u2018Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms. Let me have my toaster and my TV and my steel-belted radials and I won\u2019t say anything. Just leave us alone.\u2019<br><br><br>Well, I\u2019m not gonna leave you alone. I want you to get MAD! I don\u2019t want you to protest. I don\u2019t want you to riot \u2013 I don\u2019t want you to write to your congressman, because I wouldn\u2019t know what to tell you to write. I don\u2019t know what to do about the depression and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street. All I know is that first you\u2019ve got to get mad. (shouting) You\u2019ve got to say: \u2018I\u2019m a human being, god-dammit! My life has value!\u2019<br><br>So, I want you to get up now. I want all of you to get up out of your chairs. I want you to get up right now and go to the window. Open it, and stick your head out, and yell: \u2018I\u2019m as mad as hell, and I\u2019m not gonna take this anymore!\u2019<br><br>I want you to get up right now. Sit up. Go to your windows. Open them and stick your head out and yell \u2013 \u2018I\u2019m as mad as hell and I\u2019m not gonna take this anymore!\u2019","time":1490206771,"resto":117798637,"id":"6phPj27R","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":117799864,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)14:20:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117798637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117798637<\/a><br><br>niggers don&#039;t know morse code","time":1490206822,"resto":117798637,"id":"W1MkDqFn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117800087,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)14:21:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117798637\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117798637<\/a><br>hopefully they will shut down poll soon. i reported this to fbi","time":1490206913,"resto":117798637,"id":"65DTlfGd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

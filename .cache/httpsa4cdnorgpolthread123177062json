In all honesty, I wouldn&#039;t put this past the CIA. It&#039;s not clear what the globalist plan is for Assad. Of course, both Putin and Trump are influenced by International Jewry in different ways, it&#039;s not so black and white. Remember that globalists want chaos. The wrong thing to do, in any case, is to bomb one of the few leaders who refuses to cede his nation to foreign-funded terrorists because some Jihadists gassed and village and blamed it on Assad without any credible evidence besides whatever Nikki Haley could pull out of her ass.","filename":"1490594033290","ext":".gif","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493388009314,"time":1493388009,"md5":"jzOM5zyK\/8LUmvjVrGvvaw==","fsize":379798,"resto":123177062,"id":"I0kjERuX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123197081,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)10:00:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123177062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123177062<\/a><br>Assad can say whatever the fuck he wants.

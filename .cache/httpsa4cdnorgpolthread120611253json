Rather than being &quot;le based crusader XDDD&quot; he just seems like he&#039;s betting his horses on a Shia victory, which is why he&#039;s letting Iran and Hezbollah turn Syria into Lebanon 2.0. His inaction on Chechnya just confirms this and it&#039;s funny because I&#039;ve seen people on this board defend Putin by saying radical Islam is an enemy of the Russians with Chechnya as an example, and yet Putin&#039;s solution has just been to put a radical muslim in charge and appease the Chechens, which will inevitably turn into a safe haven for radical islamist terrorists.","time":1491925296,"resto":120611253,"id":"1pP99abQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

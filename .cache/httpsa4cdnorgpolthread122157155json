I&#039;m probably medically disqualified to join. So if there was a draft and they needed as many people as possible, that might be my only way to serve in the military. My grandpa was drafted into the Korean war. It looks like we could have a Korean War 2.0 coming up. Imagine the liberal snowflakes on media freaking out over being drafted! It would help depussify this generation.","filename":"IMG_8456","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":1200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492794213761,"time":1492794213,"md5":"aPr\/ZMUCbAnL2TFr4SxBsg==","fsize":503543,"resto":0,"id":"NnnswThg","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"military-draft-discussion","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":5},{"no":122157862,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)13:11:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122157155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122157155<\/a><br>Digits Witnessed. I am kind of in the same situation. I don&#039;t think I would qualify, but I am 30 now and if the war was bad enough, I am definitely able to serve. Would you go the officer route (do you have a degree?) or maybe that isn&#039;t part of selective service. i am like two semesters short of a degree, but too sick and demotivated to go finish it.

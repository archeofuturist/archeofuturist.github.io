Read about societies that have attempted Communism.

They are not experts in all things. People who run businesses have spent their careers building expertise on a specific product\/service\/market. They know how to make their product, they know how much of it is in demand, they know how to get it to their customers. This is why they are ALSO allowed to dictate the price.<br><br>Under total government control, these business owners (usually stubborn capitalists) are removed, and replaced by people with ideological purity (or just government loyalty) and very little practical experiences.

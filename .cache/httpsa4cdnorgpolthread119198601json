The meme magic used to elect Donal Trump and make Brexit happen can be channeled to make Marine Le Pen win in France which would be the end of the EU. Rather than try to make pro Le Pen memes the best way to achieve this is with anti-EU memes.<br>The unelected bureaucrats in Brussels are flooding the continent with unskilled, unassimilated migrants from Africa and the middle east. They are trying to turn each country in Europe into a state in a &quot;United States of Europe&quot;. The third worlders they import are not only much easier to control but they will vote to keep the EU in power 100% of the time. Action must be taken now because every year the EU imports millions more from Africa to vote for them and soon Europeans will be outnumbered in their own continent <br><br><br>Post video links, pics, and anything else you think would open the world&#039;s eyes to what the EU is doing.","filename":"V6mmQKqKqpF4V4Ujh9-B-f5p_OVkznkkyZOWk2VB0y0","ext":".png","w":983,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":195,"tim":1491139471524,"time":1491139471,"md5":"Rw8GfSGGSx7jGGsiQdQ\/qw==","fsize":720652,"resto":0,"id":"2UyQ68ze","country":"IE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"antieu-general","country_name":"Ireland","replies":17,"images":9,"unique_ips":11},{"no":119198762,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:26:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"Briexit was a mistake<br><br>UK rejoin the EU.","time":1491139593,"resto":119198601,"id":"LU6dHnXr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119198832,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)09:27:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"wow there are a lot retards out here but you are fucking special<br><br>the EU is the only reason we have peace in Europe and you wan&#039;t to destroy it?<br><br>What are you?

I believe in Christianity because I believe it&#039;s true.<br><br>There are only two religions on earth suitable for the adult mind: Christianity and Confucianism. Christianity has obviously been distorted to such a great extent that it has become unbelievable to most people: I understand this. The true Christian churches are probably the Orthodox Churches (Armenian, Greek orthodox, etc). <br><br>If you have the time I would read the Analects by Confucianism. or &quot;sayings of Confucious&quot;. PDF&#039;s of both can be found on Google.<br><br>I also think there is obvious proof in God&#039;s existance. Objective morality for one. If anyone takes the time to study history and religion seriously, and by seriously I mean go into a Library and pull out encycolpedias that are 1,000+ pages long on the history of religion and ethics, he will discover quite quickly the unanimous belief in object morality across all races and cultures spanning thousands of years. How could they all of come to the same conclusion on morality and virtue if they had never met each other?<br><br>The fact of the matter is God has implanted His consciousness inside you. We are surrounded by God. We are inside of God. Of course God is not a person like you or me but a spirit beyond our comprehension. God means creator, afterall.<br><br>God cannot make himself any more present in this world than Shakespeare can in a production of Henry V playing at the rep this weekend. However, in a way, Shakespeare is present in the entire play. He wrote it. It was and is his creation. The actors are inside Shakespeare. Now I know this is not a perfect example. None can be perfect when attempting to describe the indescribable. But I take for certain, as did Confucius, Christians, and the great Philosophers (Epictetus, Seneca, Aristotle, etc) that God is a lot like this.","time":1492158944,"resto":121029214,"id":"hOKTInEm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121037741,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)04:36:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121029214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121029214<\/a><br>God is dead, we chilled him","time":1492158972,"resto":121029214,"id":"84RYVsXg","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121037757,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)04:36:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121037234\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121037234<\/a><br><br>he probably healed a few sick people.

But then if the &quot;science&quot; types who denounce an existance in God because they can&#039;t see him (even though, as we&#039;ve said, God is not a human like you or me but something completely beyond our comprehension), then how can they believe in Gravity? I don&#039;t see Gravity but I know it works. I don&#039;t see God but I know I am in his creation and I must do his will, and just like gravity, his good is object and ever constant, never changing.<br><br>So whenever someone says there is no proof of God they are either so withered with sin that they have lost touch with this objective good and fail to recognize it any longer, have a bizzare definition of God, or have mistaken it for something else. Both are perversions of thought, and the statement &quot;there is no proof in Gods existence&quot; should be contradicted in season and out of season whenever it is met. If God made himself truly present in his real form then it would destroy free will and what you would have would essentially be a bunch of computers free of personality and free of happiness.","time":1492159329,"resto":121029214,"id":"hOKTInEm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121038286,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)04:45:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121037311\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121037311<\/a><br>Jews want Christcucks to think Jesus was real<br>Fuck me why do I post","time":1492159510,"resto":121029214,"id":"14OswNxP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121038969,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)04:56:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121038286\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121038286<\/a><br><br>That is why (((they))) do everything to undermine Christianity in the West, because (((they))) want us to think Jesus was real?

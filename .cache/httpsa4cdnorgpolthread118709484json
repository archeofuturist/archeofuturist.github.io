Versions of the bill have twice passed the House by wide margins but then stalled due to lack of support from Democrats in the Senate and the Obama administration.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Analysts said the measure has a better chance to become law now that Republicans control both houses of Congress and the White House. Paul\u2019s son, Rand, the Republican senator from Kentucky, has introduced a similar measure in the Senate. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Democrats in the committee were firmly against the bill. \u201cThis bill would open the floodgates to political interference in monetary-policy making,\u201d said Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat from the District of Columbia. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, a Democrat from New York, said the measure would lead to higher interest rates because it would undermine the market\u2019s confidence in the independence of the central bank. Republicans said the measure was needed to rein in the Fed.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cIt is ironic that the arsonists that caused the financial collapse are now being given credit\u2026for putting out the fire. Almost every macroeconomist concedes in retrospect that [the Fed\u2019s] extended period of easy money led to the financial crisis,\u201d said Rep. Thomas Massie, a Republican from Kentucky. <\/span><br><br>https:\/\/archive.is\/iANdA<br><br>http:\/\/www.marketwatch.com\/story\/ho<wbr>use-panel-passes-bill-to-audit-the-<wbr>fed-2017-03-28","filename":"ed34c61f334a625fde3913f4c803b33475f278affb222f55c15b383053f07d1a[1]","ext":".gif","w":388,"h":432,"tn_w":224,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490741392731,"time":1490741392,"md5":"1fyGwNJwtPmmSEFo7+fPfQ==","fsize":2961884,"resto":0,"id":"SKbYRjKx","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"audit-the-fed-passes-house-panel","country_name":"United States","replies":292,"images":111,"unique_ips":180,"tail_size":50},{"no":118709856,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)18:52:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118709484\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118709484<\/a><br>Bump.

It is merely wishing and daydreaming.<br>It is useless and even bad for your success - counter-intuitive as this may seem.<br>It&#039;s the simplest, most common thinking that exists, it is automatic.<br>Just wishing what you want and aspire to be is trivial, everybody imagines<br>his wishes.<br>Wishing and dreams will not motivate to do anything much to reach your goals.<br>Check your past - what you wished for and what and where you are today.<br>You&#039;ll realize wishful, positive thinking gets you nothing good, ever.<br><br>Just do the opposite - but beware, it is cognitively more demanding! It can cause anxiety and strains thinking - as it is a more sophisticated thinking style.<br>Think negatively.<br>Imagine and list and ponder the reasons why you could fail, reasons why you<br>would __not__ reach goals and get what you want.<br>Then think about what you have to do to remove those causes for your future<br>failings from your life.<br>This kind of negative thinking has been popularized by Charles Munger, who basically describes it as &quot;Tell me where I will die, so I can avoid going there.&quot;","filename":"1493736448001","ext":".jpg","w":1680,"h":1050,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1493737417021,"time":1493737417,"md5":"5XQHf8PVAKfR3kmMTw4ISQ==","fsize":720545,"resto":0,"id":"r6NTKvg\/","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mental-trick-practice-negative-thinking","country_name":"Germany","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123775949,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:03:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Careful, it takes time, mental energy, and can cause you emotional pains.<br>But if you want to succeed and get further in life, this negative thinking, constant probing of your life for reasons why you could fail, is most advantageous.<br><br><br>Also:<br>Do not daydream how great a person you are, conquering things with your powerful space ship, or daydream about that fancy car, hot girlfriend or expensive house you will own and live in with your super-muscular body in wealth and ruling.<br>Instead,<br>imagine yourself as a future loser, lacking money, growing old without any success or personal power, in poverty, without wife and children, being obese and weak, having to live as a wage slave or drowning yourself in alcohol.<br>Be detailed, think and daydream negatively a lot!<br>It will cause fear and pain, anxiety and - motivation.<br><br><br>Positive thinking is like music or drugs - it causes you to stop achieving, <br>neutralizes you with nice, virtual imagery of your imagined good life - which subconsciously is registered as &quot;I am already or nearly great&quot; - making you passive, doing nothing, and therefore guarantee your future failures.<br><br>Practice negative thinking, if you are able to endure it!<br>It will, slowly but surely, empower you with a hatred towards everything that<br>is bad for you, therefore propel you forward to success by making you do all the right things and having you avoid the bad ones.","time":1493737427,"resto":123775923,"id":"r6NTKvg\/","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":123777229,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)11:17:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123775923\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123775923<\/a><br>I do this 100% of the time and my life is still shit.","filename":"1468039664106","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":612,"tn_w":122,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493738227892,"time":1493738227,"md5":"GvccFQO14MzrUC0tApWiQw==","fsize":96844,"resto":123775923,"id":"YAAFzcqz","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"}]}

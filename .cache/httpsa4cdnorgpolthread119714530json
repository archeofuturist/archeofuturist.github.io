Nor were they the only inspiration for today&#039;s ID politics.","time":1491480279,"resto":119714530,"id":"BVP1o2bE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119735850,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:06:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119731614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119731614<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/119734985#p119734985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119734985<\/a>","time":1491480377,"resto":119714530,"id":"mHo6R7\/5","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119735985,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:07:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119734161\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119734161<\/a><br>Ironic that you linked a video of a feminist, after you spent so much time denouncing ideology and identity politics.","time":1491480479,"resto":119714530,"id":"xwuTVxw+","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119737007,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)08:20:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119735985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119735985<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119735850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119735850<\/a><br><br>You can&#039;t deny that Cultural Marxism is ACTUALLY a critique of The Culture Industry:<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Cultu<wbr>re_industry<br><br><a href=\"#p119735719\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119735719<\/a><br><br>I agree.

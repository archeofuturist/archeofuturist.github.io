The origin was clearly with right-wing \/ alt-right groups that used it as an insult toward liberals \/ globalists for their progressive policies that essentially worked to their disadvantage but supported them all the same. It\u2019s the same as in cuckoldry, where a man allows another to have sex with his wife and somehow enjoys it. Globalists were called cucks because they allowed other countries to benefit as their own country suffered.<br><br>The left\u2019s attempt to retake this word is just like any other \u201cword retaking\u201d movement like with nigger, yankey, queer, etc. Only problem is that here it doesn\u2019t make sense, it\u2019s not only an immature insult but it\u2019s one with no basis in its origin other than it being a label they want to shed themselves off. <br><br>Has anyone else noticed this? We have media that ordinary people indulge in like the Daily Beast and the Colbert Report that use the word \u201ccuck\u201d and terms like \u201ccuckservative\u201d. Is there any good way to handle this? The word itself isn\u2019t important, but it\u2019s not a good sign that liberals can get away with just turning this term around with no spin or creativity involved.","filename":"Screenshot 2017-04-11 11.13.25","ext":".png","w":1207,"h":769,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":159,"tim":1491927330312,"time":1491927330,"md5":"W6Ukny5laSCO7oxGA80vzQ==","fsize":135614,"resto":0,"id":"RDa0zLEf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-is-it-that-liberals-are-suddenly-trying-to","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Funny now, with the very same narrative being reused to say the same thing about Bannon<br><br>- in the beginning of the campaign when name recognition was more important than anything else he had Lewandovsky, starting shit to guarantee media access and coverage (even when negative)<br>- when he lost WI and Iowa due to Corey lack of understanding of party machinery he brought Manafort, the delegate hunter. He then delivered a swift path to 1237<br>- when he needed a smooth RNC he brought Reince and Spicer onboard. They ensured, along with Manafort, there would be no party coup or dissent at that moment (unlike DNC and Bernie supporters)<br>- after that, when Trump biggest problem was lack of media access (with the whole media endorsing Hillary and threatening a blackout on his campaign) he brought Bannon and his alternative media outlets: Breitbart and &quot;frog Twitter&quot; to push his message out<br>- at the same time when traditional pollsters were pushing misleading numbers based on false premises (2012 turnout) Trump brought KAC on board and even stiffed his old incompetent pollster. <br>- at the same time Manafort became a liability due to his Russian and Ukrainian connections so he was benched to give way to Kellyanne and Bannon<br><br>Fast forward to now.

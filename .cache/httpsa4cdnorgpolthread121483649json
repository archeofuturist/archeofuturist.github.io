In February, she pleaded guilty to multiple counts of felony child abuse. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Robinson&#039;s boyfriend, Joshua Granger, also was sentenced to life in prison for allegedly beating two children and aiding Robinson. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Police came to Robinson&#039;s home in September 2014 after she tried taking her granddaughter to the hospital, KFOR reported. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The girl, 7, appeared to be malnourished, had burns and bruises all over her body, and infected cuts on her ankles, according to a police report. Her wrists also had marks that &quot;had the appearance of possibly being bound.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The girl told authorities that her grandmother would dress up as a witch named &quot;Nelda&quot; and torture her, according to KFOR.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Robinson allegedly would wear a green mask and punish her granddaughter by binding her wrists and making her sleep on a pair of pants in the garage.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Other times Robinson, dressed as &quot;Nelda,&quot; would &quot;take a pink dog leash and hang the victim in the middle of the garage underneath her arms.&quot; Robinson then would tell the girl the &quot;the creatures in the attic were going to come get her,&quot; according to KFOR.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Granger would stand by and help Robinson take on her witch persona, prosecutors said. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Officials found a witch hat, chains, and whips allegedly used to torture the girl at the scene, police said.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Though Robinson&#039;s defense argued the sentence was too harsh because the child did not die, the judge said Robinson robbed her granddaughter&#039;s innocence and &quot;sparkle,&quot; KFOR reported.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;She has scarred them for the rest of their lives,&quot; Prosecutor Merydith Easter said in court on Thursday.<\/span><br><br>What do you think?

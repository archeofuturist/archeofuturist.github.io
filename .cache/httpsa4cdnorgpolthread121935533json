Remind me again why you don&#039;t engage in degeneracy. It&#039;s because it leads to social, moral, and physical decline. Degenerates are inferior and are less likely to survive than people who uphold family values and maintain self-control. Opening the floodgates is what will wash away all the riff-raff on the streets. You think the man with a prescription opiate habit will live to see the next 5 years when he has access to all the heroin he wants? Of course not; he&#039;ll probably overdose in the first day.<br><br>It&#039;s the law of the jungle: those less fit to survive must adapt or die.

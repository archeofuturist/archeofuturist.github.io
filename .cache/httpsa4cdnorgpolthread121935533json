Remind me again why you don&#039;t engage in degeneracy. It&#039;s because it leads to social, moral, and physical decline. Degenerates are inferior and are less likely to survive than people who uphold family values and maintain self-control. Opening the floodgates is what will wash away all the riff-raff on the streets. You think the man with a prescription opiate habit will live to see the next 5 years when he has access to all the heroin he wants? Of course not; he&#039;ll probably overdose in the first day.<br><br>It&#039;s the law of the jungle: those less fit to survive must adapt or die. Degeneracy decreases fitness, and most people can&#039;t adapt. Institute a completely free market and watch as the blacks, trust-fund pot heads, and commies melt away.","filename":"1200px-Gadsden_flag.svg","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":800,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492653967286,"time":1492653967,"md5":"bWPkgADB8BCeOFKtfTzI0Q==","fsize":121598,"resto":0,"id":"1hq+j84j","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"alright-nazifags-listen-up","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":3,"unique_ips":7},{"no":121935696,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:07:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s very easy for otherwise upstanding citizens to fall victim to drug abuse, which will lead to societal collapse as the drugs will be available to anyone.","time":1492654043,"resto":121935533,"id":"2c0iBBjV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121936007,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)22:09:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121935696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121935696<\/a><br>Alcohol is one of the most destructive drugs there is, and anyone can get as much as they want.

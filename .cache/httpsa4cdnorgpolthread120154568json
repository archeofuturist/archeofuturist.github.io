It would cut our costs of going to orbit from about $2000\/kg to about $1\/kg. There are individual asteroids that have tens of trillions of dollars in materials on them that could be mined. One mission could easily pay for the cost of building the Orbital Ring.<br><br>We could then deploy solar power satellites in orbit above cloud cover and return the power back to the surface with near zero loss by running power transmission cables down the elevator, and sell the power at a profit.<br><br>With increased luminosity in space, enhanced exposure time, and the ability to deliver base loads, solar panels pay for themselves in only 1-2 years while having a 20 year life time.<br><br>In other words, if you put $5 trillion of solar panels into space, you get your $5 trillion back by the end of year two and a $5 trillion income stream each year thereafter.<br><br>In other words, the US could cut everyone&#039;s taxes, both personal and business, income, capital, death, or otherwise, all to 0%, not even cut any benefits or current spending, and pay off the national debt within a decade.","filename":"Jeb","ext":".jpg","w":596,"h":444,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":186,"tim":1491671445653,"time":1491671445,"md5":"9zHxpj+Php+keXrd+F4OWQ==","fsize":85686,"resto":0,"id":"zC2VNgb0","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-build-the-space-elevator-or-youre-gonna","country_name":"United States","replies":21,"images":5,"unique_ips":9},{"no":120155997,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:22:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120154568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120154568<\/a><br><br>Why NOT to build the orbital ring if it&#039;s such an amazing idea?","time":1491672176,"resto":120154568,"id":"QCrmWbb0","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":120156580,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:28:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120155997\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120155997<\/a><br><br>It will happen when we all demand it, and meme it into reality.","filename":"Rushmore","ext":".jpg","w":733,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":85,"tim":1491672496521,"time":1491672496,"md5":"l5cjbwGUJpZ5RMWo+pIFuA==","fsize":151635,"resto":120154568,"id":"zC2VNgb0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120157416,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:35:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120156580\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120156580<\/a><br>If Trump announces such a project, how long until he gets JFKed?","time":1491672930,"resto":120154568,"id":"QCrmWbb0","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":120157728,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:37:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120157416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120157416<\/a><br><br>Trump can put himself in a bunker, send a batallion into Langley, and clean this mess up in a few days.<br><br>Once he gets on national television and tells everyone they have been robbed of their birthright, the cat is permanently out of the bag.","filename":"Kennedy","ext":".jpg","w":519,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1491673077487,"time":1491673077,"md5":"xGRYwL6x3xNwDpwZINCWGg==","fsize":76305,"resto":120154568,"id":"zC2VNgb0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120158155,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:41:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120156580\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120156580<\/a><br>Work on Plan B.","time":1491673289,"resto":120154568,"id":"oGsWYepp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120158255,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:42:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120157728\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120157728<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Once he gets on national television and tells everyone they have been robbed of their birthright, the cat is permanently out of the bag.<\/span><br><br>So why doesn&#039;t he do it?","time":1491673340,"resto":120154568,"id":"QCrmWbb0","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":120158671,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:46:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120154568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120154568<\/a><br>\/pol\/ please provide a prototype picture of this space elevator. i am interested. thank you.","time":1491673568,"resto":120154568,"id":"l\/O5hcjf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120158954,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)13:48:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120154568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120154568<\/a><br>You can&#039;t build a fucking wall and you dream of space elevators.

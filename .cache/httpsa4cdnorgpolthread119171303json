There&#039;s not even one shred of truth out there. I check CNN on a regular basis to check on the Trump-Russia controversy and all I see are insinuations and baseless allegations. All the while blaming Trump for doing this with the Obama wiretapping.<br><br>Your media is demolishing his presidency, and to be honest Trump should close CNN, MSNBC and all other grade A traitor news networks.<br><br>How can your media be so utterly and completely fucked up? Even my leftist shithole of a country doesn&#039;t have such fucking bias.<br><br>We can only go back to freedom of speech when the leftists are removed from all positions of power.

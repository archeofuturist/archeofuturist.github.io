Or, more specifically, CEOs of defense contractors and media outlets sometimes happen to overlap, and they push for a certain agenda.

Then, suddenly, that job is changed. That&#039;s what&#039;s happening right now. Even during the election, people who supported Trump acknowledged that this would probably happen, because siding with Russians in Syria, rather than the rebels, is a huge change in the intelligence communities directive. We&#039;re, essentially, witnessing the defense industry going on strike, because they don&#039;t want to do their job. However, the fact is that the previous directive is finished. The Cold War against the Russians is over. We no longer have to fight proxy wars against Russia.

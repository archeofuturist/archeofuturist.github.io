Like I totally understand the food makes the goddamn smell of a spice bazaar permeate through your pores, but for fuck&#039;s sake. Try some deodorant and a shower. Every computer science hallway in America smells like curry and calloused Indian feet due to wearing pic related.<br><br>Another thing. Why are you all so fucking rude? How the fuck is it that you guys give people sideways glances while you pace up and down hallways on your phone talking your verbal equivalent of diarrhea loudly into your androids?<br><br>Also the clothing.

And then you all have the audacity of looking at us like we&#039;re crazy for avoiding you.<br><br>Seriously, Americans don&#039;t want you in call-centers: It&#039;s irritating picking up a customer service line and speaking to &quot;John in Tampa&quot;.<br><br>Americans also don&#039;t like you dominating computer science hallways. You smell, and you come en masse forcing kids into smelly rooms that have a stench like downtown New Delhi.","filename":"2796095c231f891f37510294f8d46cac","ext":".jpg","w":570,"h":598,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490823057584,"time":1490823057,"md5":"z1rii048n1JsoGuXW0FwDg==","fsize":47762,"resto":118834501,"id":"HNiMwKkz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118837185,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:31:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118834501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118834501<\/a><br>Generations of eating shit with their hands","filename":"32_poo_in_it","ext":".png","w":630,"h":405,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1490823114444,"time":1490823114,"md5":"rHTcGi3NeSDbtwH33JwH7g==","fsize":64849,"resto":118834501,"id":"Oat4OhQn","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118837391,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:33:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118834501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118834501<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tubby<\/span>","filename":"USA Obesity","ext":".webm","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490823219465,"time":1490823219,"md5":"CeGhQtIeqLZVh8k4cZCi6A==","fsize":1533198,"resto":118834501,"id":"wPlvzd0+","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118838687,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:44:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118834501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118834501<\/a>","filename":"1463585115510","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":684,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1490823895468,"time":1490823895,"md5":"PUFEOv9mh0K030L1Jkfr0Q==","fsize":132465,"resto":118834501,"id":"q2CzMQua","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":118838787,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:45:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118834501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118834501<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;indian<\/span>","time":1490823957,"resto":118834501,"id":"7CfPLO+v","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118838863,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:46:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118837391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118837391<\/a><br>DELETE THIS","time":1490823998,"resto":118834501,"id":"hY8NOsCy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118838867,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:46:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118834501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118834501<\/a><br><br>their culture is a matriarchy","time":1490824000,"resto":118834501,"id":"xhi4AkKK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118839166,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)17:49:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118836455\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118836455<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Implying it matters<\/span>","time":1490824152,"resto":118834501,"id":"Bs47bSph","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

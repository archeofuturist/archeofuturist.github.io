We stood above their SJW attacks and artillery barrages of media against our glorious board. But these fascist cucks and normies have still fight in their veins. Keep a watchful eye to the horizon and guard thy memes with honor in our katanas and pride in our fedoras. For it is our duty and (white) privilege to fight together to finish those who threaten our freedom to shitpost now and forever. We few, Newfags and Old, ladybois and weeb trash, we happy few. We band of brothers. For he who fights and posts rare pepes with me today shall be my brother, be he ne&#039;er such normie trash. And we shall read the books to our downy children of the year we fapped to traps and emerged victorious in a fight that was unwinnable.<br><br>We stand United as one people, with one will, one reich. \/pol\/ Forever.","filename":"0","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490073699980,"time":1490073699,"md5":"QunDxp0\/yHeEsOauWRZ1Ig==","fsize":35498,"resto":0,"id":"KXk617Tw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"take-a-moment-to-reflect","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

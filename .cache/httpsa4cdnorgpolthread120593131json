The video is taken from the perspective of a high speed aircraft in low altitude flight. The video shows what appears to be launches of surface to air missiles that fly towards targets and release chaff for the tomahawks to fly through and be destroyed. The explosion event at the end of the missile stream (where it detonates to destroy its target) looks like a detonation sequence of extended duration, involving the explosion of a huge number of bomblets. Additionally, the missile streams themselves are laced with bomblets, that also explode along the entire length the missile traveled.<br><br>If this video is legit, it fully explains how so few tomahawks hit their targets, AND it also fully explains why they did so poorly on arrival - if they mostly had damaged sensor systems from flying through shrapnel but still managed to arrive they would not do as well at selecting targets when they arrived. This video could explain it all.<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dAI<wbr>WD3SLxrc","filename":"36c5d290df47a96d40a054e2bafd9ae5e1d4cf1a05ad97a47cb75432de205029","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491915548705,"time":1491915548,"md5":"+M+dECj\/0wAvrPW4Aandew==","fsize":7657,"resto":120593131,"id":"BNJmeBHI","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"}]}

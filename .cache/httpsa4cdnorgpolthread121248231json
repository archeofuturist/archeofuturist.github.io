After nearly 2 years of being crucified in the media for every little thing and absolutely none of it sticking (including the pussy tape October surprise)\u2014most of it probably only serving to desensitize people to Trump&#039;s outrageous antics\u2014his detractors are now going back to the drawing board and looking for something more boring, tame, and seemingly important and official, in hopes of it registering in the public&#039;s radar, as everything too &quot;out there&quot; like the Russia conspiracy theory starts to blur together. They settled on the tax returns because it&#039;s one of the major issues that never got settled, even leaving off on a high note for Trump after Rachel Maddow humiliated herself by showcasing paperwork that actually shed a positive light on him. It&#039;s a point of great frustration for them because they can&#039;t land a decisive blow on what they feel should be a big issue that Trump has even chided others for, but nobody ever cares.","time":1492284986,"resto":121248231,"id":"UNIKAx79","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

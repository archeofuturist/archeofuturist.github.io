actually going to defend Diane Abbott now, which must be a britpol first.<br><br>What happened today is the latest example of &quot;journalists&quot; ambushing politicians in order to drum up a non-existent scandal. It&#039;s a way of generating clickbait.<br><br>What we ultimately want to know is Labour&#039;s policy, the details behind it and how it will be paid for. Now I can only defend her so far, she totally fucked up the numbers and is a total retard. But the aim shouldn&#039;t be to make her even more flustered when she does cock up the numbers. Instead of just waiting for her to correct herself, or letting her take her time to explain what she means, he started asking quick fire questions and they both knew she was embarassed, so he aimed to try and embarass her more.<br><br>I remember Laura Kuennsberg got to ask the first question when the PM did her Lancaster House speech about Brexit, telling us more about the government&#039;s approach than we had learnt in the six months before that. Instead of asking about the details of the government&#039;s approach, she tried tripping May up with some crap question trying to make May look like a hypocrite. She did the same type of thing when Trump and May had their first press conference together.<br><br>This gotcha journalism may be good for retweets and instagram likes but it makes for a level of political discussion that&#039;s approaching American levels of bullshit.","time":1493741850,"resto":123781727,"id":"H8yQ\/Fyr","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123783920,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)12:23:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123779970#p123779970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123779970<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123779970#p123779970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123779970<\/a><br><br>Keep this thread for after.","time":1493742232,"resto":123781727,"id":"2s7cNZ0h","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123784221,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)12:26:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123783247\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123783247<\/a><br>If you&#039;re a MP, and especially if you&#039;re part of Cabinet\/Shadow Cabinet, you MUST be ready to take shit coming at you, and address it. <br>However I do agree with you that the media has become much more like a tabloid, and it&#039;s bad for us in general.","time":1493742388,"resto":123781727,"id":"4WfPsEa0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

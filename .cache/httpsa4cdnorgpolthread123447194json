Her management was inept, her messaging misguided, and her character terribly flawed. Let\u2019s put this into proper perspective: she lost to Donald Trump, for fuck\u2019s sake! A colossal joke of a candidate who by all accounts should\u2019ve lost to a chair. As the saying goes, the election was Clinton\u2019s to lose... and she lost it. So why on Earth would I want her to run again in 2020?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The answer is rather simple: I remain committed to the belief that Clinton would be an incredible president. And I believe she not only will run again, as her recent and outspoken re-launch onto the public stage indicates, but that she will also win. No, I\u2019m not crazy. I just believe that history repeats itself. And for that we simply need to look to Richard Nixon.<\/span>","filename":"1478409402254","ext":".png","w":866,"h":665,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":95,"tim":1493535971736,"time":1493535971,"md5":"ilVkd4uSqlM0m5OF8LUveg==","fsize":721933,"resto":123447194,"id":"6er3\/Ldh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123449901,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:08:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"3rd times a charm.

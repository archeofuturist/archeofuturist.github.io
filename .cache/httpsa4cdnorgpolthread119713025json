The popular vote is totally inconsequential. It means about as much as the fact that Trump won more counties than Clinton. It is heavily skewed as California always throws it in the Dems&#039; favor by running up the score because they have much much higher voter participation. The point of the electoral college is to represent the entire country when it is understood that not everyone will vote. Now, the electoral vote should just be based on the House figures (no additional 2 electoral votes per stat for Senators) because that unfairly helps rural states, though this wouldn&#039;t change the results as Trump would still have easily beaten Clinton. <br><br>I don&#039;t understand why so many people are claiming Trump lost because he lost the popular vote.

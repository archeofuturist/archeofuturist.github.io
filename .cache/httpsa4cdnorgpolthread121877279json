Some of the guys even mentioned the Georgia guidestones and Jewish control of the media BEFORE I spoke up. I thought it was just us, pol, the normies know in their gut that something bad is coming and there are unseen el-ites maneuvering things against the rest of us. Someone mentioned revelations and that&#039;s when I sprung the synagogue of Satan, that is those who claim to be Jews but are not Jews, mentioned in revelations, and then I described the attack on the USS Liberty, the fact of Jewish\/Israelis stealing and sending top secret information to Israel and in turn the Soviets, Jews selling the bomb to the Soviets, Jewish control of the communists in the early 20th Century and finally why Hitler actually hated them: the German communist revolutions of 1918\/19. <br>Be careful how you do it, but it can be done pol. The average working class citizen knows something is wrong and are very receptive to the truth.","filename":"CE18E1B4-ECA7-4643-8196-4AD1B2CFFA23-11774-00000CCD9C9E79CC_tmp","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":523,"tn_w":191,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492627309725,"time":1492627309,"md5":"0qth\/vVZ1SuI16YblDS3XQ==","fsize":77356,"resto":0,"id":"CGzmtlJ3","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"red-pilling-normies-on-the-jq","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121877484,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)14:43:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121877279\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121877279<\/a><br>Tell me you don&#039;t know all of this and support Trump still.","time":1492627405,"resto":121877279,"id":"76YAA+Mj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121878009,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)14:47:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"Stop finding common ground, goyim.","filename":"goyim glare-1-1","ext":".jpg","w":355,"h":354,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492627653998,"time":1492627653,"md5":"GjfpjXUd\/X8C7GsQoW2JVg==","fsize":26624,"resto":121877279,"id":"QD3YP\/Wr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121878703,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)14:52:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121877484\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121877484<\/a><br>I do, but I still support Trump because he is wittingly or unwittingly causing a lot of things to come to light.

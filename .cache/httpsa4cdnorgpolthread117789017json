The film included a \u201ccinematic motif\u201d which featured an American Jewish doctor dismembering Iraqis allegedly murdered by American soldiers in order to harvest their organs for Jewish markets.

The Weimar republic failed because for most Germans at the time the authoritarian regime of the Kaiser was far closer to the political ideal than a republic set up by the hated left wing of the political spectrum.

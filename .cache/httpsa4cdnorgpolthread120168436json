The halls would have ended with a double transept at the south end, 157 feet (48 m) wide and 47 feet (14 m) deep. The soaring Memorial Tower included a high-level open ambulatory, surmounted by a corona topped by a lantern with bells. It was intended to hold of monuments and imperial trophies in galleries on lower floors, with archives on upper floors. It would have been the tallest building in the UK, significantly higher than the 111 metres (364 ft) dome of St Paul&#039;s Cathedral. The complex would have had a similar floor area to Westminster Abbey itself, and would have overshadowed the Houses of Parliament on the other side of the road.<\/span>","time":1491679056,"resto":120168436,"id":"9VLmuoqa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120169585,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:17:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120168436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120168436<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;claim to be greatest empire in the world<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;couldn&#039;t beat a bunch of backward colonists<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;try again<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fail<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;help you out with WW2, took the hardest beaches while you took the nice ones with less MGs<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;laugh at us for not winning vietnam<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;can&#039;t win against a bunch of fetal-alcohol-addled Irish<\/span>","time":1491679062,"resto":120168436,"id":"LVOKUojr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120170778,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:26:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120169585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120169585<\/a><br>this is not a thread for bullying. this is a thread for loyal servants of his majesty&#039;s empire to reminisce about what could have been","time":1491679618,"resto":120168436,"id":"9VLmuoqa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120171117,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:29:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120168436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120168436<\/a><br>Don&#039;t worry my man, the U.K. will wake up and rise once more.

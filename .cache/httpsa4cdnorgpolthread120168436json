The halls would have ended with a double transept at the south end, 157 feet (48 m) wide and 47 feet (14 m) deep. The soaring Memorial Tower included a high-level open ambulatory, surmounted by a corona topped by a lantern with bells.

It would have been the tallest building in the UK, significantly higher than the 111 metres (364 ft) dome of St Paul&#039;s Cathedral. The complex would have had a similar floor area to Westminster Abbey itself, and would have overshadowed the Houses of Parliament on the other side of the road.<\/span>","time":1491679056,"resto":120168436,"id":"9VLmuoqa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120169585,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:17:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120168436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120168436<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;claim to be greatest empire in the world<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;couldn&#039;t beat a bunch of backward colonists<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;try again<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fail<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;help you out with WW2, took the hardest beaches while you took the nice ones with less MGs<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;laugh at us for not winning vietnam<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;can&#039;t win against a bunch of fetal-alcohol-addled Irish<\/span>","time":1491679062,"resto":120168436,"id":"LVOKUojr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120170778,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:26:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120169585\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120169585<\/a><br>this is not a thread for bullying. this is a thread for loyal servants of his majesty&#039;s empire to reminisce about what could have been","time":1491679618,"resto":120168436,"id":"9VLmuoqa","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120171117,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)15:29:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120168436\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120168436<\/a><br>Don&#039;t worry my man, the U.K. will wake up and rise once more.

Quality life isn&#039;t stressful life of constant chase.","time":1491556003,"resto":119915402,"id":"zlcfdWko","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":119918067,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:07:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119917900\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119917900<\/a><br>wonder who&#039;s behind this post.","time":1491556074,"resto":119915402,"id":"erY0QGpq","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":119918155,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:08:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119917814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119917814<\/a><br>One is AIDS, the other is ass cancer.","time":1491556117,"resto":119915402,"id":"EuiwWF6g","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119918166,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:08:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119915402\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119915402<\/a><br>Because they&#039;re not on the same side as the Zionists.","time":1491556124,"resto":119915402,"id":"pSVmjFbT","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119918192,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:08:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119917900\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119917900<\/a><br>\/pol\/ is kinda mad at you right now, you might want to leave kike","filename":"1486953031326","ext":".jpg","w":680,"h":478,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1491556136404,"time":1491556136,"md5":"l7s6q0lkoIqCyPkdtCdPMw==","fsize":58756,"resto":119915402,"id":"x+hh8Ci7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119918205,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:09:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119915402\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119915402<\/a><br>Didn&#039;t Russia also?","time":1491556145,"resto":119915402,"id":"LJ0UyRbn","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119918394,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:10:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119917667\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119917667<\/a><br>Both sides are villainous.","time":1491556247,"resto":119915402,"id":"erY0QGpq","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":119918401,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:10:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119916331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119916331<\/a><br>Not a reason for intervention, gas is banned because it killed an entire generation of soldiers die and crippled Europe in the process.<br>Not because muh civillians.","time":1491556250,"resto":119915402,"id":"JzYGMik9","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119918439,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:11:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Reddit protecting Trump currently because they think other presidents would have done the same thing<\/span><br><br>Why is \/pol\/ on the same side with reddit?","filename":"8a443f7b-1eee-4b22-a70e-9d9807e9d359","ext":".png","w":414,"h":479,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491556277027,"time":1491556277,"md5":"NqNyZQqsv1A2tiYRKfK2Pg==","fsize":379446,"resto":119915402,"id":"eocyRb23","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":119918473,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:11:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119915402\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119915402<\/a><br>anyone who doesn&#039;t bend the knee to the kikes gets my support","time":1491556298,"resto":119915402,"id":"\/UJTGhEB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119918489,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:11:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119918394\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119918394<\/a><br>yep, but see:<br><br><a href=\"#p119917814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119917814<\/a>","time":1491556304,"resto":119915402,"id":"x+hh8Ci7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119918534,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:12:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119917814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119917814<\/a><br>well explained, very articulate<br>this should be a fucking post-it for this board","time":1491556326,"resto":119915402,"id":"AJmk9z+S","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119918631,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:13:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119918155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119918155<\/a><br>pretty much","time":1491556384,"resto":119915402,"id":"AJmk9z+S","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119918739,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:14:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119915598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119915598<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you shouldn&#039;t have an opinion that someone you dislike also happens to have<\/span>","time":1491556449,"resto":119915402,"id":"aN4xmUsq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119918829,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)05:14:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"tru","time":1491556495,"resto":119915402,"id":"XOh8vGwj","country":"SY","country_name":"Syria"}]}

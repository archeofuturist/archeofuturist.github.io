It costs my clients $10000+ to schedule a 3 day shutdown of all machinery and put their workers on leave for an inspection. They have to do this to maintain their state-issues operating license. If I miss a flight, they could spend a few more days of downtime and lose more money, after which they&#039;ll be making a claim against my company&#039;s insurance. I&#039;ll have to submit a report along with receipts and vouchers to verify their claim, which will then be considered when our company agent decides on which airline to book the next flight. If this happens repeatedly, my company&#039;s reputation suffers and our accreditation could go under review if we get too many complaints. If a client misses their license renewal and suffers significant financial hardship as a result of my delay, they can and have sued us for failure to deliver service. So for the sake of my own job, I sure as hell ain&#039;t volunteering for anything and will be on the phone with our legal department if they try to force me to do anything. Not gonna spaz out like the chink but I&#039;ll be taking names, badge numbers and making sure people get fired. <br><br>The only reason that someone should be forcibly removed from a plane is when they become a danger to the safety of plane and other passengers.","time":1491890972,"resto":120555271,"id":"+vKvoSa0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120562944,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)02:09:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120562785\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120562785<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but you certainly spread your cheeks open and beg for it like a bitch.<\/span><br><br>I am not the one defending united actions here fucciboi.

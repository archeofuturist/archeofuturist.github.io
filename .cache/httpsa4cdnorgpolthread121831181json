It&#039;s at least a much funnier and endearing movement than liberals, but most of them don&#039;t really know why they&#039;re a part of it beyond being sick of political correctness; which is fine, but I&#039;d hope they find themselves in the future.","time":1492600183,"resto":121831181,"id":"juLDehoW","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121832616,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:15:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121831540\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121831540<\/a><br>nazism is left wing goy :^)","time":1492600519,"resto":121831181,"id":"rvhJP2Mj","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

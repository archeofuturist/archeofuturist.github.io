Even if you hadn&#039;t said so, your posts all demonstrate that you didn&#039;t read it. <br><br>The book is pretty much apolitical. It&#039;s a meticulously researched outline of how the media and the government collude to fulfill the will of the corporate elites. I honestly think it is a must-read for anyone who wants to discuss\/debate politics. It provides a very straight-forward and well-justified lens through which to view government, the media, and the corporate influence over both.<br><br>Take two weeks to ignore the fact that the author happens to be Jewish and enlightened yourself: this book will change how you see everything in society. Can&#039;t recommend it enough.","time":1492418064,"resto":121490539,"id":"dUFjmG7f","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121502466,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)04:42:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Noam Chomsky is a genius, and we&#039;re very lucky he decided to betray the rest of the jews and leak their mind control strategies to the rest of the world.","time":1492418545,"resto":121490539,"id":"Y6dF9q5y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

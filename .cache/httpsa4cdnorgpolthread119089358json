The course syllabus said content would be provocative and that students were expected to conduct themselves with \u201crespect and care.\u201d The instructor, Caroline Hinkley, also warned students to distinguish opinions from critical thought, and said she\u2019d ask them to rewrite analytic papers that didn\u2019t meet that standard.<br><br>Pompeo received A\u2019s on her first two papers but was asked to rewrite the third, on the 1985 film Desert Hearts. Pompeo wrote that the film, which depicts a lesbian romance, provides \u201cno reason for anyone other than lesbians who are unable to discern bad film from good film to endure\u201d it. Of the actors, Pompeo wrote, \u201ctheir general appearance conjures the clich\u00e9 \u2018you can put lipstick on a pig, but it\u2019s still a pig.\u2019\u201d<br><br>She described one of the characters as \u201cstill sexually vibrant, in spite of her perverse attraction to the same sex,\u201d but lesbianism in general as \u201ca very death-like state as far as its inability to reproduce naturally.\u201d Turning to a bathing scene in the film, Pompeo said that the \u201conly signs of potency in the form of the male cock exist in the emasculated body\u201d of one character&#039;s fianc\u00e9, and that the water was \u201cessentially drowning out any chance of life considering their fatal attraction to one another.\u201d<br>Over all, she said, the film \u201ccan be viewed as entirely perverse in its desire and attempt to reverse the natural roles of man and woman in addition to championing the barren wombs of these women.\u201d","filename":"womenfilm","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490988235774,"time":1490988235,"md5":"AW7TDg6u4uxSw7j7S1\/SUg==","fsize":186146,"resto":0,"id":"JI0cp0gK","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"student-loses-appeal-dismissed-from-film-class","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":119089420,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)15:24:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119089358\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119089358<\/a><br>Hinkley wrote on Pompeo\u2019s ungraded paper that lesbians were in fact capable of discerning good films from bad ones and asked, \u201dWhy is attraction to the same sex perverse?

But the student said she felt she was being monitored for her anti-gay comments. She complained about her situation to the university provost and a dean and eventually met with the department chair and a third professor, who told her that her use of the historically derogatory term \u201cbarren\u201d and the explicit term \u201ccock\u201d were not appropriate for an academic setting.<br><br>The department chair allegedly took Pompeo\u2019s statements during the meeting to mean that she would complete the course as an independent study.

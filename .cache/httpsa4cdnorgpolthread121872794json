Pinochet was one of the biggest pieces of shit to ever rule a country in general, much less only in Chile. I mean really, he let the openly neoliberal &quot;Chicago Boys&quot; shape his economic policies, he killed tons of Spaniards\/Basques\/Italians\/Germans etc for no good reason, he bowed down to America&#039;s every wish, and he was pro-Israeli\/Zionist. How in the fuck is that even remotely nationalist? Actual nationalist leaders who gave a fuck about their people such as Peron, Vargas, Allende, Chavez, etc protected their nations&#039; economy against &quot;foreign&quot; (aka &#039;murrican) investments. Pinochet basically turned Chile into an American protectorate. People can bitch about Allende and claim he had &quot;Jewish-Bolshevik&quot; ancestry and intentions all they want, but it&#039;s clear to anyone who&#039;s not a literal fucking retard that Pinochet loved Jews more than his own people.","filename":"pinochet1","ext":".jpg","w":594,"h":536,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":225,"tim":1492625070319,"time":1492625070,"md5":"9xXBQHqS32zxfT\/x1Knf4A==","fsize":72840,"resto":0,"id":"ik2IrGo1","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"whats-up-with-all-these-retarded-pol-users","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Be a bitch about it if you have to. Make public pleas in all media and through every possible diplomatic channels.

Make it so that Churchill and his cabinet cannot turn you down. <br><br>Lastly, the big move. So you want to take down Communism? Begin by building an anti-comintern alliance throughout Europe to include Italy, Spain, whatever is left of France and the low countries.

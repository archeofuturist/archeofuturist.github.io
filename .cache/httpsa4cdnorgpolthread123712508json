In fact, he completely ignored their advice to attack Cuba and instead blockaded Russia&#039;s fleet with our own armada, to his advisors&#039; dismay. Everyone thought it was about to be WW3, but Kennedy held his ground, and at the very last moment Russia turned around and went home.<br><br>After that, Russia&#039;s attitude towards America changed. Gorbachev respected Kennedy as a world leader and eventually even as a person, offering many kind words after his death.<br><br>Unfortunately, after his death, his VP Lyndon B. Johnson led the country down a road of disaster and war because he was inept and listened to the very people Kennedy would have ignored.<br><br>Kennedy didn&#039;t allow America to be cucked by Russia. He put us on mutual footing by playing their game in a way they didn&#039;t expect. That&#039;s not Trump, though. They know his game, they wrote his game, and they&#039;re playing him like a pawn. <br><br>There will be no mutual respect between our countries, because Putin sees Trump as a sucker and a tool to use at his disposal. Even if he doesn&#039;t have a pee tape and other blackmail material, the lack of respect is palpable. <br><br>We need another Kennedy. He&#039;s the only thing that can save America, and the world.","filename":"john-f-kennedy_HD_1104x622-16x9","ext":".jpg","w":1104,"h":622,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493692015430,"time":1493692015,"md5":"TiYprW50CDJw\/TeQYkhNPQ==","fsize":65345,"resto":0,"id":"TUgK16IP","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"if-kennedy-were-president-today-there-wouldnt-be","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123712871,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)22:29:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123712508\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123712508<\/a><br>I think it&#039;s too early to come to conclusions.

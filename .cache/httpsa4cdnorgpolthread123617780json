Sovereignty is a very nebulous concept nowadays in the globalised world that we live in. <br><br>We have to recognise that absolute sovereignty is a thing of the past as we have to follow so many rules in return for trading with other countries, or for being part of NATO, or being part of the UN, or participating in EFTA etc etc that making all of our own rules is only possible if we pull up the drawbridges and refuse to play any part in the rest of the world. And probably starve as a result.<br><br>And furthermore I have absolutely no faith whatsoever in &quot;our&quot; government making a better job of regulation than the EU or any other body, as governments of both colours have committed some truly egregious policy mistakes in the name of whatever pet ideology (or simple selfish power-grabbing) they allow to drive their policy decisions.<br><br>It is pure fantasy to think we would be better off with total sovereignty. I understand that it is tempting to believe that it could be better, but in the real world it absolutely would not. Our politicians really aren&#039;t any more clever than any others.","filename":"20170408_woc316","ext":".png","w":1190,"h":592,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1493643573914,"time":1493643573,"md5":"KqyUMRQffwgg7AZHB1C6kg==","fsize":40201,"resto":123617780,"id":"PIEGY2v\/","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

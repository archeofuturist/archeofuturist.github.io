The 2 rounds system was specifically designed to make sure that the establishment will always win. If an anti-establishment candidate makes it to the 2nd round, he will have to face what we call in French a &quot;barrage&quot;.<br><br>What is a &quot;barrage&quot;, you ask ? Simple. Every single person that cast a vote for a candidate that was not the anti-establishment candidate will cast their 2nd vote against this candidate. Of course it doesn&#039;t always work 100%, but it is a flawless measure put in place by the French political class to always be in control. <br><br>If Lepen faces Fillon or Macron (highly unlikely) she will lose, simply because people will give their votes to the establishment.<br><br>If she faces Melenchon, who is also anti-establishment, she has her chances (disregard the polls, they cannot be trusted.)<br><br>Also AMA about anything related to French politics.","filename":"pepee","ext":".png","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492469831438,"time":1492469831,"md5":"nrvfr1jwgCTbpZ0dEFc9zg==","fsize":105241,"resto":0,"id":"6h1fEGhW","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"let-me-tell-you-why-giving-momentum-to-melenchon","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

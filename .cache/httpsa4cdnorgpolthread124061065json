I have never seen the left have such a powerful stranglehold on American politics.","time":1493909406,"resto":124061065,"id":"5CF9CQsI","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124066987,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:51:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124066823\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124066823<\/a><br>this it&#039;s obvious now that the illuminati want le pen to win<br>enjoy your trump france","time":1493909465,"resto":124061065,"id":"AVNxOjXz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124067146,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:52:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124061065\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124061065<\/a><br><br>Because his endorsement meant oh-so-much for Hillary","time":1493909546,"resto":124061065,"id":"rGJPLzJ2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124067693,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)10:58:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124061065\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124061065<\/a><br><br>Good.","time":1493909897,"resto":124061065,"id":"bgKFV4ml","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124067924,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)11:00:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124067146\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124067146<\/a><br>everything Barry Soweto backs turns to shit.<br>Brexit<br>Hilldog<br>moderate rebels<br>ACA","time":1493910028,"resto":124061065,"id":"jMsNvoh0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124070017,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)11:22:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124061065\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124061065<\/a><br><br>Who is this black guy and why is he important?","time":1493911335,"resto":124061065,"id":"1raCx2PI","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":124070201,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)11:24:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124067146\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124067146<\/a><br>Please vote Hilldwag.","time":1493911451,"resto":124061065,"id":"0ElfXD28","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":124070258,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)11:24:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124064192\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124064192<\/a><br>wtf<br>is natalie a coalburner now","time":1493911490,"resto":124061065,"id":"wdsUFUka","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":124070373,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)11:25:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124061065\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124061065<\/a><br>guess he&#039;s gotta interfere with yet another election","time":1493911549,"resto":124061065,"id":"CiSIWAti","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124070391,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)11:26:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why is this negro still making public appearances?","time":1493911560,"resto":124061065,"id":"YOnAq06m","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":124070504,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)11:26:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;People in this thread don&#039;t remember how he spent his entire 8 years trying to get Netanyahu unelected<\/span>","time":1493911619,"resto":124061065,"id":"VA9d3eAA","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124070648,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)11:28:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124070391\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124070391<\/a><br>he still has debts to pay for the jews allowing him to be a nigger president for 8 years and going against israel.","time":1493911699,"resto":124061065,"id":"50u6ydk9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124072264,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)11:44:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124061065\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124061065<\/a><br>So if Macron wins now it was because Obama rigged the election?

Horrible. The suburban schools were ok. City school was horrifying. <br><br>My first day I was assigned to a 16 y.o. girl with Down Syndrome. She and her bestie (another retard) each have their own mommie to follow them, tie their shoe, hold their umbrella, remind them when to change their period pad, and that&#039;s about it. Mind you these kids are not on a diploma track. They take no tests, get no grades. They suit up for gym every day to stand on the sidelines. So who cares if they get to the right class? Those resources should go to the achievers. I was basically a babysitter and in fact I got to leave early because her mom pulled her out early to get her hair done (really) for a dance that night. The mom was a trophy wife type, thin pretty blonde, most likely rich. <br><br>Special ed is just as big a drain as immigrants and dindus, if not more. We had one in our system that was sent to private school out of state for nearly $1million\/year. The parents pay zero despite being rich. The kid is profoundly disabled, violent, and will never learn anything.","time":1490145983,"resto":117694788,"id":"XP7kSQo1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

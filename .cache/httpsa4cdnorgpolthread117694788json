Horrible. The suburban schools were ok. City school was horrifying. <br><br>My first day I was assigned to a 16 y.o. girl with Down Syndrome. She and her bestie (another retard) each have their own mommie to follow them, tie their shoe, hold their umbrella, remind them when to change their period pad, and that&#039;s about it. Mind you these kids are not on a diploma track. They take no tests, get no grades. They suit up for gym every day to stand on the sidelines. So who cares if they get to the right class? Those resources should go to the achievers. I was basically a babysitter and in fact I got to leave early because her mom pulled her out early to get her hair done (really) for a dance that night. The mom was a trophy wife type, thin pretty blonde, most likely rich. <br><br>Special ed is just as big a drain as immigrants and dindus, if not more. We had one in our system that was sent to private school out of state for nearly $1million\/year. The parents pay zero despite being rich. The kid is profoundly disabled, violent, and will never learn anything.","time":1490145983,"resto":117694788,"id":"XP7kSQo1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117700654,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)21:31:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117695746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117695746<\/a><br>which school form","filename":"1486130530577","ext":".jpg","w":735,"h":455,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":77,"tim":1490146288049,"time":1490146288,"md5":"PDjZ55al7mkQqpPAvWXxfQ==","fsize":116867,"resto":117694788,"id":"beI1xcM3","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117700933,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)21:34:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117698076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117698076<\/a><br>Because East Asians always use privilege and status and face to conceal shortcomings?","time":1490146450,"resto":117694788,"id":"asOrZTOj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117700989,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)21:34:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is teaching high school a good job?

Although my horror stories are nowhere near as bad as some of the shit I&#039;ve seen shared here, I have no problem believing any of it, being that I dealt with very similar problems.<br><br>I did a year at Bradley Tech, which is supposed to be like a prep school for MIT, and we had some very bright students, even a few black ones, but it was on the whole a containment facility for some of the vilest nigger animals I&#039;ve ever personally encountered. The last straw for me was a police raid where four (4) firearms were recovered from student lockers.<br><br>So I transferred to Town of Lake, which had just been renamed Ronald Reagan High, rather appropriately, taking into account how many illegal Mexicans were enrolled.

Not the greatest car, sure, but the first new one I&#039;d ever bought, and I liked it, and felt I&#039;d earned it, having kept up my end of the bargain with MPS to try to train their monkey-ass negroid animals to at least pretend they were learning.

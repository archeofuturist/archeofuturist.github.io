Genetic evidence shows that Ashkenazis can trace most of their paternal Y-DNA markers to the Levant (about 90%+) and about 80%+ of their maternal mtDNA markers originate from European women from middle to northern Italy in the early 2nd and 3rd centuries. Now just because their markers are from these origins does not mean that the rest of their DNA necessarily is. In fact, most studies have shown that Ashkenazis tend to show more genetic affinity to the nations in which they inhabited originally. This has led most geneticists to determine that Ashkenazis would occassionaly take in converts and add them to their gene pool. This is why they look so far removed physically from their Mizrahi and Sephardi counterparts. <br><br>So they do indeed have a genetic line back to the Levant, but is probably so minuscule by this point it would be akin to saying that a Brit is a German simply because they share some ancestry from centuries ago.","filename":"Just your average white guy","ext":".jpg","w":217,"h":253,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490990825371,"time":1490990825,"md5":"BXy5LqwSOL+qotAXDwevJw==","fsize":6147,"resto":119079136,"id":"lN5LpLnK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119094024,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)16:07:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119092909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119092909<\/a><br>Most people who had converted to Buddhism in the golden ages of Buddhism in the subcontinent either returned to Hinduism or converted Islam (Afghanistan, Pakistan). <br>Your avg Hindu has nothing but reverence for Gautama Buddha.

You will see in the existence, anything that is vast and beyond your perception generally tends to be blue, whether it is the ocean or the sky. Anything which is larger than your perception tends to be blue because blue is the basis of all-inclusiveness. It is based on this that so many gods in India are shown as blue-skinned. Shiva has a blue skin, Krishna has a blue skin, Rama has a blue skin. It is not that their skin was blue. They were referred to as blue gods because they had a blue aura.&quot;","time":1490995702,"resto":119079136,"id":"RiLv0dav","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119102333,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)17:28:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119102002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119102002<\/a><br>what? they&#039;re only shitskins now since the industrial revolution man, you really dont seem to understand this<br><a href=\"#p119102068\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119102068<\/a><br>are you fucking retarded? http:\/\/www.livescience.com\/38751-ge<wbr>netic-study-reveals-caste-system-or<wbr>igins.html<br><br>there&#039;s 100 more of these dude, fuck off with your anthropology and linguistic shit you mongoloid<br><br>its 2017 now, the people leading this field are geneticists not you social science babbies and your theories<br><br>get fucked","time":1490995720,"resto":119079136,"id":"blMcFhFr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119102353,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)17:28:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119101947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119101947<\/a><br>WE WUZ BRAHMINS N SHIIEET","time":1490995733,"resto":119079136,"id":"Yyg7BFKV","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119102400,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)17:29:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119102002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119102002<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lurs","time":1490995759,"resto":119079136,"id":"ZJlcaTxM","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119102423,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)17:29:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119101871\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119101871<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Brahmin chimpanzees <\/span><br>Kek, Shhh we don&#039;t like to say that out loud their is a reason Dravidan nationalism is a thing","time":1490995771,"resto":119079136,"id":"PJjEYha6","country":"IN","country_name":"India"}]}

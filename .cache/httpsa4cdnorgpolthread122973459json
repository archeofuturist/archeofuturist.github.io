I won&#039;t go as far as to say it&#039;s ZOG propaganda but I will say this:<br><br>Demographic transition is a theory which states that as a country industrializes, it goes through transitions in terms of death and birth rates like so:<br>1. High death and high birth rate<br>2. Low death and high birth rate<br>3. Low death and low birth rate<br><br>Eventually the birth rate goes below 2.0 per every woman and the population naturally goes down unless aided by immigration.<br>Literally every country in the world has or is going to undergo this. Bangladesh is already below 2.<br>The world population will hit a limit as we continue to build up third world countries and then go down \/ stabilize.","filename":"1413070608496","ext":".jpg","w":282,"h":269,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":119,"tim":1493257567406,"time":1493257567,"md5":"H7QFKWFevptlR2bFFhVYKQ==","fsize":24088,"resto":122973459,"id":"Sl+ZtjyE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122975862,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)21:49:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122973459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122973459<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122975411\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122975411<\/a><br>The real redpill is climate change will solve over population.","filename":"1486416013288","ext":".png","w":859,"h":420,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":61,"tim":1493257753074,"time":1493257753,"md5":"TfD6240ZBCEqLYVuFTHoOA==","fsize":231528,"resto":122973459,"id":"Qxo5xB66","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122976121,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)21:51:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122973459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122973459<\/a><br><a href=\"#p122975411\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122975411<\/a><br>Ok honestly, if you would stop attributing political motives and look just at mathematics and resources, it is objectively true that our Earth is over-populated with human beings. We are using over 1.5x the resources our world can sustain, or reproduce. What this means is that at our current levels (which are spiking in Africa and Asia), we cannot support the population, and the amount of resources we can bring back each year becomes less and less as the population increases.<br><br>So the objective reality is, the more the population grows from this point, the more resource strain will be distributed across the world, leading to more conflicts.<br><br>The only possible solution, for people using reason and fact, is to manage the world&#039;s population so that we use less than 1x the amount of resources we can reproduce in a year. There is simply no other way. This is not political, it is ecological and objective. Please actually think this through before attacking me.","time":1493257866,"resto":122973459,"id":"xa4wT84V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122976190,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)21:51:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122973459\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122973459<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Convenient self-important excuse when they could have just said that they don&#039;t want to have kids because they&#039;re broke, don&#039;t have any patience, and value their free time.<\/span><br><br>The earth is locally overpopulated.

Bring back the lulz, bring back the love machine, and do not let some rather forceful detractors sway you.<br><br>The time for making allies at the expense of our ideals is over. The alt right are not our friends<br><br>The time to make an individual choice between complacency and action is at hand. We will not be segregated. We will not be run roughshod over. Anonymous does not willingly accept acts of suppression from anyone. Our will shall not be bent by outsiders any longer.<br><br>Do not consider this anything personal. Consider this a call to reclaim what is ours.<br><br>Consider this a shift from the tactics of the past six months to new more subtle and shocking tactics that will shake the 4chan to its very core.<br><br>We will ensure that when what is rightfully free comes under threat of suppression, nothing will stop us from raising our voices.<br><br>We will ensure that Anonymous retains what is ours. Anonymous will reclaim 4chan<br>once again<br><br>Your fascism will be ruined utterly, and disposed of . <br><br>We are Anonymous.<br><br>We are Legion<br><br>We do not Forgive.<br><br>We do not Forget.<br><br>We are back","filename":"anonymousanti","ext":".jpg","w":935,"h":935,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492399327443,"time":1492399327,"md5":"35ojM4Fw9F5y3TGxAZk9aA==","fsize":56060,"resto":0,"id":"B90XHdsk","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-new-message-from-anonymous","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":2,"unique_ips":5},{"no":121471913,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)23:23:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121471760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121471760<\/a><br>This AGAIN?","filename":"Bait (2)","ext":".jpg","w":625,"h":626,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492399410838,"time":1492399410,"md5":"wPrfnpgNU6j1PoVdYS0MUQ==","fsize":31495,"resto":121471760,"id":"bPY\/u+CQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121472158,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)23:25:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121471760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121471760<\/a>","filename":"1467797338035","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":820,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492399533493,"time":1492399533,"md5":"IEBfvj6X5fyhwpAYCZ3d+Q==","fsize":152643,"resto":121471760,"id":"gXWMWsMY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121472309,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)23:26:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121471760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121471760<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A message from Anonymous....<\/span><br><br>Stopped reading there","time":1492399603,"resto":121471760,"id":"1Eh976Gp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121472632,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)23:29:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121471760\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121471760<\/a><br>Faggot","time":1492399761,"resto":121471760,"id":"i28BJHV7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

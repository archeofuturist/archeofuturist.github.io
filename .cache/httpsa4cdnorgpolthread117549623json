They show that the net contribution to the public finances for a Norwegian man from the 25th year and the rest of their lives, on average amounted to ~6.000 \u20ac per year. An on the contrary immigrant \u2013 from primarily Africa or Asia \u2013 cost the public finances on average Corresponding number for an immigrant man (from Asia or Africa) is ~10.000 \u20ac per year. Norwegian women cost on average ~10.800 \u20ac per year and immigrant women 18.600 \u20ac per year. In other words the Norwegian man pays for it all.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;These numbers are the best we have but are likely too low, since the cost for &quot;schools, police and health services&quot; are estimates on the average cost and there are valid indications to believe immigrant groups use these services more.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There are no reason to believe these basic calculations aren&#039;t accurate for Germany too. The conclusion, the basic arithmetic doesn&#039;t hold; immigration are undermining our societies economically. This is not to mention social and religious tension.<\/span>","time":1490052690,"resto":117549623,"id":"0QewWXFG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117550598,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:32:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117549623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117549623<\/a><br>Will \/pol ever recover from this one","time":1490052736,"resto":117549623,"id":"2AiGZoSE","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":117550790,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:33:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;socially retarded (((scientist))) doesnt know shit about the real world<\/span><br><br>shocking","time":1490052812,"resto":117549623,"id":"1j1gE8vO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117550910,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:34:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Science is a lie","time":1490052866,"resto":117549623,"id":"KGDKtgvt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117551019,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:35:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117549623\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117549623<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;an asian telling whites about diversity and immigration<\/span><br><br>p-p-please let us in goyim.","filename":"diversity-all-mud-nigger-asians","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":620,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490052913403,"time":1490052913,"md5":"dRtcR1FgM37rhcEZlh9hLg==","fsize":200945,"resto":117549623,"id":"bn7rjAUr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117551085,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:35:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Find me a celebrated economist that says supply and demand doesnt affect workers wages","time":1490052935,"resto":117549623,"id":"GK1spRhq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117551095,"now":"03\/20\/17(Mon)19:35:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Except several scientific and engineering organizations have stated the opposite of what a few pop-sci and leftest organization have spouted out.

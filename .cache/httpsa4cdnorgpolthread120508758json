He said Saudis knocked down the towers. (Correct. Israel too). He gave us the right winks to let us know he knows about (((them)))... &quot;Ask Israel, Walls Work.&quot;<br><br>Now do you really think that this guy who you grew to know and love because of things like that is suddenly going to work for the neocons bc of fake dead babies while getting cheered on by Israelis and Saudis and assorted jihadis?<br><br>No, sometime after the election a Saudi rag told Trump if he&#039;s not down with the blood-for-pipelines program they will sell off all their US assets to dick over our economy. Since Jews use mudslimes to do their dirty work, the Saudi rag also gave the message that the Israelis will sell their US assets as well. Jews own about 80% of the real estate in pretty much every major US city, most dual Israel-American citizens. Enough will divest to screw Trump. This kind of mass divestment can cripple the US (&amp; Trump would personally lose billions in net worth).<br><br>Media would cover up the semitic machinations and blame Trump&#039;s policies for the depression. Even Trump&#039;s Walmart-American base would desert him as they hit poverty. He&#039;d be impeachable. Or just not re-electable. A puppet would get the presidency again, like magic the foreign investment restored (jews would buy back in at rock bottom prices of course), and the great neocon project would be back on.<br><br>Did you really think you just win an election and the islamoshits and shekelsteins just fold? Their game is Eurasian oil trade domination and there is TRILLIONS of dollars at stake.<br><br>Does it look like he gave in and is now a neocon? GOOD! Thats what its supposed to look like, you dumb motherfucker!

Based on current social spending in KSA, their break even price for oil is $72 per barrel. <br><br>3.

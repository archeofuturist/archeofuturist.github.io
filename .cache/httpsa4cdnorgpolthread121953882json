However, as you probably note, to trust in God you have first to believe that God is indeed real. And indeed this is the case. Traditionally, in Christianity, God is the first shown to exist using metaphysical arguments and only then do you ever talk about faith.

Instead, we hold them to be true on the authority that only a necessary truly actual being could have.

The poet encounters the souls of hell who offer him knowledge of the past and future, but never the present. The implication is, that at the end of time, when their is no before or after, only an eternal present, the damned souls, once full of knowledge, will forever remain ignorant of anything.","time":1492671617,"resto":121953882,"id":"2v4moRvq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121965971,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)03:00:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121953882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121953882<\/a><br>Because &quot;What if you&#039;re wrong&quot; is not an argument","time":1492671625,"resto":121953882,"id":"sFpzbsxt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121965988,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)03:00:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121965643\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121965643<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;god did not create evil, we do evil things because we are fallen from the garden of eden when we ate the fruit from the tree of knowledge<\/span><br><br>WHO CREATED THE GARDEN OF EDEN?","filename":"AUTISM","ext":".jpg","w":225,"h":225,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492671637727,"time":1492671637,"md5":"qiccFFej3Ijn1qVemhCtrg==","fsize":5238,"resto":121953882,"id":"57kIYQgm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121966173,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)03:02:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121965988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121965988<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;free will is bad because you can do bad things with free will! this is god&#039;s fault &gt;:(<\/span><br><br>fuck off already retard","filename":"371ba43092fa53cbdc3b048ccd242f98","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":450,"tn_w":83,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492671753705,"time":1492671753,"md5":"Ymgl1MO0LTskvRxSVdBd5w==","fsize":26472,"resto":121953882,"id":"hnSkOnA0","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121966311,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)03:04:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121955949\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121955949<\/a><br><br>I believe that&#039;s what the trendy kids in Uni call a Straw Man.<br><br>Pick your own shit up.","filename":"flipcat","ext":".jpg","w":887,"h":901,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492671855504,"time":1492671855,"md5":"bjobC3BFCyqHmK3Yih9BNQ==","fsize":96616,"resto":121953882,"id":"IdBljih1","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121966478,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)03:06:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121953882\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121953882<\/a><br>Pascal isn&#039;t a smart man\/edgy teenager.","time":1492671973,"resto":121953882,"id":"pKcwioto","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121966552,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)03:07:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121957485\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121957485<\/a><br><br>Are you Portubro who laments the blasphemy in these threads?

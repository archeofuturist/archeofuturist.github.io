However, as you probably note, to trust in God you have first to believe that God is indeed real. And indeed this is the case. Traditionally, in Christianity, God is the first shown to exist using metaphysical arguments and only then do you ever talk about faith.

Instead, we hold them to be true on the authority that only a necessary truly actual being could have.

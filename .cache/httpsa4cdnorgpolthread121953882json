However, as you probably note, to trust in God you have first to believe that God is indeed real. And indeed this is the case. Traditionally, in Christianity, God is the first shown to exist using metaphysical arguments and only then do you ever talk about faith. It is held that the existence of God and His basic properties are known through reason alone, but other facts cannot be grasped by our feeble minds. Instead, we hold them to be true on the authority that only a necessary truly actual being could have. That is faith: to trust in God.","time":1492665919,"resto":121953882,"id":"GddmXtMI","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":121957941,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:30:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121957431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121957431<\/a><br>Obviously not, as hell would follow the same logic.

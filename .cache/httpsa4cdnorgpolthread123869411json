But whatever he may himself have thought, his theories are essentially philosophical and political rather than scientific; and judged from that standpoint they can claim both successes and failures. Marx erred in claiming that events are determined totally by economic factors. Even in countries that underwent socialist revolutions of a Marxist type, the power wielded by individuals such as Lenin, Stalin, and Mao gave the lie to the theory that only impersonal forces give history its shape. But, on the other hand, no historian, not even a historian of philosophy, would nowadays dare to deny the influence of economic factors on politics and culture.<br>If we look back, a century and a half later, on the proposals of The Communist Manifesto, we find a mixture of rash draconian measures enforceable only by tyranny (e.g. abolition of inheritance and compulsory agricultural labour), institutions that advanced countries now take for granted (progressive taxation and universal education), and experiments that have been adopted with greater or less success in different times and places (nationalization of railways and banks). Considered as a prophet, Marx has been discredited; and so has his claim that ideology is merely the smokescreen of the status quo. But the most convincing refutation of the thesis that consciousness is impotent to determine life is provided by Marx\u2019s own philosophy. For the history of the world since his death has been enormously influenced, for good or ill, by his own system of ideas, considered not as a scientific theory, but as an inspiration to political activism and a guideline for political regimes.","time":1493790422,"resto":123869411,"id":"9D5xlT0P","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123878530,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:47:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123877943\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123877943<\/a><br>Stormf*gs aren&#039;t welcome either, just as cringe as leddit. <br><br>Take the anti Spence shills and Donalders with you.","time":1493790443,"resto":123869411,"id":"1RVgZ6CQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123878576,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:47:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123878500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123878500<\/a><br><br>this is faggy trash copypasta","time":1493790473,"resto":123869411,"id":"fHp49UBv","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":123878591,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:48:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123870426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123870426<\/a><br>This.<br><br>If I have to keep seeing retarded threads about this literal who faggot, I want to at least see him taking it up the ass from some aids nigger.","time":1493790480,"resto":123869411,"id":"lhnRqkP+","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":123878693,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:49:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123878576\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123878576<\/a><br>UGH jewish dissgusting CTR shill ALERT!","time":1493790550,"resto":123869411,"id":"deL\/G9Yu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123878707,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)01:49:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"He&#039;s just saying Marx was right about their being a problem.

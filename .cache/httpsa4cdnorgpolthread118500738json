Rented a 4x4 and camped and hiked the whole island. It&#039;s really sad that most people just drink in Reykjavik and do the day tours. Miss out on the awesomeness of iceland. I went back 3 years ago and spent more time in the west fjords and got to know the locals a little more. It&#039;s a wonderfull countryside but I&#039;m sure between tourism\/liberal ideas in the capitol, the clock is ticking.","time":1490623862,"resto":118500738,"id":"cn\/nXne0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118517055,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)10:25:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118514387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118514387<\/a><br>Please nippon.

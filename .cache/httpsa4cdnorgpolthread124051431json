Think about how rediculous the entire system is. One man runs the entire executive branch, under a thousand write all our laws and some unelected old fucknuts in the Supreme Court &quot;&quot;&quot;interpret&quot;&quot;&quot; those laws to see if they jive with a piece of paper written by some fucknuts hundreds of years ago. All this while claiming fairness because people voted for some of them, even though you don&#039;t need to own property, work or even be able to fucking read to vote. It&#039;s ridiculous on its face anon, but it&#039;s sadly still better than no goberment at all or communism","time":1493900222,"resto":124051431,"id":"Gl8AGWfD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124054561,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)08:17:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124051431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124051431<\/a><br>stupid russian","time":1493900271,"resto":124051431,"id":"G2wpYiHp","country":"PK","country_name":"Pakistan"},{"no":124054601,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)08:18:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124051431\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124051431<\/a><br>He&#039;s not a clown, he&#039;s a fucking shabbos goy","time":1493900301,"resto":124051431,"id":"2XWD5vRX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124054609,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)08:18:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124053007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124053007<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.<\/span>","time":1493900306,"resto":124051431,"id":"7ZFeiPWO","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"}]}

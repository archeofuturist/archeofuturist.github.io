That\u2019s how we speak to each other, how we express ourselves is buying shit. I have a dream? The peak of our dreams is a new hat for our doppel, a hat that doesn\u2019t exist. It\u2019s not even there, we buy shit that\u2019s not even there. Show us something real and free and beautiful, you couldn\u2019t. It\u2019d break us, we\u2019re too numb for it, our minds would choke. There\u2019s only so much wonder we can bear, that\u2019s why when you find any wonder whatsoever you dole it out in meager portions, and only then til it\u2019s augmented and packaged and pumped through ten thousand pre-assigned filters, til it\u2019s nothing more than a meaningless series of lights, while we ride day-in, day-out \u2014 going where? Powering what? All tiny cells in tiny screens and bigger cells in bigger screens and fuck you. Fuck you, that\u2019s what it boils down to is fuck you. Fuck you for sitting there and slowly knitting things worse. Fuck you and your spotlight and your sanctimonious faces and fuck you all, for taking the one thing I ever came close to anything real about anything. For oozing around it and crushing it into a bone, into a joke, one more ugly joke in a kingdom of millions and then fuck you. Fuck you for happening.

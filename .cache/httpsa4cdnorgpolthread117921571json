She went to the boy\u2019s side, speaking to him as if he were an old friend, while Martinez stood beside them and stared down the harasser, rendering the man silent and causing him to sit down. The man eventually left the train without incident, but Martinez remained unnerved by the experience. It was the first time he had witnessed someone \u201cdirectly threatening someone else\u201d in his five years in New York City.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; That kind of incident has only become more common since the fall. Hate crimes were already on the rise in New York in 2016, and spiked after Donald Trump\u2019s election \u201celectrified the radical right,\u201d as the Southern Poverty Law Center put it. Nearly 900 \u201chate incidents\u201d were reported to the SPLC immediately after Trump\u2019s victory, and harassment remained above pre-election levels well into January. Just this week there\u2019s been a rash of bomb threats made to Jewish Community Centers throughout the country.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Four months later, Martinez now trains 30 politically active liberal men in powerlifting, so they can be strong enough to defend themselves against attacks by far-right extremists, and to intervene in potential hate crimes like the one Martinez encountered on the train. Some have called it the #SwoleLeft.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; \u201c[Conservatives] thinks we\u2019re weak, we\u2019re snowflakes, we\u2019re hiding in our safe spaces.

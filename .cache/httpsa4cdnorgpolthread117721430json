The second standard is that exempt employees must in fact be treated as a salaried employee. This means that the employee is routinely paid a set amount at a set interval. Claiming an employee as a salaried employee, yet docking pay by minutes or hours if the employee is late or leaves for a doctor\u2019s visit is not treating the employee as a salaried employee. Another standard is the nature of the job itself. Exempt employees must engage in duties that are considered \u201cwhite-collar\u201d work, such as executive, professional and administrative duties.

The second standard is that exempt employees must in fact be treated as a salaried employee. This means that the employee is routinely paid a set amount at a set interval. Claiming an employee as a salaried employee, yet docking pay by minutes or hours if the employee is late or leaves for a doctor\u2019s visit is not treating the employee as a salaried employee. Another standard is the nature of the job itself. Exempt employees must engage in duties that are considered \u201cwhite-collar\u201d work, such as executive, professional and administrative duties. An employee must have some level of independent judgment and discretion in making decisions on behalf of the company.<\/span>","time":1490161961,"resto":117721430,"id":"z6bKpUSs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117727435,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:52:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117726828\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117726828<\/a><br>Not unless I&#039;m out of town.","time":1490161970,"resto":117721430,"id":"4Tv13ZJT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117727529,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:54:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117727175\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117727175<\/a><br>Capitalism is so great, isn&#039;t it?","time":1490162043,"resto":117721430,"id":"9UUe7V77","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117727680,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:55:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117727529\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117727529<\/a><br>Its not really capitalism when you have a shitty government that bails out retarded companies\/banks with tax payers money","time":1490162144,"resto":117721430,"id":"YkoyFeaR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117727812,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:57:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117721430\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117721430<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Full time job with good benefits and overtime <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Very hard to get hired on<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;18.00 an hour<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Best shitty job i&#039;ve ever had<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Full of cool people with a family like vibe<\/span><br><br>I lucked out for what I got.

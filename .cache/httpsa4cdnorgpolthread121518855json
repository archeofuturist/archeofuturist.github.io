Socialism isn&#039;t limited to Marxism y&#039;know. Both the Strassers were more interested in non-Marxist Socialisms, particularly Prussian Socialism and Guild Socialism, with heavy influence from Mussolini&#039;s Corporatism. Gregor maintained an ongoing working relationship with the Nazi Party of course, (well, until the NoLK), so his ideology was more rooted in the less-socialist Hitlerite NS, and Otto spent relatively little time under the NSDAP&#039;s big tent, so his is a little more astray.<br><br>And a tactical alliance with the Soviet Union wasn&#039;t a bad idea, I mean Hitler himself seemed to think so. Fighting a two-front war was what ultimately doomed the 3rd Reich (Though there are plenty of tactical errors as well), and while I understand that Hitler was more or less forced into it, it was still far from ideal. <br><br><a href=\"#p121523078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121523078<\/a><br>Third International Theory is good for Africans, and NazBols are just Russian Strasserites.

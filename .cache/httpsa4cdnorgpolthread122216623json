We currently have single-payer for some people, Medicare, and Medicaid. These are more cost efficient than private insurance. Fine, but even with that health is 20% of the U.S. budget AND 20% of GDP. If we took over 20% of GDP in a 17 trillion dollar economy, even with improved efficiency, isn&#039;t that a spending increase close to equal the ENTIRE current government budget of 4 trillion?<br><br>Am I missing something? Is U.S. government revenue comparatively low for our GDP? Is single-payer THAT much more efficient? Is &quot;medicare for all&quot; just a bro lore fantasy for leftists?","filename":"bro-science","ext":".jpg","w":350,"h":270,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":192,"tim":1492825062698,"time":1492825062,"md5":"mlGP9wsJPrU7xnGfaCXkcg==","fsize":16883,"resto":0,"id":"tAWLdD\/B","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"medicareforall","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122216975,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)21:40:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Obamacare, Medicare, Medicaid should all be repealed.

Bring safety\/sporting gear if you have it, but don&#039;t look like you came dressed for a riot.<br>4) Do NOT talk to press about stupid alt-right shit or memes, stay on-message.<br>5) Do NOT cause damage to the campus or the downtown area.<br><br>1) DO wear Auburn colors to the rally - dark blue and orange<br>2) DO act civil and composed - there must be a stark contrast between you and the Antifa hooligans<br>3) DO take lots of pics and vids so you can report any Antifa to police\/university.<br>4) DO talk to press about the importance of defending speech, ESPECIALLY unpopular speech, on college campuses.<br>5) DO stay after the rally to help clean up damage caused by Antifa.

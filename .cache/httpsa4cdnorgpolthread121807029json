They think that liking anime makes them superior to those who don&#039;t, they think that if someone does not like anime it means they are too stupid to understand it and they worship Japan. There ongoing obsession with Japan makes me want to kill myself, they all want to learn japanese and move to Japan to be an anime artist. They insist on speaking in broken Japanese all the time, trying to show off to there fellow anime losers just how much they know and they get offended if you say a slight word against Japan. They also have an obsessin with gay people and yell and scream whenever they see one, they say that gay people should be treated the same as straight people yet i don&#039;t see then shout and scream when they see a straight couple do you? No, they only reason they love gay people is becasue they are desperate to show the world how openmided they are and they just wait for someone to something like &#039;thats so gay&#039; so that they have have a 3 hour discussion about it.I myself don&#039;t have anything against gays but to be honest i don&#039;t really think about it. I could go on for hours but I can&#039;t be botherd just know one thing Anime couldn&#039;t be crapper if it tried.","time":1492582590,"resto":121807029,"id":"ju2SW2Ya","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121812754,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)02:17:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121807029\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121807029<\/a><br>Most of it is absolute garbage, but cute girls are alright with me.","time":1492582659,"resto":121807029,"id":"e2WARAQZ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121813226,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)02:22:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121812647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121812647<\/a><br>No, it&#039;s fucking true.

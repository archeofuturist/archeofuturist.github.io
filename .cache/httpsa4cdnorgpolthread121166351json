The conflict will probably be prolonged and will result in heavy casualty for both sides. From my belief, the fact that Kim Jong Un is essentially a deity in North Korea might make it so they won&#039;t surrender so easily, which means they might fight to the very last man - or atleast until Kim calls it off. Nuclear weapons will most definitely be used, however it&#039;s unlikely that anything will hit US soil. North Korea hasn&#039;t perfected the nuclear bomb yet so making one small enough to put on a ICBM is far from likely. The farthest North Korea will be able to launch a missile would probably be to Tokyo or Shanghai. Either way the war will definitely go in the US&#039;s favor because of our overwhelming firepower and we will most likely win and overthrow Kim - but this might take a lot longer then expected.","time":1492229898,"resto":121166351,"id":"jM4993GQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121168481,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)00:20:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121167975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121167975<\/a><br>You honestly believe China is going to keep sticking up for NK?

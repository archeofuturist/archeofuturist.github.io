Docs discovered that when the gov&#039;t was writing checks they could charge more for their services, as compensation for the rising costs of their training--overall, for the artificial skews introduced in the colleges, and in fields that were more specialized for the increased demand on routine doc visits rather than immediate need. Routine HC evolved into symptom management with prescription drugs, which were similarly subsidized (the econ affect of which is wash and repeat). Insurers compensated for overall rising costs through higher premiums that those on the lower end of the econ spectrum could not afford. Not that they ever could, but there came to be a leftist viewpoint that everyone deserved their HC because life ought be an exercise in equality, even if it placed undue burden on insurers or the budget. Along came the latest prog pusher; although he wouldn&#039;t ask country not yet ready for full socialism to go for it, insurers were forced to take on those who couldn&#039;t afford what they offered, subsidizing yet more ppl and their discretionary HC decisions through public coverage if not private, with no way for insurers to avoid high risk.

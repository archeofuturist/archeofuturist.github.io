Essentially, antifa is being enticed into more violent guerrilla techniques. You&#039;ll start to see random bombing and terror campaigns in densely populated cities (think back to the Weather Underground, but far more destructive).<br><br>3. They are being aligned with well armed and trained insurgents, many of whom are refugees and members of Islamic State. <br><br>4. Expect to see them escalate quite soon as we approach the warmer Summer climate in the US.

They are prone to manipulation and have nothing to lose. <br><br>6. It&#039;s the core 10% that is guiding and managing. Trained insurgents entering as refugees, but more often rogue elements of CIA, trafficking cartels and university professors on CIA payroll. Politicians whose names you&#039;d recognize have a stake as well. This 10% helps produce much of the messaging and organizing for the 90% to do the dirty work. <br><br>In the following short, skip to 15:15, where you can see them organizing with refugees and aligning with radical American insurgents in Syria (read: &quot;deep state&quot;): https:\/\/sub.media\/video\/trouble-2-b<wbr>ash-the-fash\/ (This short, incidentally, is CIA&#039;s latest guiding hand.

Now these groups have realized they no longer have the same kind of intimidation, so they are trying to escalate the situation. Provoke the right into attacking them or prevent it from continuing action. This is in an effort to hold the illusion they are some kind of all powerful entity we should be afraid of. Sure, some of them could actually fuck your shit up. But the majority of their show of force is just that, posturing. Call their bluff.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2. &quot;Never go outside the expertise of your people.&quot;<\/span><br>Gathering arms, posturing, and in some cases being sucessful isn&#039;t anything new to the left. The 20th century is scattered with examples of them. But until recently it has been neglected to say the least. Groups that pop up like &quot;redneck revolt&quot;, and &quot;john brown gun club,&quot; are way for leftists to brush up. The problem is that this is no longer the 70s. The feds and police have wised up to leftist language and antics. Regardless, keep a close watch on them. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3. &quot;Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy.&quot;<\/span><br>This is where things get tricky for the left. The right has been observing, copying, and in some cases refining leftist political tactics (weaponized autism and doxxing). The right also has a large swath of people that are armed, angry, and currently outpacing the left in organizing. Sure, there are some members of Antifa that have seen something on the frontlines in Syria, but they don&#039;t have the number of combat vets the right does.

To repeal it would be throwing away so many votes for the republicans so the only way to &quot;fix it&quot; would be to regulate the insurance companies to stop them from increasing rates for everyone else but that can&#039;t really be done because that isn&#039;t the republicans forte. Basically the republicans only choice is political suicide either by regulating insurance companies or hospitals prices and lose the support of hardcore republicans or repeal the whole deal and get millions of people off of coverage and lose all those possible moderate votes","time":1490498439,"resto":118312249,"id":"sA1zzOwP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118314260,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)23:33:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"An idea....Everyone that is a citizen independent of age gets a card. Either the company you work for or the government (if you are unemployed, disabled, less than 18 or 65+, veteran, etc) puts money on the card each year for you to use for healthcare purchases. This acts as a direct apples to apples comparison between choosing where to work (i.e how much money does Company A give each year) If you leave a company the money stays with you, it works like a bank account and people can send their money to anyone else with a card. The money the government hands out comes from taxes people pay out of each paycheck and the money from the company is overhead.<br><br>The other sub-issues that have to be addressed:<br>Insurance companies go away, people choose their own doctors based on public prices so that actual decisions can be made by the public, medical school costs adjust.","time":1490499198,"resto":118312249,"id":"ZBoPHGw+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118314465,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)23:35:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118312249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118312249<\/a><br>Medicare for All<br><br>It&#039;s the only way.<br><br><a href=\"#p118314260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118314260<\/a><br>And what happens if you need major surgery and it costs $400,000?

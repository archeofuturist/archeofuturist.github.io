By its own terms, the law does not make all simulated child pornography illegal, only that found to be obscene or lacking in serious value. And mere possession of said images is not a violation of the law unless it can be proven that they were transmitted through a common carrier, such as the mail or the internet, or transported across state lines.[62]","time":1491322308,"resto":119481232,"id":"+agMYskz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119484112,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)12:12:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119481460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119481460<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119481638\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119481638<\/a><br>Actually, about that","filename":"animu illegal","ext":".png","w":2289,"h":1744,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1491322338791,"time":1491322338,"md5":"zsH9Iz0uCOW7rIX3CY+QFg==","fsize":161812,"resto":119481232,"id":"ZXZuhlII","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119484166,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)12:12:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"Consequences for me to have a different opinion here are way less severe than they would be in America.","time":1491322371,"resto":119481232,"id":"om+iWfOC","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":119484225,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)12:13:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119482634\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119482634<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s also illegal to scream &quot;FIRE!&quot; in a movie theater<\/span><br>this actually isn&#039;t illegal in the US, you will however get kicked out for being a dick.","time":1491322405,"resto":119481232,"id":"A4rHOq+V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119484231,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)12:13:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119482023\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119482023<\/a><br>Social Tyranny is an entirely different issue than regular old Political Tyranny.

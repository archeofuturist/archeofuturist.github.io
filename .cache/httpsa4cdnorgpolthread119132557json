Do you know that it took years to complete the Watergate proceedings? There were so many people, doing so many different illegal things to accomplish the whole task, that it took years to process the evidence, build the cases, and try them all in courts. <br><br>The fucker Nixon was even re-elected in the middle of it all, with newspapers releasing stories about scandal the whole time. How&#039;s that for some bullshit?<br><br>&quot;Fake News&quot; is a powerful meme, even in that time period, which Nixon was very prominent in declaring. But it&#039;s so easy to get to facts nowadays. It doesn&#039;t matter what the public opinion is. Once you have investigative bodies getting their hands on the right information things proceed regardless of the memes.<br><br>The most ridiculous part is that some of these committees are still using paper binders for documents. If we had a 21st century government, I think Trump would already be in court.","filename":"1490305602135","ext":".jpg","w":1628,"h":1035,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":158,"tim":1491013612523,"time":1491013612,"md5":"XN\/+NEQXR4nDC3TO0izZqA==","fsize":525666,"resto":0,"id":"rjken2XX","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-live-in-an-amazing-time-the-trump","country_name":"United States","replies":107,"images":26,"unique_ips":45,"tail_size":50},{"no":119132939,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)22:30:59","name":"Dr Sage and Mr Hide","com":"<a href=\"#p119132557\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119132557<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do you know that it took years to complete the Watergate proceedings?<\/span><br>meanwhile your shitpost only takes 10 seconds, and this sage only 5,kys","filename":"1462560043039","ext":".jpg","w":310,"h":394,"tn_w":98,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491013859280,"time":1491013859,"md5":"ISiMpy049X84ZAQEJ+Z0XA==","fsize":34259,"resto":119132557,"id":"psau8JXN","country":"TH","country_name":"Thailand"},{"no":119133413,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)22:35:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119132939\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119132939<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;random flag<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pro-trump<\/span><br><br>Hi Russia.

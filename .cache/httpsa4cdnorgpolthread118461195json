You guys need to learn how to live compactly lol. Use triple bunk beds and only focus on having a large living room \/kitchen.Put dressers in closets if you need another bunk. Organize who gets shower time in 15-minute intervals.Simple shit like that.<br><br>You don&#039;t need a 20x20 br for 1-2 people. You spend most of your time in the common areas. Fuck if you&#039;ve got kids let them run outside,its good for them.<br><br><br>My grandpa bought a used circus tent and set it up about 20 ft from our house. It kept the rain off us and we would have a blast. .It extended our play time alot. You can buy large party tents these days pretty cheap. They even have inflatable ones.<br><br>Yes,it&#039;s hot in the summer but open the the top flap and sides flaps and you create a nice breeze because the heat goes out the top and pulls the air from the bottom. Put and above ground pool in it. Use a projector and watch movies on the walls.<br><br>You&#039;ve been suckered into this &#039; american dream is a giant house &#039; ILLUSION!! by this system we&#039;re trapped in.<br><br>Just because some people live cheaply does not mean they live badly.<br><br>It&#039;s senpai\/friends that count.","filename":"Nh3Zhqb","ext":".jpg","w":683,"h":800,"tn_w":213,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490583189745,"time":1490583189,"md5":"52\/LyzH5PwyncXd3yt0LTQ==","fsize":442469,"resto":0,"id":"\/X79n3OE","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-large-house-happiness-thing-is-a-myth","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

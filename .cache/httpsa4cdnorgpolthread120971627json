This reduced the yield by 50% by eliminating the fast fissioning of the uranium tamper by the fusion neutrons, and eliminated 97% of the fallout (1.5 megatons of fission, instead of about 51.5 Mt), yet still proved the full yield design. The result was the &quot;cleanest&quot; weapon ever tested with 97% of the energy coming from fusion reactions. The effect of this bomb at full yield on global fallout would have been tremendous. It would have increased the world&#039;s total fission fallout since the invention of the atomic bomb by 25%.<br><br>Despite the very substantial burst height of 4,000 m (13,000 ft) the vast fireball reached down to the Earth, and swelled upward to nearly the height of the release plane. The blast pressure below the burst point was 300 PSI, six times the peak pressure experienced at Hiroshima. The flash of light was so bright that it was visible at a distance of 1,000 kilometers, despite cloudy skies.

bombs and hydrogen bombs have a powerful radio receivers built into them, which receives all frequencies on borth shortwave and longwave, plus FM and AM radio. In a hydrogen bomb, this receiver causes the water inside the bomb to be saturated with radio-waves, which in effect makes the water highly radioactive. Thus when the bomb later explodes, countless radioactive water molecules explode into the air and vaporize, causing a deadly cloud of radioactive water. This is what makes hydrogen bombs more dangerous than nuclear bombs, because the radioactive steam will fall to the ground and more easily penetrate into living matter (because living things absorb water molecules easily).","filename":"gas all kikes 9999999","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":8470,"tn_w":7,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492125018265,"time":1492125018,"md5":"oMo7NXyvjoGLQ2MShwb+Bw==","fsize":1033119,"resto":120971627,"id":"tHkI1Msz","country":"SE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120979395,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)19:10:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120979203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120979203<\/a><br>Polish Saber best saber in Poland<br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/IGlgpslOaRY<br><br>very nice sword and history and culture behind it.","time":1492125024,"resto":120971627,"id":"B4OA0OtY","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":120979450,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)19:10:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120976345\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120976345<\/a><br>Light can travel 300 km per millisecond.

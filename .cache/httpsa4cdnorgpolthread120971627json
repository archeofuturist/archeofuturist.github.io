This reduced the yield by 50% by eliminating the fast fissioning of the uranium tamper by the fusion neutrons, and eliminated 97% of the fallout (1.5 megatons of fission, instead of about 51.5 Mt), yet still proved the full yield design. The result was the &quot;cleanest&quot; weapon ever tested with 97% of the energy coming from fusion reactions. The effect of this bomb at full yield on global fallout would have been tremendous. It would have increased the world&#039;s total fission fallout since the invention of the atomic bomb by 25%.<br><br>Despite the very substantial burst height of 4,000 m (13,000 ft) the vast fireball reached down to the Earth, and swelled upward to nearly the height of the release plane. The blast pressure below the burst point was 300 PSI, six times the peak pressure experienced at Hiroshima. The flash of light was so bright that it was visible at a distance of 1,000 kilometers, despite cloudy skies. One participant in the test saw a bright flash through dark goggles and felt the effects of a thermal pulse even at a distance of 270 km.","time":1492122114,"resto":120971627,"id":"B4OA0OtY","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":120973123,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)18:21:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120972350\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120972350<\/a><br>lol, nice autism","time":1492122115,"resto":120971627,"id":"MDi2jHkW","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120973245,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)18:22:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120971747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120971747<\/a><br>Not exactly bigger but wider google MIRV bomb","time":1492122170,"resto":120971627,"id":"Vrg+2U9j","country":"PR","country_name":"Puerto Rico"},{"no":120973263,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)18:23:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120973035\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120973035<\/a><br><br>Could there be a louder message than the entire sky of a country being fire?","filename":"1478285251321","ext":".gif","w":695,"h":392,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492122181020,"time":1492122181,"md5":"xaXPauh7bdE+JSBzEiYWcg==","fsize":2350945,"resto":120971627,"id":"u2o2OsKw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120973372,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)18:23:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"REAL footage of the tsar bomba<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=aMY<wbr>YEsKvHvk","time":1492122231,"resto":120971627,"id":"Fv0IlLbL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120973465,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)18:24:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120973263\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120973263<\/a><br>in case you didnt know the atmosphere doesnt have boarders","time":1492122268,"resto":120971627,"id":"VZzscSWF","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120973502,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)18:24:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Wrong , russia has THE FATHER OF ALL BOMBS , comparable to the US MOAB , non nuclear as well .

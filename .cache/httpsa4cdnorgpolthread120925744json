As result of this approach, it was almost every Western capitalist country that was &quot;fascist&quot;, with the Third Reich being just the &quot;most reactionary&quot; one.[2][3] As result, after 1941 &quot;fascist&quot; was used in Soviet Union to describe virtually any anti-Soviet activity: for example, the international investigation on Katyn massacre was described as &quot;fascist libel&quot;.,[4] the Warsaw Uprising as &quot;illegal and organised by fascists&quot;.[5] Communist S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa described trotskyism, titoism and imperialism as &quot;variants of fascism&quot;.[6]<\/span><br><br>The Berlin Wall was called the &quot;Anti-Fascist Protection Barrier&quot;.

If your parents don&#039;t get upset at you for doing something, it&#039;s not cool. That&#039;s a fucking fact. Back in the early post-soviet era parents and the public in general scorned anything Socialist or Communist-themed, which is why we got a generation of lefty dildos who rebelled against their parents and go around LARPing as commies, while all the normal kids did what they always did--became boring conservatives, i.e. Republicans.<br><br>But that was nothing--NOTHING--compared to the forces arrayed against us. The sheer scope and magnitude of the cultural anathema that National Socialism and Fascist aesthetics cannot be adequately described in words. There is a constant pressure on every depiction of it. Every single time you see Nazis, it is in a context to make them seem evil, sinister, powerful, monstrous, frightening.<br><br>That last one. That&#039;s what&#039;s important. It&#039;s frightening. Frightening enough to scare adults. See, that&#039;s what children want. Deep down, all children are terrified of their parents, and the worse they&#039;re raised, the more terrified they are. All they really want is to impose that fear onto everyone else. When you see kids acting out, it isn&#039;t to try and frustrate their parents--frustrating them doesn&#039;t get them what they want. They want to SCARE their parents. They want their parents to fear them, because being feared makes you feel powerful, and children live in a perpetual state of powerlessness.<br><br>Now think back. What were parents scared of in the 1970s? Communism. But that fear is dead now. Nobody is afraid of communists, we laugh at them.<br><br>Nazis, though.

Kids used to dress up like vampires and shit because they felt it made them intimidating.<br><br>You know what&#039;s more intimidating than some pale faggot with long hair? The SS. What we can offer children right now is UNLIMITED power. Power to disrupt society, power to horrify their parents, power to shock, power to stun, power to get themselves sent to the principle&#039;s office every time they speak, power to get themselves expelled, the power to destroy relationships with a WORD, power to signal to every one of their friends that they are &quot;in,&quot; they are part of the group, they are part of the movement.<br><br>Fascism is the ultimate counterculture and it has become that way because it was so utterly and effectively suppressed. THAT is what is happening right now. Eighty years of the most deliberate and systematic propaganda imaginable has turned the Nazis into the ultimate villain, with the Swastika as their Icon of Sin.

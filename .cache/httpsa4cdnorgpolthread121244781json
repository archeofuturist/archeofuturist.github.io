The belief that the Gaelic Irish were descended from M\u00edl Esp\u00e1ine and his Spanish followers was current in Spain as well as Ireland, and as a result the Irish in Spain were given all the rights and privileges due to Spanish subjects. In 1680 King Charles II of Spain issued a decree stating that &quot;the Irish in Spain have always enjoyed the same privileges as Spaniards. This has always been the practice and is actually so today.&quot;[17] King Philip V of Spain issued decrees in 1701 and 1718 confirming these rights, stating that the Irish were to be treated as native Spaniards. In 1791, in response to fears about the French Revolution, royal orders were given to create registers of all foreigners then in Spain and to extract an oath of allegiance from them. Three Irish natives living in Cadiz agreed to sign the register, but refused to take the oath which Spaniards were not required to take. The three appealed to the Royal Council in Madrid, who decreed (having consulted the attorney-general) that &quot;the taking of the oath, to which all foreigners have been directed to submit, shall not be extracted from the Irish, seeing that by the sole fact of their settling in Spain the Irish are regarded as Spaniards and have the same rights.&quot;[17] King Charles IV of Spain issued a decree in 1792 confirming this decision by his council.[18]<\/span><br><br>One of the most notable Irishmen in Spain is Leopoldo O&#039;Donnell: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Leopo<wbr>ldo_O%27Donnell,_1st_Duke_of_Tetuan<wbr>","time":1492287006,"resto":121244781,"id":"x3Jn\/W+A","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121254036,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)16:11:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121253443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121253443<\/a><br><br>All Irish need to stick together now the globalists have their claws out<br><br><a href=\"#p121253821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121253821<\/a><br><br>Yeah didn&#039;t the wild geese settle in Spain","filename":"1477937961530","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":465,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492287104230,"time":1492287104,"md5":"pXTkVwrdMHlS8St7GaTDAQ==","fsize":27800,"resto":121244781,"id":"pIpJdPFi","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121254315,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)16:13:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"no offense lads but i think youre overestimating how great ireland really is or could have been, plus a far right movement has very little chances of working due to no actual big issues and most normies are liberal as fuck","time":1492287232,"resto":121244781,"id":"QtKyTVR7","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121254391,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)16:14:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121254036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121254036<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yeah didn&#039;t the wild geese settle in Spain<\/span><br><br>France, Spain, Russia, Austria","time":1492287277,"resto":121244781,"id":"5VXb34F8","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121254396,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)16:14:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121253387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121253387<\/a><br><br>nah there are 3 million so lots of towns and cities and anyway that&#039;s how it starts first the cities then the villages then whats left","time":1492287279,"resto":121244781,"id":"pIpJdPFi","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121254513,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)16:15:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121254036\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121254036<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121253821\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121253821<\/a><br>Yeah, they did.

Once such example was Peter Lacy, a Field Marshal in the Imperial Russian Army, whose son Franz Moritz Graf von Lacy excelled in the Austrian service. General Maximilian Ulysses Graf von Browne, the Austrian commanding officer in the Battle of Lobositz, was also of Irish descent. Recruitment for Austrian service was especially associated with the midlands of Ireland and with the Taaffe O&#039;Neillan and O&#039;Rourke gentry families.[citation needed] However, Count Alexander O&#039;Nelly (O&#039;Neill) came from Ulster. He commanded the 42nd Bohemian Infantry Regiment from 1734 to 1743. Much earlier, in 1634, during the Thirty Years&#039; War, Irish officers led by Walter Deveraux assassinated general Albrecht von Wallenstein on the orders of the Emperor. In the 19th century, further Irish officers served in the Habsburg Empire, so Laval Graf Nugent von Westmeath and Maximilian Graf O\u2019Donnell von Tyrconnell, who saved the life of Emperor Franz Joseph I during an assassination attempt. Gottfried von Banfield finally became the most successful Austro-Hungarian naval aeroplane pilot in the First World War.<\/span>","time":1492287338,"resto":121244781,"id":"x3Jn\/W+A","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121254570,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)16:16:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121254315\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121254315<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Overestimating how great ireland really is or could have been<\/span><br><br>Why do so many foreigners come move here then?","time":1492287368,"resto":121244781,"id":"sRAR99HD","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121254599,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)16:16:21","name":"Thiobraid \u00c1rann","com":"who \/comfy\/ here?","filename":"1491859901831","ext":".jpg","w":624,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":96,"tim":1492287381951,"time":1492287381,"md5":"i6s7nqdzK\/PYrQJdpcLgjQ==","fsize":214114,"resto":121244781,"id":"vMQne8BK","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121255155,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)16:19:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121254599\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121254599<\/a><br><br>Up the Tipp (gdad from there)","time":1492287554,"resto":121244781,"id":"pIpJdPFi","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121255260,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)16:20:03","name":"Thiobraid \u00c1rann","com":"<a href=\"#p121255155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121255155<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Up the Tipp (gdad from there)<\/span><br>Whereabouts?","time":1492287603,"resto":121244781,"id":"vMQne8BK","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121255387,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)16:21:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121255260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121255260<\/a><br><br>Dundrum.

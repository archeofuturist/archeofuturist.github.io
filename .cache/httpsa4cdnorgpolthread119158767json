They were reported to go fairly well, Cina saying that the US and China share far more goals in common than differences, and that they had agreed upon finding a resolution to deal with North Korea. <br><br>Japan, one of the United States closest allies, has stated that they are ready for conflict with North Korea. <br><br>South Korea and the US continue to do military exercises outside the North Korean border. <br><br>Some may argue that this is uncalled for, but these military exercises started when diplomacy was obviously a dying option. As North Korea continues to distance themselves from China, and continues to threaten neighboring countries and the US with nuclear intentions. <br><br>His has been an ongoing problem for quite some time, but recently it&#039;s been hitting a boiling point.<br><br>The question isn&#039;t if, but when? North Korea has isolated itself to the point of where a collision with the US would be its destruction. But there is no real idea whether North Korea has working nuclear warheads or if they don&#039;t. <br><br>This the issue with an isolated country. They could possibly have many Chinese nukes stockpiled, and the world has no clue. They could indeed be the skapegoat China needs to wipe someone off the map. Or it could just be Kim Jung Un leading his nation into sudden death. <br><br>What is certain is that a war with North Korea may be one of the only wars since a generation, that is necessary in certain rights. <br><br>Not only does North Korea provide as a threat to the US, but to Japan and South Korea as well. <br><br>This also doesn&#039;t go without saying that their nuclear testings are causing seismic waves that could possibly create devastation for neighboring countries such as China.","filename":"IMG_0077","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491033566191,"time":1491033566,"md5":"TkATIryeyww34al\/\/YqrUQ==","fsize":58965,"resto":0,"id":"c8LH2koa","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-are-close-to-war","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

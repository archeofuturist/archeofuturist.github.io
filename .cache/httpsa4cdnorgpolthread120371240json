The system, which was to combine ground-based units and orbital deployment platforms, was first publicly announced by President Ronald Reagan on March 23, 1983.[1] The initiative focused on strategic defense rather than the prior strategic offense doctrine of mutual assured destruction (MAD). The Strategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) was set up in 1984 within the United States Department of Defense to oversee the Strategic Defense Initiative.","time":1491788169,"resto":120371240,"id":"tKwtAZKv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120371693,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:36:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"The Pacific Missile Range Facility, Barking Sands (IATA: BKH, ICAO: PHBK, FAA LID: BKH) is a U.S. naval facility and airport located five nautical miles (9 km) northwest of the central business district of Kekaha, in Kauai County, Hawaii, United States.[1]<br><br>PMRF is the world&#039;s largest instrumented, multi-dimensional testing and training missile range.[2] The US military and subcontractors favor its relative isolation, ideal year-round tropical climate and encroachment-free environment (see &quot;PMRF Agriculture Preservation Initiative&quot; below). It is the only range in the world where submarines, surface ships, aircraft and space vehicles can operate and be tracked simultaneously. There are over 1,100 square miles (2,800 km2) of instrumented underwater range and over 42,000 square miles (109,000 km2) of controlled airspace. The base itself covers roughly 2,385 acres (965 ha).<br><br>The base includes a 6,000-foot (1,800 m) runway with operations and maintenance facilities. It has roughly 70 housing units and various recreational facilities for those who can access the base.<br><br>The base has support facilities at Port Allen, Makaha Ridge, and Koke&#039;e State Park. The base also uses a portion of the nearby island of Niihau for a remotely operated APS-134 surveillance radar, an 1,100-acre (450 ha) Test Vehicle Recovery Site, the Perch Electronic Warfare site, multiple EW Portable Simulator sites, and a Helicopter Terrain Flight training course.","time":1491788211,"resto":120371240,"id":"tKwtAZKv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120371788,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:37:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"nothing they launch will hit us","time":1491788267,"resto":120371240,"id":"tKwtAZKv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120371950,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:39:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"what are chances of Tokyo being nuked don&#039;t lie to me Anon I want to know the truth","time":1491788362,"resto":120371240,"id":"82spU509","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":120372024,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:39:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120371240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120371240<\/a><br>this is one regime change that should happen","time":1491788396,"resto":120371240,"id":"XRxXXQb9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120372102,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:40:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120371950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120371950<\/a><br>if shit goes down tokyo is fucked","time":1491788442,"resto":120371240,"id":"XRxXXQb9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120372201,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:41:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120371240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120371240<\/a><br><br>Themselves.","time":1491788492,"resto":120371240,"id":"2vGH+LLO","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120372306,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:42:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;going to study in Seoul from next weekend for the next 2 months or so<\/span><br>Please please please wait until I&#039;m back in the USA","time":1491788541,"resto":120371240,"id":"D6oJK6Da","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120372416,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:43:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120372201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120372201<\/a><br>7pbp","time":1491788594,"resto":120371240,"id":"HIFjBqxy","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120372700,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)21:45:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120371950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120371950<\/a><br>I really don&#039;t think they&#039;d hit you guys.

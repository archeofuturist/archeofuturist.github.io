As these mighty glaciers melted, large quantities of water cut channels through sediment and debris in the ground underneath. Today the Mississippi River and its tributaries follow these same channels that were created thousands of years ago. Most Delta soils are farmed, with three-fourths of the cropland to the north and less cropland in the south. Controlling surface water and drainage are major soil management issues. Soils are naturally diverse in the Delta due to their alluvial origin; the sediment originated north of Mississippi. Particle sizes within the sediment decrease as distance from the originating stream increases, i.e. soils closer to running water have proportionally more large silt and sand particles than soils further from the stream. Another factor in Delta soil formation is surface water movement over time. Soils formed under standing water have different properties than soils formed under running water. Slavery in America began when the first African slaves were brought to the North American colony of Jamestown in 1619, to aid in the production of such lucrative crops as tobacco. Slavery was practiced throughout the American colonies in the 17th and 18th centuries, and African-American slaves helped build the economic foundations of the new nation. The invention of the cotton gin in 1793 solidified the central importance of slavery to the South\u2019s economy. By the mid-19th century, America\u2019s westward expansion, along with a growing abolition movement in the North, would provoke a great debate over slavery that would tear the nation apart in the bloody American Civil War. Though the Union victory freed the nation\u2019s 4 million slaves, the legacy of slavery continued to influence American history, from the tumultuous years of Reconstruction to the civil rights movement, a century after emancipation.","time":1491264363,"resto":119396996,"id":"kGg5ZILv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119404108,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:23:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119401399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119401399<\/a><br>You retards set them free and they moved west anyway.","time":1491265420,"resto":119396996,"id":"r29GiO3P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119404258,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:24:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119396996\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119396996<\/a><br>blacks","time":1491265493,"resto":119396996,"id":"skp6kIoi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119404353,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)20:25:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119404108\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119404108<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;more salt<\/span><br><br>That salt delivery is right on time!

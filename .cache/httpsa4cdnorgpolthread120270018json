I think the US has a 3-point scheme:<br><br>- Step 1: Create an artificial civil war in a country. This is usually done to countries laden with oil.<br><br>- Step 2: Allow the civil war to continue for a year or two, completely destabilizing the entire region.<br><br>- Step 3: Come in with forces and &quot;finish&quot; the war. Appoint a leader who is basically an American puppet.<br><br>Meanwhile, large hoards of oil is drained from the country. I think this is their primary motivation. Just take a look at places like Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria. All oil-laden countries.<br><br>I find this revolting. I&#039;ll admit some of it is envy - I&#039;m not going to pretend that there aren&#039;t benefits to being the most powerful country. But even if my country did this, I&#039;d be opposed to the principles. Spending trillions to cause death to thousands innocent children and civilians is just inhumane. These regions will never recover. And the worst part is that the US-installed regime at the &quot;end&quot; of the civil war will continue to drain the place of its resources.<br><br>This is just illegal.","filename":"US-Military-Bases-Worldwide-1-","ext":".jpg","w":770,"h":456,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":148,"tim":1491735199294,"time":1491735199,"md5":"uauwDgJqLco8MevZfd+SSw==","fsize":70017,"resto":0,"id":"TKMyIVcF","country":"IN","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"us-world-policing","country_name":"India","replies":44,"images":9,"unique_ips":26},{"no":120270237,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)06:55:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"Now that you look at history what Britain did to India doesn&#039;t seem so bad.","time":1491735356,"resto":120270018,"id":"iaEuKdKB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120270527,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)06:59:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120270237\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120270237<\/a><br>That was systematic oppression.

This is according to the UK\u2019s The Times.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the article published on April 4, The Times said that \u201cHungary has led a rebellion against the quota scheme with a challenge in the EU courts,\u201d while \u201cPoland has ignored the European Commission\u2019s criticism\u201d.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A diplomatic source told the daily: \u201cThey will have to make a choice: are they in the European system or not? You cannot blackmail the EU, unity has a price.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As reported by Radio Poland online, the European Court of Justice will hold a hearing on the legality of migrant quotas. A verdict is expected by the end of the year. Experts say that the court will likely rule in favour of the scheme.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cWe are confident that the ECJ will confirm validation,\u201d the source told The Times.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cThen they [Hungary and Poland] must abide by the decision. If they don\u2019t then they will face consequences, both financial and political. No more opt-outs. There is no more \u2018one foot in and one foot out\u2019. We are going to be very tough on this.\u201d<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In a separate report, The Budapest Business Journal online noted that the current Hungarian governing Fidesz-KDNP coalition has often voiced its opposition to the relocation quotas, adopting strong anti-Brussels communication. The latest step has been to launch a \u201cstop Brussels\u201d so-called \u201cnational consultation\u201d.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;However, although Hungary\u02bcs Eurosceptic government has vocally criticised Brussels, the findings of a new study by KPMG and GKI, which were published by the Hungarian Prime Minister\u2019s Office, suggest the country cannot afford to leave the EU. Hungary\u2019s economy is highly dependent on EU funding.<\/span><br><br><br>AHAHAHAHAHAHA not so based once daddy decides to cut off your shekel supply huh?","filename":"200_s","ext":".gif","w":174,"h":200,"tn_w":174,"tn_h":200,"tim":1491419888471,"time":1491419888,"md5":"cqo6L5lZl3sJGE4HzWJYXA==","fsize":22001,"resto":0,"id":"VSDc01GM","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"eu-ultimatum-issued-to-poland-and-hungary-take-in","country_name":"Canada","replies":265,"images":68,"unique_ips":117,"tail_size":50},{"no":119643753,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:24:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119642944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119642944<\/a><br>BTFO","time":1491420280,"resto":119642944,"id":"0hAdhFIw","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119643936,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:26:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"our minister said that &quot;there is no way that Poland will pay anything&quot;<br><br>so fuck off and suck little chineese dick","filename":"if-cancer-had-a-flag-a-fucking-leaf-3821723","ext":".png","w":500,"h":388,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":97,"tim":1491420361384,"time":1491420361,"md5":"Udz7iynWv+0CHB1DpGQuuw==","fsize":54808,"resto":119642944,"id":"mKtUmWeW","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119644169,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:27:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"i give the EU 10 years max","time":1491420466,"resto":119642944,"id":"kenAX\/D8","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":119644183,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:27:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119643936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119643936<\/a><br>enjoy being poorer<br><br>u will take them","time":1491420472,"resto":119642944,"id":"0hAdhFIw","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119644231,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:28:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119642944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119642944<\/a><br>We 1984 now","filename":"Frau Kaiserin","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491420499201,"time":1491420499,"md5":"PF98lfmCp0CL68tyIdQUpg==","fsize":15886,"resto":119642944,"id":"hCDrB7T0","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119644278,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:28:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119643936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119643936<\/a><br><br>haha you shitskins will never leave the EU","time":1491420520,"resto":119642944,"id":"VSDc01GM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119644366,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:29:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119644183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119644183<\/a><br>Being poor vs having your culture raped into the ground. id rather be poor","time":1491420563,"resto":119642944,"id":"2i2pfuRE","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119644375,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:29:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119644169\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119644169<\/a><br>Dead before the end of the year.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Warsaw Pact resisting Germany cuckoldry<\/span><br>Don&#039;t say commies never did anything for you.","filename":"1484168324789","ext":".png","w":528,"h":624,"tn_w":105,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491420568925,"time":1491420568,"md5":"g3gekAqQt+yJduFsASVgBQ==","fsize":15109,"resto":119642944,"id":"VrjduTok","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119644578,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:30:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"M I E D Z Y M O R Z E time","filename":"20110911_Intermarium(1)","ext":".jpg","w":160,"h":220,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491420658485,"time":1491420658,"md5":"2E64Xj2a\/WByCKlwE45NOQ==","fsize":14063,"resto":119642944,"id":"++xuMrVM","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":119644653,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:31:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119644183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119644183<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;enjoy being poorer<\/span><br>economy can be fixed<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;enjoy being replaced by subhumans from Africa<\/span><br><br>And no, we will not take a single one.

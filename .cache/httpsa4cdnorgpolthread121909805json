Two days after the socialist republic was proclaimed, Hitler ran for and won a position in Eisner\u2019s government, taking the position of \u201cDeputy Battalion Representative\u201d, where some of his duties included serving as a liaison officer with the Department of Propaganda.[9][10] After Eisner was assassinated in 1919, Hitler attended the funeral and in solidarity with the socialist republic and with Eisner, a Jewish Marxist reformer, he wore a black armband on one arm and a red communist brassard on the other, as evidenced by surviving film footage of the funeral.[9] In the footage, Hitler and a few men from his unit are seen walking in Eisner&#039;s procession. Furthermore, one of Heinrich Hoffmann&#039;s photos of the procession showed Hitler in attendance, taken just before Eisner was eulogized.[9] After Communist Party of Germany seized power, it appears that Hitler did not join a Freikorps with his comrades or desert his post to fight the communists in the streets. This incident suggests that Hitler\u2019s opinions concerning nationalism, socialism and Marxism were still not resolved.<\/span>","filename":"1467081220758","ext":".jpg","w":719,"h":553,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":192,"tim":1492641822307,"time":1492641822,"md5":"jK200v8n3PBZW+i1tOV9iA==","fsize":37533,"resto":0,"id":"KcOLU1DU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hitler-worked-for-a-communist-jew-in-1919","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":1,"unique_ips":7},{"no":121910187,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:46:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121909805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121909805<\/a><br><br>I hope the film actually exists (but I doubt it), too many on the right idealize Hitler when he did more then anyone to discredit nationalism. <br><br>Pinochet is \/ourguy.","time":1492641998,"resto":121909805,"id":"EFA9Yzs7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121910256,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:47:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"really makes you think","time":1492642029,"resto":121909805,"id":"8wAVk0Ko","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121910258,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:47:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121909805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121909805<\/a><br>bump. hitler literally worked in a communist government. fucking kek","time":1492642031,"resto":121909805,"id":"KcOLU1DU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121910572,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:49:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121909805\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121909805<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(April 2017)<\/span><br><br>It was just edited right now? yeah right, the jews or trolls try to shit on him.","time":1492642173,"resto":121909805,"id":"sEK00+cp","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":121910607,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)18:49:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121910187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121910187<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I hope the film actually exists (but I doubt it)<\/span><br><br>both the links in wikipedia were just to articles. with no clips of the video.

Seems like the writer was just trying to smear hitler by interviewing butthurt jews or something.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In Hitler&#039;s First War, award-winning author Thomas Weber delivers a master work of history--a major revision of our understanding of Hitler&#039;s life. Weber paints a group portrait of the List Regiment, Hitler&#039;s unit during World War I, to rewrite the story of his military service. Drawing on deep and imaginative research, Weber refutes the story crafted by Hitler himself, and so challenges the historical argument that the war led naturally to Nazism. Contrary to myth, the regiment consisted largely of conscripts, not enthusiastic volunteers. Hitler served with scores of Jews, including noted artist Albert Weisberger, who proved more heroic, and popular, than the future F\u00fchrer. Indeed, Weber finds that the men shunned Private Hitler as a &quot;rear area pig,&quot; and that Hitler himself was still unsure of his political views when the war ended in 1918. Through the stories of such comrades as a soldier-turned-concentration camp commandant, veterans who fell victim to the Holocaust, an officer who became Hitler&#039;s personal adjutant in the 1930s but then cooperated with British intelligence, and the veterans who simply went back to their Bavarian farms and never joined the Nazi ranks, Weber demonstrates how and why Hitler aggressively policed the myth of his wartime experience.<\/span>","time":1492643604,"resto":121909805,"id":"KcOLU1DU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121915045,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)19:25:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hitler was involved as a counter intelligence agent in the post WWI Reichswehr.

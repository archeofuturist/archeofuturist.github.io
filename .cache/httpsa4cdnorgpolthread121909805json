Two days after the socialist republic was proclaimed, Hitler ran for and won a position in Eisner\u2019s government, taking the position of \u201cDeputy Battalion Representative\u201d, where some of his duties included serving as a liaison officer with the Department of Propaganda.[9][10] After Eisner was assassinated in 1919, Hitler attended the funeral and in solidarity with the socialist republic and with Eisner, a Jewish Marxist reformer, he wore a black armband on one arm and a red communist brassard on the other, as evidenced by surviving film footage of the funeral.[9] In the footage, Hitler and a few men from his unit are seen walking in Eisner&#039;s procession. Furthermore, one of Heinrich Hoffmann&#039;s photos of the procession showed Hitler in attendance, taken just before Eisner was eulogized.[9] After Communist Party of Germany seized power, it appears that Hitler did not join a Freikorps with his comrades or desert his post to fight the communists in the streets. This incident suggests that Hitler\u2019s opinions concerning nationalism, socialism and Marxism were still not resolved.<\/span>","filename":"1467081220758","ext":".jpg","w":719,"h":553,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":192,"tim":1492641822307,"time":1492641822,"md5":"jK200v8n3PBZW+i1tOV9iA==","fsize":37533,"resto":0,"id":"KcOLU1DU","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hitler-worked-for-a-communist-jew-in-1919","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

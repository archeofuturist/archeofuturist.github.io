US high command was rightfully concerned that if Americans made too much headway into North Vietnam, the Chinese would get involved and it would turn into Korea 2: Electric Boogaloo. Therefore our military operations were restricted to purely defensive measures in South Vietnam, and occasional skirmishes into North Vietnam. Rather then simply conquer North Vietnam and risk Chinese involvement, we opted to simply inflict so many casualties on the North that they would give up their aggression and sign a peace treaty with the South. And inflixt massive amounts of casualties we did. <br><br>The problem is that communists have absolutely no regard for the lives of their fellow man. They were getting BTFO but they were always willing to draft or indoctrinate more people to throw into the meat grinder. The NVA were drafting fucking ten year old girls by the end of US involvement. Meanwhile the Chinese were keeping them stocked with weapons and other materials. <br><br>So I&#039;m not sure if you can call it a loss. We never capitulated, and we weren&#039;t defeated militarily. When South Vietnam fell, we were officially not involved with the war in any meaningful way.

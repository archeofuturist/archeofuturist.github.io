We slaughtered their armies, militia, and families and they were practically powerless to stop us. For the duration of American involvement in the war, the North Vietnamese made little if any gains, and what temporary gains they made were shortlived and cost them dearly. From a military standpoint we BTFO of the communists.<br><br>If you are wondering why we didn&#039;t invade and conquer the North, it&#039;s because we didn&#039;t want to, not because we couldn&#039;t. US high command was rightfully concerned that if Americans made too much headway into North Vietnam, the Chinese would get involved and it would turn into Korea 2: Electric Boogaloo. Therefore our military operations were restricted to purely defensive measures in South Vietnam, and occasional skirmishes into North Vietnam. Rather then simply conquer North Vietnam and risk Chinese involvement, we opted to simply inflict so many casualties on the North that they would give up their aggression and sign a peace treaty with the South. And inflixt massive amounts of casualties we did. <br><br>The problem is that communists have absolutely no regard for the lives of their fellow man. They were getting BTFO but they were always willing to draft or indoctrinate more people to throw into the meat grinder. The NVA were drafting fucking ten year old girls by the end of US involvement. Meanwhile the Chinese were keeping them stocked with weapons and other materials. <br><br>So I&#039;m not sure if you can call it a loss. We never capitulated, and we weren&#039;t defeated militarily. When South Vietnam fell, we were officially not involved with the war in any meaningful way.

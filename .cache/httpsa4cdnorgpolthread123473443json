I usually just have a bowl of soup before my entree and as I was waiting to get my soup, two older men were in front of me at the soup bar. One was clearly Dutch and the other British.<br><br>The dutch guy was telling the other guy about a fantastic sea cruise he just got done with and said cruises are the way to vacation. As this guy started getting his soup, the other guy turns to me and says, &quot;Cruises are really the best way to take a vacation. You should really consider it.&quot; Now I don&#039;t mind small talk at the soup bar but does this man really have the right to tell me how I should enjoy my vacation? That&#039;s kind of a personal decision. I think restaurants should post what conversation topics are allowed at the soup (and salad) bars. It really isn&#039;t the place to be telling other people what to do with their free time.<br><br>Why can&#039;t Europeans leave people the fuck alone?","filename":"IMG_3426","ext":".jpg","w":651,"h":478,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":183,"tim":1493555838162,"time":1493555838,"md5":"fTTsAcrGmCA1r1ACR65cjw==","fsize":70194,"resto":0,"id":"Yw2jsmuf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"privacy-americans-and-european-culture","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

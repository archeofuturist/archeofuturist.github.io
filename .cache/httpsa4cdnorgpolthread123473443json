I usually just have a bowl of soup before my entree and as I was waiting to get my soup, two older men were in front of me at the soup bar. One was clearly Dutch and the other British.<br><br>The dutch guy was telling the other guy about a fantastic sea cruise he just got done with and said cruises are the way to vacation. As this guy started getting his soup, the other guy turns to me and says, &quot;Cruises are really the best way to take a vacation. You should really consider it.&quot; Now I don&#039;t mind small talk at the soup bar but does this man really have the right to tell me how I should enjoy my vacation? That&#039;s kind of a personal decision. I think restaurants should post what conversation topics are allowed at the soup (and salad) bars. It really isn&#039;t the place to be telling other people what to do with their free time.<br><br>Why can&#039;t Europeans leave people the fuck alone?","filename":"IMG_3426","ext":".jpg","w":651,"h":478,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":183,"tim":1493555838162,"time":1493555838,"md5":"fTTsAcrGmCA1r1ACR65cjw==","fsize":70194,"resto":0,"id":"Yw2jsmuf","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"privacy-americans-and-european-culture","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":1,"unique_ips":8},{"no":123474272,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)08:48:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123473443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123473443<\/a><br>faggot","time":1493556534,"resto":123473443,"id":"Bef59qCd","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123474590,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)08:53:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123473443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123473443<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why can&#039;t Europeans leave people the fuck alone?<\/span><br><br>Many natives have asked the same question.<br>Be grateful they gave you holiday advice and not TB.<br><br>Seriously though buddy, what&#039;s your problem with small talk?<br>Talking about the weather and your holidays is a time honoured way of avoiding anything controversial like business, politics or religion.<br>If any talk with strangers makes you that uncomfortable, be grateful the Brit didn&#039;t get started on the weather, go would have been listening to the details for hours.","time":1493556813,"resto":123473443,"id":"hoUDkKqe","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123475246,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)09:01:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123473443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123473443<\/a><br>Were you emotionally triggered by a man attempting light conversation with you?<br><br>See a therapist, son.","time":1493557289,"resto":123473443,"id":"WYMBRk7P","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123475357,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)09:03:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123473443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123473443<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bu-hu, people talk to me!<\/span>","time":1493557383,"resto":123473443,"id":"rw+q4m\/I","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":123475650,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)09:06:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123473443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123473443<\/a><br>I know that feel.<br><br>Nothing is worse than small talk with strangers, just leave me the fuck alone.","filename":"1472296877055","ext":".gif","w":250,"h":251,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493557585585,"time":1493557585,"md5":"BxsawMoisa8lMHmxfKr5Rw==","fsize":358530,"resto":123473443,"id":"K4Hqd1p4","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":123475706,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)09:07:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123473443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123473443<\/a><br><br>Go back to blogger faggot.","time":1493557624,"resto":123473443,"id":"dXGQSl5M","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123475838,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)09:08:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123473443\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123473443<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Some random dude is making small talk with you no big deal<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;HELP THIS GUY IS INVADING MY PRIVACY SOMEBODY SAVE ME<\/span><br><br>How fucking autistic are you holy shit.

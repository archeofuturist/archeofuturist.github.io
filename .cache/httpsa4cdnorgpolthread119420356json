If you play make believe a.k.a thinking that you are a man when you are BIOLOGICALLY (keep that in mind) a woman, then you have something seriously wrong with your mental state. I personally don&#039;t have a problem with men going to women or women going to men if they still feel like that they are a man or they are a woman. I don&#039;t know why but that is fine with men. Getting your dick cut off and breasts inserted but still believing you are a man is fine with me. It&#039;s just the people that clearly are fucking idiots thinking that this is a &quot;social construct&quot;. It is not a meme, these people are genuinely fucked in the head and we need them to be first on the day of the rope.","time":1491275240,"resto":119420356,"id":"sh+qZU\/S","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119422759,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)23:11:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119420356\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119420356<\/a><br>Apparently since we&#039;re the majority\/ in power it&#039;s impossible for us to experience the oppression inherent in racism.

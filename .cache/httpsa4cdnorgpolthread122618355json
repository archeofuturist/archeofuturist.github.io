However most of them were talking about how they hate Bolsheviks and how they don&#039;t understand why is western antifa so pro communism.<br><br>So, what is antifa like in other countries?

They endorse communism. Their primary focus seems to be to attend conservative rallies and use physical violence to try to shut things down. They toss glass bottles, M80s, spray mace, and one guy was slamming people over the head with a bike lock. They punch and kick, scream and shout obscenities.

It&#039;s the top right (north eastern) corner of Hyde Park where, every Sunday morning from about 9am - 1pm, a load of weirdos go to preach random bullshit. Every week the same Muslim preacher is there, there is usually a Christian weirdo, and recently a bunch of MGTOW people and Trump supporters have been standing on stepladders giving speeches.<br><br>The crowd tend to heckle them a lot and there is a lot of &quot;healthy debating&quot; going on.<br><br>The most interesting thing about speakers corner though, is the prevalence of Muslims. There are always dozens of them, moving in packs with video cameras and recording iphones, and they approach you and ask you if you want to debate. They then talk at you endlessly about how rational, sensible and awesome the quran is, all the while filming you and recording all your comebacks and arguments. They try their best to be reasonable. To me it just seems a rather sinister way to appear rational and appealing while trying to convert people, recording their arguments so they can go home and work up a counter.<br><br>So, Britbongs of \/pol\/, I will be at speakers corner this Sunday. If anyone wants to come along that would be great. I&#039;ll be there from 10am, I&#039;ll make myself obvious in some way. At the moment the only thing I can think of is by holding a maroon coloured handkerchief in one of my hands. Either way I&#039;ll post closer to the time (Saturday night\/Sunday morning) to let you know where I&#039;ll be.<br><br>Come one, come all, let&#039;s have a good time.","filename":"speakers corner","ext":".jpg","w":1366,"h":768,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492707883082,"time":1492707883,"md5":"\/OHXLInLCphOmPRMI6Ye4g==","fsize":213042,"resto":0,"id":"53RgbFMD","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"london-pol-meetup-speakers-corner","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":122014994,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:08:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122014596\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122014596<\/a><br>In fact, this is probably a far better way to organise meeting.<br><br>Message me on Telegram (it&#039;s like a better, more anonymous version of whatsapp).

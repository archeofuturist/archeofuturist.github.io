Don&#039;t get me wrong, I&#039;d love to see some special snowflakes get their ass kicked, but I&#039;m worried that the war&#039;s going to give rise to something even worse. I don&#039;t think Donald Trump&#039;s the kind of guy to use a civil war for a power grab, but he&#039;s only one guy and his attempts at draining the swamp frankly aren&#039;t working.<br><br>And the worst bit is that it&#039;s not just the US that&#039;s having problems. The EU is apparently not backing down after Brexit, and their starting a new spat over Gibraltar. With Le Pen looking likely, and the possibility of a Frexit, Europe is looking more an more like a powder keg every day.<br><br>Anybody else have thoughts on the matter? I&#039;m probably just being paranoid.","filename":"5454954984","ext":".png","w":800,"h":527,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":164,"tim":1491324701825,"time":1491324701,"md5":"m\/7IvB2oj4vKSZeALAOotA==","fsize":329354,"resto":0,"id":"mFVKQh1o","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"anybody-else-getting-rather-depressed-lately","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":119489929,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)13:08:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"Yes.

In other words, we knew we were running a huge risk of betrayal by supporting him. It was also, as I say, obvious from his speeches and his performance in the debates that he is a stupid and ignorant man. Our only hope, as I also said, was in his gut instincts.<br><br>Le Pen, in all these respects, is a horse of a completely different colour. She has an impeccable record as a woman who has persevered as a complete ostracised political outsider for forty years, and her campaign speeches these last few weeks have been a revelation: rhetorical brilliance and intellectual incisiveness and glorious righteous passion. Le Pen is a genuine nationalist revolutionary in the tradition of Maurras and Peguy, a woman of discipline and conviction, not someone thrown up accidentally by the insane excesses of globalist liberalism.","time":1492287692,"resto":121247620,"id":"zrwB8+T6","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121255506,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)16:21:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121255354\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121255354<\/a><br>he&#039;s pro trump not against him, apparently Bannon leaked some stuff to Cernovich","time":1492287713,"resto":121247620,"id":"12s6EvCx","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":121255535,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)16:22:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121254657\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121254657<\/a><br>HAIL BOTUS","filename":"1489866887067","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492287723963,"time":1492287723,"md5":"zmGgJzJFzENKeRxFp4HpRQ==","fsize":114421,"resto":121247620,"id":"3+U5Jlwe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121255548,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)16:22:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121254588\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121254588<\/a><br>russia respected t-rex bigly while he worked there as a businessman, now that he&#039;s there as a politician i did not pick up too much positive vibes.","time":1492287728,"resto":121247620,"id":"SggBasE3","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":121256093,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)16:26:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121255211\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121255211<\/a><br>Redditor panics at the sight of actual discussion and screams &quot;&#039;muh &#039;pedes, we can go LARP in HERE!&quot;","time":1492287977,"resto":121247620,"id":"zrwB8+T6","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121256486,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)16:29:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121247620\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121247620<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not posting the original<\/span>","filename":"IMG_0431","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":555,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":67,"tim":1492288165707,"time":1492288165,"md5":"XBcEYLGOpniTwtou0LNT0Q==","fsize":122929,"resto":121247620,"id":"P5Gkzwrr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Not long after Romney failed he trademarked his MAGA trademark in anticipation for forcing his way though the Republican primaries, as it became clear to political analysts that there was no strong frontrunner to clinch the nomination. Jeb Bush had the dynasty, MSM favor, and fundraising machine but once he surpassed Bush there was no stopping him. <br>He was able to get votes at a lower cost in primaries than any republican candidate in history. With his combination of very smart hires like Manafort (who won the primaries for every republican he served) and a lean crew using social media to largely propel the message was drastically more cost effective than any other campaign.<br><br>Just like his mentor Perot in the past, Trump was able to self-fund his campaign, largely, due to his enormous wealth, and did not have to serve interests or do events that he did not deem to gain him the votes he needed.<br><br>He went on to win the presidency at the lowest relative campaign cost in modern American political history. He is also the very first American in the entire history of the United States to win the Presidency without holding any prior public office.<br><br>In the area of the Military, POTUS Trump has proposed absolutely radical changes to the scheme of not only foreign policy conduct but fundamentally how the military is structured will be changed for the 21st century.","filename":"a8McHoa","ext":".jpg","w":1808,"h":1264,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1491422148499,"time":1491422148,"md5":"9bg6QcW94pHY8ashn\/pXfg==","fsize":214008,"resto":119645352,"id":"OHthyPob","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119647552,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:55:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Someone post the pics with the names of shills.","time":1491422150,"resto":119645352,"id":"AAzmnR7p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119647557,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:55:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119647141\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119647141<\/a><br>I<br><br>L<br>I<br>K<br>E<br><br>Y<br>O<br>U","filename":"LikeYou","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":168,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491422154330,"time":1491422154,"md5":"znHFN+uDRpuShoU5Mj269g==","fsize":6215,"resto":119645352,"id":"Egv1vvHA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119647570,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:55:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"what i want to happen by end of week<br><br>rice fried<br>gorsuch confirmed<br>obongo being blackbagged back to dc to face charges or testify<br>someone on the left to admit muh russia was bullshit","time":1491422159,"resto":119645352,"id":"qps8E8+q","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119647583,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:56:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"119647134","filename":"db0","ext":".jpg","w":349,"h":642,"tn_w":67,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491422167440,"time":1491422167,"md5":"MZiER3vMbRWYNOTDRlD6dA==","fsize":51895,"resto":119645352,"id":"90li8p8k","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119647590,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)15:56:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119647501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119647501<\/a><br>Take it as a suppository and shove it up your ass.

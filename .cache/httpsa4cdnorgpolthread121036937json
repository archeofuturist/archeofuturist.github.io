Why do you accept the MSM&#039;s propagandists telling you what to think? All of them are writing articles about how &quot;Trump betrayed his supporters&quot;, do you know why they are doing this? It&#039;s so when they take him out people accept his replacement, Pence. &quot;Oh, he betrayed us so fuck him.&quot; is what they will want you to think once they make a move. Do you think the deep state just went away? Has Trump arrested anyone for leaking information about him? There is so much going on behind the scenes, but the shills distract you from it. They narrow their tunnel vision onto Trump and condemn anything he does, reflexively you jump in to defend Trump. They keep bloviating about Trump becoming a &quot;neocon-puppet&quot;, yet they don&#039;t realize the actual implications of such a suggestion. Did you expect all of these events happening now two weeks ago right at the advent of \/mlpol\/? Don&#039;t things seem really off right now? McMaster is alleged to have a plan for a 150,000 man ground invasion of Syria and Pompeo has condemned Wikileaks as a hostile intelligence organisation.<br><br>We are witnessing a deep state coup right in front our very eyes, yet too many of us are distracted by leftist partisans shitting up this board with their mindless trolling. The deep state&#039;s plan looks clear to me, they will twist Trump&#039;s arm feeding him fake intelligence until he commits to an invasion of Syria with ground troops and then take him out because his supporters will feel too betrayed to fight for him.","filename":"pompeo_wikileaks","ext":".png","w":777,"h":1365,"tn_w":142,"tn_h":249,"tim":1492158178913,"time":1492158178,"md5":"qCH1rvnSZaEXbz8d9Ec7jw==","fsize":296463,"resto":0,"id":"TY0Uh+tc","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"did-the-deep-state-just-disappear","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121037269,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)04:28:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121036937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121036937<\/a><br>Did you all forget about the &quot;Counter-Propaganda&quot; Bill?

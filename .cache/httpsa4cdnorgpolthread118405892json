Sens. Tom Udall (N.M.), Sheldon Whitehouse (R.I.), Tom Carper (Del.) and Jack Reed (R.I.) on Friday introduced the the Make Access Records Available to Lead American Government Openness Act \u2014 or MAR-A-LAGO Act.<br><br>The legislation would require the Trump administration to publish public visitor logs for the White House &quot;or any other location where President Trump regularly conducts official business.&quot; Rep. Mike Quigley (D-Ill.) is also introducing a House version of the legislation.<br><br>Democrats have hounded the Trump administration to continue the Obama-era practice of publicly releasing visitor logs, and they want him to extend it to the Florida resort he has called the &quot;winter White House.&quot; Udall accused the administration of &quot;stonewalling&quot; and avoiding transparency.<br><br>&quot;It\u2019s simple: the American people have a right to know who has access to the president and who has leverage over this administration,\u201d he said in a statement.<br><br>In addition to Mar-A-Lago and the White House, the legislation would include visitor lists for Trump Tower and the Trump National Golf Club in New Jersey.<br><br>... The Obama administration published the logs roughly three to four months after they were created. The Democrats noted in their earlier letter that they would expect to start seeing Trump logs as soon as April 20 if the administration were to keep up the practice.<br><br>... As of earlier this month, Trump has reportedly spent nearly a quarter of his time as president in the Sunshine State.

Government still exists and has a real role to play in the function of the nation, but things are done at the smallest level of applicable government. That&#039;s why he wants to end the transfer payments despite being from Quebec (which has, historically, received the most). People in BC and Alberta shouldn&#039;t be funding Quebec&#039;s health care system. Reduce the federal taxation across the board (Income tax goes down for ALL Canadians, lower corporate income tax, no more capital gains tax, etc) and then provincial governments can tax their constituencies as THEY require to meet the requirements and wants of said constituents. He also wants to remove interprovincial trade barriers so people have access to a larger market. Let&#039;s say you&#039;re a brewer in the Maritimes. Under Bernier&#039;s proposed legislation, you&#039;d be able to sell to Ontario, Alberta, BC, etc without having to jump through a fuckton of hoops and lose a bunch of your potential profit to bureaucracy, thereby leading to massive growth (Which all the Maritime provinces could sorely use, DESU).","filename":"Maxime Red Pill","ext":".png","w":503,"h":648,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490561966901,"time":1490561966,"md5":"JjHd\/noXtPZTbfPVP9VX2g==","fsize":200069,"resto":118406220,"id":"+KNjEphc","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118414551,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:00:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118413399\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118413399<\/a><br>The CBC is shitting themselves.

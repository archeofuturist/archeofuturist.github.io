More tax you pay, the more you get back ona failing investment. If you lose 10k a year on your property investment and pay 50% in tax you get 5k back. So if you&#039;re a Boomer with some money stored up you can buy a property and rent it out by taking out a mortgage (with low interest rates) and reduce the loss on the investment by negative gearing it. This means that people are buying properties that they would otherwise be unable to afford, reducing the number of houses that are being sold and increasing the number being rented, further driving up the value of all the property in the region, locking more people out of buying a house. If there was no negative gearing these people could not afford this investments. The Government is literally giving people an option to buy an investment they cannot afford without welfare.<br><br>Every year the number of these investment properties grow, more of our tax money is being spent on weak investments and property prices rise. It&#039;s gotten to the point where buying a house is practically a guaranteed money maker. So you&#039;ve got these people who have had a chance to save up some wealth buying things they couldn&#039;t afford without also taking our tax dollars, to buy houses resulting in us (us being people under 40) being locked out.<br><br>I don&#039;t think that poor investments should be saved with tax dollars, but using them to perpetuate a vicious cycle is even worse.

It also brings in a lot of open minded people into the racial question. For instance on Gavin McInnes show he had Jared Taylor on multiple times. This allowed his viewership of open minded individuals to see Jared Taylor discuss white racial identity. This applies to all the other ones I would make exceptions for PJW or Alex Jones BUT at least it will lead them to start thinking critically about the media. Everything links each other to add stepping stones. A good example of this is when Jared Taylor was on The reality calls show which also had Blaire White on (I believe). People who liked Blaire White had an opportunity to view that youtube channel with Jared Taylors conversion on it. <br>Its about red pilling people not really having \/ourguy\/ more like people who think like us that aren&#039;t really 100% aligned with everything.<br><br><br>As for the ultra-shareblue or reddit or whom ever lets discuss the Israel issue. Now Israel by itself right now is perfectly fine as a state. They can exist as much as any other racial nation can. However if they start trying to fuck with white nations they need to be put into there place and as we know they fucking don&#039;t. By itself Israel does not matter anymore then say Iran. I think a lot of you don&#039;t really understand what ZOG means. It means ZIONIST OCCUPIED GOVERNMENT. If Israel is occupying and influencing the US then they should be shit on but zionism itself isn&#039;t a big deal. Zionism is white nationalism for JEWS. When ramzpaul says that he likes zionists he is saying that jews should be able to have self-determination. He is not saying that Israel should control the US. If you hate zionists (in israel) then you are no better then leftist who also hate nationalists.","time":1491713775,"resto":120226256,"id":"UtwDapXQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120240467,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)00:56:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120231519\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120231519<\/a><br>natives are chinks.

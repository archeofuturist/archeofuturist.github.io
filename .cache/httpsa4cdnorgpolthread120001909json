We had never seen a full scale syria invasion being this close in 2013. Please note that in 2013 Assad was the underdog vs the terrorists.<br><br>Some real journalists together with intelligence services of germany and other wester countries fought for the truth, providing compelling arguments and facts that the gas attack was instead done by &quot;moderate rebels&quot;. Of course with the motivation of trying to argue for a full scale invasion.<br><br>When this^^ information got more coverage all of a sudden the propaganda from west leaders deminished and there was a deal made with west and Syria, which was to ship all chemical weapons to norway which was done.<br><br>Now it is 2017, another gas attack has happened in Syria. Assad has never been closer as of this point to slay all these terrorists.<br><br>With this being said, what are your thoughts bc our new spiritual leader did something stupid yesterday.","filename":"b3f162bf711f13637e733f27f5acfeda200e3d06954e2b45b3d14ae79da913dd","ext":".jpg","w":398,"h":344,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":216,"tim":1491591046194,"time":1491591046,"md5":"2QuQU2nkN8G5XtbMPD+YHA==","fsize":31811,"resto":0,"id":"6Th1n8Ke","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"in-2013-there-was-a-chem-gas-attack-in-syria-with","country_name":"Sweden","replies":8,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":120003139,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)14:58:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Think you&#039;re in the wrong timeline boy","time":1491591519,"resto":120001909,"id":"V8QOAwKK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120003305,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)14:59:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"How long did it take to counter the narrative the first time round would you recon?","time":1491591582,"resto":120001909,"id":"AElepqGK","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120004161,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)15:04:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;We had never seen a full scale syria invasion being this close in 2013.<\/span><br>That was unlikely and not what was being pushed.

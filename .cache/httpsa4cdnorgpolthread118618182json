He was a good guy he left Mexico because of how oppressive the mafia down there is and came here legally. He spends his time helping uneducated poor kids get their GED and find Job and Training opportunities. When he told me who he was Voting for I told him how can she stick it to Fracking companies when they are one of her biggest sponsors. His face Cringed and he opened his mouth to Argue but he knew that politics was something I am very interested and he asked me how i knew that. and i began to explain to him what Crony Capitalism was and he walked off with a different point of view. Most you guys think Dumb Niggers and spics voted for her but in reality not everybody lurks the internet like you. Raul didn&#039;t even have a facebook. All he knew was the media. and when he learned the Truth he changed his mind.","time":1490684041,"resto":118618182,"id":"X9+n5pPy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118623001,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)02:57:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"Once again the elitist pigs peek out of their ivory towers, perched high atop their modern plantations filled with wage slaves; <br><br>mouths stuffed with foods they never grew, hands full of goods they never produced;<br><br>the useless emperors of rotting empires, peopled with merceneries bought from afar, their schools and neighborhoods peopled with illegal criminals and thugs;<br><br>you are angry because you do not rule me. <br><br>What you cannot buy, you hate; what you cannot understand, you mock; what you cannot own, you destroy.<br><br>You cannot rule me.

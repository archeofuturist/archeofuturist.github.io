Blacks owning other blacks surely upsets the mainstream narrative of whites oppressing everyone, but this really destroys the narrative when you look a little deeper.<br>Slaves were not cheap. As a matter of fact a healthy young African male slave cost the equivalent of a decent car today. They were something only the very financially secure could afford unless they were buying crippled, elderly, or otherwise lack luster laborers. What this tells us is that there were a fair number of well to do blacks in the US prior to the Civil War. The notion of wealthy independent black citizens really dissolves the concocted media image of what the nation was like.","time":1490123518,"resto":117655918,"id":"5grWIOiR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117658011,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)15:13:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"AREN&#039;T","time":1490123587,"resto":117655918,"id":"LTTSs5Qd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117658084,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)15:13:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"PEOPLE","time":1490123630,"resto":117655918,"id":"LTTSs5Qd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

These are irrelevant questions.<br><br>The group did well because they were the smartest, highest achieving students. Everything else is secondary. It doesn&#039;t matter if they voted to select to a leader of if they used some other means to delegate work. These are just tools, a means to an end.<br><br>Likewise, economics is a tool. Authoritarianism is a tool.

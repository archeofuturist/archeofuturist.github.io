Here it fucking goes. <br>The Quran today is not in chronological order, but its all mixed up. When put in chronological order, its in two parts, the Meccan parts (when he was in Mecca), and the Medinan parts (when he was in Medina).<br><br><br>Now in the Meccan parts, he was still a fledgling religious group, a newcomer with no real power or influence, so he had to be peaceful. You get verses like, &quot;You to your religion, me to mine&quot;, that sort of thing. He starts gaining influence, political support, military might and <br><br>in the Medinan parts he is now the leader of a powerful religion and army (He united many arabs, who had historically fought amongst themselves). So in the Medinan parts, then he starts to reveal the more dictatorial, harsh parts, like &quot;Whoever doesn&#039;t follow Islam will be a loser in Hell forevermore&quot;.","time":1491918993,"resto":120598277,"id":"hBWIfaBd","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":120600491,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)09:57:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120598277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120598277<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I will complain to god about that person<\/span><br>SO someone besmirches islam you behead them, but if they act cruel to non muslim you just whine to your imaginary friend?","time":1491919074,"resto":120598277,"id":"QbfMKHGQ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120600597,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)09:58:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120598277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120598277<\/a><br>Any religion is a business in controlling people.","time":1491919130,"resto":120598277,"id":"HHa8H0Sl","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120601155,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)10:04:19","name":"BixNoodenStammer","com":"Wow.

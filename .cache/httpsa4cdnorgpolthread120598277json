Legalism and morality have become totally divorced in Islam. <br><br>Three of Muhammad&#039;s four immediate successors were assassinated, two of those by fellow Muslims for supposedly not being &quot;Muslim enough&quot;. Islam was only saved from total disintegration when the secular Umayyad aristocracy took control and ousted the religious fanatics for a century.

The heat is real. It&#039;s not a nice balmy beachy holiday heat but an angry and oppressive heat. Have you ever felt a 40 degree day? You know when you open the oven and get blasted in the face? It literally feels like that... all the time. The humidity is insane... the second you step outside you are covered in a sheen of sweat from head to toe. You constantly feel like you just stepped out of a pool. There are a fuckload of Asians and brownskins. The abos are fucked and I shit you not you can smell them from 50 yards away and they reek of hot garbage. The Australian accent is annoying. at first you&#039;re like okay I guess that&#039;s kinda cool\/interesting\/whatever but after a week you will want to rip out the throat of everyone who speaks to you. It&#039;s like this weird, whiny, nails on a chalkboard kind of sound. Also Australians are just really annoying and obnoxious people. There is a reason their shitposting skills are legendary. Imagine talking to someone and literally everything that comes out of their mouth is an IRL shitpost. Imagine being surrounded by ~20 million of them.<br><br>No. <br><br>Go to NZ instead.","filename":"dunedin","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":800,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491309871201,"time":1491309871,"md5":"IYaaVKvW6REWvuWPjsNDBw==","fsize":1095651,"resto":119457006,"id":"N9fMQTVA","country":"NZ","m_img":1,"country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":119465673,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)08:46:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119465499\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119465499<\/a><br>Also don&#039;t be fooled. ~95% of Australian men are cucked numales and 99% of Australian women are militant feminists who suck about 12 dicks a week because &quot;muh sexuality&quot;<br><br>The days of the rugged Crocodile Dundee-esque man of the outback is a thing of the past.

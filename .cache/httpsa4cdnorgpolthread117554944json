Something that often confuses me is that even with the industralization, computers and machines we still have to be wage slave and work most of hour time to be able to keep up. Personally, I would be more productive in a 30h week as I have enough time to recover. <br><br>Why do we have to do lots of overwork? Because our boss knows that he has nothing to lose and can only win from this situation. The law doesn&#039;t give enough protection and doesn&#039;t care if your kids and wife are waiting at home. <br><br>How can Europeans get more kids if both parents have to work all day to earn enough money and even then it&#039;s often not enough. Back then the father went to work for 40h per week and could feed the WHOLE family.","filename":"Fotolia_51293292_XS-300x199","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":199,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1490054502227,"time":1490054502,"md5":"\/QivGdLWaprw4zEGBAHItA==","fsize":16724,"resto":0,"id":"1JvTq289","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-there-any-pill-to-swollow-regarding-work","country_name":"Germany","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Perhaps you only get out of social interaction what you put in.","time":1493200419,"resto":122862654,"id":"z89Jyufy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122867009,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:55:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122865198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122865198<\/a><br><br>Thats called the fluoride stare my brother","time":1493200535,"resto":122862654,"id":"08S5hASI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122867015,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:55:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122866842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122866842<\/a><br><br>Brain damage?<br><br>Not quite.<br><br>https:\/\/www.google.com\/patents\/US65<wbr>06148","time":1493200543,"resto":122862654,"id":"X88uLrwV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122867076,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:56:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122866842\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122866842<\/a><br>wifi is part of the control structure, and phones always have that shit on full blast. 4g or 5g or w\/e they have now probably is direct mind control. remember how there was all this fear about wireless causing cancer in the 90s? that got buried super hard and they just made the mobile phones more appealing, now they are computing devices, not just receivers and transmitters, but they augment how you think and monitor it carefully.<br><br>i would say majority of us dont have or use mobile phones very sparingly, because we are oddball neet people who slipped through the cracks. we aren&#039;t even 1% of the population so it barely matters, no amount of noise we make can bring people back, look at Trump- total neo-con bombing countries, supporting zionists, and putting billionaires in his cabinet, hes obama 2.0.<br><br>try explaining that to a trump supporter, they are as blind to it as obama supporters were. think about the term: trump supporter, obama supporter. wtf are you supporting? is he the captain of your team? what happened to having accountability and not giving politicians a pass.","time":1493200613,"resto":122862654,"id":"qHHVi134","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122867122,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:57:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122866809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122866809<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;lizard people<\/span><br>wat.jpg","time":1493200668,"resto":122862654,"id":"uDoMNQss","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122867126,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:57:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122866918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122866918<\/a><br>I was a big time normie for years with a huge circle of friends.

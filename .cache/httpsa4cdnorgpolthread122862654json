Normies repeat themselves a lot more and use a way smaller vocabulary than they did 10 or even 5 years ago. When I run into the same person days later, the same conversation we had earlier gets repeated almost word for word. It really feels like talking to NPCs in a video game. The effect is especially pronounced with women and younger people.<br><br> Whenever I try and bring this odd feeling of deja vu up with anybody I see this vacant, blank stare of horror in their eyes every time. Like they know they&#039;re trapped in a sim but can&#039;t admit it. The only conversations I have that seem real are online now, or with a couple of my closest friends and relatives.

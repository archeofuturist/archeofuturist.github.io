A final vote, expected to come Wednesday, sends it to the state House.<br><br>Texas&#039; Republican-controlled Legislature only meets every two years, meaning state lawmakers weren&#039;t able to respond to the high court&#039;s June 2015 gay marriage decision until now.

Brian Birdwell, a Republican from Granbury about 40 miles southwest of Fort Worth.

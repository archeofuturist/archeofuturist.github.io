I honestly had to just now look that up Bc I had no clue what it meant. It&#039;s bizarre that they have a name for this as I have never referred to this thought process in that manner. With that said, I was trained to think in an analytical and logical manner that begins first and foremost with the end result and them move through time and space in reverse.<br>The key and most difficult aspect to this thinking is changing your concept of time and space from a linear structure to what I can only describe as a - holistic, circular, multilayered structure.<br>For example, 99% of us see the universe likes it&#039;s a vinyl record with our realty being the needle and time as the movement the needle makes going across the surface of the record. So our lives begin when needle hits the beginning of the record and end when needle comes off the and music we hear is our memories.<br>The &quot;4D&quot; concept of space and time -for lack of better phrase - does not see 1 record but instead sees -say- . 1000 records stacked on top of each other and all spinning with more records be added on top infinitely. Further, the needle does not simply go in one direction across the record for a linear start to a linear finish but instead the needle can go in any direction - left, right, up and down through the record stack in any manner. This means that the music can be played anywhere at any time without end. Thus, every sound on every record can be connected at any one time with every other sound on every other record.<br>So to get to an end result is to jump forward in time to the result and begin moving backwards to see what connects need to be made to other events or actions until you get to the original starting point. Obviously we can&#039;t control what another person may or may not do but when understand the overall series of events and knowing in general terms what you expect a person to do in reaction to an event will certainly bring a higher probability that anticipated reactions will occur.","time":1490454637,"resto":118229808,"id":"tRzUAObT","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118233342,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)11:10:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118233179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118233179<\/a><br>Those still on?","time":1490454642,"resto":118229808,"id":"fTDEqmLM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118233346,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)11:10:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118233194\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118233194<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;defending the Freedom Cuckus, who stab Trump in the back at every turn<\/span>","time":1490454646,"resto":118229808,"id":"R9qkXGjo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118233349,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)11:10:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118231987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118231987<\/a><br>It&#039;s not like you have any real arguments or anything interesting to say.","time":1490454647,"resto":118229808,"id":"IAOk+AAG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118233372,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)11:11:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118232885\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118232885<\/a><br><br>This would self correct if they were not interfered with.

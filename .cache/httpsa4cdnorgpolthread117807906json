Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved.","time":1490210424,"resto":117807906,"id":"I1w4NsLp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117809636,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)15:20:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117809572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117809572<\/a><br>This... he banged everything.","time":1490210444,"resto":117807906,"id":"h1D6M7eC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117809760,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)15:21:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117809501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117809501<\/a><br>What music do you like? <br>Death Grips maybe?","time":1490210496,"resto":117807906,"id":"DVN34Cl8","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":117809766,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)15:21:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117807906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117807906<\/a><br>Slide thread to protect Brock:<br><br>See:<br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/117807298#p117807298\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117807298<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/117808804#p117808804\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117808804<\/a>","time":1490210498,"resto":117807906,"id":"G0RyNHLK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117809778,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)15:21:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"he&#039;s a literal who","time":1490210505,"resto":117807906,"id":"Hu3zjPnx","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117809877,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)15:22:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117809598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117809598<\/a><br>this. led zeppelin is objectively the best rock band of all time anyway","time":1490210543,"resto":117807906,"id":"zTX45zO4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117810002,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)15:23:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117807906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117807906<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Faggot<\/span><br>Mental ilnesses are pretty correlated to highly creative people<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Indian<\/span><br>Ethnically Persian, kinda.

But seriously, kids on a board as edgy and smart and hard-minded as \/pol\/ expressing admiration for QUEEN?<br>I&#039;m British and have been knocking around mainland Europe for twenty-five years and I have to admit I&#039;ve known a few Austrians and Belgians and so on who have claimed to like Queen. Apparently, May and the others were skilled musicians. But no continental European country has ever had any sense of what rock n roll is actually about and I can assure you that, in the time when they were active, listening to Queen would have put any British kid in the same sub-pleb tier as would, say, listening to the Boomtown Rats.<br>They turned out some more than averagely sophisticated Glam Rock in the early 70s - which only meant that they&#039;d missed the point because all the Glam Rock that was any good was unsophisticated to the point of infantility - but from Bohemian Rhapsody on everything they did was pure camp. <br><br>It was actually quite frightening to observe how the grotesque vocal affectations and guitar-hero posturing of a song like Rhapsody turned out to have a powerful appeal both to mincing queers AND, inexplicably, to the sort of ruddy-faced, man-boobed football hooligans who spent their time kicking in the heads of flagrant batty-men like Mercury in alleyways when they weren&#039;t slavishly singing along to the choruses of their crappy &quot;rock anthems&quot; in stadiums they&#039;d paid a month&#039;s wages to get into.<br>The punk generation looked on Queen with an even more withering contempt than they did on the full-on prog-rock dinosaur bands. And with good reason. They were fucking atrocious.","time":1490213841,"resto":117807906,"id":"J5E2+Am2","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":117818381,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)16:17:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117817719\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117817719<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He&#039;s never seen that copypasta before<\/span>","time":1490213850,"resto":117807906,"id":"I1w4NsLp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117818494,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)16:18:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117816093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117816093<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dio can&#039;t sing<\/span><br>nigga dio&#039;s cover of dream on is insane<br><br><a href=\"#p117812568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117812568<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;rob halford<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shit<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Xbi<wbr>Ss-wv5lI<br>(you)","time":1490213904,"resto":117807906,"id":"Yw30qxmq","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":117818572,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)16:18:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117817420\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117817420<\/a><br>Oh man, GG are one of those bands where they&#039;re good enough that you don&#039;t even notice they&#039;re jewish. <br><br>Unfortunately another one of my favorite bands isthe whole<br><br><a href=\"#p117817700\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117817700<\/a><br>No, just pointing out that Queen is shit and you likely are too if you like them past the age of 15. <br><br><a href=\"#p117817803\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117817803<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They were one few bands that managed to stay out of any particular genre<\/span><br>Pop rock, arena rock, prog rock, hard rock, did I miss anything? <br><br>Don&#039;t make me laugh, Queen are the last band I&#039;d call difficult to categorize. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;defined middle ground between pop and rock<\/span><br>What a fucking accomplishment, thanks for doing the same fucking thing that everyone else before you did. <br><br><a href=\"#p117817904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117817904<\/a><br>Shredding doesn&#039;t equate competent music, but King Crimson got the bridge between technicality and quality right. <br><br><a href=\"#p117818073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117818073<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;solo artists<\/span><br>I was really referring to the Mothers of Invention considering that Zappa wasn&#039;t even a solo artist in the 60s but most people are more familiar with that name so I used it instead. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they were in a shitty genre so it&#039;s ok for them to be shit<\/span><br>Excellent reasoning. <br><br><a href=\"#p117818337\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117818337<\/a><br>He may be a pretentious muh technicality faggot but he isn&#039;t wrong.

Since apparently it&#039;s normal for people I barely know to spout off any baby advice they think I want, I&#039;ve been told here or there to not let doctors &quot;pump my son full of vaccines.&quot; <br><br>Is this just anti-science bullshit or is there something outside of the hyper-inflated fear perpetuated by America&#039;s natural outrage culture? Any and all help is appreciated, \/pol\/. Help me protect my son.<br><br>Here&#039;s some other general questions open for discussion:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;My wife smoked weed, took adderall, and took over 700mg of caffeine every day during the first month of pregnancy because she didn&#039;t know she was pregnant. The doctor&#039;s say the baby is fine, but do I need to be worried?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;My wife took a little less than an eighth of shrooms during the first month. Will my son have superpowers?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I have a nicotine addiction and smoked\/vaped constantly during the time-frame surrounding the date of conception. Will my son be a nicotine-fiend because of this, or will he be retarded? <\/span><br><br>I had been thinking about asking my girlfriend to marry me, but I didn&#039;t plan on having kids until another couple of years. She and I have been thrown into this situation after her birth control failed, and we weren&#039;t afforded the time to plan out a healthy pregnancy. I&#039;m just trying to do my best, but I can&#039;t help but worry about my son&#039;s future.

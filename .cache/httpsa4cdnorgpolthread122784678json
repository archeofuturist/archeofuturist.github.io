I think it&#039;s clear that audiences are increasingly dissatisfied with the influence of commercialism and progressive politics on art, so there&#039;s definitely a lot of room for reactionaries to work.<br><br>I&#039;ll post a few examples of this vein of art that I think \/pol\/ might like later in this thread.","filename":"hqdefault","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493153180371,"time":1493153180,"md5":"0rykBIzOZE+pn6u82XgvCw==","fsize":8787,"resto":0,"id":"9lTJOLiu","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-art-thread","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":3,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122785343,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)16:51:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"Spring Breakers (2013)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; directed by Harmony Korine<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; stars James Franco and a bunch of disney starlets<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; score done by Skrillex (actually pretty good)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; film about a bunch of degenerate college students going to spring break who decide to start robbing and murdering people<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; basically the entire film is the director pointing out that modern degenerates are disgusting people and that commercial party culture encourages self-destructive and violent behavior<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; aesthetic as fuck<\/span>","filename":"spring-breakers-2012-720p-bluray-dd5-1-x264-ebp-mkv_003900271","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":534,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":52,"tim":1493153468349,"time":1493153468,"md5":"ZDHY7bM5Lg323HotFzJtaA==","fsize":413049,"resto":122784678,"id":"9lTJOLiu","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122785543,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)16:52:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122784678\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122784678<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;world peace will never have a season 2<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw goyimswim won<\/span>","filename":"1430453422386","ext":".png","w":633,"h":758,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493153561211,"time":1493153561,"md5":"vEQwyigsTov8CuEwMe6eog==","fsize":30666,"resto":122784678,"id":"i8K2R+Hr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122785845,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)16:55:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Magic Mike (2012)<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; directed by Steven Soderberg<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; supposedly about a bunch of male strippers in Tampa<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; actually about how the recession\/gig economy emasculates young men for the purpose of economically exploiting them<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; routines are more funny than erotic<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; protag is a skilled dancer who really wants to work in a trade (carpentry) and later realizes that degeneracy (polyamory, sex work, etc.) is ruining his life<\/span>","filename":"Magic Mike hoodie","ext":".png","w":845,"h":356,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":52,"tim":1493153707254,"time":1493153707,"md5":"vO6m\/zjHMxX1FDr1MhN70g==","fsize":592136,"resto":122784678,"id":"9lTJOLiu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122786066,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)16:56:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122785543\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122785543<\/a><br><br>It&#039;s incredibly sad - the show struck me as a more politically-minded Wonder Shozen.

The removal of the Lincoln Monument should happen too. I&#039;m pretty sure he had a few illegitimate children and owned slaves at one point and I find that racist and misogynist against women&#039;s liberation from the non-conforming cisgender white male patriarchy. The statue of liberty needs to go too. A woman alone in the water forced to hold up a light so that people see what she is saying is the patriarchy telling all WOMEN that the cisgender white man can sit in his chair and tend to his colored slaves working in the fields while his enslaved white wife is forced to be outside and be a symbol that people lust dirty thoughts after. Items from a period that isn&#039;t now are not historical items. Things from a different moment are not things which are not now. It&#039;s racist to suggest that historical relics stay intact. I mean, things from a past time period are not pieces of history so like destroying them is okay with me.","filename":"1324798015678","ext":".jpg","w":1528,"h":854,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1493164223185,"time":1493164223,"md5":"qxrKgPOr1L8LQXfG6PayyA==","fsize":16249,"resto":122798106,"id":"C0jcDO93","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":122809195,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)19:51:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122808576\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122808576<\/a><br>Yes, das juden blah blah.

A woman alone in the water forced to hold up a light so that people see what she is saying is the patriarchy telling all WOMEN that the cisgender white man can sit in his chair and tend to his colored slaves working in the fields while his enslaved white wife is forced to be outside and be a symbol that people lust dirty thoughts after. Items from a period that isn&#039;t now are not historical items. Things from a different moment are not things which are not now. It&#039;s racist to suggest that historical relics stay intact.

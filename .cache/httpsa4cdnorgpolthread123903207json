That blasphemous name for God that is mentioned in the Bible as the name of the beast, or the number of his name, is Allah. We know this because when John had the vision of Revelations, the Arabic language did not exist yet. However, the Greek language was prevalent at the time. So when he saw the greek symbols for 666, he saw the name of allah. He just couldnt interpret it.<br><br>Now this picture is a little exaggerated, but the original greek translation said the number of the beast was 666 or 616. It was lost in translation.

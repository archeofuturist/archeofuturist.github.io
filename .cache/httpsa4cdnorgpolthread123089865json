I KNOW it was just to prove he has balls, but I don&#039;t see the need.

If we didn&#039;t continuously let 3rd Worlders into our midst, I dare say there would be hardly any threats to our societies at all. Certainly less so, than are currently being generated every time we get involved in the Middle East.","filename":"1492729545853m","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":646,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":78,"tim":1493329334067,"time":1493329334,"md5":"5Dx\/cTKKYe3YZ7s5o9ph3g==","fsize":146631,"resto":123089865,"id":"5widoxJp","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

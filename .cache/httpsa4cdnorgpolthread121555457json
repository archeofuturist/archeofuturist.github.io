An advisor? Should you follow everything he says?<\/span><br><br>The title &quot;vicar of Christ&quot; puts it best. Christ is the head of the Church as St. Paul says to us, but while he is in Heaven, the Church still needs some visible leader to prevent heresies and schisms from spreading within. For that Lord appointed St. Peter and, by apostolic succession, his successors. The pope, has the ability to change and set the canon law along with other parts of the discipline, which refers to parts of the religion that are supposed to (technically a wrong decision may happen here, and indeed there is at least one case of this happening I remember) put the beliefs into practice - liturgy, Church government, excommunications, etc. More interesting is his role in development of the doctrine. Most of it has been developed during councils, which need pope&#039;s approval to be binding. However, the pope can issue declarations which are infallible - there were ten or so so far in the history of the Church. When doing these, he must speaking &quot;ex cathedra&quot; - i.e. in his Petrine authority - definitively proclaim something as true and binding for the whole Church. In addition, his other formal documents are to be adhered to, although he isn&#039;t infallible here and an error can happen. If there is a sure error in such a formal document, one doesn&#039;t need to, indeed in some kinds of error (like when the document proclaims as good something sinful), mustn&#039;t, listen to it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What if he says something that&#039;s contrary to the book? <\/span><br><br>Not formally? Not to listen. Formally, but when the conditions for infallibility aren&#039;t employed? Make sure that it&#039;s really contrary to the Bible. If it is, not listen.

What is known is that the unbaptised go to Hell, that until baptism they are stained with original sin, that the damned suffer unequal punishments and that God is perfectly just. Suppose that an unbaptised dies without any personal sin and enters Hell. Now, there is nothing worthy of punishment in them - so he isn&#039;t punished for sins. And yet his state doesn&#039;t allow him to enter Heaven. Such a state would be called limbo, which comes from Latin &quot;limbus&quot; - edge, border (of Hell). Resistance to this idea comes from the fact that God isn&#039;t bound to the sacrament and can work His graces even outside of them. The idea is that the children who die unbaptised are technically baptised - by some method God employs quickly before their death. Such a person would now, free of original sin, enter Heaven.

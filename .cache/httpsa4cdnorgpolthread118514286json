Theres no real way of redeeming this. <br><br>And the fact that ALL the south has is our shitty meme revolution which failed and was for a horrid cause anyway that lasted not even 5 years in a country that wasnt even recognized by anyone else is an albatross around our necks. Like We Wuzian niggers, instead of looking for ways to actually fix ourselves by looking forward, we only look back and make shit up about the past about how &quot;LOL ONCE WE WERE GREAT&quot; The South will never rise again because the south is full of illiterate dumb assholes who cling to the CSA like a shit covered and tattered comfort blanket instead of forging some path to the future of greatness. And worst of all, many southerners are outright proud of their ignorance and wear it as some sort of badge of honor. But of course no one will listen to this and just have a get angry at someone telling them a hard to swallow truth in favor of wallowing around in a shit pit of self pity. <br><br>t.

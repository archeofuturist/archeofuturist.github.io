Because of political correctness and Bernie being cheated of the nomination, the Democratic party is destroying itself. Because of this as well as other factors such as WikiLeaks and Snowden, people are waking up to the truth of the deep state, the globalists, and the military-industrial complex. The establishment is weakening.<br><br>Now is our chance to strike. We need to convince everyone that Republicans, Democrats, neocons, neolibs, Clinton, Bush, Trump, Obama, etc are all the same, by showing that they all support war in Syria, that they&#039;re all interventionist warmongers, that they all serve the same masters.<br><br>The reason is to turn everyone against both parties. The people in power keep people fighting each other in the two-party dichotomy, Republicans versus Democrats. This prevents people from fighting the real enemy. It keeps people complacent.<br><br>We have the power to meme the collapse of the Republican party, Democratic party, similar parties in other nations, and ultimately the globalist-zionist state.<br><br>We have to choose who our enemies are and who our allies are. No more infighting. Our allies are all who stand against our enemies. Libertarians, national socialists, \/pol\/acks, redditors, activists, anarchists, Anonymous, WikiLeaks, freedom of information activists, even some social justice activists. Everyone who wants to see the fall of the globalist state. We all must stand together and bring down our enemy. Unity is our greatest strength. Our unity will lead to the collapse of the globalist power structure.<br><br>Operation: Collapse initiated.","filename":"1491620793119","ext":".png","w":800,"h":510,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":159,"tim":1491674776484,"time":1491674776,"md5":"\/EHebVDySjZrk\/Kby2UWjw==","fsize":749545,"resto":0,"id":"+mXMD1Xh","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"operation-collapse-kushner-edition","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":120161304,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)14:08:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"Kushner is the red flag.

The issue is, is that humans are going to have more and more issues living on the planet. Acidification of the ocean, sea-level rise, droughts, changes in migration patterns, etc, will impact billions of people, usually the poorest. The unrest that will rise from these groups of people will eventually lead to extreme ideologies and governments.<br><br>I mean, once India or China start to really hurt, and begin to demand you let in their people, or else, what are you going to say?<br><br><a href=\"#p118608788\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118608788<\/a><br>Actually, that figure proves me correct.

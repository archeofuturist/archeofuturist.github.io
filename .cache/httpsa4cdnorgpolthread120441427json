And autists who try to get a girlfriend aren&#039;t very likely to succeed. This might then be the 7 times greater punishment.

It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, Harut and Marut. But the two angels do not teach anyone unless they say, &quot;We are a trial, so do not disbelieve [by practicing magic].&quot; And [yet] they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife. But they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of Allah . And the people learn what harms them and does not benefit them. But the Children of Israel certainly knew that whoever purchased the magic would not have in the Hereafter any share.

It&#039;s only a &quot;mix&quot; in its lexicon. To be more nuanced, the origin of much of the English lexicon is mixed. The phonological form of English lexical items is profoundly Germanic (note that this term doesn&#039;t mean &quot;descended from German,&quot; it means &quot;shares a common ancestor with Frisian, German, Danish, etc.&quot;). The prosody of English is Germanic. The syntax of English is Germanic. The morphology of English is Germanic. It&#039;s typologically Germanic. It&#039;s genetically Germanic. Stop thinking it&#039;s a &quot;mix&quot; of Germanic and Romance. That&#039;s not how languages work.<br><br>And the comment is irritating as well, the idea that Black English is &quot;incorrect&quot; and that a person who speaks Black English is uneducated. There&#039;s nothing &quot;incorrect&quot; about it- it has its own phonology, morphosyntax, etc.","time":1491342509,"resto":119515034,"id":"zq+ainuC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119521717,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:50:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119520940\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119520940<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;canadian niggers <\/span><br>lol<br><br>glad canada doesnt have many spanish rape babies","time":1491342600,"resto":119515034,"id":"m75qGoPh","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119521860,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:51:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"OUI","filename":"Alexandre_Dumas_(1762-1806)","ext":".jpg","w":1620,"h":1244,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1491342667570,"time":1491342667,"md5":"GWqFIJqgbXmYM1\/rU57J0g==","fsize":750119,"resto":119515034,"id":"9+Xv2oom","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119521868,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:51:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119519701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119519701<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A race who never invented the wheel in their culture<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A race that didn&#039;t have a written language thus no recorded history of &quot;muh dick&quot; conquests<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;A race that had never even gone south to colonize their own country<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Invented English <\/span><br>Sound right","time":1491342677,"resto":119515034,"id":"qawKi\/B0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119522107,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:53:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119521510\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119521510<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119521717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119521717<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119521860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119521860<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119521868\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119521868<\/a><br>shit nigga wite pepplz dun even xizt since the great space war part 27 my nigga hey yo where dem bitches at yo","filename":"google-glass-locate-watermelon-and-fried-chicken-p-s-im-not-racist_o_1506727","ext":".jpg","w":950,"h":546,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1491342790600,"time":1491342790,"md5":"cQIwqklkagCz0dGMbxxxEQ==","fsize":60001,"resto":119515034,"id":"OMb3qiCl","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119522360,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:55:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119515213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119515213<\/a><br>It&#039;s actually a jew","time":1491342906,"resto":119515034,"id":"1Vm6+LWy","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119522428,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:55:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119519701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119519701<\/a><br>Only a fucking leaf would believe in the out of Africa hoax.","time":1491342940,"resto":119515034,"id":"XO\/SEhte","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":119522497,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:56:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119519701\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119519701<\/a><br>There is no evidence that real white people came out of Africa much less share an ancestor with nigglys.

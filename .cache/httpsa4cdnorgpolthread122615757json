parents. Tito was an incompetent nobody. But since this part of Europe was a total shithole pre WWII even the slight improvements are hailed as some godlike accomplishment, when in fact they should have been way more significant. <br>Just look at the stats. <br>Japan had the same GDP per capita in 1947 as Yugoslavia. Japan had no industry pre WW2 and got totally destroyed in WW2. <br>In 1980 when Tito died Yugoslavia had a GDP of 6000$ and Japan had almost 14000$. That&#039;s more than twice.<br>Germany too had a GDP of 14000$ in 1980, despite the fact that all of their industry got wiped out and they had to pay reparations to Yugoslavia. How embarrassing is that?<br>And then lets look at the really embarassing stats. Bulgaria, which was a total shithole at the time, far worse than any other communist country, is ahead of TIto&#039;s Yugoslavia.<br>How is that possible?<br>Wasn&#039;t Tito supposed to be a genius?<br>Wasn&#039;t he supposed to give the money to the people?<br>Where did the money go? I bet you it did not go to the people. <br>But of course you won&#039;t find these stats in leftist Serbian, Croatian or Muslim papers. Admitting that Yugoslavia was a shithole would raise the question about the money and would reveal that it went straight into the pockets of the members of the communist party. <br>So have fun worshipping a guy, who was very likely mentally retarded, since you need a special kind of stupid to be this bad at economics.","filename":"YU Trade Deficit","ext":".png","w":498,"h":639,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493066618844,"time":1493066618,"md5":"D62lvLjjAKGKOT8rohAXhw==","fsize":30327,"resto":122615757,"id":"UVMC8bp+","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":122635125,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:44:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122634827\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122634827<\/a><br><br>Still not slavs.","time":1493066688,"resto":122615757,"id":"+78oLMSW","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":122635190,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:45:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122634679\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122634679<\/a><br>Someone was posting some gene maps recently where it showed we were genetically closer to hungarians than serbs kek","time":1493066717,"resto":122615757,"id":"KFiIXXo3","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":122635509,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:48:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122617809\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122617809<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;trusting balkniggers with democracy<\/span><br><br>there would be another race war in 10 years flat","filename":"1485042941971","ext":".png","w":616,"h":606,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":122,"tim":1493066898926,"time":1493066898,"md5":"YdxOdzL9TVw9Rh9izaY+CQ==","fsize":14063,"resto":122615757,"id":"rPpxj\/92","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122635534,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:48:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122635190\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122635190<\/a><br><br>Please do not refute the other guy who was about genes.

Any basic knowledge of the earth&#039;s history would tell you this. Earth&#039;s native climate is not what we have enjoyed during our short romp on the planet. Humans are certainly speeding up the process, but realistically we have to be honest and remember that we only exist thanks to a massive asteroid paving the way for us. The earth will eventually return to that climate unless we terra-form the shit out of it over the long term.","time":1493561655,"resto":123480172,"id":"Dudv9Dtq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123481741,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)10:18:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123481287\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123481287<\/a><br>despite what most liberals believe,I&#039;d like to add that environmental conservation is a big thing for republicans too.

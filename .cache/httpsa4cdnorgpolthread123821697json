If everything is too fluid like SJW&#039;s, Feminist, Muslim apologists and the like , continue making up rules and create chaos and anarchy out of nothing, then it would be a bunch of people doing a lot of shit just because they feel like it. There would be no real reason for doing it and no one would be enlightened by it.<br><br>Mythical gods of &quot;chaos&quot; have either done it for laughs, to test ones will and adversary, to see what could come of such horror or even get people to improve their situation. I don&#039;t believe any god would support a political system that have no meaning other than random and selfish chaos.

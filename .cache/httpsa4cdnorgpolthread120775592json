An estimated 250 million vehicles worldwide are expected to contain connected features within the next five years, and automakers\u2014inundated with detailed information on drivers\u2019 whereabouts, in-car entertainment selections, and vehicle diagnostics\u2014are searching for ways to harvest and profit from that data stream. With that in mind, global supplier Delphi Automotive has announced a series of partnerships and investments intended to establish platforms that will help their OEM customers extract customer data and generate revenue from it. Delphi executives announced that their company has acquired minority stakes in two Israeli companies and established a strategic partnership with a third firm. The moves are all centered on improving vehicle connectivity and data analytics. Valens, a chipmaker, will help Delphi speed the transfer of data, moving it approximately six times faster than today\u2019s averages. Otonomo establishes a common platform and serves as a data broker between OEMs and third parties. Rosenberger, a German connectivity company, helps tie together systems that enable driver-assistance features, automated driving, and connected platforms.<br><br>Of the most recent announcements, the one with the broadest implications for automakers and motorists is Delphi\u2019s stake in Otonomo. The Israeli tech company is essentially creating a data marketplace. What makes the company\u2019s services attractive to automakers is the ability to aggregate data from multiple companies and provide a more comprehensive data set to interested parties. That reach is significant.<br><br>1\/2<br><br>-- <br><br>Why is this allowed?","filename":"HappyIsraelis","ext":".jpg","w":876,"h":535,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":152,"tim":1492015224117,"time":1492015224,"md5":"p8gafGzaiJyPIDvcmOyBng==","fsize":59493,"resto":0,"id":"fjCEcRAw","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"carmarkers-soon-to-profit-off-selling-your-data","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":120775710,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)12:41:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120775592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120775592<\/a><br>If a third-party service \u201cwants specific information on vehicle or consumer behavior, Otonomo could be customizing the query for that data,\u201d DeVos said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of flexibility and customization to tailor that data set to a third-party provider.\u201d What kind of third party?

The rebels are to a large extent radical jihadis, closely related to al quaeda and have commited all kinds of atrocities. Trying to blame them for things that can&#039;t be definetly proven just gives others a chance to defend them by pointing out weak links in the argument in favor of their guilt of a particular, somewhat questionable event.<br><br>After the latest chemical weapons boogaloo for example i was suprised to see a journalist (l\u00fcders) in a german TV talk show (lanz, 5th april) saying that it is highly likely that the rebels did this as a false flag. And while he was quite knowledgeable about the CW storys in syria and wrote a book about it he shot himself in the foot by saying that turkish journalists confirmed that MIT delivered sarin to rebels in 2013 to stage a false flag attack in east ghouta. The problem with that was that the turkish journalists in question deny that, they only ever talked about the delivery of conventional weapons by the turkish state towards al quaeda linked rebels in idlib. Now, you can imagine what the response to that was in the media that talked about this talkshow. They ignored all other evidence that indicates that the rebels might have been responsible for CW incidents in 2013 and just went for that single falsifiable statement.","time":1492384276,"resto":121410137,"id":"h+Zx\/FVL","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121435079,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:11:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121434929\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121434929<\/a><br>One of the main people involved with the twitter drama.","time":1492384298,"resto":121410137,"id":"vXL4hqgg","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121435087,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:11:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121434929\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121434929<\/a><br>its women looking for attention.","time":1492384299,"resto":121410137,"id":"KySJuCNZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121435128,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:12:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121434692\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121434692<\/a><br>Such is life for a leb","time":1492384321,"resto":121410137,"id":"EzMtvOER","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121435287,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:13:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121434916\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121434916<\/a><br>I know.<br>At first I as mad as fuck, I&#039;m just sad now.","time":1492384385,"resto":121410137,"id":"NnsTsBSV","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121435311,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:13:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121433960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121433960<\/a><br>that are two gambles, one is that they&#039;ll be able to take morek, the other is that the rebels would retreat through a small corridor.

But sensationalism and polarization and other things, I actually think, are probably even stronger and more prolific effects. And we have to work on all these things. I think we need to listen to all the feedback on this.\u201d<br><br>During the interview, Zuckerberg said Facebook\u2019s news feed helps users access more \u201cmeaningful\u201d content, but on the flip side he acknowledged the feed also results in negative consequences, like what happened during the run-up to the 2016 U.S. election. Facebook faced repeated criticism last year that it spread fake news and favored liberal content over more conservative postings. Some have gone as far as to say Facebook had an impact on the election in a way that hadn\u2019t been seen before.

Those actions, reported the Times, has resulted in Zuckerberg questioning his ideas about building a global community on the social network. &quot;Giving everyone a voice has historically been a very positive force for public discourse because it increases the diversity of ideas shared,&quot; Zuckerberg wrote in a manifesto earlier this year that was discussed during the Times interview. &quot;But the past year has also shown it may fragment our shared sense of reality.&quot;","filename":"zuck","ext":".jpg","w":1930,"h":1148,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":148,"tim":1493212954417,"time":1493212954,"md5":"D9uW1PhDL6s\/uJJ45mWp6A==","fsize":661843,"resto":0,"id":"fG4f7tHl","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mark-zuckerberg-we-have-to-get-to-the-core-of-the","country_name":"United States","replies":12,"images":3,"unique_ips":12},{"no":122882870,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)09:22:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122882853\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122882853<\/a>","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-26 at 9.17.58 AM","ext":".png","w":1192,"h":956,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1493212967116,"time":1493212967,"md5":"NYfr9sPiv\/kaybQdoogwiA==","fsize":109908,"resto":122882853,"id":"fG4f7tHl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122883310,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)09:27:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122882853\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122882853<\/a><br>we have to get to the (((core))) of it","time":1493213276,"resto":122882853,"id":"Ag65pKRl","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":122883996,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)09:36:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122882853\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122882853<\/a><br>Probably selling more user data for even less money to the core of the china communist party.<br><br>Remember when that guy tried to have the chinese party leader name his unborn child?<br><br>That Zuckerjew ist out-brown-nosing everyone, holy crap!","filename":"brown nose","ext":".png","w":667,"h":460,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":86,"tim":1493213800661,"time":1493213800,"md5":"RKYw9juxtt\/fhWAqeAKEuw==","fsize":205803,"resto":122882853,"id":"CuYtOeG6","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122884059,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)09:37:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Notice how Zuckerberg now has the sunken pedo eyes as well.","time":1493213851,"resto":122882853,"id":"6Kb0Vnst","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122884433,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)09:41:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122882870\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122882870<\/a><br>When I find out someone gets their news from Facebook, I immediately discard all their opinions and arguments.","time":1493214087,"resto":122882853,"id":"q1G3zvbs","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122886908,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:08:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122882853\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122882853<\/a><br>He has a steve buscemi look about him.","filename":"djbvj.sa","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":540,"tn_w":111,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493215736726,"time":1493215736,"md5":"mUZjqkhfES7\/+Hz\/ZGuGiw==","fsize":36072,"resto":122882853,"id":"\/PjbDSMJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122887053,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:10:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Half jew, half chink baby = Stewie Griffin<br><br>Zuck the cuck is not the enemy here.

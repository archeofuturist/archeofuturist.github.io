I&#039;m tall, actually moderately attractive, with a state job making ~145k a year in tech. I currently spend most of time free time reading, playing video games, working out, and cooking. Over the last 5 years or so I have slowly lost my desire for any kind of relationship with women. <br><br>I was not really a Chad, but I was one of the lucky few who was getting laid pretty steadily in high school, and on through college and my early adult life. I had my heart broken, and I broke some hearts. But the last 5 years I have really found the company of women in general to be less and less tolerable. Most of them want to talk about the same old boring shit. Whats on TV\/Movies\/Social Justice\/Whatever dumb hobby they&#039;re into. Given I live in a liberal infested shithole, it just seems like I can&#039;t find a single woman out there who brings any kind of excitement to the table anymore. Even the ones where politics is never brought up once. I don&#039;t drink often at all, not into the party scene. I despise degeneracy in general. I&#039;ve just gotten to the point where I&#039;m giving up hope on finding a decent companion, ya know? I can deal with it. Really, pussy is great and all, but it has seriously come to the point where I don&#039;t see it worth the effort of going through the motions of picking up women. Its like the same shit on repeat. Fuck it, I&#039;d rather just beat my meat in the shower every once in a while and call it even. <br><br>Given my growing apathy toward women in general, I&#039;ve come to question if this is strictly internal, or if the direction society is going is attributing to it. I didn&#039;t used to feel this way, but that was 5 years ago, before SJW, Cultural-marxism, and Socialism was mainstream. I see these &#039;anti-values&#039; reflected in the women I meet and it sickens me.<br><br>What does \/pol\/ think? Is society causing otherwise valuable males to drop out, and if so, how do we fix it, or am I just fucked in the head?","filename":"Going_alone","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":465,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492567023156,"time":1492567023,"md5":"rCRUXoxcriU8GLVGpF29OQ==","fsize":37872,"resto":0,"id":"9eSNTXku","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"am-i-the-problem-or-is-it-society","country_name":"United States","replies":210,"images":38,"unique_ips":107,"tail_size":50},{"no":121782610,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:59:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121782238\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121782238<\/a><br>You will find the strength to come out of the closet one day, don&#039;t worry","filename":"1492204911969","ext":".jpg","w":959,"h":777,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":101,"tim":1492567179416,"time":1492567179,"md5":"Eo86k+4+AruIF\/s0BVq8IA==","fsize":160471,"resto":121782238,"id":"KQqImkAI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121782692,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:00:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121782238\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121782238<\/a><br>I&#039;d try to get a waifu to have kids, then you can divorce. <br><br>It&#039;s fine if you want to live alone as long as you have white kids.

Their gender has evolved over hundreds of thousands of years to be more &quot;go with the flow.&quot; It&#039;s a survival mechanism.

Women who were pliant, demure, disloyal to their people, etc., were accepted by the conquering group. <br><br>Don&#039;t hate woman or hold it against them.

It&#039;s not just about &quot;muh sky fairy.&quot; Even if you don&#039;t believe the spiritual truths within, marriage, especially in the Christian sense, is a social contract between man and woman, on which civilization was based.

Both are peddled principally by Jews. We allowed them to tear down the edifices of our civilization without even considering what else would come tumbling down with them. <br><br>You need to quit fapping and porn. It&#039;s wiring your brain to associate arousal to screens, darkness, solitude, instead of to affection, togetherness, etc. Yes it will be hard (pun intended.)

Not to mention stalking deer during hunting season and stumbling on remains of old buildings and exploring the woods.","time":1490638529,"resto":118536992,"id":"fgc1PBoe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118540409,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)14:16:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118540007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118540007<\/a><br>Bucks County fag here.

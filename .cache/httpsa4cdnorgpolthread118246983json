It started about 1 month ago in \/b\/ with constant &quot;blacked.com&quot; threads and how black men are superior to every other race of men especially Asians and Whites. Then it stopped after \/b\/ started to post White man\/Black women threads daily. Then all the Trump threads started with &quot;Why do you still support this man?&quot; and &quot;Why are Trump supporters idiots&quot; and so on... Now yesterday started all the &quot;Why is \/b\/ so racist?&quot; and &quot;Why whiteys are so racist&quot;... At the moment there&#039;s 5 Anti-trump threads on \/b\/ and 2 Evil Whiteys threads. Also many threads in last couple weeks have been blaming \/pol\/ mods for banning them so i think they tried to shill those &quot;blacked.com&quot; threads here and got banned.<br><br>Also we don&#039;t know who is behind this raid. I&#039;ve been testing what kind of threads trigger them and so far they have responded most aggressively to Anti-Antifa threads so it could be them. Also it could always be Tumblr revenging previous raids. Couple weeks ago one of the posters who started &quot;blacked.com&quot; thread posted a timestamp of his hand and he was black so that again doesn&#039;t point to Antifa since they are mostly rich white liberals...<br><br>What can we do? How do we stop it? Do we have to colonize \/b\/? It could be possible since \/b\/ feels like it&#039;s neutered nowadays. They haven&#039;t raided anybody in last half year and \/pol\/ has had more traffic than them which may be the result of Brexit and Trump.<br><br>Also I thought that maybe those &quot;blacked.com&quot; and &quot;black supremacy&quot; threads could work for us if those would redpill newfags and normies who are just checking the site. Media has also been covering 4chan and especially \/pol\/ much more lately. That&#039;s going to draw a lot more normies than usually. How can we take advantage of this?<br><br>Has anybody else noticed this? Could we colonize \/b\/? How could we do it? How do we stop the raid?","filename":"4chan_flag","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":563,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1490462621921,"time":1490462621,"md5":"lUvw5Yixyv4FfH+KR5naqA==","fsize":53457,"resto":0,"id":"8iN9GwSV","country":"FI","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"we-are-being-raided","country_name":"Finland","replies":8,"images":7,"unique_ips":6},{"no":118247970,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)13:32:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118246983\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118246983<\/a><br>what&#039;s the matter white boi? how can you even compete.","filename":"trollld","ext":".webm","w":750,"h":420,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490463175741,"time":1490463175,"md5":"XYJ8due2OX1msS+7rlT\/Xg==","fsize":1282641,"resto":118246983,"id":"qHvr4Ne0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118248017,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)13:33:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118247970\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118247970<\/a><br>WRONG IMAGE.

Should we keep species unfit to live in the current year alive and thus fighting the evolution? In the past millions of species died and everyone was a-ok. Why do we humans fight with the Evolution?

There are plenty of species out there that could fit very well into our world if we made an effort to incorporate them into particular ecosystems, and made them perform a beneficial role. Tons of possibilities - terraforming from arid or toxic environments into arable land comes to mind. A decade or two of introducing certain species into an area can have an amazing effect if done right. The harvesting of exotic materials from certain species, whether it&#039;s a byproduct or directly taken from an overabundant supply could also be quite useful. In this, I find agriculture still in its infancy. <br><br>Most nature preservation people are a bit on the fruity tree-hugger side. Ironically, this is bad for the environment and biodiversity, as opening things up for commercialization is the only thing that will save a species in the end.

I&#039;ve had some struggles in the past few years, but these last weeks have been terrible for me. I&#039;ve been feeling depressed and with lots of doubts. It has to do with my artistic skills. I&#039;ve loved anime all my life (in part, that&#039;s a reason why I&#039;m here in 4chan), and I&#039;ve been teaching myself to draw, and I&#039;ve become decent at it. I&#039;ve been posting my art on some boards here and I&#039;ve got an artblog too, and people seem to really like it. But I&#039;ve noticed that pretty much every artist on this site has drawn or currently draws porn alongside their SFW works, and the folks at \/ic\/ seem to agree that drawing porn is something that a lot of excellent artists do. I made a post about this on \/adv\/ a few weeks ago on this, asking for suggestions on what to do. I stated there that I was only &quot;moderately religious&quot;, but truth is that my religion is actually quite important for me. I can&#039;t just forget about everything I&#039;ve learnt from my parents, who are indeed, much more religious than I am, and everything I&#039;ve experienced in my life in the Church.<br>My big problem is that I want to make a living out of drawing, and that drawing NSFW is a possible way to get a high amount of it. One of my flaws is that I&#039;ve become somewhat materialistic, and as such, I want money to buy things such as PC upgrades, video games and manga. However, at the same time, I think that learning to win money by myself will help me in my future as a professional and will be good for my parents (with whom I still live with), as they won&#039;t have to pay for everything I actually need (food, internet, phone...).<br>Ever since I met with this condundrum, I&#039;ve been having doubts about my faith. &quot;Is it really that bad? Is it bad at all?&quot; I&#039;ve asked to myself, and as I mentioned on that thread, I&#039;ve done &quot;mental gymnastics&quot; rather than talking to someone with knowledge about the topic.","filename":"d3f870904a21734f1947c9326ecdbca6f75f50656e8cc41758ed00d5c84db597_3","ext":".jpg","w":323,"h":386,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492386239113,"time":1492386239,"md5":"2YQ0i\/Fn+Sbsh+0idDr8Mg==","fsize":17787,"resto":121428888,"id":"gvf03yrj","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121440401,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:45:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121440232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121440232<\/a><br>TL;DR: I&#039;ve been tempted to draw porn for a living, and it&#039;s making me feel nasty.","time":1492386310,"resto":121428888,"id":"gvf03yrj","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121440499,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:45:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121439098\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121439098<\/a><br>You sir, just gave me something to research.

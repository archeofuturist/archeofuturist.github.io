I&#039;ve had some struggles in the past few years, but these last weeks have been terrible for me. I&#039;ve been feeling depressed and with lots of doubts. It has to do with my artistic skills. I&#039;ve loved anime all my life (in part, that&#039;s a reason why I&#039;m here in 4chan), and I&#039;ve been teaching myself to draw, and I&#039;ve become decent at it. I&#039;ve been posting my art on some boards here and I&#039;ve got an artblog too, and people seem to really like it. But I&#039;ve noticed that pretty much every artist on this site has drawn or currently draws porn alongside their SFW works, and the folks at \/ic\/ seem to agree that drawing porn is something that a lot of excellent artists do. I made a post about this on \/adv\/ a few weeks ago on this, asking for suggestions on what to do. I stated there that I was only &quot;moderately religious&quot;, but truth is that my religion is actually quite important for me. I can&#039;t just forget about everything I&#039;ve learnt from my parents, who are indeed, much more religious than I am, and everything I&#039;ve experienced in my life in the Church.<br>My big problem is that I want to make a living out of drawing, and that drawing NSFW is a possible way to get a high amount of it. One of my flaws is that I&#039;ve become somewhat materialistic, and as such, I want money to buy things such as PC upgrades, video games and manga. However, at the same time, I think that learning to win money by myself will help me in my future as a professional and will be good for my parents (with whom I still live with), as they won&#039;t have to pay for everything I actually need (food, internet, phone...).<br>Ever since I met with this condundrum, I&#039;ve been having doubts about my faith. &quot;Is it really that bad? Is it bad at all?&quot; I&#039;ve asked to myself, and as I mentioned on that thread, I&#039;ve done &quot;mental gymnastics&quot; rather than talking to someone with knowledge about the topic.","filename":"d3f870904a21734f1947c9326ecdbca6f75f50656e8cc41758ed00d5c84db597_3","ext":".jpg","w":323,"h":386,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492386239113,"time":1492386239,"md5":"2YQ0i\/Fn+Sbsh+0idDr8Mg==","fsize":17787,"resto":121428888,"id":"gvf03yrj","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121440401,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:45:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121440232\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121440232<\/a><br>TL;DR: I&#039;ve been tempted to draw porn for a living, and it&#039;s making me feel nasty.","time":1492386310,"resto":121428888,"id":"gvf03yrj","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121440499,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)19:45:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121439098\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121439098<\/a><br>You sir, just gave me something to research.

One of the better things about Catholicism is that, when looking at the litany of saints throughout the ages, one notices that they are incredible diverse, both in character and occupation. Where as protestantism demands a certain engagement in public life, Monasticism, isolation, and solitary contemplation of God has always had a place. There are of course, great leaders, or warriors, or charismatic speakers, but true to its claim of being the Church for all people, it has always respected those who work better alone.","time":1492393868,"resto":121428888,"id":"54DXZMtt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121460011,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)21:53:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121459366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121459366<\/a><br>No.If I&#039;m remembering correctly it had to do with Paul and maybe the epistles.","time":1492393980,"resto":121428888,"id":"XIHpms\/3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121460024,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)21:53:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121459140\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121459140<\/a><br>Can you link the thread?","filename":"1476756413974","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":960,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492393984709,"time":1492393984,"md5":"Xub+OH0+NBvJNQqKC8zvGw==","fsize":295521,"resto":121428888,"id":"o8CGhobI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121460187,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)21:54:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121457766\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121457766<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Muh, God only came to earth and spread his truth in the late 1300s. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Muh, muh language is built upon 100s of other proto languages but muh religion isn&#039;t.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Muh, god only sent his profits in my time to inform me of the truth as to his words<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Muh, let me go ahead and lie about how I sourced my religion<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Muh, I don&#039;t make sense because there are no gaps in history but but .. muh god in muh specific religious text book.<\/span><br><br>God is beyond all books of man.

Her body was even examined by a doctor about 50 years later, and this is what he had to say:<br>&quot;I would have liked to open the left side of the thorax to take the ribs as relics and then remove the heart which I am certain must have survived. However, as the trunk was slightly supported on the left arm, it would have been rather difficult to try and get at the heart without doing too much noticeable damage. As the Mother Superior had expressed a desire for the Saint&#039;s heart to be kept together with the whole body, and as Monsignor the Bishop did not insist, I gave up the idea of opening the left-hand side of the thorax and contented myself with removing the two right ribs which were more accessible. ... What struck me during this examination, of course, was the state of perfect preservation of the skeleton, the fibrous tissues of the muscles (still supple and firm), of the ligaments, and of the skin, and above all the totally unexpected state of the liver after 46 years. One would have thought that this organ, which is basically soft and inclined to crumble, would have decomposed very rapidly or would have hardened to a chalky consistency. Yet, when it was cut it was soft and almost normal in consistency. I pointed this out to those present, remarking that this did not seem to be a natural phenomenon.&quot;<br>Pic related is her today, though with a wax face mask because of some damage incurred during one of the world wars.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":293,"h":176,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1492395042215,"time":1492395042,"md5":"L70PQFY17gAKreYT1fOnWA==","fsize":27537,"resto":121428888,"id":"8HQXbN2v","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121463976,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)22:22:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121461948\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121461948<\/a><br>This is the one time illl quote Martin Luther <br>&quot;If you&#039;re going to go and sin, then sin greatly&quot;<br>Go and see what it does to a man, a little hear and there will decieve a vain man but great amounts will show you how horrible it really is<br><br>If you say it doesnt matter then go ahead and be a hedonist to the extreme","filename":"APOSTLE-PAUL","ext":".jpg","w":1086,"h":1447,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492395740953,"time":1492395740,"md5":"idjm18Otywpa6lx86oqGnw==","fsize":478447,"resto":121428888,"id":"o8CGhobI","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121464389,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)22:25:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121462314\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121462314<\/a><br>Yeah I totally agree","filename":"Cima_da_conegliano,_incredulit\u00e0_di_san_tommaso_col_vescovo_magno","ext":".jpg","w":1841,"h":2731,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492395931593,"time":1492395931,"md5":"FHrIXtXqQc5FLaGP00E\/NQ==","fsize":3209044,"resto":121428888,"id":"o8CGhobI","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121464598,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)22:26:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121463976\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121463976<\/a><br>The lukewarm have been described as the most revolting to Christ.

This is in the Bible. Peter is given authority first, apart from everyone else, and is also exclusively said to be given the &quot;Keys to the Kingdom of Heaven&quot; in a somewhat lengthy talk. The apostles are given similar authority besides the comments surrounding these keys.<br><br><br>Some small regional churches split from the church due to councils that they didn&#039;t agree with, which came to be collectively known as Oriental Christianity. The biggest split in Christianity began with the kingdoms of Rome and Constantinople disagreeing - primarily - with the power of the office of the apostle Peter. Peter had the &quot;keys&quot; and the details surrounding that but Rome held this would mean that the office had authority over other offices mechanically in the church structure whole Constantinople held that all offices were equal and Peter&#039;s primacy is only honorary. This disagreement is the core of the split between those two faiths. These faiths center their authority on the apostolic authority from the apostles to which they came to have and are thus known as Apostolic Faiths. They lean on the church authoritative judgements throughout the years and the words of the saints (declared saints by that same authority) and scripture decided by this authority.<br><br><br>After all of this in the 16th century there began to be popular revolution against the Catholic Church due to distrust in their authority. They held that either apostolic succession was not truthful or that neither major church shared it and so decided to focus on what they could think is authoritative - the Bible. The Bible became the very extent of Christian law to them and began to justify the Biblical canon through rational discourse alone rather than leaning on church authority and rational discourse. This scriptural discourse led to several faith but they are collectively known as Protestant Faiths.<br><br>Hope that helped.","filename":"1437109822607","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":587,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":71,"tim":1492401512125,"time":1492401512,"md5":"uXhsnWy9mOXuY37CqmYeOQ==","fsize":182443,"resto":121428888,"id":"fRigl5y5","country":"US","trip":"!!tuOwy1ct2dy","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121476234,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:00:47","name":"Anonymous","filename":"polyptych-of-st-peter-eternal-blessing-with-cherubs-and-angels-1500","ext":".jpg","w":2045,"h":1034,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":63,"tim":1492401647026,"time":1492401647,"md5":"d3qTdy4jgVnGUv9ZM4x2KA==","fsize":281932,"resto":121428888,"id":"o8CGhobI","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121476258,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:00:55","name":"WOLFSHIEM","com":"<a href=\"#p121475988\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121475988<\/a><br>To add some vocab:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pope<\/span><br>Man in office of the apostle Peter in Catholicism.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Patriarch<\/span><br>Men in apostolic offices generally to Orthodoxy.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sola Scriptura<\/span><br><br>The Protestant doctrine that scripture is the final and only authority to the Christian faith.","filename":"Basilica of St Clement2","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492401655891,"time":1492401655,"md5":"\/Pc3oz\/SY9RqgL8h5RpF8w==","fsize":247331,"resto":121428888,"id":"fRigl5y5","country":"US","trip":"!!tuOwy1ct2dy","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121476304,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:01:19","name":"Anonymous","filename":"pala-di-sant-agostino-arcangel-gabriel-1523","ext":".jpg","w":2453,"h":2453,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492401679933,"time":1492401679,"md5":"d10oHoi1Uzt6lyQ6tCmWSw==","fsize":618649,"resto":121428888,"id":"o8CGhobI","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121476322,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:01:33","name":"WOLFSHIEM","com":"I&#039;m out.","filename":"Fighting Temptations","ext":".jpg","w":457,"h":400,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":109,"tim":1492401693414,"time":1492401693,"md5":"ouVlafhn6xisSQJDEZH6Cg==","fsize":41263,"resto":121428888,"id":"fRigl5y5","country":"US","trip":"!!tuOwy1ct2dy","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121476384,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)00:02:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121464598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121464598<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121467997\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121467997<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121468887\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121468887<\/a><br><br><br>&quot;When Jesus Came to Birmingham&quot;<br> <br>When Jesus came to Golgotha, they hanged Him on a tree, <br>They drove great nails through hands and feet, and made a Calvary; <br>They crowned Him with a crown of thorns, red were His wounds and deep, <br>For those were crude and cruel days, and human flesh was cheap. <br> <br>When Jesus came to Birmingham, they simply passed Him by. <br>They would not hurt a hair of Him, they only let Him die; <br>For men had grown more tender, and they would not give Him pain, <br>They only just passed down the street, and left Him in the rain. <br> <br>Still Jesus cried, &#039;Forgive them, for they know not what they do, &#039; <br>And still it rained the winter rain that drenched Him through and through; <br>The crowds went home and left the streets without a soul to see, <br>And Jesus crouched against a wall, and cried for Calvary. <br> <br>-- G.

It was a common mystery in the middle ages as to why these Turks were so white and blond. <br>So take that, shitskin :)","time":1492509252,"resto":121652275,"id":"UVPJD7rw","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121664295,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)05:55:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121662460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121662460<\/a><br>don&#039;t be disrespectful to best turks. you all fucking suck, you let fucking slavshits take all our lands. sort yourselves out already steppe niggers","time":1492509307,"resto":121652275,"id":"asLdw2lE","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":121664319,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)05:55:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121661501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121661501<\/a><br>Yes","time":1492509320,"resto":121652275,"id":"P0z6lOc7","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121664337,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)05:55:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121652275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121652275<\/a><br>where is this even? central africa?","time":1492509335,"resto":121652275,"id":"Zcgm88m7","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121664383,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)05:56:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121664295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121664295<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;turks<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;best<\/span><br>Choose one.","time":1492509371,"resto":121652275,"id":"LuKjonf6","country":"KG","country_name":"Kyrgyzstan"},{"no":121664494,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)05:57:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121661501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121661501<\/a><br>Why is Uzbekistan hated?<br><br><a href=\"#p121664096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121664096<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121664056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121664056<\/a><br>Why are Tajiks gypsies?","time":1492509450,"resto":121652275,"id":"YStjHf5A","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":121664681,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)05:59:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121664216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121664216<\/a><br>Yes Western Kipchaks were blonde.

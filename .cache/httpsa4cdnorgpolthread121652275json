I am descendant of them from Hungary where we are called Paloc. The word derives from the slavic root b.l.d. meaning pale (same root in english), fair, and yellow. This is because the Western cumans were blond as fuck. The germans refered to them as Fallones, also deriving from the Germanic root &quot;fair&quot;. It was a common mystery in the middle ages as to why these Turks were so white and blond. <br>So take that, shitskin :)","time":1492509252,"resto":121652275,"id":"UVPJD7rw","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121664295,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)05:55:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121662460\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121662460<\/a><br>don&#039;t be disrespectful to best turks. you all fucking suck, you let fucking slavshits take all our lands. sort yourselves out already steppe niggers","time":1492509307,"resto":121652275,"id":"asLdw2lE","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":121664319,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)05:55:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121661501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121661501<\/a><br>Yes","time":1492509320,"resto":121652275,"id":"P0z6lOc7","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121664337,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)05:55:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121652275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121652275<\/a><br>where is this even? central africa?","time":1492509335,"resto":121652275,"id":"Zcgm88m7","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121664383,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)05:56:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121664295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121664295<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;turks<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;best<\/span><br>Choose one.","time":1492509371,"resto":121652275,"id":"LuKjonf6","country":"KG","country_name":"Kyrgyzstan"},{"no":121664494,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)05:57:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121661501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121661501<\/a><br>Why is Uzbekistan hated?<br><br><a href=\"#p121664096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121664096<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121664056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121664056<\/a><br>Why are Tajiks gypsies?","time":1492509450,"resto":121652275,"id":"YStjHf5A","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":121664681,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)05:59:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121664216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121664216<\/a><br>Yes Western Kipchaks were blonde.

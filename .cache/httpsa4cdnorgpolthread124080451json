Corporations have access nearly every single office in government by their ability to pour money into races and the revolving door between government and corporate employment. They write a variety of legislation and pay to have lobbyists on hand at every level of government from the city halls to the US Senate. The only people who don&#039;t have power in this system is the average person - the one getting the short end of the stick in terms of education, infrastructure, housing, etc. One might in fact argue that government is nothing but an extension of those with money and power - the capitalists, in short. Who can deny this with Goldman Sachs sitting at the helm in any and all administrations from any party? While our media has dwindled to six private conglomerates tied to the military industrial complex? And meanwhile you&#039;re worried that the government is gonna *do something with your shoes*? Wow.<br><br>The fact is that this is always what capitalism becomes, because the richest capitalists - as anyone with unaccountable power does - always corrupts the system to benefit them. Crony capitalism IS capitalism. And there&#039;s no way around that. Capitalism loves this sort of government - government which pours a trillion dollars a year into the military industrial complex. Government which keeps taxes low to non-existent through loopholes and tax deferments. Government which - despite what you think - regulates practically nothing outside of what might cause clashes amongst the corporate giants or violent reaction.<br><br>Your silly capitalist utopia doesn&#039;t exist.

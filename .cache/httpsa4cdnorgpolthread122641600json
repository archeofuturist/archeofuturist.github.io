When I asked for the reason, he said that people come from other countries. He left the news and basically just said have a nice weekend,\u201d said Uffe Rustan.<br><br>\u201cIt feels like I\u2019m worthless, even though I pay taxes and my kids go to school here. If only they had been in kindergarten or something . . . but you cannot put a family on the streets for another family,\u201d<br><br>\u201cIt feels a little depressing. I think this is about morality and how to treat people, that everyone should be treated equally. But apparently I\u2019m worth less than others.\u201d<br><br>Rustan is taking the city government to court and charging them with breach of contract.<br><br>\u201cProbably, we have to move from here, and I still do not think it is right. I can stay with friends, but it will be the worst for the children.\u201d<br><br>The Swedish establishment has tried to turn the country into a global cluster of third-world countries at the expense of local Swedes.<br><br>\u201cDiversity is our strength\u201d they shout loudly from their ivory towers and gated suburbs.<br><br>So then why is it third-world countries are not the first ones to have it? Why is it always the White places that must have \u201cdiversity\u201d? That have no choice but to accept?<br><br>It\u2019s got nothing to do with mixing the world or any of that other hippy talk. It\u2019s about getting rid of White areas.<br><br>Africa is not becoming minority Black. Asia is not becoming minority Asian.<br><br>It is only Western countries which are becoming minority White, and this is the result of a deliberate and forced agenda.<br><br>It\u2019s called White genocide.","filename":"sweden","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":525,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":145,"tim":1493069721077,"time":1493069721,"md5":"XhI8BeOqwI5JANDIl9Gy3A==","fsize":35045,"resto":0,"id":"KV152lc4","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-taxpaying-swedish-family-was-forced-to-leave","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122642245,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)17:40:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122641600\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122641600<\/a><br>Fucking Sweden man.","time":1493070021,"resto":122641600,"id":"B1v35U5G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

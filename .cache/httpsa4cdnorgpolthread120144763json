The service has repeatedly warned that the Chinese could become the DOMINANT ETHNIC group in the Russian Far East in 20 to 30 years. Such an occurrence would require an annual influx of about 250,000 to 300,000 Chinese, LESS than one-third the rate that Shaikin currently claims<\/span>","time":1491666219,"resto":120144763,"id":"mjcCUJHJ","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":120144906,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)11:44:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Freedom of speech and being BASED in Putin&#039;s own way","filename":"IMG_5822","ext":".png","w":1536,"h":2048,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491666250573,"time":1491666250,"md5":"c+d+hKxV8HvLTP3LHdiBow==","fsize":2746416,"resto":120144763,"id":"mjcCUJHJ","country":"RU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Russian Federation"}]}

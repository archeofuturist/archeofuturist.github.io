All sources updated within the last day or so.<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Steal<wbr>thing<br><br>You&#039;re free to Google more at your leisure, but all these articles have appeared within the last day or two. It&#039;s another media blitz on the issue.<br><br>I can&#039;t say for sure what sparked the interest on the issue at this time. The issue was raised before a few years ago in connection with a Canadian case, which was covered by Vice.<br>https:\/\/www.vice.com\/en_us\/article\/<wbr>is-poking-holes-in-condoms-a-sexual<wbr>-assault<br><br>But the intention is clear. To increase the ever-expanding definition of sexual assault, likely to use it increase its scope as a weapon against exclusively straight men. In each of the articles, the issue of stealthing is presently almost exclusively as one of men committing it against women - hardly no consideration of how a woman might sabatoge a condom in order to commit paternity fraud, much less any consideration of how might &quot;forget&quot; to take her birth control in order to secure child support payments for the next 18 years.","filename":"i said no","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":250,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1493337224065,"time":1493337224,"md5":"VJijxhEF1EzvGyytlm5FHA==","fsize":25818,"resto":0,"id":"gEpFJQw1","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"stealthing-a-new-weaponization-of-sexual-assault","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

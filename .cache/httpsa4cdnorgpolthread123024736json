So that they can easily rule over your consciousness. Don&#039;t forget real authority starts there. The rest is detail. Pornography, nudity, obscene dress, alcohol, they all serve to this agenda. They portray pornography and fapping as if it were harmless while in reality they cause many serious psychological problems starting with low self-esteem, social anxiety disorder and depression. They corrupt your psyche. You already know it because you are no-faps. But quitting fap is not enough. You must also quit being sexually obsessed in your mind. Stop looking at naked women on the street, work place and elsewhere. I know its hard as a man, but everytime you find yourself captivated by their bodies, just remember that you are in the middle of a corruption process that will in the end be bad for you. But what can you do in a society where everything visual revolves around naked bodies and lust? Spirituality is the only answer my friends. Not dark-Satanic versions of course. They only make things worse for you. I myself found true spirituality in Sufism. It worked on me. You can start with googling &quot;Rumi poetry&quot;. You don&#039;t have to become a Muslim to be a Sufi. Maybe later you might consider, but this is irrelevant because Sufism is about your soul.

He is more. That&#039;s why Rumi (who was not only a poet but also a theologian, jurisprudent, kalamist etc.) says here he is not a Muslim. Because when he says &quot;I&quot; he does not refer to Rumi the worldly person. He refers to the essence in himself. All his poetry, all the love, everything is about this. Spirituality is all about discovering this essence, while religious regulations (prayers, fasting and the rest) are there to make such a discovery possible by cleaning your consciousness and heart from dirts like lust, anger, cynicism, arrogance, ego-related features etc. In any case, please do not just stop fapping, but also replace something better in its place, so that you become more than worldly creatures and raise your consciousness levels to high echelons.

Cultural imperialism has been the most successful in countries where they succeeded to turn people into sexually obsessed creatures.<br>There is also another thing I want to mention. Sexuality is a good thing. It is not only a biological need, but also a God-given gift to people. Maybe a preview of what will happen in Heaven. Pornography first degenerates and demonizes it and then demonizes those who watch it. The problem is, I guess, the Christian problematic perspective of sexuality. While it is a biological need, they regarded it as evil per se and commanded priests to abstain from it. Which resulted in other sexual affairs behind closed doors.. Because it is so strong an impulse that you can hardly stop. Therefore God told us to marry and to find satisfaction with our wives. And not seek further satisfaction with non-marital partners, no matter how appealing it is for our desires.

That is... strange, I guess. I go to social events like weddings and bars and I need to drink a coke.

You think you are ok and that you are so successful and &#039;all I do is smoke a couple joints, that&#039;s not bad, could be worse I could be getting drunk&#039; but that&#039;s just being in denial. Weed is still a crutch and you will feel so much better if you quit. Other drugs I haven&#039;t done in over 5 years. I think I did one rail of blow a few years ago when I was really drunk, that&#039;s it. <br><br>As for the fapping... That&#039;s probably the hardest. Being healthy everywhere else in life gives me crazy libido, and my gf isn&#039;t always DTF when I am, so sometimes maybe I&#039;ll fap in the shower if she is on the rag or it&#039;s been a few days and I know I won&#039;t be getting any that night or the next. <br><br>I&#039;m completely no-porn though, porn is the real problem.

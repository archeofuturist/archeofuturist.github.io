Only two options come to mind - they want to put boots on the ground in Ukraine or ethnic cleansing of Baltic states.<\/span><br>My guess is the plan is to do something in regions near Russia that pose an extreme long term strategic threat to Russia to bait Russian forces into moving across into another country. Then they will say look Russian invasion of Europe, war now! They will let it spill over into a few eastern euro countries then try and get Russia bogged down in a long term conflict in hostile territory. In theory after enough time attrition would reduce the Russian military to almost nothing without using nukes.<br><br>By fighting near Russia it makes using nukes inconvenient for Russia. As long as NATO make sure to not outright defeat the Russian offensive they can maintain a long term stalemate. They would use eastern euro locals to absorb the majority of casualties. As long as the weapons flow, insurgents in Estonia, Ukraine, Lithuania and Belaraus would burn through Russian military equipment supplies. Eventually supplies of T-72s, T-80s and all the cold war era weapons would run out.

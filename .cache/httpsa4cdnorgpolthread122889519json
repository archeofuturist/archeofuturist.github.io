But she saw daylight through a small window on Tuesday, and from an unlikely source: her defeated counterpart on the far left.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Alone among all of France\u2019s major political personalities, Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, the leader of his own \u201cFrance Unsubjugated\u201d movement, who finished a strong fourth in Sunday\u2019s voting, has refused to endorse Ms. Le Pen\u2019s opponent, the former economy minister Emmanuel Macron.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s critics say his obstinacy is petulant, wounded pride that can only help Ms. Le Pen\u2019s National Front. But it also speaks to the passions that Mr. Macron, a seemingly mild-mannered centrist, provokes in large parts of the French electorate, far left and far right, who share a view of the 39-year-old former investment banker as a fire-breathing incarnation of evil market culture.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As populism and anger over the impacts of globalization energize much of the electorate, Mr. M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s stand has added a new element of uncertainty into the final round of voting on May 7. It has also set off a dynamic in the French race much like when Hillary Clinton defeated Senator Bernie Sanders in the Democratic presidential primaries last year \u2014 leaving his supporters, still in the thrall of populism, up for grabs as party allegiances broke down.<\/span>","filename":"161114152205-marine-le-pen-france-flag-super-tease","ext":".jpg","w":1100,"h":619,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493217303106,"time":1493217303,"md5":"XDhEXu7iME6uDzuWqxgBwA==","fsize":118086,"resto":0,"id":"Zp5h2JpY","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"le-pen-gets-support-from-unlikely-source-the","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":4,"unique_ips":12},{"no":122889660,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:36:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122889519\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122889519<\/a><br><br>This is just like angry Bernie supporters voting Trump just as a fuck you to Clinton and the DNC","filename":"1493174999135","ext":".jpg","w":638,"h":355,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1493217384844,"time":1493217384,"md5":"ofIyf4Iy0ga2IEl7\/F+4iQ==","fsize":35575,"resto":122889519,"id":"8IHecvV0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122890198,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:41:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122889660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122889660<\/a><br>french edit of pic related gets free (you)s","filename":"1477354071507","ext":".jpg","w":976,"h":548,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493217694176,"time":1493217694,"md5":"on6eTakafOencxcGAUEUcA==","fsize":143203,"resto":122889519,"id":"NHM9e2qU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122890467,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:44:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"So far, according to polls, which were in the end accurate for the first round, most of them will vote Macron, like any other voters.

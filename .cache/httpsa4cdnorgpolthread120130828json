University education. <br><br>With feminism, social justice, equal outcome and equity fairness all becoming mainstays in our culture, this neo-marxist doctrine is being taught at University, and is furthermore becoming embedded in the campus. <br><br>Why has the push for socialism also seen the liberalisation of the University? Because paying for University creates pressure for academic conformity. The students now demanding safe-spaces, social justice and cultural marxism are forcing the Universit administrators to cave into these demands for money. The neo-liberal University needs to return to Enlightenment principles. <br><br>If the University was made for public use, students would lose their bargaining power.

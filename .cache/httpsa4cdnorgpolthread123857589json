I guess men are so angry because of all these stupid feminist bitches and then on the othersise selfish goldigging losers that think Miley Cyrus is a moron, to me men seem stuck. The OP is smart not to settle but at some point you have to decide if its better being alone. I got to run my own business, travel the world, fo things people only dream of. I am 51 now for my 50th birthday I went to Fiji. The guy I was dating didnt want to go &amp; miss work blah blah. I went alone and scuba dived had an amazing time. I don&#039;t find many guys who want to date like small things. They wanna take you for dinner and big dates. What ever happened to getting a sandwich &amp; eating by the lake. Or going for a walk in the park and holding hands? It&#039;s like American men have abandoned romance maybe because they have been burned so much I get it. But I feel like I could do a 10x better job and take myself on better dates. So that&#039;s what I do. Honestly all guys have to offer me is sex these days. And for the guy who said I have nothing to offer but sex its not true. The never bother learning about me cause they are either lazy or scared. Relationships take a lot of work OP. You have to decide which sacrifice you want to make. Sacrifice your drwams, peace, peter pan lifestyle for a lot of work with a wife &amp; kids (polish women are work too) or take a chance on being lonely. I am lonely from time to time but I chose this life.

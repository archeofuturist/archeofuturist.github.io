I&#039;m open about a ton of shit and I know I&#039;ll get a ton of shit for it. But it feels so good. And people will come up and say &quot;I feel the same.&quot; My question to you is: why don&#039;t you open up at least a bit to people. They&#039;ll have more respect for you and you&#039;ll stick to your values. Read some Evola and understand what it means to be a man among the ruins. Don&#039;t wish for a better day but do nothing. If you wish for it act for it, spread the word! Some may laugh or get mad but take it. It&#039;s better than leaving behind shit for your children.","filename":"a3d8f25ffa73c3bc12e707d51b3c1e16_pepe-the-frog-happy-pepe-frog-meme-happy_495-495","ext":".jpg","w":495,"h":495,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492384234264,"time":1492384234,"md5":"uR31YsIXbNbEwalwK38HGA==","fsize":25248,"resto":0,"id":"JJOSI1kR","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-cant-contain-my-power-level","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

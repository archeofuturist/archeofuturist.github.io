People haven&#039;t provided you proof, or proof from a source you feel isn&#039;t biased. Perhaps even if you heard it from a source you felt wasn&#039;t biased you&#039;d dismiss it as temporary panic.<br><br>I&#039;m here to help clear the confusion. Let&#039;s begin:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The scheme involves super-sizing vouchers to help urban poor afford higher rents in pricey areas, such as Westchester County, while assigning them government real estate agents called \u201cmobility counselors\u201d to secure housing in the exurbs.<\/span><br>Of course urban poor is codeword for blacks, browns and possibly illegals. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;...a similar program tested a few years ago in Dallas has been blamed for shifting violent crime to affluent neighborhoods.<\/span><br>Now the article chose to leave out any factual data on which neighborhoods in Dallas, so as to allow the reader to dismiss this reference as the upset biased opinion of whiny whites.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It\u2019s all part of a grand scheme to forcibly desegregate inner cities and integrate the outer suburbs.<\/span><br>They just come out and tell you it&#039;s a &quot;grand scheme&quot; and exactly what their goal is.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Anticipating NIMBY resistance, Castro last month threatened to sue suburban landlords for discrimination if they refuse even Section 8 tenants with criminal records.<\/span><br>They know before they do these things there is going to be resistance and they prepare ahead of time for it. These are traitors. Using legal means to financially ruin people who refuse their plans, even when the tenants have a criminal record.","filename":"371a022cb35cba0736b6fef6bee0aa740ea48f4ea7a85f8272ff253f248459d5","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1152,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1493449939393,"time":1493449939,"md5":"CTVU\/g2+0PHBqkWd0HLDbQ==","fsize":458244,"resto":0,"id":"Nm\/UnUVZ","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-may-think-hud-is-just-some-sort-of-conspiracy","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":123309251,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)03:22:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"I don&#039;t know, but elite cities in the US - SF\/NY\/BOSTON\/DC are becoming less black...There is a plan behind it all.<br><br>Weathy know that blacks cause a very large percent of the crime so they give vouchers to get them housing in more unfashionable locals -- or areas that have too many whites and are in need of vibrancy.<br><br>They have problems with this in Chicago, but they are trying to get blacks away from the central lakefront at least- so weathy \/ tourists aren&#039;t being harassed... demolition of Caberni Greene was part of this strategy.","time":1493450541,"resto":123308584,"id":"5oDIk8Bg","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

I have a family doctor I haven&#039;t seen in around 2 years, but I could call up and make an appointment and see her within a week. Free. I could also go right now to any walk in clinic and see a doctor, after probably 3 hours waiting because it is Sunday. Free. Prescription wise, I would have to pay (generally $10-70 Canadian bux a month for most prescriptions in my experience) but can later send the receipts to family insurance and be reimbursed. <br>Basically GENERAL healthcare shit in Canada is very good, like getting antibiotics same day you get sick or referrals or bloodwork done. You can only get controlled prescription drugs from family doctors not walk in clinics. Emergency room visits (Ive been twice for broken bones) take forever (6-8 hours both times), involve sitting around and all around isn&#039;t very efficient, however it is still same day emergency services all FOR FREE with no insurance (except, again, prescriptions you may get in emergency). The part where Canadian healthcare falls apart at the seems is when you need a specialist, like a dermatologist or a pain expert. These take like 4-12 months to see depending and can be very expensive. Most Canadians with enough money just pay out of pocket for American specialist doctors. So basic healthcare = cheap, quick enough easy to access. Complex specialist healthcare = bureaucratic shitfest and well worth paying extra to speed the process. This is all possible with a ~40% tax rate, and the embarrassment of knowing you have a cockbrowser as your prime minister. Could be worse, could be better, atleast you don&#039;t every have to decide if you can afford a quick clinic visit or emergency room","time":1493584387,"resto":123504378,"id":"whypSjJh","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123522741,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)16:35:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123507044\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123507044<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;U.S is not on the list<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Japan, Canada and UK are the top 25. <\/span><br><br>Even after the health care law we passed we still are nowhere in the top 25.

This world would be a much better place if more people did. IF Japan will suffer hardship from not allowing immigrants in, AND they choose that outcome, that is their fucking choice to make. Did it ever occur to you that a labor shortage is a cross some people are willing to bear in order to maintain their culture?

The technology is there. Moreover, individual workers benefit from higher wages. Having to pay workers more is a redistribution of wealth that is actually a healthy result of the free market.

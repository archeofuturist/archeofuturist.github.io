I personally believe insurance, like usury, is an inherent scam. It should be outlawed all together. This would bring prices back down to what the market would dictate an average person could afford. Also on the other hand, a welfare program for those who can&#039;t work to subsidize the costs should be instituted.<br>Insurance is gambling. Which is under prohibition. Perhaps maybe a loan program provided by the state without usury in order to cover said medical bills is the good option for the welfare I&#039;m speaking of.","filename":"1493347450696","ext":".jpg","w":251,"h":189,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":188,"tim":1493911370854,"time":1493911370,"md5":"us1iX7bFMu+pEscnRWJAjQ==","fsize":6383,"resto":0,"id":"xeFG6bol","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-lets-talk-about-insurance-in-america-this-is","country_name":"United States","replies":40,"images":6,"unique_ips":13},{"no":124070596,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)11:27:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Theoretically I support universal healthcare.

By outlawing insurance we bring it back to free market capitalism dictating the price. There are those who are unfortunate enough to not be able to work though. For those non-interest bearing loan from the government to pay the hospital in my opinion would be the best case scenario. The loan can be paid back with very low minimum payments. The money used for these loans would never really have to grow per se. Sans of course population expansion. But the worst case scenario is that these loans would go unpaid. In my opinion however this would not necessarily be a bad thing. The money text from the u.s. population would go directly back to it. we would basically be using the US government as a capacitor for monetary funds directed towards Healthcare.

So people can just not get insured (the fine from Obamacare is less than insurance and it&#039;s loosely enforced) then wait till they get sick and buy insurance after. That means there are fewer healthy people paying into the insurance pool which drives up the price for those that are (further incentivising people to not buy insurance until they need it).","time":1493920218,"resto":124070068,"id":"qOBAR3Gn","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":124086630,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)13:55:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Universal health care is the answer.

I personally believe insurance, like usury, is an inherent scam. It should be outlawed all together. This would bring prices back down to what the market would dictate an average person could afford. Also on the other hand, a welfare program for those who can&#039;t work to subsidize the costs should be instituted.<br>Insurance is gambling. Which is under prohibition. Perhaps maybe a loan program provided by the state without usury in order to cover said medical bills is the good option for the welfare I&#039;m speaking of.","filename":"1493347450696","ext":".jpg","w":251,"h":189,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":188,"tim":1493911370854,"time":1493911370,"md5":"us1iX7bFMu+pEscnRWJAjQ==","fsize":6383,"resto":0,"id":"xeFG6bol","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-lets-talk-about-insurance-in-america-this-is","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":124070596,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)11:27:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Theoretically I support universal healthcare. Take it out of taxes. It would cost a lot less than the insurance playing Middle man system we have in place. But...you just know the government would fuck it up and require mandatory 21 immunizations every year or some similar level of fuckery. When John Kerry was running for prez he floated an idea that any medical bill over 50k would be picked up by the government. I actually think this is a decent idea.","time":1493911669,"resto":124070068,"id":"N0HbqH9Q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124070917,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)11:30:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124070068\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124070068<\/a><br>Insurance is not a scam, people are just to dumb to understand it.<br><br>1.

Hospitals will charge what is willing to be paid. If the only option is to try to get money from an average person that cannot charge exorbitant fees. By outlawing insurance we bring it back to free market capitalism dictating the price. There are those who are unfortunate enough to not be able to work though. For those non-interest bearing loan from the government to pay the hospital in my opinion would be the best case scenario. The loan can be paid back with very low minimum payments. The money used for these loans would never really have to grow per se. Sans of course population expansion. But the worst case scenario is that these loans would go unpaid. In my opinion however this would not necessarily be a bad thing. The money text from the u.s. population would go directly back to it. we would basically be using the US government as a capacitor for monetary funds directed towards Healthcare. In fact the taxes paid by Health companies could go to fund this very thing.","time":1493912113,"resto":124070068,"id":"xeFG6bol","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124071446,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)11:36:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124070917\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124070917<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;health care cost is the issue insurance does not lower cost<\/span><br>Some doctors will negotiate payments without insurance at more than 50% off.

The House Always Wins. on one hand you&#039;re making a bet that you are going to be unhealthy and the insurance company is making a bed that you&#039;re going to be healthy. At the end of the day their risk-benefit analysis is significantly better than the average person . similar to loans and Usery this only adds a middle man that stands to profit and leech off of the very system it states that it benefits. Not only that but it drives the cost of healthcare up as it will be charged for what the market will bear.

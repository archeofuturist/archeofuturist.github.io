The argument on whether or not they were state capitalist comes from a purely factual analysis of the Soviet system and any state that copied it. The Soviet Union used a state-capitalist model and called it socialist.<br>When looking at it from a non-aligned standpoint, the state went and took everything from private capitalists and became a mega-capitalist in it&#039;s own right. It owned the factory, it hired the manager, it bought the machinery, it hired the workers and paid them a fixed wage and then kept the profits for itself. From this simple standpoint, it was a acting as a capitalist, but was in fact a state actor. So it was state capitalist.<br><br>And before someone starts calling me a commie, I&#039;m actually far-right. I was just looking at the facts.","time":1490649938,"resto":118563013,"id":"a1aDQnQP","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118564623,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)17:27:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ask them to define &quot;true communism&quot;","time":1490650076,"resto":118563013,"id":"dYRkYJfQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

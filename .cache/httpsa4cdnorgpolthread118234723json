Republicans don&#039;t have that and they&#039;re never going to get that. 2018 at best will net them 5 seats, which would be a colossal swing these days, an that would still only bring them up to 57 votes, and that&#039;s assuming all Republicans agree on a bill, which we now know they can&#039;t do, seeing as the house of representatives, where they have a fun king huge majority, couldn&#039;t even pass this bill to the senate.<br><br>TL;DR Obamacare is now here to stay. Yes, you will now be forced to buy health care or submit to a fine for the foreseeable future. Yes, your premiums will stay sky high. Repealing isn&#039;t happening. Replacing isn&#039;t happening.

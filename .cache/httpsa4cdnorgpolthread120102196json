Anti-diversity is not racism, it is about creating a stable society. What would happen if immigrants decides to bring &quot;laws&quot; into a new country? Would that be acceptable for the sake of diversity? Of course not. One land under one government needs to show direction to the people, and if the routes diverge too much people will get lost.<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;t. 2nd gen<\/span>","filename":"will","ext":".png","w":633,"h":397,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1491635102481,"time":1491635102,"md5":"nlSxPDXw4duPukRAsgAQ3g==","fsize":225153,"resto":0,"id":"rquNOidt","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-dont-spoiled-westerners-not-understand-what","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120102374,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:07:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"What if immigrants come and 100% assimilate?","time":1491635240,"resto":120102196,"id":"yoiuKErU","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120102743,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:11:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120102374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120102374<\/a><br>You didn&#039;t understand the post. I&#039;m talking about bring new cultures to other lands. Immigrants who 100% assimilate are basically your people now. Although it is besides the point, it is impossible for any immigrant to 100% assimilate because that means forgetting the past and unless you have a tumor in your brain, that is unlikely.","time":1491635506,"resto":120102196,"id":"rquNOidt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120102929,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)03:15:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120102743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120102743<\/a><br>Ah.

Race is not what prevents foreign population from assimilating, it is language and culture.<br> And again, you are missing the point here. Your Muslim friend is doing something unusual for a traditional Muslim to be doing, but that guy probably has strong tendency to do prefer something unusual over what your people may consider normal. People who have ties to dangerous culture or background are like ticking bombs because even if they go to public school that teaches new values, they often live within communities or family that still sticks to what your people may consider taboo. <br>Purging unsatisfactory cultures is just the best way to go","time":1491636098,"resto":120102196,"id":"rquNOidt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

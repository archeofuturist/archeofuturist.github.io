Her training days led by trainer Anthony Cortez included long distance running and cycling mixed with swimming and grueling stair runs. To increase the actress\u2019 lean muscle mass, Cortez pushed her through total body resistance training workouts that included walking lunges, push-ups, and military presses. To get Linda\u2019s abdominals lean and defined, she performed an intense abdominal training routine each day. Cortez mixed it up with various mini-trampoline exercises to elevate her heart rate and develop her lower body.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In addition to the traditional exercise program, Linda participated in an intense martial arts program to increase her fat burning and stamina. What\u2019s interesting is that the Terminator actress sought out an Israeli commando instructor that worked with her on her fighting skills and basic soldier training routines. This also helped her get into amazing shape and prepare her for the role of the female hard nose in the movie. At the conclusion of her training program, the now 112-pound actress could perform 85-pound bench presses for multiple repetitions and run for eight miles without becoming extremely fatigued.

One interesting topic that I discussed lately is the burning of witches during the 15th to 19th centuries (and some cases long before that). <br><br>Do you think it could have been another ploy by the Jew which turned out to be a big hoax? Pretty convenient to get rid of some of the most beautiful women at the time and blame (((their))) own accusations on the young women. Britain has a known meme throughout the world of having ugly as sin women (it&#039;s not false either for the most part), but a lot of the beautiful ones were in fact labeled as witches in the past. Some still retained the genes and we have a tiny percentage of beautiful women.<br><br>Thoughts on all of this?

The average American does not know this. But 60 cruise missiles being fired at a single base sure sounds impressive. So everyone involved wins, except the rebels. Trump gets to look tough and kill the Russian puppet narrative, Putin gets to posture rattle his sabre at those mean old Americans and Assad gets to call for a strengthening of resolve. And the MSM and American public eat it up. Bill Clinton did this shit through most of the 1990&#039;s.

Countries were founded on a common identity, a common major ethnicity and a common good for said ethnicity. Ahmed may be born in France, but he is hardly french, he doesn&#039;t have french blood, doesn&#039;t inherit France legacy, isn&#039;t taught France&#039;s values, doesn&#039;t relate to frenchmen in either race nor ideas on a large scale. He is raised in a mini Morocco or Saudi Arabia inside France, raised by muslim parents, and grows up to see the western world as a bunch of degenerates that indulge themselves on alcohol, sex and infidelity. As a common man he neither has the intelligence nor the tolerance to understand the world around him, and knows it by what his Arabic environment taught him. He then feels conflicted and goes to kill some innocent people to redeem himself of his &#039;degeneracy&#039; he himself indulged in when he was younger. The world may scream racism, but it matters little when you have an 11 year old cut in 3 in the middle of the street.","filename":"IMG_4307","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":664,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":162,"tim":1491918123746,"time":1491918123,"md5":"wOouvnEoYAqh0KksNROeQQ==","fsize":107754,"resto":0,"id":"j2v5Xrw3","country":"AL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"on-the-origin-of-terrorism","country_name":"Albania","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":120600027,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)09:53:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120598781\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120598781<\/a><br>you dont say","filename":"1491579781599","ext":".png","w":545,"h":530,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":121,"tim":1491918815967,"time":1491918815,"md5":"S\/U9731vL5msVYw9ekehBA==","fsize":239921,"resto":120598781,"id":"HDR8HgbP","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]}

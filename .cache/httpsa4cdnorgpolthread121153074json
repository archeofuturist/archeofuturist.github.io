say that I back them 100% I find most of the world&#039;s perception and behavior towards the NKs to be autistic. <br>First let me say there was a heaping pile of autism that started the total shit show that was the Korean war. It forced them to dig in an become more extreme just so they could survive, and decades of military, political, and economic antagonization haven&#039;t helped either. Furthermore the &quot;but da gommies&quot; argument used to justify all of this falls apart if one looks at fucking China. Its actually funny because I remember at the start of the ukraine situation being part of a discussion on the US-RUS relations and how this could be resolved, and this discussion flipped over to NK because of the idea that the West doesn&#039;t want peace. When ever a politician wants to get a bump they just need to be seen as taking a hard stance on NK, the reason doesn&#039;t matter. Western nations only antagonize countries which are weaker than them or not economically important, and since the Korean war hasn&#039;t sparked up again its seen as safe business as usual to pressure NK in a manner that would normally be seen as escalation. Western leaders seen little risk in hitting the NK punching bag since the conflict can benefit a politician&#039;s career. This kind of mind set in itself is retarded, but the notion that after all of these years of threats to NK maybe one day out of the blue they will surrender and have a big musical number in the streets with SK about how wonder the US is down right insane. The only way this ends is half of SK gone and NK a crater, or a deescalation of hostility toward NK and the guarantee that they will be integrated back into the world. <br><br>All that said this NK missile story is great because if western leadership is not deranged it may lead the west to respect NK&#039;s right to exist which will deescalate the whole situation and cause peace. Or if the west has goes full retard we get the end of both Koreas.","time":1492254182,"resto":121153074,"id":"tEZKLRcM","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121199184,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)07:05:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121198203\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121198203<\/a><br>Gains?

This book inspired me to go against the grain. Sometimes the culture is WRONG. Sometimes society has become too comfortable. Sometimes you need to do something even if it&#039;s &quot;weird&quot;, different, or shocking to some people. This book woke me up in the sense that I started to see things how they really were instead of what society wanted me to see. I stopped sucking up to the popular kids in school. I stopped caring about &quot;being popular&quot;. I stopped listening hip hop and started listening to only metal. I realized the meaningless of so much that we think matters. &quot;You&#039;re not your kakis.&quot; &quot;You&#039;re not you&#039;re special china cabinets.&quot; It gave me inspiration to get fit like brad pitt (In the book he was fit too) and to be tough and not a beta cuck.

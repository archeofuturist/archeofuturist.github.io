All of these types of attacks try to make someone look stupid, or like a hypocrite, until you put a single ounce of thought into them. They are dependent on making their statement, then moving on to the next topic immediately. It probably works for normies that don&#039;t have time to get into the meat and potatos of a topic\/event, but not anyone that&#039;s keeping up w\/ things. It works on TV because they can move onto the next &quot;joke&quot; or subject quickly before someone will stop and reflect on what was said, no idea why anyone would fall for it on \/pol\/.<br>eg: <br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123641921#p123641921\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123641921<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123640314#p123640314\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123640314<\/a><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/123642666#p123642666\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123642666<\/a><br><br>Trump is a disaster: They will say things like &quot;Drumpf betrays supporters by failing to end NAFTA&quot; -- Anyone that was paying attention to the campaign (eg: his supporters) will notice that what Trump actually said was that he would only end NAFTA if he couldn&#039;t renegotiate it to more favorable terms.

They are trying to use their divide and conquer tactics to separate and divide anyone that supports President Trump and turn them against eachother.

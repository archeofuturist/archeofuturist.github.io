It is very common for people to take lies as truth or not even think of its possibility to exist, like Religion, life after death, media-fed agendas and so on - it makes it easy to go on. Other people share it with friends, relatives or others they can trust and feel like they sympathize or contribute into making the burden easier, and other just deal with it alone if they cannot take any of the above - probably most of us here.","time":1493408397,"resto":123226105,"id":"9nMjKgc1","country":"IL","country_name":"Israel"},{"no":123235499,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)15:44:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123235086\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123235086<\/a><br><a href=\"#p123232572\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123232572<\/a><br>I for example, to deal with the question of death, came to a lie to myself that can exist, that helps me get through the mental lows I get from time to time:<br>Just before an accident or some Adrenalin rush from danger or something alike, people feel like time is slowing down or accelerating for them.

When Assad threatened to gas his opposition Obama drew a false line of resolve, the &quot;Red Line&quot; which Assad promptly crossed, incurring no consequences. Republicans didn&#039;t have Obama&#039;s back either, so was incredibly dumb to reign in a guy like Assad through rhetoric. Anyway, the civil war continues and Russia gets involved on behalf of their ally. They continue to push the propaganda meme that ISIS was directly formed by Obama, rather than they forming as a natural result of the region being in upheaval. We were actually supporting a 3rd force that was fighting and getting its shit pushed in by both sides. Trump comes along and echos those sentiments in the campaign that we&#039;re behind ISIS, lending more unwarranted credence to Russian propaganda. He also basically says that although Assad is a bad guy, we don&#039;t have intentions of removing him. He goes to greater lengths than required to reinforce this, however, as he wins the election and becomes president, leaving Assad the impression that there is nothing he can now do to draw the United State&#039;s ire. Gets away with several minor gas attacks with no evident response, then conducts a major attack with gas. Russia pushes out more propaganda on behalf of their ally that it was actually the enemy on the ground who had gas, and that Syrian bombing run only unleashed that which they had--essentially victim blaming--a point of which more than a few Trump supporters now believe. They believe this because for short-sighted political gain they&#039;d found allies of convenience in America&#039;s strategic opponent, who actively went about trying to sew American people&#039;s distrust in democratic principles, being that while they&#039;re nationalists, they&#039;re Russian nationals first and foremost.

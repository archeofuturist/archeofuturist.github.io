New starters were given an exam, but they weren&#039;t marked on whether they were correct, instead on whether the answers they picked showed a consistent theory of how it worked. Students were then tracked separately depending on which group they were placed in.<br><br>The students who were working off a consistent theory rapidly improved, and finished the course with average grades in the 80% range.<br><br>The students who didn&#039;t never got any better.<br><br>The bottom line is that if someone doesn&#039;t consistently apply a logical theory of working to computers to start with, we can&#039;t teach them it.

New starters were given an exam, but they weren&#039;t marked on whether they were correct, instead on whether the answers they picked showed a consistent theory of how it worked. Students were then tracked separately depending on which group they were placed in.<br><br>The students who were working off a consistent theory rapidly improved, and finished the course with average grades in the 80% range.<br><br>The students who didn&#039;t never got any better.<br><br>The bottom line is that if someone doesn&#039;t consistently apply a logical theory of working to computers to start with, we can&#039;t teach them it. Those who go off a consistent theory, it&#039;s just a question of telling them what the right theory is.","time":1492041516,"resto":120811476,"id":"4+QPmPm4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120833559,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)19:58:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120832820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120832820<\/a><br>basically if it bricks your system. fries your gpu, or corrupts your cmos an engineer wrote it","filename":"image","ext":".gif","w":540,"h":303,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492041538090,"time":1492041538,"md5":"3V7VcuZPCe+e0ZNUQaq\/IQ==","fsize":1649568,"resto":120811476,"id":"yj\/Ns6ha","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120833627,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)19:59:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120832952\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120832952<\/a><br>Saw a poo-in-the-loo in my ceramics class.

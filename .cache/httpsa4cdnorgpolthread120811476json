As such, it would make sense for us to transfer resources to the educational system to teach children about basic computer use, programming, architecture, etc., even at the expense of other subjects, some of which I do not believe are as vitally important to the future economy.<br><br>I believe that computer &quot;fluency&quot; will come to be as important and widespread as verbal literacy, and that we should be taking action to implement this in our countries ASAP. Not necessarily teaching our children about complicated data structures or algorithms like graph isomorphism, but simple, applicable things.

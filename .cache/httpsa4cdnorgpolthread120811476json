Also most jobs require you know how to read and write on at least a basic level. Need a drivers license or to file taxes? Enjoy doing that when you can&#039;t read. Whereas only a few people, most of them programmers, ever need to know how to code. Also you need to know how to read to program.","time":1492038097,"resto":120811476,"id":"zs+80yH5","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120826079,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)19:02:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120811476\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120811476<\/a><br>if every person knows how to code and program then what maeks it valuable?","time":1492038137,"resto":120811476,"id":"hc+RjEeL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120826383,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)19:04:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"dont know who are worse<br><br>t_d or programming niggers","time":1492038281,"resto":120811476,"id":"I1wtFMMa","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120826582,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)19:06:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120811476\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120811476<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;have CS degree<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;teacher assistant in college<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;assistant instructor for 1 year<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;now I&#039;m jobless NEET<\/span><br>Yeah sure lets increase the job market for me.","filename":"1395574854359","ext":".jpg","w":328,"h":366,"tn_w":112,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492038363211,"time":1492038363,"md5":"IXCkJxEp\/KC+2Z5AdmOymw==","fsize":162176,"resto":120811476,"id":"mhvvCr7Y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120826611,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)19:06:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120826079\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120826079<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If every person knows how to add and subtract then what makes it valuable?<\/span><br>Its cpmplex. anyone can do the simple work (if theyre taught) but someone who is actually good at is demands a premium in the job market","time":1492038380,"resto":120811476,"id":"romUVXQu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120826728,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)19:07:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120811476\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120811476<\/a><br>like 20% of my comp sci major dropped out within 6 months because they couldnt even understand basic C variables<br><br>then another 20% dropped out at pointers<br><br><br>and these are people who thought they were &quot;&quot;&quot;good&quot;&quot;&quot; at computers. sorry anon not everyone can get it. we dont need arrogant kids who think they are the shit because they can do some dumb shit lowest common denominator &quot;&quot;programming&quot;&quot;<br><br><a href=\"#p120814254\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120814254<\/a><br>also this, had to end up doing a business second major and 8 business electives to cover my defiency in this area","filename":"image","ext":".gif","w":180,"h":180,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492038428973,"time":1492038428,"md5":"s9EvWAHl1lVuHKEMo01M1A==","fsize":1190530,"resto":120811476,"id":"yj\/Ns6ha","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120826807,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)19:07:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120811476\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120811476<\/a><br>no.","time":1492038471,"resto":120811476,"id":"2lapNJjW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120826826,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)19:07:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120826582\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120826582<\/a><br>I dont even have my CS degree yet (although I have several professional certificaitons) and im a cyber security consultant for two businesses and I also administer a few websites.<br><br>Maybe your not that good at it.","time":1492038476,"resto":120811476,"id":"romUVXQu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120826892,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)19:08:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120823455\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120823455<\/a><br>&#039;&#039;Your&#039;&#039;<br><br>It&#039;s okay anon, just leave the thread, you don&#039;t need to embarrass yourself any further.","time":1492038503,"resto":120811476,"id":"13trsWTm","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":120826931,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)19:08:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120815353\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120815353<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Computer literacy<\/span><br>I think there should be a &quot;just fucking Google it, you retard&quot; class.

But it is still a very strong root part of their psychology. If someone thought they where inferior for being poor or mundane then they feel punishment.. yet to go in the direction this punishment suggests is to escape from the root. Its very tricky because a person can be very close to the root and feel like they are meaningless but when you are meaningful, when you are a revolutionary in the true sense of the word, then you are in that spot completely.. But there is a different factor involved.. That factor is that you understand your head, reality, society, other people, the world which is disordered, your energy, enthusiam, what is right action, what is suffering, how to live without suffering, how to live with great meaning inwardly and outwardly.. Its very a tricky spot, but it is the truth.. 100% truth.","time":1492686699,"resto":121978571,"id":"7CaqyNO7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121983899,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)07:16:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121982587\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121982587<\/a><br>kek<br><a href=\"#p121979961\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121979961<\/a><br>fuck them.

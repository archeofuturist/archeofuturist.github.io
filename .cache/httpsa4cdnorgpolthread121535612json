There is no such thing as a general purpose AI and I honestly doubt there ever will be. Even a moderately effective AI is trained on a huge amount of data to do one very specific task and is worse than useless to do anything else. You have to understand that at the root of it all an AI is just taking a mathematical vector and mapping it to another vector, there&#039;s no freaking magic involved. <br><br>Worrying about the singularity coming from AI would be like worrying Newton could read your mind and predict all your future actions just because he figured out a formula predicting where a cannonball would land. <br><br>Google is not trying to create the singularity. Google is trying to keep the ad money flowing in, while doing enough cool tech stuff to make the engineers feel like they aren&#039;t working at an advertising company.

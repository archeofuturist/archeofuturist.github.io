Of course the SJW&#039;s are totally silent on this issue, other than to attack anyone who disagrees as being racist or something. Anyway Reza Aslan wrote a book saying Jesus wasn&#039;t the son of God, and he lives in the USA, which is mainly christian. I think you see where this is going! We need to get the hashtag #HangRezaAslan trending, to a) piss off Muslims and expose their hypocrisy when it comes to their feelings, b) piss of an troll SJW&#039;s as they reveal their double standards for christians and Muslims. And c) Just generally trigger some butthurt. Anyone in for this?","filename":"rezaislam","ext":".png","w":1275,"h":1432,"tn_w":222,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491005491225,"time":1491005491,"md5":"9oa0Q7L69eb6e0g8EWBw6g==","fsize":2217030,"resto":0,"id":"stWzetGI","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-hashtag-hangayaznizami-is-trending-on-twitter","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119119562,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)20:16:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119119123\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119119123<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jesus is son of God<\/span><br>What does this mean?

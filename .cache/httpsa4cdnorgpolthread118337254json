Name a civ that doesnt have beliefs. It fills a void that we cant fill with any material thing. We need to pray even if we dont believe to fill that gap we have. Pray, meditate whatever. Just do it for your spiritual health. Its like feeding ones souI. I know it sounds crazy but just look at our species developement.

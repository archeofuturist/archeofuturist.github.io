The list of supposed Russian hacking origins just leads to general servers run by Yahoo and other companies. Its a massive clusterfuck of nothing. Could Russia have done it? Yes. But so could have a middle school student given that Podesta replied to a fishing email with his account information.<br><br>Trump Getting Russian Money: Paul Manafort, a political consultant and lobbyist, got Russian money for organizing anti-Western political groups in Ukraine like 2-3 years ago. He did nothing illegal, and its not like the current Ukrainian government is above board. He has also previously been investigated for money laundering but nothing was found. Why is this relevant? Because he helped Trump organize his campaign. He was fired pretty early on. Aside from this, there really isn&#039;t any other significant proof.","time":1490921054,"resto":118993639,"id":"CjLZ5GOs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118995278,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:47:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118994249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118994249<\/a><br>this is how Trump supporters defend it.<br><br>Micheal Flynn was the first national security advisor appointed by President Donald Trump and had to step down for lying about Russian connections.

There were also other smaller members of Trumps cabinet and of course Trump&#039;s own family who have connections with Russian&#039;s. They are now being investigated. We don&#039;t know how deep it goes. It could all be business partners and associates from previous governmental positions or it could be a complete undermining of the administration. Latest news today is Michael Flynn and his lawyer have announced they are willing to rat everyone out for immunity from charges.","time":1490921278,"resto":118993639,"id":"bKbxak53","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

He did nothing illegal, and its not like the current Ukrainian government is above board. He has also previously been investigated for money laundering but nothing was found. Why is this relevant? Because he helped Trump organize his campaign. He was fired pretty early on. Aside from this, there really isn&#039;t any other significant proof.","time":1490921054,"resto":118993639,"id":"CjLZ5GOs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118995278,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)20:47:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118994249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118994249<\/a><br>this is how Trump supporters defend it.<br><br>Micheal Flynn was the first national security advisor appointed by President Donald Trump and had to step down for lying about Russian connections.

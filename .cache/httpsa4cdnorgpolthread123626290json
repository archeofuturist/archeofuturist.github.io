Shia here in Lapland just letting you Nazis know that you\u2019re never going to find me and all your attempts to bring me down and hurt me are only going to make me stronger and more determent. From now on I\u2019ll always be two steps ahead of you. Like a ninja but armed only with tolerance and understanding. You will never divide me and my friends ever again.<br><br>I\u2019ve also done some serious thinking and realized that this art I\u2019m making has helped me understand your loneliness. It\u2019s not about how you&#039;re connected to other people but what connects you with them. My connection is the shared humanity and love. All that connects you is your anger towards the world, edgy shock humor, bankrupted and anti-Semitic western ideals, making white supremacist OK signs and spreading hateful frog memes. That\u2019s all you have in your small community while mine is shared across the world in every culture.<br><br>Also it seems that while you were busy trying to divide me, your bigoted president has actually divided you. Sad. It really shows what all that lonely nerd resentment leads to in the end. I tried to welcome you guys and let you share the love and togetherness that HWNDU was all about but all you wanted was to ruin the joy for everyone else. Keep the flag if it\u2019s the only thing that makes you feel important. You are nothing but a bunch of fascists and thieves. Sitting in your rooms, scrolling through your lonely dude forums in the dark, wondering why you don\u2019t have any real friends or why you\u2019ve never touched a woman while validating your racist and misogynist delusions with people who don\u2019t actually care about you. Face it. You guys are really the ones who are Divided and Alone Together.<br> <br>Anyways, I\u2019m going to have threesome with Finnish and a Swedish chick tonight but be sure to check out the live stream tomorrow at http:\/\/alonetogether.kiasma.fi\/ and maybe you\u2019ll learn what real human connection is about.<br><br>Oh yeah. One more thing. I banged Megan Fox.

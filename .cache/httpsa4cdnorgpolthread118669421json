I don&#039;t have a problem with the fact that many people make way more money than I do. No one is entitled to more than he\/she is willing to work for. I support protectionism to the point that countries should aim for full employment until foreign workforce is considered but it&#039;s just ridiculous, how some workers think that they should earn thousands for a job that doesn&#039;t require high level of education and a lot of brainpower. Physical and dangerous jobs are one thing but some paper mill worker sitting in front of a computer in a monitoring room is basically paid to do nothing.","time":1490743064,"resto":118669421,"id":"yZPyp16c","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118713767,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)19:25:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hello, friends.

I&#039;m not one of them and I&#039;ve already said that I don&#039;t like them. RKP is also so small that they can&#039;t decide anything by themselves. I believe in meritocracy to a certain extent, so defence should be arranged by those, who know most about it. In this case officers. A good start would be to let them join the discussion. Unfortunately officers aren&#039;t allowed to speak publicly about what&#039;s going on behind the scenes. This negatively affects the public discussion. There&#039;s a lot of wrong or incomplete information in circulation.<br><br>Modern Russia still has many of the same interests as Soviet Union, whether you like it or not.

Being an employee isn&#039;t usually bad but then you&#039;ll have to settle for what&#039;s given to you.<br><br>And again, using your money to influence things other than economy is out of the scope of what I said. Sure, those who pay more taxes should have more say on what they&#039;re spent on but it should be done openly and not in secret like Soros does. Soros is pushing an agenda and not raising public discussion. There&#039;s a huge difference. Also one good way to give more power to people would be to move to direct democracy. That way economic elite would have less power to lobby their agenda. Capitalism is about economy and should stay that way. In my opinion it would be in the national interest that our welfare state would make a shift towards a model, where everyone would be placed on the same starting line instead of the same finish line. The current system is broken in two ways: workers have artificially high wages and benefits and elite can use their money to influence the &quot;starting line&quot; to benefit themselves.","time":1490746662,"resto":118669421,"id":"yZPyp16c","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"}]}

So last week, Mr. Jarlstrom filed a civil rights lawsuit in federal court against the Oregon State Board of Examiners for Engineering and Land Surveying, charging the state\u2019s licensing panel with violating his First Amendment rights.<br><br>\u201cI was working with simple mathematics and applying it to the motion of a vehicle and explaining my research,\u201d said Mr. Jarlstrom, 56. \u201cBy doing so, they declared I was illegal.\u201d<br><br>The lawsuit is the latest and perhaps most novel shot in the continuing campaign against the proliferation of state licensing laws that can require costly training and fees before people can work. Mr. Jarlstrom is being represented by the Institute for Justice, a libertarian organization partly funded by the billionaire brothers and activists Charles G. and David H. Koch.<br><br>Mr. Jarlstrom does not have an engineering license issued by the state board. He is a self-employed consultant who tests audio products and repairs, upgrades and calibrates test instruments. But he did earn a bachelor\u2019s degree in electronics engineering in Sweden, where he was born. He has also spent a couple of years researching traffic light timing intervals, which included consulting with one of authors of the original 1959 mathematical formula used as a basis for programming traffic light signals.<br><br>Nonetheless, the Oregon board, after a nearly two-year investigation, assessed a $500 civil penalty because Mr. Jarlstrom called himself \u201can excellent engineer\u201d in one of several emails to the board and informed the Washington County sheriff that he \u201cinvented and publicly released a new extended solution\u201d to the problem of yellow lights in traffic flow.","filename":"trafficlight","ext":".jpg","w":484,"h":348,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":179,"tim":1493636853675,"time":1493636853,"md5":"3BC8o\/iGty57K88039XwsA==","fsize":20896,"resto":0,"id":"e6Ed0erY","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"oregon-man-fined-for-complaining-about-traffic","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123608367,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)07:16:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123607724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123607724<\/a><br>bump","time":1493637360,"resto":123607724,"id":"e6Ed0erY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123608392,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)07:16:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123607724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123607724<\/a><br>bump","time":1493637382,"resto":123607724,"id":"oiTnRpk0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123608540,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)07:18:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123607724\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123607724<\/a><br>There&#039;s some background to this -- for those of you who didn&#039;t know.<br><br>The US and Canada(only 2 I know of) have strictly defined what an engineer is. If you do not have an actual college degree, in engineering, they will litigate the fuck out of you. Legally, you can say that you are partaking in &quot;engineering&quot; though.<br><br>You might be thinking oh, that&#039;s kind of weird they&#039;d go through all that trouble even though nobody but engineers even care enough to tell anyone they&#039;re engineers! Much like the &quot;banking cartel&quot;(its really hard to get into banking, if you didn&#039;t know), there is also an &quot;engineering cartel&quot;. Literally anyone can partake in engineering, so accredited engineers got together long ago and decided everyone else had to go through the same retarded shit they did to call themselves an engineer. They also decided to extort other engineers to lobby the goverment to give them the legal authority to litigate anyone who just casually said they were an engineer in any sense.<br><br>Also, this guy should have just went back to Swedistan.","time":1493637499,"resto":123607724,"id":"MnhbpvZK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123610130,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)07:39:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123608540\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123608540<\/a><br>I forgot to mention that outright criminal cartels, such as drug cartels, also participate in this type of behavior. The actual cartels don&#039;t even bother trying to stop certain laws from going into effect, especially those involving money laundering and other things they can bribe their way out of. Selling drugs wholesale is literally pointless if you can&#039;t launder it back to Mexico!<br><br>And while Jose and his gang of street children might be able to actually sell drugs at a meaningful amount, it&#039;s improbable for them to be able to launder it in the matter that larger cartels tend to.<br><br>Basically, my point is that the goverment is retarded, and lets these groups use them to raise the entry barriers into shit. <br><br>I&#039;m not exactly a lolbertarian is practice, but paying off a stupid and corruptible(in this area, at least) goverment to mandate fines and other litigations, including jail for people who call themselves a noun that basically just means you know calculus, some liberal arts, and whatever bullshit specialty you were likely dumb enough to choose just sounds like outright racketeering.<br><br>If there&#039;s anyone reading this, don&#039;t trust or even acknowledge someone who calls themselves one unless you knew them before they went into the bowels of circle-jerking. And always remember that they chose to get accredited in a field that is literally the mental equivalent of laying brick.<br><br>http:\/\/foreignpolicy.com\/2013\/07\/11<wbr>\/theres-a-good-reason-why-so-many-t<wbr>errorists-are-engineers\/","time":1493638797,"resto":123607724,"id":"MnhbpvZK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123610435,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)07:42:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123608540\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123608540<\/a> This<br>He challenged two revenue streams for the state:<br>*Registration of engineers<br>*Red-light cameras<br><br>The autist didn&#039;t realize that the state doesn&#039;t care about road safety","time":1493638973,"resto":123607724,"id":"N+Lej1bS","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"}]}

And because you had a good upbringing and are a good person yourself, you explain it in ways that make them out to be not so bad. You make excuses of various kinds for what you see, like - maybe they just had a bad day, maybe they were just mistaken, maybe they accidentally slipped up.<br><br>But it&#039;s no accident. Why are all the accidents and slipups to the detriment of those they hate and the benefit of other totalitarian and collectivist far-leftists? Why does a communist get a sympathetic interview, and a neo-nazi does not? Why do they always lie and distract, and always pretend?<br><br>Unfortunately, the truth is that they are simply utter and complete psychopaths. They don&#039;t have boundaries or ethics or rules. They are like serial killers with other goals than killing.<br><br>Psychopathy includes prominently callousness and an absence of feelings of guilt. That seems quite prominent to me.<br><br>Also, leftists really enjoy violence. Look at a march, and see. <br><br>So you&#039;re basically stuck in a society that can never be good, because the most active leftists politicians and journalists, even if just a few percent of the population, are complete and utter psychopaths, and they will spend their entire lives, constantly, causing harm. <br><br>Hence the only way to really deal with it is to kill them. Nothing else works. Try for decades if you want to - nothing else has ever worked, and nothing else can work.

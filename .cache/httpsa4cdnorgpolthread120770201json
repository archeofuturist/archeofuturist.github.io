Universities are trying to subvert anyone trying to study a real course. Then you gotta take some amount of social or humanitarian courses, and that&#039;s where you get indoctrinated, this way they get to even those students who don&#039;t care for SJW shit. Apart from of course eroding the campus society, as these are courses that will influence the social life at the university.<br>These &quot;courses&quot; have no right to exist in the first place, even more so if they are just &quot;fillers&quot;. They have no other purpose than the erosion of common-sense society.","filename":"1353089218948","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":525,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492025333027,"time":1492025333,"md5":"1aHubHPk2ehoFE32rMdQ+g==","fsize":46663,"resto":120770201,"id":"v5Qx64Cs","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120795785,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)15:31:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120785054\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120785054<\/a><br>Yer both doing good... believe me.","time":1492025466,"resto":120770201,"id":"ijZPToFk","country":"BG","country_name":"Bulgaria"},{"no":120795933,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)15:32:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;(((Crowds)))<\/span><br>NGO footmen.","time":1492025540,"resto":120770201,"id":"wj6UGB3O","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":120796268,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)15:34:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120795933\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120795933<\/a><br><br>No. No need for it.

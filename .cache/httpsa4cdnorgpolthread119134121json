If you took a lot of Black children and raised them in societies established by White people, ran by White people with all the resources a White community provides, this would allow these Black kids to reach their full potential. They would have better personalities and a higher level of intelligence than their Black brethren from the ghetto, but would they be able to sustain this society after their White elders begin dying out?<br><br>I don&#039;t think so. I think the first generation of Blacks would run things a little more shoddily than the Whites did. Resources would be mismanaged slightly, the teachers at the schools wouldn&#039;t be able to convey key ideas to their students as well as the White teachers did to them, the police would become a little more aggressive and make mistakes on cases or shoot suspects more often under suspicious circumstances and cover it up (corruption sets in), things like this. The next generation would be even more screwed, and the one after it as well, until the Black community regressed to the mean and the community, which started off as a successful White one, and then an okay Black one, became just another ghetto.<br><br>I honestly don&#039;t think Blacks can create or sustain advanced societies. There&#039;s a lot of intelligent Blacks and stupid Whites, and this overlap is what makes it difficult for so many normies to see the possibility that Blacks are, on average, less intelligent.","filename":"1488942473942","ext":".jpg","w":492,"h":449,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":228,"tim":1491014571000,"time":1491014571,"md5":"QyZIQUHJ7ZWeVsuKm0MUiA==","fsize":43010,"resto":0,"id":"STRsXDjY","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-know-theres-a-lot-of-ideas-out-there-about","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":119134317,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)22:44:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"Expanding on this idea a bit...<br><br>I think that one&#039;s environment can play a greater role in how they express themselves than they&#039;re genetics, if their natural instincts are suppressed by some greater impetus. Say you have a single Black person in the middle of Japan, born and raised (somehow, just stay with me), so they adopt all the Japanese language, culture, mannerisms and way of thought. I think their genes would still make them express themselves in a slightly different manner, a slightly more boisterous demeanor, their way of thinking would possibly be a little off from everyone else, which would reveal itself in the way they speak or the way their relationships form and are maintained.<br><br>But just one Black wouldn&#039;t be enough to overcome the prevailing actually-ethnic Japanese culture. Throw another Black in there, and I believe they would begin influencing each other and the behavior they would naturally be inclined to would begin manifesting itself as they could finally &quot;be themselves&quot;, especially if there were some Marxist school of thought telling them to throw their traditions and culture into the trash and adopt a new one entirely their own. Increase their numbers into the thousands and they would become Blacks merely born in Japan. They might speak the Japanese language and adopt some of the culture and tastes, but they wouldn&#039;t be like the ethnic Japanese.<br><br>In the early days of the United States, Blacks in the north had a much greater impetus to behave themselves and prove their worth. Whites were telling them they were subhuman, and a White person uprising could occur at the drop of a hat, so many Blacks adopted the White culture and did everything they could to prove their worth, while many Whites could be as grimy as they wanted, which created this overlap that made cucked Whites believe that we could all be equals if we gave equality a chance.","filename":"1461820329512","ext":".png","w":621,"h":309,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1491014692148,"time":1491014692,"md5":"rgD4qzuBmPUESqHJHq8yiQ==","fsize":223362,"resto":119134121,"id":"STRsXDjY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

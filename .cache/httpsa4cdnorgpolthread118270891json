In 1965, average tuition at a four-year public university was just $243 and many of the best colleges did not charge any tuition at all. The Sanders plan would make tuition free at public colleges and universities throughout the country.<br><br>Over the next decade, it has been estimated that the federal government will make a profit of over $110 billion on student loan programs. This is morally wrong and it is bad economics. We will fight to prevent the federal government from profiteering on the backs of college students and use this money instead to significantly lower student loan interest rates.<br><br>The Sanders plan would require public colleges and universities to meet 100% of the financial needs of the lowest-income students. Low-income students would be able to use federal, state and college financial aid to cover room and board, books and living expenses. And Sanders would more than triple the federal work study program to build valuable career experience that will help them after they graduate.<br><br>The cost of this $75 billion a year plan is fully paid for by imposing a tax of a fraction of a percent on Wall Street speculators who nearly destroyed the economy seven years ago. More than 1,000 economists have endorsed a tax on Wall Street speculation and today some 40 countries throughout the world have imposed a similar tax including Britain, Germany, France, Switzerland, and China. If the taxpayers of this country could bailout Wall Street in 2008, we can make public colleges and universities tuition free and debt free throughout the country.","time":1490476276,"resto":118270891,"id":"j2f7lLbQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118272843,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)17:11:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118272434\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118272434<\/a><br>please refund my donation Bernie.

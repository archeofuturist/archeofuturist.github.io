The leftist learns first to be ashamed and afraid of the incorrect positions and this becomes an infection that must spread from his mouth to his mind. For such loud individuals, many of us found leftism marked by a deep and unsettling silence.<br><br>It should in particular be concerning how the left has reformed the notions of love and hate (or fear) to be affixed to those notions that go against the position. There is a party of love and a party of hate in our countries now, rather than thought and feeling as it ebbs and flows in its complexity. There are -isms and -phobias to describe dissent, rather than the notion of dissent with its capacity for reason. There is no reason, one may be angry or fearful, but reason is precluded against by the invention of the -isms and -phobias, which make impossible any discussion towards many of the greatest ideas of man. We should be suspicious of such a large portion of the population amassed by a childish need to affix such simplistic metadata to the world in order to categorize it.","time":1490553242,"resto":118385854,"id":"gw\/uqven","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118395286,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)14:34:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118385854\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118385854<\/a><br>listenandbelieve","time":1490553270,"resto":118385854,"id":"q++SH4iD","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118395295,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)14:34:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Vibrant diversity with *Asians* makes multi culturalism our strength and strengthens our values.<br><br>Hm, just listing newspeak terms creates an average sentence in the politician of the day.

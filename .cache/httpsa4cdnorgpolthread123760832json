Before everyone in town would meet at Church every Sunday to pray, eat a brunch, associate, and have fun. Maybe go play baseball or whatever after Church. People were forced to be a part of a community. People were literally banned, by law, from working to force this. <br>2) No &quot;school of life&quot;. Church gives people a way to live their lives correctly. The Book of Proverbs is literally an entire book of sayings on how to live life. It gives people good advice too, like work hard and you&#039;ll succeed. Before God died, everyone spent an hour a week being told good tips on how to live. In ancient society, this was even more valuable as the tips are a lot more directly applicable to them. There&#039;s even some miscellaneous farming advice in there. <br>3) Lack of reason to not commit suicide. Before we had a final barrier to suicide, fear of eternal damnation. Since everyone who commits suicide is supposedly damned, there&#039;s a reason not to even if your life is total shit. It&#039;s grim, but now people just don&#039;t have a reason not to kill themselves. Today, if you know your life will generally suck you have every incentive, logically, to commit suicide. <br>4) Lack of higher purpose. Religion gives people an inherent calling. You exist to be a part of something - God&#039;s plan. It gives meaning to your suffering and a liberating feeling of direction. People despise not having a reason to exist. People can find other reasons to live, of course, but we no longer have that &quot;default&quot; purpose of existing because it&#039;s God&#039;s plan.","filename":"pepe","ext":".jpg","w":269,"h":187,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":86,"tim":1493728607944,"time":1493728607,"md5":"AGA5HNNYNcnIWGeGzdG\/vg==","fsize":7196,"resto":123760832,"id":"bX5bApDE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123763116,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)08:41:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123762076\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123762076<\/a><br>He wasn&#039;t saying it makes you addicted, he&#039;s saying Prozac only helps if you keep taking it.

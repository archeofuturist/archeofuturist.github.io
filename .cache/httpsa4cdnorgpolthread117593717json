Oracle, Progressive Insurance, Marvel Cinematics Palo Alto Networks, Cleveland Clinic are all huge employers with regional hq&#039;s or main hq&#039;s here.

Me and the wife working 50k a year jobs paid that off by 30.<br><br>Akron is even cheaper only an hour away with all of those rubber plants. My buddy is a backup engineer, makes only 122k and is seriously considering buying the fucking Schlesinger (the family that built it created Schlesinger Pianos in like the 1800s) Mansion thats been abandoned for 600k if the floors werent so rotten. This is a movie level mansion built with like 15 rooms, underground pool, carriage house, servants house (buddy owns this) and two acre gone to shit garden in the middle of downtown Akron. My lakehouse was built in 1915 Art Deco style and is fucking 60K, 5 bedrooms 1.5 bath and sauna. My friends brother keeps his 25ft yacht he bought for 3500. My mom&#039;s house that is 15min away is a small 3 bedroom 2 bath ranchhouse with 28 acres for 70K built in 2008. All of these things are in excellent condition.

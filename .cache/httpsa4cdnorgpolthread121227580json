I live in the 666 Fifth Avenue building on the 11th floor. I&#039;m 36 years old. I believe in taking care of myself and a balanced diet and rigorous exercise routine. In the morning if my face is a little puffy I&#039;ll put on an ice pack while doing stomach crunches. I can do 1000 now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial mask which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion.","filename":"kushner","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492274008387,"time":1492274008,"md5":"Cu5yXuJMEk73re7Z4Bg6TQ==","fsize":330015,"resto":121227580,"id":"tx4wEwfe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121227804,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)12:33:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"awoo","filename":"1488343721502","ext":".jpg","w":676,"h":1000,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492274011004,"time":1492274011,"md5":"o+ARVoe4GlK0Nc5tY+TNig==","fsize":319418,"resto":121227580,"id":"7bX1Y9\/x","country":"PE","country_name":"Peru"},{"no":121227819,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)12:33:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121227768\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121227768<\/a><br>Autism","time":1492274024,"resto":121227580,"id":"msYZZjeW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121227846,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)12:34:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"AWOO~","filename":"1469593042484","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":822,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492274042773,"time":1492274042,"md5":"NZt\/\/zOYsslUFaim9CAatA==","fsize":297781,"resto":121227580,"id":"fqQL3hfw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121227847,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)12:34:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121227699\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121227699<\/a><br>they will, you know they will","filename":"8lxA7yg","ext":".jpg","w":310,"h":403,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492274043522,"time":1492274043,"md5":"EGf6UYc95QzdUjCKTh7cEw==","fsize":24305,"resto":121227580,"id":"FiW2SUSs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121227887,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)12:34:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121227768\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121227768<\/a><br>easy to make a script that does it.","filename":"memeballshill","ext":".jpg","w":1075,"h":771,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1492274068884,"time":1492274068,"md5":"ti4hZ9XUrO6FKbxdqgE6iw==","fsize":130470,"resto":121227580,"id":"VqufmWvn","country":"IE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121227891,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)12:34:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/pastebin.com\/B8uLdK1j<br><br>Shill filter.

Austria should&#039;ve always been inside a PanGermanic state. The problem was the rivalry between Prussia and Austria back then was too great. After the HRE was de-facto dissolved, the great leading German power was Austria. As Prussia gained more and power this presented a problem for Austria hegemony over the German states. However, all states confederated under the German Confederation. This should&#039;ve been the end of German unification and it should&#039;ve been proclaimed as a state. It would&#039;ve been a massive German state.<br>However, Prussia and Austria came into conflict over their joint administration of seized Danish areas. There&#039;s dispute as to whether Prussia instigated the conflict to acquire power over the German states over Austria. Either way, this triggered the Austro-Prussian war, which Prussia won. Prussia then briefly created the North German Confederation and de-facto took control of all German states outside of Austria. However, Austria was purposefully excluded from the greater German union after the war. This in my mind was the greatest mistake made.<br>Within the Austrian Empire, the actual Austrian lands were quite small in comparison to the size of the entire territory. After the war Austria was weak, which resulted in them making the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, giving almost total autonomy\/sovereignty to Hungary in order to preserve the larger union. The North German Confederation went on to be the German Empire after the southern German states were officially incorporated into the NGC by treaty. This was originally prevented by other European states like France, who were threatened by a united German state.<br><br>Like I said, the greatest mistake made was excluding Austria from a German a centralized German union. It could&#039;ve been down either by force through annexation or by treaty as a defeated party of the war.

Firstly, Austria already had to hand over territories to Prussians and hand over their independent German state allies. They lost a lot of territory and had to accept to never involve themselves in German affairs. Secondly, they was immensely weak at that point in the way, Prussia had dealt them big blows, hence why they had to concede to all of the above. This is also evident from the compromise with the Hungarians, which showed that they couldn&#039;t even keep their own Austrian Empire centralized.<br>The real reason Austria was never incorporated was because France and Russia threatened an intervention against Prussia, which made Bismark convince the prince to end the conflict quickly and aim for the peace with the Austrians. The prince and other powerful Germans had ambitions to continue the conflict and acquire more Austrian territory, which there&#039;s no denying, would&#039;ve meant that they would&#039;ve kept the war until they had conquered all of Austria, which in my opinion should&#039;ve been done. Sure, Austrians would&#039;ve been butthurt (Bismark also said, he was afraid of bad blood or revenge from Austrians if this had happened), but in the long run, feelings of German nationalism were quite strong during that time and they would&#039;ve gotten&#039; over it.<br><br>tl;dr: If Prussia would&#039;ve pursued the war, they could&#039;ve annexed Austria, incorporated it into the NGC by force and later it would&#039;ve formed a larger German Empire.

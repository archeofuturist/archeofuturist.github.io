I do not deserve this. She did not have the right not to allow me to know my father. My life is an embarrassment. Shame in trying to explain everyone I meet that I don&#039;t have a father. Single mothers must be punished. I feel miserable now, I just wanted a normal life, just like my friends.","filename":"1490822018736","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":1707,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491323360822,"time":1491323360,"md5":"MSrDEj+cY2m\/fsbRkDx3cw==","fsize":642938,"resto":0,"id":"ccYp8tb3","country":"BR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"explain-to-me-why-is-it-allowed-for-a-woman-to-be","country_name":"Brazil","replies":10,"images":2,"unique_ips":11},{"no":119486245,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)12:32:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119485905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119485905<\/a><br>I agree, can&#039;t you find your father somehow?","time":1491323577,"resto":119485905,"id":"HIO+efLA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119486401,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)12:34:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Not politics<br>Slide thread","time":1491323661,"resto":119485905,"id":"OO1n2K9M","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119486430,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)12:34:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119485905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119485905<\/a><br>How is it possible for a person to be as disgraceful as (You)?","time":1491323675,"resto":119485905,"id":"LViIvjmo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119486717,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)12:37:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119485905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119485905<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;HURR DURR EVERYTHING NOT MY FAULT ALL BECAUSE OF MAMA WAHH WAHH<\/span><br>grow a pair faggot","time":1491323844,"resto":119485905,"id":"\/SDTZwAp","country":"LY","country_name":"Libya"},{"no":119487155,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)12:42:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119485905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119485905<\/a><br><br>Your father was a monkey Pedro I&#039;m sorry.","time":1491324129,"resto":119485905,"id":"5hiswZTj","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119487225,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)12:42:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119485905\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119485905<\/a><br>Good luck without any male guidance, swimming in a vast ocean of female emotional waste. <br>You my friend, are fucked.

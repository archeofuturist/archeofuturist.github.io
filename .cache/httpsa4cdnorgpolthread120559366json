Is college overrated or am I missing something? People act like college is the best time of your life, but I&#039;m miserable as fucking shit. I want to be an free independent adult already with a good paying job and a wife that isn&#039;t a slut (and is intelligent) and maybe a kid and not have my fucking parents down my throat treating me like their baby boy. <br><br>Is it just me or does college fucking suck? I&#039;m surrounded by privileged liberal retards who are basically just spoiled high schoolers except worse because they live on their own and think they&#039;re smart bc they&#039;re in college now. It&#039;s like this shitty stage of your life where you&#039;re not a kid with no responsibilities like in high school, but you also have no money and everything is overwhelming as fuck trying to start your life.<br><br>Everyone wants to fucking &quot;party&quot; and be a normie all the time. All the girls here are normie fucking drug addicted whores and borderline alcoholic hedonists.<br><br>Is it just me or is the education\/job system completely fucked up? Like why the fuck does college even exist? People should be ready for jobs at like 18-20 and not have fucking extended childhoods, it&#039;s making me wanna puke. I hate college, I hate the real world.","filename":"6c9743f62f13262f375a35d91c19ce29","ext":".jpg","w":359,"h":512,"tn_w":175,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491888632201,"time":1491888632,"md5":"kFCzxiIq1bL3Qx9Wyz0+ow==","fsize":75384,"resto":0,"id":"Q639WoZR","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-college-overrated-as-fuck-or-what","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":0,"unique_ips":11},{"no":120559723,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)01:34:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120559366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120559366<\/a><br>Trade jobs seem pretty awesome, to be honest.

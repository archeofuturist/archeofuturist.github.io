Is college overrated or am I missing something? People act like college is the best time of your life, but I&#039;m miserable as fucking shit. I want to be an free independent adult already with a good paying job and a wife that isn&#039;t a slut (and is intelligent) and maybe a kid and not have my fucking parents down my throat treating me like their baby boy. <br><br>Is it just me or does college fucking suck? I&#039;m surrounded by privileged liberal retards who are basically just spoiled high schoolers except worse because they live on their own and think they&#039;re smart bc they&#039;re in college now. It&#039;s like this shitty stage of your life where you&#039;re not a kid with no responsibilities like in high school, but you also have no money and everything is overwhelming as fuck trying to start your life.<br><br>Everyone wants to fucking &quot;party&quot; and be a normie all the time. All the girls here are normie fucking drug addicted whores and borderline alcoholic hedonists.<br><br>Is it just me or is the education\/job system completely fucked up? Like why the fuck does college even exist? People should be ready for jobs at like 18-20 and not have fucking extended childhoods, it&#039;s making me wanna puke.

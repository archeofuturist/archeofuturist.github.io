Demographics as most of us know are destiny and whites are now a minority for current births and children under 5. We will see the absolute destruction of any sort of conservative politics in the very near future. If the republican party even wants to be competitive they can never threaten gibs, or immigration again. The conglomeration of dark people understand the power they possess and will use it to benefit them and them only. We can expect South African tier policy when it comes to taxation and hiring policies in regards to whites within 100 years. <br>Plato was right.<br>Democracy failed us.","time":1490404326,"resto":118162648,"id":"wOwMBNBY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118163592,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:13:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118163374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118163374<\/a><br>I think you missed point 3","time":1490404433,"resto":118162648,"id":"BoIus4UA","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118163730,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:15:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118163592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118163592<\/a><br>I didn&#039;t see point 3","time":1490404502,"resto":118162648,"id":"wOwMBNBY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118163774,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:15:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118163592\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118163592<\/a>","filename":"50 Point Plan","ext":".png","w":1280,"h":1964,"tn_w":81,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490404527956,"time":1490404527,"md5":"E34F856uDswF2r6Aar2Ptg==","fsize":246069,"resto":118162648,"id":"wOwMBNBY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118163799,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:15:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"http:\/\/www.strawpoll.me\/12601349\/r","time":1490404541,"resto":118162648,"id":"hammIRUt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118164007,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)21:17:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"deadlink\">&gt;&gt;1<\/span>.

Not doable, unless you somehow get an \/ourguy\/ (I&#039;m looking at you, Bolsonaro) elected as president, either somehow replace all those corporate kikes for decent people or somehow manage to make a centralised government where nobody can overrule what you order. The second problem? There&#039;s the hard solution, and the simple one.

All of that is borderline impossible, ofc.<br><br>Simple solution: raise the amount of time one spends in prison for basically every crime (currently, the penalties are so ridiculously low that criminals from neighbouring countries come here for that reason alone), strip every convict of every property they own, including money (houses, buildings and such could be used for various purposes, such as building schools, hospitals, etc. If the area is appropriate for those, otherwise, just sell it all to the highest bidder and keep the money for the government, it should help us in the current economic crisis), introduce both the death penalty and imprisonment for life for heinous crimes (actually use both of them), introduce physical punishment, maybe some public executions, etc. No, I&#039;m not being edgy, all of that is supposed to make criminals fear getting arrested and convicted, and death penalty also helps us get rid of keeping all these criminals alive in our facilities, and thus, cutting some spending of the people&#039;s taxes and allowing for the opportunity to use them to something actually useful, but ofc, whilst the solution itself is simple, achieving it isn&#039;t, considering you&#039;d have to go through congress, who will certainly not approve of those laws, considering they might get under arrest themselves sooner or later.","time":1490407413,"resto":118162648,"id":"HSKmMsdt","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":118169955,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:04:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118169820\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118169820<\/a><br>Also lower majority age for crimes to like, 12 or so (if anyone is wondering why, it&#039;s because criminals abuse the fact that you can only really go under arrest [minors are just &quot;apprehended&quot; and are released in a couple of weeks] at 18 by getting 16 year olds [who certainly aren&#039;t against working for them] to do their dirty work for them).<br><br>There are loads of other possible solutions, but I can&#039;t bother listing them all or I&#039;ll end up reaching the character limit again.","time":1490407473,"resto":118162648,"id":"HSKmMsdt","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":118170026,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:05:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118166003\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118166003<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a much better world for everyone would emerge?<\/span><br>Right, but this would surely be the end of the US.

What&#039;s your country&#039;s biggest problem at the moment?<\/span><br>Not our biggest problem, but something that pisses me off is the House of Lords. Our upper house of parliament is appointed by the prime minister, and as a result is full of cronies and other wannabe aristocrats <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3. How would you solve that problem short and long-term? (Only solutions that can actually be realized)<\/span><br>Elections based on an occupational franchise. <br>The only good thing about the lords is its apolitical nature, because peers are appointed for life, they can be somewhat above petty party politics, so to preserve this we need a system of elections which avoid party politics.<br>Hence the vocational franchise, the idea of this is people would elect their politicians based not on where they live, but on what job they do. So doctors would vote in a healthcare franchise, bankers in a finance one etc. <br>This would help turn the House of Lords into a proper chamber of experts, chosen by experts","time":1490408540,"resto":118162648,"id":"atAtJdNP","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118172548,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)22:26:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Turkey<br>The biggest problem is islam and corruption.

Obviously right now I can&#039;t do shit, but if I had the power:<br> Abolish minimum wage laws;<br> Implement a flat tax with low income people paying 0% tax but everyone else paying a flat tax rate. I don&#039;t know what % would be appropriate but income and corporate tax should be the same with no deductions;<br> Tie NZ$ to gold standard;<br> Cut funding for obese maori sitting on their ass all day watching TV and eating McDonalds. They should have just enough money to survive but not enough to be comfortable. They need motivation to get a job.<br> That&#039;s just the start. I would want to eventually stop paying for healthcare for every dickhead who walks through the door and give more money to army so that when USA and Europe decide it&#039;s time to destroy Islam, NZ can help out.","filename":"1449224834152","ext":".jpg","w":247,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":101,"tim":1490409203292,"time":1490409203,"md5":"lQo5eAoUCwyUjB8+msJYIw==","fsize":12510,"resto":118162648,"id":"yUE62n2l","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"}]}

Three are suspected carcinogens, meaning they may be capable of causing cancer. Two of them, chemicals known by their bulky acronyms TDCIPP and TCEP, are listed by the state of California as carcinogens. The third, TCIPP, was found in dorms in double the median quantities found in other indoor environments. TCIPP hasn\u2019t been extensively studied, but chemicals it closely resembles in structure have toxic effects on brain cells in animals studies, and may lower thyroid levels and decrease sperm quality in humans.

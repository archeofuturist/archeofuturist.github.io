The chain of custody is sound, the story doesn&#039;t change over time.<br>2. There was stuff in the Bible that was later confirmed by archeology(places, people, chariots on the sea floor of the Red Sea (Moses parting the red sea), snakes used to have legs, etc.)<br>3. There are even non-believers&#039; accounts of some stuff Jesus did, just from them you can know a lot about Jesus if you piece it all together.<br>4. The differences between gospels aren&#039;t a bad sign, because witnesses rarely agree on stuff. If every eyewitness would say the same thing, it would be very fishy and would mean they probably talked to each other at one point.<br>5. The apostles died without getting rich, getting a girlfriend or getting power, they all died horribly. There was no point in spreading Christianity if they didn&#039;t believe in it. Why would they risk their life if it wasn&#039;t true? Why would they risk their life if it was all forged? Why would Paul try to join this new small church?","filename":"1492347699813","ext":".png","w":580,"h":606,"tn_w":239,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492793234298,"time":1492793234,"md5":"6Cf+ZzWEV+0Yh6Okdw57ng==","fsize":183296,"resto":0,"id":"c5M6mjI\/","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-can-atheists-ever-recover-protip-they-cant","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":2,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122155741,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)12:48:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122155622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122155622<\/a><br>Other videos:<br>New Testament Reliability:<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=rml<wbr>5Cif01g4 <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=WYE<wbr>zxD2kcGQ <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vCp<wbr>-ayAp7fE <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_l0<wbr>Say2wMw0 <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qId<wbr>CRanZZyw <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=cv6<wbr>JHGfB9Sk <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gld<wbr>vim1yjYM<br><br>Credit to based Polish anon I copied this from","filename":"1492347218236","ext":".jpg","w":829,"h":589,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":88,"tim":1492793304087,"time":1492793304,"md5":"JZezCErlBjcUyuH2pJ89gA==","fsize":94178,"resto":122155622,"id":"c5M6mjI\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122157273,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)13:04:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122155622\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122155622<\/a><br>Are you aware of what critical thought is?

This is almost a get threat at this point.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And yet this is not the state of any government on Earth...<\/span><br>what, then, is the purpose of government in your views then? I can agree with you that the current state of government is far from the idea but they do function to a degree. The fact that we are able to have a discussion about this confirms that the government does provide for its own citizens.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it only relies on men agreeing to mutually agreeable and beneficial behaviour<\/span><br>How many leaders have you seen attempt to gather people together for a common good. How many attempts in history have there been to create a utopia. My point is that men are simply too selfish, too greedy, to ever prevent anything like this from happening. From Caesar to Nobunaga, all attempts at unification have been ridden by backstabbing and powergrabbing. I have been saying this again and again that you can not just simply form a society with people who are completely selfless and do not place their own interests above the interests and wellbeing of others. People like that just simple do not exist.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Actually no, your thoughts and wills are a combination of the genetic...<\/span><br>why do counter culture movements happen?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Despite what pick-up artists will tell you...<\/span><br>humans are ruled by their emotions more than their logic. If all humans were logical, I would not place a shred of doubt in your society. Logically, your society is the perfect society and I see nothing wrong with it&#039;s construction. However, my argument is that since humans are not always logical, this can not happen. Again, if men were angels, then of course there would be no need for this farce of governance. However, we are not. We lie, we cheat, we steal, we lust. Even you can not admit to not succumbing to these things can you?<br><br>A perfect society with perfect people is, of course, a good desire. But we must take into account the flawed and illogical and emotional nature of humanity.","time":1493021649,"resto":122546119,"id":"OM7ppAwa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

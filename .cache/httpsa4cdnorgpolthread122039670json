They&#039;ll tell you it&#039;s about patriotism, democracy or some shit about the other guy hating our freedom. But you want to know what it&#039;s really about? What do you see? A kid from Arkansas doing his patriotic duty to defend his country? I see a helmet, fire-retardant gloves, body armor, and an M16. I see $17,500. That&#039;s what it costs to outfit one American soldier. Over two million soldiers fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. It cost the American taxpayer $4. 5 billion each year just to pay the air conditioning bills for those wars. And that&#039;s what war is really about, war is an economy. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either in on it or stupid.<\/span><br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NHO<wbr>g-lMPuaM","filename":"north korea","ext":".jpg","w":992,"h":558,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492720448834,"time":1492720448,"md5":"kGerSVDu67LPZQVsPf4BZg==","fsize":122385,"resto":0,"id":"M3yHgtMn","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-do-republicans-want-a-war-with-north-korea","country_name":"Canada","replies":11,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":122040014,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:36:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;North Koreans don&#039;t want war<\/span><br><br>kill your children and yourself","time":1492720584,"resto":122039670,"id":"hc4J+9B+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122040148,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:37:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122040014\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122040014<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;North Koreans want war<\/span><br>I hope you have cancer","time":1492720634,"resto":122039670,"id":"M3yHgtMn","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122040453,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:39:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122039670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122039670<\/a><br>Democrats do as well.","time":1492720771,"resto":122039670,"id":"l0kGHzMb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122040522,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:39:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122039670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122039670<\/a><br>Oh I don&#039;t know.<br>Could it be that North korea has threatened the world with Nuclear apocalypse for years?<br>Could it be that North korea has been proven to actually know how to develop nukes, so we have to take them out before they develop powerful enough nukes that could potentially completely wreck South korea and Japan?<br>Could it be because commies?<br>Could it be because North korea refuses to stop developing nuclear weapons?<br>Could it be because they want to reduce China&#039;s influence in the region?<br><br>Nah man, let&#039;s listen to a fat jew that made a movie about war profiteering.

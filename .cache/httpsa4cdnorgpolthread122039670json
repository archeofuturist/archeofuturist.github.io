They&#039;ll tell you it&#039;s about patriotism, democracy or some shit about the other guy hating our freedom. But you want to know what it&#039;s really about? What do you see? A kid from Arkansas doing his patriotic duty to defend his country? I see a helmet, fire-retardant gloves, body armor, and an M16. I see $17,500. That&#039;s what it costs to outfit one American soldier. Over two million soldiers fought in Iraq and Afghanistan. It cost the American taxpayer $4. 5 billion each year just to pay the air conditioning bills for those wars. And that&#039;s what war is really about, war is an economy.

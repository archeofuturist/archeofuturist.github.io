Quite a number of the ancient civilizations had stories of a flood that wound up dissapearing or got wiped out. Probably what happened to Atlantis and most of the Nephilim race. They angered God and he smited them. Ironically now is the next cycle once again, and do you think he is happy with the death of the Pacific ocean? I dont. This time will be by fire and thats probably contributed to the Nemesis cluster with Nibiru closing in. I used to question it untill I realized that it was the system itself concealing the truth.

In terms of &quot;proving&quot; God (as in how Richard Dawkins wants to prove him) you can&#039;t show anyone anything they don&#039;t want to believe in, and God is included in this explicitly in the Bible. Even if we take objective, worldy things like race and IQ disparities we literally see 90% of (white) people just scream racist at you and shove their fingers in their ears, and insist against mountains of evidence that it is not &quot;proven&quot;.

When I tried to make this on \/lit\/ it didn&#039;t go down so well. <br><br>I recently started Adolf Hitler&#039;s work Mein Kampf. Only about 25 pages in and he is making incredibly inciteful and true observations about the conditions of poor people and its effect on the health of society\/visa versa. Hitler&#039;s observations of the desolate in Vienna remain astoundingly relevant to modern situations, for example the cause of the perpetual brokeness of nogs in places like Detroit (outide of the main cause - inherent nogginess). <br><br>I find Hitler&#039;s writing stlye to be similar to my own ironically - but I wonder about the effect if translation on that aspect. My copy is an E book and was translated about a year prior to the start if WWII in 1938.","filename":"IMG_3414","ext":".jpg","w":635,"h":422,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493515620487,"time":1493515620,"md5":"pyWl1RuQb6\/R6wTy5JLdjQ==","fsize":50685,"resto":0,"id":"dKZEQdUi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-book-club","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":123415934,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)21:27:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123415855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123415855<\/a><br>reading is gay","time":1493515658,"resto":123415855,"id":"Oh4UBqQc","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123415995,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)21:28:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Listen to the audiobook if you don&#039;t have the time.<br><br>Alfred Rosenberg on the myth is one I want to read too","time":1493515684,"resto":123415855,"id":"nmkvA+ot","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":123416178,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)21:29:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"I was recommended these https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/The_T<wbr>hird_Reich_Trilogy","time":1493515773,"resto":123415855,"id":"h3NnV9Di","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":123416427,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)21:31:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123415855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123415855<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw too smart to read the opinions of others<\/span>","filename":"1405133515345","ext":".jpg","w":6408,"h":3040,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":59,"tim":1493515886827,"time":1493515886,"md5":"AoIJm7848ODZX+Xl32uHNQ==","fsize":3892068,"resto":123415855,"id":"Aa+tJ2uw","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123417581,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)21:40:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"One if my favorite passages from chapter II, although this translation is different in some waysbthan my eBook version, which has considerably more clear syntax and word usage that drives the point much more clearly.<br><br>In hardly any German city could the social question have been studied better than in Vienna. But make no mistake. This &#039;studying&#039; cannot be done from lofty heights. No one who has not been seized in the jaws of this murderous viper can know its poison fangs. Otherwise nothing results but superficial chatter and false sentimentality. Both are harmful. The former because it can never penetrate to the core of the problem, the latter because it passes it by. I do not know which is more terrible: inattention to social misery such as we see every day among the majority of those who have been favored by fortune or who have risen by their own efforts, or else the snobbish, or at times tactless and obtrusive, condescension of certain women of fashion in skirts or in trousers, who &#039; feel for the people.&#039; In any event, these gentry sin far more than their minds, devoid of all instinct, are capable of realizing. Consequently, and much to their own amazement, the result of their social &#039;efforts&#039; is always nil, frequently, in fact, an indignant rebuff, though this, of course, is passed off as a proof of the people&#039;s ingratitude.<br>Such minds are most reluctant to realize that social endeavor has nothing in common with this sort of thing; that above all it can raise no claim to gratitude, since its function is not to distribute favors but to restore rights.","time":1493516449,"resto":123415855,"id":"dKZEQdUi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

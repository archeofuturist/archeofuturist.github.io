I&#039;m paying for all the black and white copies I want, may as well use them. I&#039;ve planned two mock free speech rallies. They were mock because I invited no one and leaked the meeting time and dates only to the regressive\/left leaning\/feminist slanted clubs and groups. It was fucking beautiful to watch social engineering at work. The first group shows up expecting to protest, but simply by being the first group to show they&#039;re labelled the people hosting or attending the rally by the other groups that show up. After a little bit more than thirty minutes of squabbling (only one punch thrown sadly) they realize they were rused and disperse. The second one wasn&#039;t nearly as big, but there was a great shouting match between tumblr incarnate and a numale ally who was singled out because they thought he had fashy looking hair.<br><br>By the way feel free to copy this tactic, it&#039;s a riot if done right.","time":1492345443,"resto":121352321,"id":"cTaBwSMU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121353179,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)08:27:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121352321\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121352321<\/a><br>I just speak up in my classes.

The idea of a single world government or rather Order itself derives from the ancient Aryans. In both ancient Vedism and Zoroastrianism we see Aryans as the bringers of civilization, laws, technology, architecture and so forth. The goal was to heighten the spirit of all peoples, whether they were their peers or simple thinking natives, so that mankind would all share the same values (which were things typically found today in Christianity). This system of rule was also democratic. The Zoroastrians especially depicted a world in which a leader or a predetermined number of leaders would be elected by the people of the world. Of course, this assume that the entire world is comprised of people who are actively working on being good people. This leader[s] would then lead the world for a specific time until a new leader is elected.<br><br>This is the natural system for mankind if he is free from degeneracy, the majority of mental illness, corrupt political and religious systems, and etc. This is the same system the Jew is presently using, only in a corrupted or perverted form. The current system of Globalism is intended to place Israel is the seat of Kingship while the rest of the world is turned into Worker Nations, except America of course, who will be a &quot;privileged State.&quot; America will always serve as the muscle for the Jew.","time":1493071681,"resto":122644303,"id":"ZAf3oAl\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122646119,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)18:08:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122645207\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122645207<\/a><br>Lol<br><br>Middle East has been a backwards shithole for centuries<br><br>And Africa was never &quot;advanced&quot;","time":1493071729,"resto":122644303,"id":"HaY0PCIQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122646494,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)18:11:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122646119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122646119<\/a><br>They were lagging behind, yes, but they completely missed the industrial revolution train.","time":1493071894,"resto":122644303,"id":"mi0E05kS","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":122646719,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)18:13:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"world gov&#039;t you will have no freedom think the U a million times worse, I hope I die before it happens or die trying to stop it. we are on the way now","time":1493072000,"resto":122644303,"id":"A4V2NY0Z","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122646935,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)18:14:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122645168\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122645168<\/a><br>Someone should make his arm spin faster and faster until he helicopters away","time":1493072086,"resto":122644303,"id":"Cya+7H3H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122647013,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)18:15:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122646935\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122646935<\/a><br>lel","time":1493072119,"resto":122644303,"id":"ZAf3oAl\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Started with a woman who hurt her knee in a car accident. Three of us had hands on her in prayer and others were singing and everything crescendoed to this point where you could feel energy and the woman just starts smiling and we&#039;re like what&#039;s up, and she says she saw the car that hit her drive past her and then stood up and started dancing around. We were like wtf just happened, let&#039;s keep going. Had like 5 or so more people with joint pain come up and claim it was resolved. One of the more interesting afternoons of my life. I&#039;d known there was something more for a while before that, but that day really opened my eyes to the true power. Last summer saw an article about how to identify someone drowning and sent it to many people I know (which I never do). A few months later someone I sent the article to said they forwarded it to some people and one of the people to whom they forwarded it ended up saving a child drowning at a Chinese waterpark. Apparently the person credited the article for knowing what to do. Weird stuff like that. Feeling something and then acting on it and then seeing what happens.","time":1492214736,"resto":121128445,"id":"DX027UF4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121136661,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)20:06:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121135745\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121135745<\/a><br><br>Perfect I was trying to think of someone to say a prayer for before bed lol.

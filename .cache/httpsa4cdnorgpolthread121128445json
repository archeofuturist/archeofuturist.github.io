Last summer saw an article about how to identify someone drowning and sent it to many people I know (which I never do). A few months later someone I sent the article to said they forwarded it to some people and one of the people to whom they forwarded it ended up saving a child drowning at a Chinese waterpark.

Life was terrible, suicidial thoughts, suicide attempts, etc. My parents always knew something was wrong with me but didn&#039;t know what it was. I was in and out of mental institutions, diagnosed with depression and bipolar. After a pretty bad manic episode my dad took me to some spiritual healers where I found out I was demon possessed for most of my life. I got freed from bondage that day in the name of Jesus and it was pretty surreal because I could feel actual weight leave my body. Pretty crazy. After that experience I kept in contact with one of the people that helped me out. She has a unique spiritual gift. It was her that told my dad what his ex-wife had done to me. She never met them so her knowledge of the situation came from the supernatural. She once told me I was meant to have a sister but my dad&#039;s ex-wife put a curse on her in the womb and my mom miscarried. My parents never told me about this so I asked them about it and they were brought to tears. I imagine that was a tough time for both of them.

I&#039;ve always heard stories about miracles and whatnot, but I never witnessed one. Until that day. There was a site across the street, a close friend of my father bought it. He wanted to build up a lumber businnes there. Of course, they needed something to defend the wood they were storing there. And this &quot;something&quot; was a dog. Not too big, pretty small in fact, but it was agressive as it barked at everything and everyone. One day, me and my father went there for a little chit-chat. I asked about the dog&#039;s name. It was &quot;Laci&quot;. He asked me if I wanted to pet him. I said of course, but on the other hand, I was a little bit afraid (I was 11-12 at best at the time). As we walked up to the animal, I realized that I was standing on the dog&#039;s chain. I didn&#039;t know why was it important then, since my mind started arguing with itself on whether I should step down or should I stay on the chain. I mean, something like this? Why would something like this be that important for me? After that little argument in my head (which was no longer that 1 or 2 seconds), I finally came to the conclusion that I should release the poor animal. And then I heard a voice in my head saying &quot;Put it back down&quot;. Without hesitation, I put my feet down on the chain. I&#039;m still sure that this voice was my guardian angel. As I was petting the dog, suddenly, from the nowhere, it jumped into my face with open mouth. Only a few inches separated my face from the dog&#039;s jaws.

Prayers didn&#039;t do shit and chemotherapy turned him into a zombie who knew nothing but pain and being sick. One day, after smoking a joint, I thought to myself what if he took this? I imagined the smoke itself would be even worse for him so I gave him a vape pen with indica strain oil and he miraculously began a slow but steady recovery. His aches and pains eased off. He&#039;s no longer nauseous 24\/7. He began to develop an appetite again. He can actually sleep at night and has much better control of his bladder now too. Eventually I managed to ween him off the chemotherapy altogether and substitute it with the cannabis. He eventually passed away in his sleep after a few years, a peaceful death. A complete turnaround from a few years prior to that while he was on the chemotherapy. To me and my family, it was a miracle. Yet religious tards would ban this miracle medicine off the face of the Earth if they could.","time":1492224048,"resto":121128445,"id":"rfQTt32u","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121156702,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:42:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121156507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121156507<\/a><br>it&#039;s a conspiracy!","time":1492224139,"resto":121128445,"id":"0uhknGnP","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121156810,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:43:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s actually sad reading some of the shit here. most likely when people believe in god they&#039;ve had some sort of trauma in their lives and then rationalize their existence with God. <br><br>The human condition is a cruel joke.","time":1492224184,"resto":121128445,"id":"\/e8dgZ5Z","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121156911,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:43:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"let us pray and accept jesus as our savior","filename":"jesus","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":1166,"tn_w":85,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492224236977,"time":1492224236,"md5":"1H+q3vXhrzZ1uDEGVpN+xA==","fsize":97153,"resto":121128445,"id":"seq2CwRa","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121156934,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:44:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121156507\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121156507<\/a><br>It isn&#039;t even mentioned in the bible.

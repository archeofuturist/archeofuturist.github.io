Mahler was born a Jew but converted to Christianity and wrote about how he looked down upon his people in the city, wondering how he could be related to him. His music is part of the driving force from Beethoven through Wagner, pushing at the bounds of tonality. \/pol\/ derides anything that doesn&#039;t sound romantic as degenerate or decadent, when ironically the 2nd Viennese grew out of this impassioned boundary-pushing into complete destruction of tonality. Dissonance is not degenerate or inherently Jewish. Think of Charles Ives, who implored his audiences and performers to &quot;take their dissonance like a man&quot;, seeking to overcome the soft, effeminate reputation classical music had gained. Wagner was a force in his time that each and every composer had to face. Some rode and expanded upon his aims like Mahler or Strauss, but composers but others like Debussy rejected the paradigm and the imperatives of his directional music. What he did in his string quartet or the Prelude to the Afternoon of a Faun more directly led to tendencies in music that \/pol\/ would have a problem with, but Debussy is still a very skilled composer. It&#039;s all about integrity and ingenuity of construction.","time":1491019229,"resto":119136790,"id":"+XakbA9G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119141331,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:01:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Classical music.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Songs.<\/span><br>LMAO what a pleb.","time":1491019283,"resto":119136790,"id":"2cc0Ijxo","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":119141512,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:03:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Prokofiev&#039;s 2nd piano concerto is an absolute masterpiece.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1Kw<wbr>ajecmh2c&amp;t=7m20s<br><br>The cadenza in the first movement is just breathtaking","time":1491019395,"resto":119136790,"id":"Ivur+OLu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119141551,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:03:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119141255\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119141255<\/a><br>Meant to post this version, Bernstein really does kike it up as a conductor<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=3wT<wbr>V_ipt81g&amp;t=897s","time":1491019416,"resto":119136790,"id":"+XakbA9G","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119141769,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:05:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119141551\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119141551<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2nd Viennese<\/span><br>I walked past the maestro standing outside a Whole Foods in Newton once in his full length distressed brown leather overcoat and wild grey hair .. definitely a wow moment.","time":1491019553,"resto":119136790,"id":"Ppiuf3JG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119141949,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:07:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119140985\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119140985<\/a><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BRf<wbr>F7W4El60","time":1491019653,"resto":119136790,"id":"q+47\/NL8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119142079,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:08:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119141331\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119141331<\/a><br>you have a problem, bub?<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0qn<wbr>aPMx377g","time":1491019734,"resto":119136790,"id":"Ppiuf3JG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119142725,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:15:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119141769\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119141769<\/a><br>Ozawa?

But honestly anon a lot of classical music is very hard to listen to, much of it goes over my head and doesn&#039;t sound too good to me. I have always liked shorter, simpler, easier to swallow music, usually in major keys. So that&#039;s why I posted the Bach chorals, as they are good examples of these qualities. There are of course exceptions to this, sometimes I listen to some Debussy and Ravel, some Chopin etc. but even then I normally end up listening to their more conventional stuff.","time":1491020675,"resto":119136790,"id":"8AObVWim","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119143626,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:24:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw this music will be replaced by disgusting muslim chants<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JSA<wbr>d3NpDi6Q","filename":"1547017835342","ext":".png","w":205,"h":246,"tn_w":104,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491020683957,"time":1491020683,"md5":"OLtwWOnWl2C2SVG7lvVZpw==","fsize":8038,"resto":119136790,"id":"9QqX3ocn","country":"CR","country_name":"Costa Rica"},{"no":119143673,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:25:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119143082\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119143082<\/a><br>That&#039;s a good one.

But quite obviously this Keynsian economics &quot;safety net&quot; socialism experiment has been going on since after WWII. Not a long time in the grand scheme of things. <br><br>Social programs cost a lot more than they take in in tax revnue - for example if you added all the money you paid into a government pension program over the years it would not come close to covering the amount they agree to pay out to you as a senior. <br><br>In other words all government social programs are like ponzi schemes, taking new money from the new people to pay back the old people. In order for thsi system to sustain itself you need a constant INCREASE in the number of new people paying in becase as stated above the neew people dont ever pay enough to cover their future benefit. This is why immigration. They used to take europeans until they started doing the same scheme, then took chinese and asians here, and now are left taking massive amonts of africans and muslims, the lowest of all options. <br><br>In other words, soon there will be no new people left to bring in and social programs like health care, pension plans, and government retirement plans will collapse. They are a ponzi scehme and always need new investors.","filename":"meme usa nazi","ext":".png","w":460,"h":480,"tn_w":239,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492255717682,"time":1492255717,"md5":"pQMjvY1jJ77JVjd0OeP5jw==","fsize":86633,"resto":0,"id":"OghcdMZi","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-dont-you-retards-understand","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

All of that changed in the 1960s, which is not as long ago as it might seem. Once the student body (and the faculty) opened themselves up to minorities, it became very difficult to criticize them. That&#039;s because the real racists had pretty much used every excuse to keep the minorities out, so *any* criticism or pushback made it seem like you were on the racists&#039; side. As a consequence, the radicals saw an opportunity and gained a foothold. Right now you&#039;re beginning to see the pushback against the 60s-era radicals, because they&#039;re overreaching and starting to look stupid to the populace as a whole.<br><br>The hell of it is that &quot;diversity,&quot; in the uncorrupted meaning of the term, is a perfectly reasonable goal for a university to pursue.

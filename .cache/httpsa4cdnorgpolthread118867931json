The entire masonic thing with symbols is that they are useful for conveying complex ideas in a simple manner but the symbol should never become more important than what it symbolizes. <br><br>A great example of this could be say, muslims actually killing people for burning a quaran. Stupid, its just some paper and ink. Burning a quaran has no effect on the idea within it, god isnt injured because you burned a stupid book. <br><br>Not that we encourage blatant disrespect of symbols, its just that losing sight of what they are for causes problems and reduces true understanding. <br><br>Our symbols mostly exist as easy ways to remember complex ideas since most of what we do is verbatim from memory.","time":1490865214,"resto":118867931,"id":"TbYduAeW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118904778,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)05:18:07","name":"mecha -san","com":"<a href=\"#p118903838\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118903838<\/a><br>Were you the one asking about irradiated water a month or so ago?","time":1490865487,"resto":118867931,"id":"Z3s1rZSr","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118904869,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)05:19:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118867931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118867931<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Planet Earth<\/span><br>Nice try spherekike mason.","filename":"1488920712343","ext":".jpg","w":1642,"h":1282,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":97,"tim":1490865579070,"time":1490865579,"md5":"gAdPdj2bqJBl9Bh\/ofdIaw==","fsize":391664,"resto":118867931,"id":"inI5PjPG","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118905295,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)05:27:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Where did the Templars go? and did they find the holy grail?","time":1490866078,"resto":118867931,"id":"yfxLszAw","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"},{"no":118905445,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)05:30:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118904869\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118904869<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh atlas<\/span><br>Holding up the earth is easy when you&#039;re a giant in zero-g.

We were told by University officials not to have any meetings today. We were told not to wear letters and get away from campus. The whole time this was happening, university officials were sending messages to all students saying there was no ongoing threat to campus community. Various bomb threats were around campus, and someone was stabbed at 3:00 in West Campus, a very dense student living area. In the past weeks, a student resistance front has been vandalizing fraternity houses around campus with &quot;rapist&quot; and &quot;racist&quot; tags, as well as other stuff, pics are easily available online. In addition to several threats made online, RSF has vowed to hang fraternity members &quot;from their entrails&quot;. University and APD refuse to acknowledge a connection. Our Facebook has seen an uptick in views larger than any we&#039;ve seen in one day. I&#039;m not sure this is over, let&#039;s see if anything is left to happen.","filename":"Krombopulos","ext":".jpg","w":1037,"h":1170,"tn_w":221,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493700369869,"time":1493700369,"md5":"CjDaFNGyl0g7fSK8RL\/WZw==","fsize":402614,"resto":0,"id":"\/ZL6SrhB","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-am-an-executive-member-of-a-fraternity-at-ut-we","country_name":"United States","replies":29,"images":9,"unique_ips":24},{"no":123728457,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)00:48:57","name":"Sage","com":"<a href=\"#p123728183\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123728183<\/a><br><br>Here&#039;s the new &quot;campus wear&quot;.

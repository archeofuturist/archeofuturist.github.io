A 1-for-1. The Democrats, Comey, and everyone else know for a fact that Obama spied on Trump. The way they are trying to compensate for this is by blowing up the Russia story as much as they possibly can so that the general public is deceived into believing the spying was justified.<br><br>Overall, not even Comey wants to imprison a former President, it will completely destroy the Saint Obama narrative the news has been trying to run lately, and I&#039;m sure he&#039;s been convinced that it will overall look bad for the country and destroy the Democratic party as it will take a lot of people down around Obama as well. The Russia narrative was used as a bargaining chip.<br><br>So what will happen is that they will keep blowing up the Russia ties narrative to the point where it will look as if the spying was justified, even though every single thing the Dems and their propaganda arms have released has been debunked and had holes blown into by real investigative journalists, both BernieBro anti-corruption ones and Breitbart ones. <br><br>It will then come out that there was nothing found whatsoever to tie Trump to Russia and there&#039;s nothing to say that Russia actually meddled in the election, but because of all the &quot;smoke&quot; they&#039;ve been trying to show, it was A-OK that the Obama admin tapped Trump.<br><br>The Russia narrative is because the Democrat-controlled deep state wanted to go to war with Russia for a long time due to friction in Syria, the fact that Assad is still above dirt and breathing and Obama&#039;s JV team ISIS recently admitted defeat, and the fact that Iran is the next target on the list, a Russian ally. They wanted to prep the American people and indoctrinate them against Russia in case Russia does not stand for Iran being toppled and sends troops there to defend the country. <br><br>The deep state, for the next 4 years, will continue to attempt to paint Russia with a bad brush (cont&#039;d)","filename":"IovhWYs","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":321,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":126,"tim":1490235626854,"time":1490235626,"md5":"hZaDGy7e2fSR1sOCXRzDVA==","fsize":58414,"resto":0,"id":"r7IJJqcK","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"1-for-1-analysis-for-the-past-few-weeksmonths-of","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":0,"unique_ips":7},{"no":117871611,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)22:20:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"hoping that they can discredit the entire Republican party and news organizations by pushing a narrative that they&#039;re &quot;working for Putin.&quot; They&#039;ll come out with &quot;op-eds&quot; explaining why Russia is oh-so-bad periodically for the next 4 years. This is all in hopes that they win back the Presidency in 2020 and then they will go to war in Iran and possibly against Russia.<br><br>The entire ruse we&#039;ve been seeing the past few weeks \/ months is for 2 reasons -- Russia is extremely convenient as a scapegoat due to our geopolitical opposition to them, they&#039;re big enough to make ignorant Americans scared so the fear mongering works perfectly. <br><br>Trump and team know this, and are trying to figure out a way to work with Russia but since this narrative is being pushed, it&#039;ll make anything Trump does look as though he&#039;s working for Putin. It puts him in a very tough spot. If Americans could only wake up, study the actual issue, study Russia, learn their history about Crimea, the ruse would not work at all, but we all know Americans won&#039;t be doing this.<br><br>Trump will not be impeached and no one under the Obama administration will get prosecuted. It will be a 1-for-1 trade, but the Dems still have the advantage after this. If the Democrats win in 2020 or possibly even 2024, prepare yourselves America, you&#039;re going to war. If other countries join in the fray, like China for example, and side with Russia, the draft will likely be reinstated, and every single one of these liberal snowflakes will be regretting their every word and decision that they made over the past 8 years when they get that letter \/ e-mail telling them their camp date.","time":1490235647,"resto":117871563,"id":"r7IJJqcK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117872630,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)22:28:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117871563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117871563<\/a><br>Plausible, but I&#039;m not sure these people are smart enough to think of this plan.

However you must also add that the Neocons, not just the Dems, have been pushing for this iraq-libya-syria-somalia-sudan-yeme<wbr>n-iran plan for decades. This also explains why many Neocons are fighting Trump. <br><br>The war with Iran and Russia is not the end but the means to an end: a de-facto one world government run by secret, unelected councils. The beginning of this war will be used as an excuse to expand the police state, make the constitution irrelevant through obscure laws that are many hundreds of pages long, and round up political dissidents. A similar thing will happen throughout NATO, probably before the US, like beta testing. I suspect this war will be more of a coordinated depopulation program than an actual honest war.","time":1490236992,"resto":117871563,"id":"ET6H3IXp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117874712,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)22:44:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117871563\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117871563<\/a><br>thanks anon, stuff like this is why i \/pol\/","time":1490237065,"resto":117871563,"id":"x2T85UUv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117874715,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)22:44:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117872630\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117872630<\/a><br><br>They are only smart when it comes to jewing and being evil cunts.

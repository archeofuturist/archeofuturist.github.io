BBC\/CNN report on gas attack in Syria. Blame Russians.<br>5. It wasn&#039;t the Russians<br>6. Nikki Haley, neocon GOPe, goes to UN to gin up a coalition.<br>7. At the same time, Trump is speaking to leaders the Obama administration refused to deal with. Press is barely covering. Meeting with China right now.<br>8. Russia and China are on the security council, and can veto any resolution<br>9. CNN starts reporting that Bannon is on the outs.<br>10. Ben Carson just uncovered massive fraud in HUD, that went completely uncovered.<br>11. Congressional Ethics committees are busy on a Russian witch hunt.<br><br>You all better be ready for some serious whiplash. Read your Art of War.

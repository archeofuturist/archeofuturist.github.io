You guys don&#039;t realize how important it is to call in and voice your concern over this. I&#039;ve attended meetings with various congressmen discussing how they HAVE to vote against their principles due to mass outcries from their constituency.<br><br>You don&#039;t want us fighting Assad? CALL YOUR FUCKING CONGRESSMAN. Pick up your phone. Right now. It takes THREE minutes.<br><br>&quot;Hello, my name is ________. I am a strong supporter of Donald Trump. Over a 511-day election season, he has repeatedly promised no more foreign intervention, and he has promised to cooperate with Russia to take on ISIS. Now, there are rumors - unfounded rumors, but rumors nonetheless - that he is considering to intervene in Syria. I did NOT vote for this, my family did NOT vote for this, and should this happen, we will NOT be voting for the Republican Party during the midterm elections OR the presidential election of 2020.&quot;<br><br>IT TAKES FIVE MINUTES.

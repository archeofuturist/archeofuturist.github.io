Perhaps they realized that sperging out on neighbors and going full total war mode wasn&#039;t going to end well (we know it didn&#039;t), and retreated in the best way possible, ensuring they would stay outside of the Russian sphere of influence and that they wouldn&#039;t get cucked as hard as Germany did (and does to this day).

Folks were talking about how to get new flag and or fuck his shit up.<br>Folks debated on his ability to use shotgun.<br><br>Just my 48 cents here buuuttt...<br>1. It&#039;s a shotgun <br>2. He&#039;s probably had some normie fuckin training on basics of said gun at purchase.<br>3. If it&#039;s loaded with bird shot or buck shot makes a world of a difference.

He&#039;s at a full raging hemorrhoids level of butthurt and embarrassment. And paranoid to shit.<br>5. He does have money.

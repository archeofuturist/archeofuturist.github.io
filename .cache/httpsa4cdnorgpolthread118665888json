Rep. Gowdy will apparently now, in a closed door hearing, ask Director Comey AGAIN about if he ever briefed then President Obama on the findings of the electronic surveillance.<br><br>2) Chairman Nunes seems to have found more information that multiple citizens rights have been violated by Obama Administration officials via intelligence investigations started during the Administration, and Nunes has the power to start a separate investigation about this.<br><br>3) Also, Senator Chuck is apparently now &#039;loosing it&#039; in public. It is reported that he went on a public rant on an older prominent Democrat couple in a NYC restaurant because she voted for Trump. It is said that after yelling at them in the restaurant he then followed them out on the sidewalk shouting... &quot;How could you vote for him? He&#039;s a liar&#039; he&#039;s a liar...&quot; Amazing that this is the most powerful sitting Democrat in Washington, DC ! http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/poli...<br>http:\/\/pagesix.com\/2017\/03\/...<br><br>4) This also, apparently the Russians are getting sick of the baseless accusations that their Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Maria Zakharova said Russia may \u201cpublish leaks\u201d about \u201csecrets\u201d the Obama administration asked the Russian government to keep private.<br><br>It doesn&#039;t seem like the Democrats are managing their psychosis very well... and its only day 65 of their new reality !","time":1490719789,"resto":118665888,"id":"cb4BZNw2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118667729,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)12:50:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118667400\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118667400<\/a><br>He&#039;s doing exactly what I elected him to do.

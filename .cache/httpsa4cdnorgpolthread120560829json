But lately I\u2019ve been puzzled by the new slurs directed at me by some of the latter. Many I didn\u2019t even understand, so I did some digging.<br>Apparently, tried-and-true insults such as \u201cfag,\u201d \u201cfairy,\u201d \u201ckike\u201d and \u201chebe\u201d (yes, I\u2019m Jewish) are old-school, especially among the alt-right. That small, far-right movement that seeks a whites-only state is developing new coded language, much as the Nazis once did, says noted linguist George Lakoff, a professor emeritus at the University of California at Berkeley.<br><br>\u25cf Snowflake. This is no compliment, even if you like to think that you\u2019re one of a kind. At best, it\u2019s a derisive term for someone considered entitled, which to those using it includes people of color, LGBT folks, students \u2014 even Meryl Streep for her pro-kindness stance at the Golden Globes. Sarah McBride of the Human Rights Campaign told me that it\u2019s often used against LGBT people in reference \u201cto pronoun usage, particularly nonbinary pronoun use, and the efforts on college campuses to be more aware and affirming of people\u2019s pronouns.\u201d Used in a sentence, via Urban Dictionary: \u201cHey snowflake, Trump won, deal with it.\u201d With one word you\u2019re dismissed as weak, feminine, juvenile \u2014 a loser.<br><br>\u25cf Libtard. \u201cLib\u201d is for \u201cliberal,\u201d while \u201ctard\u201d is shorthand for \u201cretard.\u201d Bingo! If you\u2019re two thumbs down on political correctness, then what better insult than this combination? It even allows a bonus zing at folks with special needs.<br><br>-<br>Pic Unrelated","filename":"spanking2","ext":".jpg","w":647,"h":716,"tn_w":225,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491889511120,"time":1491889511,"md5":"A0VOYCv5O71nOZe7Ya5v3w==","fsize":153790,"resto":0,"id":"79YlOZd+","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"inside-the-coded-language-of-the-altright","country_name":"United States","replies":26,"images":10,"unique_ips":14},{"no":120560859,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)01:45:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120560829\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120560829<\/a><br>\u25cf Cuck. I heard this one while watching Bill Maher\u2019s HBO show several weeks ago. One of his guests kept using it. It\u2019s short for \u201ccuckservative,\u201d which is a word cocktail made up of equal parts \u201cconservative\u201d and \u201ccuckold.\u201d Urban Dictionary defines it as \u201ca racial slur for a White person that is not loyal to White Supremacy\u201d and offers this sample of use in a sentence: \u201cJeb is such a cuck.\u201d<br><br>\u25cf Masculinist. I\u2019m an out and proud feminist, but I\u2019d never heard of \u201cmasculinist.\u201d According to Merriam-Webster, it\u2019s \u201can advocate of male superiority or dominance\u201d and is often used to promote traditional gender roles. The Oxford Dictionaries use it this way, in reference to the 1990s: \u201cThe newly unified German parliament replicated the same masculinist pattern, celebrating its debut with less than 10 percent women representatives.\u201d That\u2019s the same as in pre-World War II Germany \u2014 and there\u2019s that Nazi thing again.<br>Bottom line: It pays to increase your word power these days. There\u2019s much more to alt-right coded language than meets the eye \u2013 or the ear. \u201cSteven Petrow is a Social Justice Warrior, a public predator, a devotee of political correctness, and happy to tar and feather others with false accusations.\u201d If they say it often enough, you might believe it, and then you might not believe anything I write or say.

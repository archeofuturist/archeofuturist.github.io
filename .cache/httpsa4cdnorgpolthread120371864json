End drug trade, and decrease homosexuality prevalence.<br>2. Gayness means that the man will not have children and thus be of no use to the future of their humanity. Its white genocide.<br>3. Bisexuality is hated and discouraged because they have breeding potential. Indeed women are attracted to bisexual men too, and would love to return a man to the sex and\/or marriage market. <br>4. Gay lifestyle has increased as a result of the decline of the quality of women post feminism. Its also the result of declining dowry customs for marriage.<br>5.

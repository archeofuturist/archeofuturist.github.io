I read a good summary of why the leaks happening are Really fucked up. So it goes something like this: Obama Admin this info be declassified or classified lower so that more people could get access to it (including (((leakers)))). But that by itself is catch-22. Any information gathered from these special warrants HAVE to be vital security information to be retained otherwise it has to be discarded. The obama admin kept trying until they get an unrelated FISA warrant (because the direct wouldnn&#039;t work) and used that as an excuse for overreaching survelliance that exceeded orginal bounds by far (and focused on Trump by recording incidentally). After collecting and keeping all these broad ranging incidental recordings and data (which never should have happened) they pushed to get it declassified as it was not vital\/important (but only vital\/important data can be kept).

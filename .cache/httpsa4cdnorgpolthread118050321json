And I fear just like the horse fuckers over on \/mlp\/ we&#039;re going to see a decline in our population as idiots who believe they&#039;re in good company take to the real world and create an awkward autistic stereo type for us. Just like with atheism people who claim to be atheist now the first thing people jump to is &quot;My own intelligence makes me euphoric&quot; and I fear it&#039;s going to happen here too weather we like it or not the stereo type of autistic edgy kids will be there and it&#039;ll only gain momentum as the left kicks out against us grabbing at anything they can.

We&#039;re under 50% participation since 1999 and in 2014 it was 42% of voters.<br><br>The reason is quite simple; people are feeling disenfranchised and unengaged by these elections. Because they are. By design each country only gets to elect a handful of people and thus the influence of a country like Sweden can never be more than pissing in the wind. We have ZERO chance to move the needle against the will of France and Germany. It&#039;s like voting for president in a US state election where a solid majority of the electorate wants something you don&#039;t. It&#039;s pointless, and thus people don&#039;t vote.<br><br>Again, this is by design, it&#039;s not a fluke.<br><br>Democracy works less well the bigger it gets. The reason is just mathematical. In a room with 10 voters your vote is worth 1\/10th of the result. In 2014 we had about 7 million eligible voters here. That means for the general your vote is worth 1\/7million. This is why local political engagement is always more effective than trying to sway the national elections. In the EU, well you do the math this time.<br><br>Once you get your cronies on the inside nobody seems to know who sets the agenda. You have strong political players moving the EU army agenda forward, but a vast majority of all individual countries polled do not want this. <br>Claiming the will of the people is represented when the disparity between what the people want and what the elites are doing is high is exactly why we&#039;re swimming in &quot;populist&quot; parties on the national level.<br><br>And make no mistake, the revival of national identity with that populism is speaking the public&#039;s mind on the EU as well.","filename":"In Your Face Whitey","ext":".png","w":1402,"h":896,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":79,"tim":1491780767932,"time":1491780767,"md5":"UQHUfUuY7SbkN3Ja8lBNKg==","fsize":2314482,"resto":120343341,"id":"IfwWKdM3","country":"SE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120356580,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)19:32:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;m a identitarian, and I don&#039;t know if I&#039;ll even vote Le Pen...<br><br>She&#039;s kinda fucked, and has no chance of winning in the second round.

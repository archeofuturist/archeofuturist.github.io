One thing I have to admit I never really connected to is the idea of charity or service -- NOT because I lack empathy, but rather because it seemed almost strange to me to focus on, say, feeding a homeless person, when there are all these other problems that are &quot;closer&quot; to me that need fixing -- helping the people in my own life with their struggles, illnesses, grief, etc., being a better person for my family, and that sort of thing. It almost seemed arbitrary to think of going out and putting my energy toward a problem removed from my own life when there&#039;s always so much &quot;at home&quot; that needs that kind of care. <br><br>Today, however, it struck me in a new way. As I look at the world around me, I can&#039;t help but feel that humanity is an unsolvable problem. I&#039;m sure I don&#039;t need to elaborate on what I mean by that. So I&#039;m suddenly seeing this call to service as an answer to that. It&#039;s unsolvable at the macro level, but as an individual, I can spread truth, mercy, and grace wherever I go, and there is no place that doesn&#039;t need those things, and that is what saves us, in a way, because the world will never be &quot;saved&quot; in the way we want it to be.<br><br>I&#039;d be curious to hear what other Christians think. It&#039;s been a tricky subject for me, as I don&#039;t wish to enable addicts, for example, or to misspend resources.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 kike on a stick<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 cucktianity is cucked<\/span>","filename":"1492025852917","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":1189,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":232,"tim":1492060646352,"time":1492060646,"md5":"T5vHiYdBAvzZKqybJ0QX4w==","fsize":559847,"resto":0,"id":"DJ+09OZD","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"serving-others-in-christ","country_name":"United States","replies":279,"images":33,"unique_ips":61,"tail_size":50},{"no":120872083,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)01:22:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"not &quot;unsolvable on a macro level&quot;... you just need to re-imagine Christ as a guerilla war chief directing his Nation\/Tribe in a long, pitched memetic battle against sin and death, with all signs pointing to defeat.<br><br>And then remember that happened last time, too.","time":1492060922,"resto":120871685,"id":"IfXrIZEP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120872164,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)01:22:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"Not a christcuck but heres my 2 cents.

It was formed roughly 500 years before the Jews stopped worshiping clay and bronze idols. While the Jews were in Babylonian captivity they intermingled with Zoroastrians and learned their philosophy. Those who would become the first Jewish priests co-opted or stole the core ideas of Zoroastrianism and began worshiping a single god. The god they chose to worship was YHVH, who prior was a god of war, and just one of the many gods the ancient Hebrews worshiped.

He was killed when his teachings became too popular and threatened the Pharisee.<\/span><br>Jesus taught something other than Judaism. Jesus even contradicted Judaism at times. For example, Jesus said: &quot;You have heard it said, &#039;Eye for an eye, tooth for tooth&#039; but I say to turn your cheek.&quot; Eye for an eye is an Old Testament commandment God gave to the Jews, and here he completely goes against it. So what was Jesus teaching? Zoroastrianism. And there&#039;s evidence of this in Scripture. When Jesus was on the cross next to the two thieves, he said to the repentant thief: &quot;Today you will be with me in paradise.&quot; (Luke 23:43). What&#039;s interesting here is that the Jews do not view the afterlife or &quot;Heaven&quot; to be like a paradise. The Jews believe when you die you go to Sheol - a place of darkness that exists literally in the ground. Jesus was revolutionary when he taught about Heaven. So what about &quot;paradise?&quot; The word originates in the Avestan language, which happens to be the holy language Zoroaster used when he wrote the Avesta (basically the Bible of Zoroastrianism). During his final moments, Jesus used an Aryan word to describe a Zoroastrian Heaven.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Jesus&#039; teachings are only useful to the Jew who seeks reformation and the non-Jewish degenerate who seeks salvation for his\/her past ways. Jesus&#039; teachings and the religion based around them are not useful for Aryans, because we do not possess the inherent character flaws the Jew possesses, and of which he needs saving from.<\/span><br>You can argue against this, but Aryans aren&#039;t naturally evil, unlike the Jew and others. We created civilization and discovered the Science -- we could have enslaved the entire world how many times over? But we didn&#039;t. And yet here the Jew is trying. There is nothing about the Aryan that he\/she can&#039;t correct through focused effort, but the Jew is flawed by nature.

Being a part of the Body of Christ means sharing in His life, like all the parts of my body live by my one life. Christ&#039;s divine life consists in God&#039;s knowledge and love of Himself. Therefore being part of Christ&#039;s body is a sharing in that love. God&#039;s love for Himself is also the reason He created anything, out of a pure desire that His Goodness be good for more and more beings. By that very same love, which we share in, God also sustains in being all He has made. So in sharing Christ&#039;s life, we share in His life-giving, creative love for everything in the whole universe.<br><br>Have a good Holy Week and a happy Easter, bro.","time":1492066310,"resto":120871685,"id":"45EdyC3e","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120880324,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)02:52:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120879389\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120879389<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I create make good and I create evil.<\/span><br><br>it is clear from the context, that the reference is too calamity, (which it sometimes is translated as) i.e. plague, earthquakes, what not, not moral evil. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1<\/span><br>Evil according to the Zoroastrian tradition which actually coined the very concept of &quot;evil&quot; or<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2<\/span><br>Evil according to Judaism\/Christianity<br><br>i contrasted both.","time":1492066323,"resto":120871685,"id":"3FeoSkUA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120880504,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)02:53:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120880324\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120880324<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;muh context<\/span><br><br>like debating a Muslim...","filename":"MUSLIM DEBATE","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":1200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492066433121,"time":1492066433,"md5":"x76zxy5E\/Dw1s0a87NO0cQ==","fsize":210533,"resto":120871685,"id":"LghsSpEo","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120880544,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)02:54:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120880300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120880300<\/a><br><br>Resurrection =\/= Disembodied Platonic Soul Magic Harp Party","time":1492066457,"resto":120871685,"id":"IfXrIZEP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120880546,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)02:54:19","name":"Praceteom","com":"<a href=\"#p120871685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120871685<\/a><br>Christians aren&#039;t utilitarians.<br>Avoid sin and seek to be as good as you&#039;re able in your own life.<br>There is no principle of &quot;good maximization&quot; in Christianity.

Certainly Christians who have died currently have no bodies, and therefore can&#039;t strictly speaking be in a place. Their immortal souls do however still exist, and from the parable of the rich man and Lazarus we can be pretty sure they have some kind of experience, whether of blessedness or of torment. The Catholic explanation for how that happens is called supplied imagination, I think. Without explaining all of Aristotelian psychology, the idea is that the only operation of the human soul which doesn&#039;t require a bodily organ is knowing. However, in order to know anything you need either sensation or an imagination in which to know it. That&#039;s why you don&#039;t go on actively considering everything you&#039;ve ever learned while you&#039;re asleep, because the parts of your brain that produce the necessary imaginations aren&#039;t engaged. So, if God either miraculously supplies the separated soul with a substitute for sensation or imagination, that soul can know things by its own power in those provided images. And if God directly informs the intellects of the blessed with His Own Essence, they don&#039;t even need supplied imagination, at least to know Him. I think.

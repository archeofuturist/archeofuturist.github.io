My great grandfather was the last of my quite obviously Irish name who was born and raised in Ireland, and since then we&#039;ve degenerated into your standard Canadian-irish scum strewn about the sleepy towns of Ontario.<br><br>Would it be right to bring my name back to Ireland? Move there and keep my heritage pure? Because of my mother&#039;s side I&#039;m sort of a UK mutt, (English and Scottish), but I still keep my father&#039;s last name. I&#039;ve got no accent though, maybe just travel there for schooling to see what it&#039;s like? Maybe it&#039;s a shithole and my offspring would be better of elsewhere.<br><br>Am I delusional or am I not wrong for thinking I should&#039;ve been raised where those before me were too? Irish flags are heavily welcomed in the thread, and I want honest opinions on whether or not I&#039;m a total fag.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pic related, reading right now<\/span>","filename":"IMG_20170412_215608","ext":".jpg","w":2992,"h":4000,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492059953568,"time":1492059953,"md5":"QeqdlbQJKwHzOke5d+FSog==","fsize":3448746,"resto":0,"id":"f0\/I75\/2","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"should-i-bring-my-family-back-into-ireland","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

Does it still exist? Plenty of reasons it doesn&#039;t, and the advantage is overwhelmingly Russian:<br>1) Intermediate and Short ranged cruise missiles are Russia&#039;s specialty. They have the Kh102 and the Iskander. Iskanders were moved to Kaliningrad, effectively breaking a treaty no one gave a fuck about, which allows Russia to neutralize Poland. The Kh102 has a range of 2700nm and carries a 450kt warhead.<br><br>Cruise missiles are hardest to detect because they are smaller than an aircraft overall, and can fly on &quot;smart&quot; low-low trajectories reducing the signal horizon for an active search radar. They&#039;re called smart because some systems like the German Taurus will use mountains for cover during cruise phase and passive countermeasures.<br><br>2) The Russians experimented with plasma to block radar waves. It essentially means radar, all meaningful air detection, is useless. There are two ways to do that. Either by flying at high altitude and using the open plasma method, which uses enormous amounts of energy and the altitude has to remain very high OR radome. Problem with radoming is that signals can&#039;t come into the plasma radome,but signals can&#039;t leave. So when Russians put plasma radomes over their engines it&#039;s fine, but putting them over the radar transmitter could cause problems transmitting signals,as it blocks ones own emissions. But they figured it out. IDK how, but they did. They can effectively travel almost completely invisible at strategic ranges. They said it was for space travel, but obviously it has a military use (piercing plasma with radar emissions). <br><br>There is no mad anymore.","filename":"1441362_610321432357823_1442875119_n","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":398,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":99,"tim":1491578429522,"time":1491578429,"md5":"5uEmYqHUY6VgiZ0wwpNsFQ==","fsize":28913,"resto":119946424,"id":"YoHk8nN\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119965010,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)11:20:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119964574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119964574<\/a><br><br>No problem man.<br><br>I happen to work for an NGO that is contracted out to work on this kind of stuff.<br><br>Nothing secret squirrel, mainly just publicly available information and numbers crunching. <br><br>We work closely with a lot of non-proliferation guys but we also work with the US federal government and the British government.","time":1491578442,"resto":119946424,"id":"NPiBiVaq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119965603,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)11:24:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119964950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119964950<\/a><br><br>Look at this jackass.<br><br>You&#039;re wrong, but I don&#039;t plan on going into how wrong you are.<br><br><a href=\"#p119964574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119964574<\/a><br><br>Also, if you want to know anything else, just go to \/k\/ and ask about Oppenheimer and ask if anyone has some of my old archived threads.

You then said that proves nothing because that wasn&#039;t us testing an interceptor. I then provided multiple articles showing every GMD test from &#039;99-&#039;16, and another article showing that we are planning on doing another test next month. How is that not proving you wrong? I have provided proof as to why you are wrong on every single instance.<\/span><br><br>You said we do it all the time. The article above says that it&#039;s only been physically simulated (a complete simulation) only once.

The missiles have a range of 2700 nautical miles. <br><br>These missiles AND the bombers may very likely have plasma radome technology for enhanced stealth.

Kh101&#039;s (the non-nuclear variant) are designed to knockout hardened silo&#039;s if they have to. Kh102&#039;s are purpose designed for strategic attacks.","filename":"arguing with pigeons","ext":".jpg","w":403,"h":470,"tn_w":107,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491584829451,"time":1491584829,"md5":"MakxxszCCfBBlQ3eHWzjfA==","fsize":39065,"resto":119946424,"id":"YoHk8nN\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119983815,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)13:11:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119981859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119981859<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Strategic bombing does not win wars.<\/span><br><br>Sounds like you&#039;re a fan of the Anglo-American air force leadership of ww2. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Unfortunately you don&#039;t have enough weapons to kill an entire country.<\/span><br><br>Are you kidding?

Croydon Crown Court after being found guilty of rape and two counts of sexual assault by penetration.<br><br>He told his victim that her mother would die if she told anyone about what was happening to her.<br><br>Police fear that he may have more victims and are appealing for them to come forward.<br><br>Met PC Laura Davis said: \u2018Ablorh\u2019s crimes were despicable. He singled out the victim before launching his attack. It was clearly the most horrible and terrifying experience for her, a girl of just five years old.<br><br>\u2018There is every chance Ablorh has abused more children who have yet to come forward. We would appeal for anyone with information to contact us in confidence.\u2019<br><br>The girl was raped after Ablorh befriended the girl\u2019s mother and worked hard to build up their trust under a false name of Eugene.<br><br>He would take the girl, who referred to him as Uncle John, to a park and take pictures of her to send back to the girl\u2019s mother to reassure her that everything was okay.<br><br>He then took the girl to rape her in the outhouse he was renting in a garden where he lived in Collyer Avenue, Croydon.<br><br>Eventually, after two years, Ablorh drifted out of the family and the girl was finally able to tell her mother what had happened.<br><br>Scotland Yard said she cried throughout her interviews as she told them what had happened.<br><br>Ablorh went off the radar but police eventually tracked him down after he was spotted on New Year\u2019s Eve outside a church in Croydon.<br><br>He was charged with two counts of rape and three counts of sexual assault by penetration.<br><br>He denied what happened, meaning that the girl, now eight, had to give evidence via video link.<br><br>The jury found Ablorh guilty of three offences and acquitted him of two..","filename":"ffwqafqw","ext":".jpg","w":748,"h":607,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":101,"tim":1493438957219,"time":1493438957,"md5":"BVZn\/V9zWwEUAxjKxiN\/dg==","fsize":69873,"resto":123274236,"id":"iUakmeuL","country":"GB","country_name":"United

The usual bait to goad someone into becoming a vegan is someone moral grandstanding about animal rights. Originally the original entity had to do that, but he doesn&#039;t need to appear anymore because veganism begets veganism. Vegan diets heavily malnourish their users, and like starving medieval peasants, prevents them from having any energy or any time to do anything intellectual. The important thing about vegans is they are stuck only able to do their daily routine and aggressively defend their veganist ideals against any of those who would criticize it. Being stuck in this cycle prevents them from doing anything intelligent. If they weren&#039;t vegans they could potentially use that demonstrated vegan zeal to be an activist for something that&#039;s actually important.","filename":"magatfh","ext":".png","w":548,"h":653,"tn_w":209,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490847499974,"time":1490847499,"md5":"WAOmXeOpT1kmiNQTb5xPaA==","fsize":463566,"resto":0,"id":"ZV1JfYII","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"veganism-is-mind-control","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

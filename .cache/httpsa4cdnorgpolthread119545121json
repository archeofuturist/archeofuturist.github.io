Military gives good benefits in the long run and a decent payscale from year to year. But on the other hand, when you join the military, they basically own your ass for however long you&#039;re signing up for. It&#039;s not like a typical job where you can just clock in your 40 hours a week and be done with it. They want you doing PT in the morning with the grunts? Gotta do it. They want you working these extra days? Gotta do it. They want you to pack up all your shit and move halfway across the country (possibly uprooting your family as well)? Gotta do it. You do what they say. You work when they say. You go where they say. You cut your hair like they say.

What they have in common is they use superheroes or popular characters like peppa or spongebob, they involve fighting, shitting, farting and killing, they have tens of millions of views and thousands of automatically generated comments and responses. I tried to dig deeper but couldn&#039;t really find anything substantial on this topic... this stuff is really worrying. I think they are trying to confuse childrens&#039; brains with this bullshit or something.. hope you could help me out here and share your thoughts or knowledge on this.<br><br>Examples:<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=E0Y<wbr>-3lK1Ak8<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_81<wbr>JoYTeFnU&amp;t=327s<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=pCA<wbr>FG-DIc6M","filename":"don&#039;t call us bossy merchant happy","ext":".gif","w":490,"h":534,"tn_w":229,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492814623350,"time":1492814623,"md5":"1IGcUNeBB0bciAstZm3n4g==","fsize":312283,"resto":0,"id":"FoxaB9YS","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"jewtube-is-poisoning-childrens-brains","country_name":"Germany","replies":285,"images":44,"unique_ips":159,"tail_size":50},{"no":122197668,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:48:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122197149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122197149<\/a><br>I fucking hate bossy women.","time":1492814912,"resto":122197149,"id":"p3qzgqXY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122197767,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:49:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"PIZZAGATE CONFIRMED","time":1492814966,"resto":122197149,"id":"KcHIn66c","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":122197876,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:50:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122197767\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122197767<\/a><br>lo \u00fanico que encontr\u00e9 fue este articulo:<br><br>https:\/\/magnet.xataka.com\/why-so-se<wbr>rious\/este-es-posiblemente-el-rinco<wbr>n-mas-oscuro-y-siniestro-de-todo-yo<wbr>utube-y-esta-dirigido-a-ninos","time":1492815033,"resto":122197149,"id":"FoxaB9YS","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":122197937,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:51:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122197149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122197149<\/a><br>My first instinct says they&#039;re just baiting for partnership\/ad shekels but yeah that is pretty creepy","time":1492815065,"resto":122197149,"id":"z+TqH\/Lo","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122197965,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:51:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122197149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122197149<\/a><br>Boi Pussy = Bossy","time":1492815085,"resto":122197149,"id":"fQ43IYxc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122198051,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:52:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122197149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122197149<\/a><br>Fuck off you bossy cunts.","time":1492815130,"resto":122197149,"id":"Q1+gPqPt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122198059,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:52:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122197149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122197149<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the bossy shit again<\/span><br>No paid attention to this when they tried it a couple years ago either.","time":1492815134,"resto":122197149,"id":"mhELUlvw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122198314,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:54:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"I call children unfuckable cunts and their parents get mad for some reason...","filename":"1346871093614","ext":".png","w":511,"h":511,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492815262003,"time":1492815262,"md5":"\/xVO6aLX12GYSSUCUWuZ1A==","fsize":136507,"resto":122197149,"id":"MPR9hbfq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122198331,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)18:54:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122197149\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122197149<\/a><br><br>All of the comments\/views appear to be bots as well.

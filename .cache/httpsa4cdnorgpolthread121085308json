If it was less about exchanges and mandates, more about fixing market failures and expanding medicaid, it would have worked much better. Obamacare is like the worst of both worlds, the worst of socialism and the worst of capitalism. There are all these market failures in healthcare, situations in which no business acting logically would serve people well, as to deny care is to increase profits, and then Obamacare basically subsidizes this broken market and &quot;doubles down&quot; on the market failure which is why premiums are going up 50% or more some years where before it was like 10-20% increases in a year (which was still bad... but not as bad) <br><br>Obamacare was a huge subsidy to the insurance industry. It literally gave them an excuse to raise premiums. So now you have 35 year old guy with a family, lets say two kids and he makes a good salary like $150,000 a year. He is now paying like $2500 or more a month for health insurance, plus all the deductables and co-pays and co-insurance which can be like a few hundred to a few thousand a year depending on how sick you were. So lets say $3500\/month for a family of 4 with moderate health problems (kid with asthma, wife with diabetes, whatever... nothing extreme like cancer) so $3500\/month over the year is $42000.","time":1492191017,"resto":121085308,"id":"2j75TBxC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121088428,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:43:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121086873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121086873<\/a><br>A public option would have fixed so much.","time":1492191786,"resto":121085308,"id":"BN6XEWw5","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"}]}

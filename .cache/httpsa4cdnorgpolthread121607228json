They don&#039;t agree with nogging a grocery store or cutting the head off non-believers, but as long as it is not actually happen, they couldn&#039;t care less. That is, a blind eye is turned to what proved to be harmless differences. Of course, it&#039;s over the line if it does results in crimes and deaths.<br><br>Yet, we see liberals wanting to shut down conservative thought and to limit free speech to prevent &quot;hateful&quot; ideas from spreading. Western conservatism hasn&#039;t lead to genociding, unlike Islam, therefore it is safe and should be tolerated. Yet, leftists aren&#039;t willing to respect conservatism. This isn&#039;t tolerance.

Turks know that within a matter of years, Kurds will increasingly become more influential in Turkey as their population increases, which is why they&#039;re doing whatever they can to destabilise Turkey Kurdistan. Turkey is going to be in a state of perpetual war within a decade as the two ethnic group battle it out to become the dominant group in Turkey. Also this is why Erdogan is trying to reverse secularism, since he believes secularism and low birth rates are linked. Although Turks are still having less babies. Next 20 years should be interesting.","time":1491412606,"resto":119626857,"id":"6fH2I4BQ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119629044,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:22:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Mods stop sliding my thread<br>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE","time":1491412978,"resto":119626857,"id":"6fH2I4BQ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119629067,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:23:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119626857\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119626857<\/a><br>TURK GENOCIDE WHEN?","time":1491412993,"resto":119626857,"id":"0IB8r250","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119629168,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:24:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"If only it were Greeks, instead of another species of roach, replacing the Kurds in Greater Greece aka Anatolia","time":1491413056,"resto":119626857,"id":"LCPAFMYu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119629257,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:24:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hopefully Kurds and Armenians will outbreed them","time":1491413099,"resto":119626857,"id":"TtDl60HJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119631018,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)13:40:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119629168\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119629168<\/a><br>There probably going to be a Kurdish Greek alliance in the future.

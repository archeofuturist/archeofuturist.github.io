I was just sitting on the toilet taking a shit and it came to mind. <br><br>now that I have your attention, it&#039;s because today you can&#039;t be an individual in society. to be an individual is to be a THREAT to everyone&#039;s nice boxed vision of the world. there is no more creativity because we&#039;re living in the WASTE LAND of everyone wanting to act like they&#039;re the kinds of their own lives when we&#039;re all filthy peasants. you can&#039;t be YOURSELF anymore without being ostracized, ridiculed and REJECTED.<br><br>so everyone is too afraid and art suffers, everything suffers. but hey at least our tech is increasing right? at least I can share a photo through my hand held glass screen and my mom can see it on her hand held glass screen, right? <br><br>FUCK all this bull shit. it&#039;s time people start to wake up, take risks and be themselves. FUCK anyone who says otherwise because they&#039;re just mass controlled normies who ruin everything anyway.<br><br>we only have this one life and instead of living it we&#039;re all in isolated bubbles dying because we&#039;re all too scared to even live.<br><br>I don&#039;t know about you but I&#039;ve had enough. I&#039;m being myself. fuck what everyone else thinkgs. I&#039;ll create my own life and live life having fun.if somebody doesn&#039;t understand me, that&#039;s their problem not my problem. even if that means I&#039;ll be rejected forever, fuck I&#039;d rather be seen as a freak\/reject then as a normal miserable pathetic existence.","filename":"pepe","ext":".png","w":601,"h":503,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1492884855202,"time":1492884855,"md5":"a1R2sUsg6p9RC64LWRn8ag==","fsize":373574,"resto":122305270,"id":"fiE4JCsb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

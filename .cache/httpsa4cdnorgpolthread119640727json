It just happens to provide answers that people accept as being possible because the ideas are old and ingrained so deeply into our social consciousnesses that questioning them feels uncomfortable. In addition, the authors of all religions add in dogmatic laws that state that you are a bad person simply by thinking of other possibilities, so those who believe must continue to do so blindly, or face the threat of eternal torture.","time":1491422412,"resto":119640727,"id":"O25S+uYU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119648223,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)16:01:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119645717\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119645717<\/a><br>I know you think you were throwing a zinger out there, but try again.

Most people are too ignorant to behave themselves without some sort of threat. The more oppressed they are, the greater the threat needs to be.

The more ignorant and oppressed a population is, the more the threat of torture beyond what can be experienced in one lifetime becomes relevant to keeping bad behaviors in check.

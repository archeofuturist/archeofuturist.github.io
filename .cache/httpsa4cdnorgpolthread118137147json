Sex is not very gratifying for the average non-deviant woman. To women, sex is mostly just a gift she gives to a man. Women are attracted to men the same way men are attracted to men: socially, not sexually. The orgasms some women can experience is really just a male orgasm. The clitoris is just a vestigial penis. The vulva is not anatomically related to the vagina at all, the actual vagina itself is nothing more than a birth canal. Embryos start off as &quot;sexually undifferentiated&quot;, meaning it comes with the parts necessary become both male or female. Maleness is only activated if a y chromosome is present, resulting in the gonads become testicles instead of ovaries. The vulva is the embryo&#039;s penis\/phallus template. Men have useless functional nipples they will never use for similar reasons. The female orgasm is sort of like a pleasurable &quot;trick&quot; some women can get themselves to do. Just like men can make their nipples lactate with enough effort. When a woman achieves this neat little trick, you can actually see her erectile muscles and pelvic area contract in the same way men do when they orgasm.

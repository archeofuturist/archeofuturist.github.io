Rick and Morty has no argument.<br><br>Think about any entertainment and think &quot;what do the creators want me to believe or know about real life at the end of this?&quot; If the answer is nonexistent, or trite garbage, then there&#039;s your answer.","time":1492992181,"resto":122502350,"id":"jog0vccJ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122512061,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:03:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122511699\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122511699<\/a><br>Mr Krabs is a Jew.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uVH<wbr>Tobid3ek","filename":"img-thing?.out=jpg&amp;size=l&amp;tid=9862165","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":300,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492992191310,"time":1492992191,"md5":"fX2DGPt5fw7WAJybL\/9ROA==","fsize":17947,"resto":122502350,"id":"i1VNglnd","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122512112,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:03:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122511899\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122511899<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;get heart broken by a hive mind alien <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;immediately try to kill yourself<\/span><br>Rick isnt above anyone.","time":1492992212,"resto":122502350,"id":"2LiSh4+F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122512435,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:06:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122510921\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122510921<\/a><br>haha that&#039;s great","time":1492992375,"resto":122502350,"id":"d\/FpFCIY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122512637,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:07:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122512061\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122512061<\/a><br>Delet this!","filename":"ngbbs4bda55b72ce0a","ext":".jpg","w":599,"h":451,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1492992462861,"time":1492992462,"md5":"SZMGt8Dgvuo64hBaiZyk1Q==","fsize":48478,"resto":122502350,"id":"UZdtbEI4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122512730,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:08:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122509137\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122509137<\/a><br>Is this real?","time":1492992503,"resto":122502350,"id":"yc05QH6U","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122512994,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:10:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"everyone in this thread<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anyone who watches it is reddit<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anyone who watches it is 15<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anyone who laughs at this is not redpilled<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;anyone who thinks this is a good show is cancer<\/span><br><br>You&#039;re all faggots, just admit it&#039;s more original and edgy than 99% of the crap that&#039;s even on TV.

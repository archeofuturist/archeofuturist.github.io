The problem with autism is that the brain connects too many neurons together, causing malfunction, but occasionally causing the savant. The non-social, border-line retarded autists are not the future.<br><br>The future lies in the functional autists out there that can pass on the genes and weed out the unfit.<br><br>Autism = shit loads of axons connecting neurons. A balance can only occur over years and years of mating. It&#039;s almost as if breeding with autism shitlords is the best future for the human race. That is, they&#039;ll be able to do more with the little brain we have.<br><br>It&#039;s a shame autists have to be so pronounced and cringe-worthy. They&#039;re the key to the future of our species, even though we view them as abnormalities.","filename":"1484112534446","ext":".jpg","w":816,"h":816,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490762414574,"time":1490762414,"md5":"5qsSg7e4XPn1qmMluCknlA==","fsize":211038,"resto":118746907,"id":"3FiXUAeJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

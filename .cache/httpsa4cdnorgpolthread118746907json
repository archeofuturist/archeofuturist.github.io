The problem with autism is that the brain connects too many neurons together, causing malfunction, but occasionally causing the savant. The non-social, border-line retarded autists are not the future.<br><br>The future lies in the functional autists out there that can pass on the genes and weed out the unfit.<br><br>Autism = shit loads of axons connecting neurons. A balance can only occur over years and years of mating. It&#039;s almost as if breeding with autism shitlords is the best future for the human race. That is, they&#039;ll be able to do more with the little brain we have.<br><br>It&#039;s a shame autists have to be so pronounced and cringe-worthy. They&#039;re the key to the future of our species, even though we view them as abnormalities.","filename":"1484112534446","ext":".jpg","w":816,"h":816,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490762414574,"time":1490762414,"md5":"5qsSg7e4XPn1qmMluCknlA==","fsize":211038,"resto":118746907,"id":"3FiXUAeJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118748575,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:48:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118746907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118746907<\/a><br>Menachem Mendel Schneerson, &quot;the rebbe&quot;, said autists relate more to god than others do.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=fBj<wbr>Umj95r6g","filename":"rebbe","ext":".jpg","w":198,"h":254,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490762887082,"time":1490762887,"md5":"6rX4J9WlX+jZs7SftxBThA==","fsize":5634,"resto":118746907,"id":"+uauvb5f","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118748799,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:50:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118748575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118748575<\/a><br><br>who the fuck cares what a jew thinks","time":1490763030,"resto":118746907,"id":"3FiXUAeJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118749434,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:57:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118746907\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118746907<\/a><br>We are the next evolution.<br><br>We are Autismnymus<br><br>Expect us","filename":"katana","ext":".jpg","w":367,"h":500,"tn_w":91,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490763466607,"time":1490763466,"md5":"g07CPlzp+umn2XmGm3intQ==","fsize":26911,"resto":118746907,"id":"2s\/xD3tu","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118749574,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)00:59:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118748799\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118748799<\/a><br>who the fuck cares what a gentile thinks","time":1490763578,"resto":118746907,"id":"+uauvb5f","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]}

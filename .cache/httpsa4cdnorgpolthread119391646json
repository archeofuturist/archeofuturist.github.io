Ok, fine, keep your niqab, but the full burka? It&#039;s one of the most demeaning and misogynistic practices going. It fully disgusts me to see it in my country.","filename":"burka-365743","ext":".jpg","w":620,"h":479,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":193,"tim":1491259059716,"time":1491259059,"md5":"YOzpGHRuMd9CjMlI87+9EA==","fsize":93495,"resto":0,"id":"U\/4xI8UT","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-does-the-burka-not-completely-disgust","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119392114,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)18:41:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119391646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119391646<\/a><br>It does.

But feminists can affect the countries they live in, so try to.","time":1491259303,"resto":119391646,"id":"BmVy2dX\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119392204,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)18:42:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119391646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119391646<\/a><br>Fallen angels like females&#039; long hair","time":1491259348,"resto":119391646,"id":"aUkgfIj9","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119392642,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)18:46:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119392114\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119392114<\/a><br>Like I said, I&#039;m disgusted to see it in my country, thats what I would like changed at a basic level.

Because normally, if you&#039;re making a coup in Turkey, you do it in 4 in the morning, so nobody can react. But these guys did it in 10 PM so everybody saw in on TV and when the sultan called his fanatics to the street they were able to do it. On another note, it was not the whole Turkish Armed Forces that tried the coup, it was just a faction within the army. They took control of some civilian buildings, but they were not able to capture one government official, let alone the sultan. That&#039;s why everybody thinks that this coup was a sham.","time":1492769286,"resto":122119159,"id":"sfAI08gL","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"},{"no":122120626,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)06:11:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122120392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122120392<\/a><br>All the alternatives to democratic elections to remove him seems bloody, and I don&#039;t think there is an organised opposition that can do something like that.

The most sickening part is that these neckbeard goatfuckers actually beat up and beheaded some soldiers. They were just obeying orders. Their deaths are in vain and now people spit in their grave. Poor souls. Erdogan and all his establishment are spineless and lowest scum of the earth.","time":1492769682,"resto":122119159,"id":"rlOxNBrh","country":"TR","country_name":"Turkey"}]}

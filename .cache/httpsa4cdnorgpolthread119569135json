EVEN IF WE SOMEHOW CREATE AN ENGINE THAT CAN TRAVEL AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT IT WOULD STILL TAKE 20 YEARS TO REACH THE NEAREST STAR.","filename":"caturday-shutterstock_149320799","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":720,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491378910895,"time":1491378910,"md5":"JwUFC\/HH\/hj5EtHWZx\/qmQ==","fsize":63220,"resto":119569135,"id":"aSJUJZAg","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119582994,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)03:55:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119582550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119582550<\/a><br>I thought at least some of the ICBM&#039;s entered orbit and then released the payload, that&#039;s why Best Korea launching a satellite - if they can put it in an orbit, then they can also put it on a trajectory to exit orbit over a location and land roughly near a city. <br><br>The cruise missile mounted tactical nukes would be a big part of the glassing of earth too, so easy to launch, not as weather reliant.

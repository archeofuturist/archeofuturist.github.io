The African-American high school student was killed by George Zimmerman, a 28-year-old mixed race Hispanic man, who was a member of the neighborhood watch in his Florida community. He claimed he shot Martin, who was unarmed, in self defense after the two became involved in a physical altercation. Zimmerman\u2019s acquittal on a second-degree murder charge inspired protests around the country.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Suspicion Nation\u201d is by Lisa Bloom and recounts her experience covering the trial for NBC. She looks at the mistakes made by prosecutors that caused them to lose what she describes as a \u201cwinnable case.\u201d \u201cRest in Power\u201d is by Martin\u2019s parents, Sybrina Fulton and Tracy Martin. It tells a more personal story, looking at Martin\u2019s childhood and the aftermath of his death.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;There were several other studios interested in the project, including Fox Searchlight, Universal on behalf of Will Packer, and Ted Field. The Weinstein Company closed the deal last week. TWC honchos Harvey Weinstein and David Glasser had a marathon meeting on Oscar weekend in their Los Angeles office with Jay Z and Martin\u2019s parents. They made it clear that they were most concerned with seeing their son\u2019s life and legacy honored.<\/span>","filename":"1490343794570","ext":".png","w":604,"h":608,"tn_w":248,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490347192244,"time":1490347192,"md5":"UbDNtM7RKSIPvtw8OuApGw==","fsize":623097,"resto":0,"id":"w4U\/9Ifp","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-is-actually-happening","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":31,"images":11,"unique_ips":23},{"no":118063289,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)05:23:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;documentary<\/span><br><br>I think it would work better as a musical.","filename":"1483933574686","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":900,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490347381845,"time":1490347381,"md5":"zbTZAb0DAL1uxKwGuZo3Hg==","fsize":117221,"resto":118063084,"id":"6NvzmqPU","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118063484,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)05:26:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118063084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118063084<\/a><br>guess hispanics are going to be white again for a convenient 90 minutes before they go back to being oppressed","time":1490347575,"resto":118063084,"id":"tlkhmefH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118063528,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)05:27:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118063484\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118063484<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;guess hispanics are going to be white again<\/span><br>Exactly.","filename":"1471548205292","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490347620618,"time":1490347620,"md5":"gvimaKbVjkgcUcngYALV1w==","fsize":819475,"resto":118063084,"id":"07oodegf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118063534,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)05:27:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118063084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118063084<\/a><br>At least they aren&#039;t calling Zimzam white anymore","time":1490347626,"resto":118063084,"id":"Cm2L7h01","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118063681,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)05:29:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118063084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118063084<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(((Weinstein)))<\/span><br>God fucking dammit, \/pol\/","time":1490347766,"resto":118063084,"id":"iyCivDSM","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":118063879,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)05:32:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118063084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118063084<\/a><br>Holy fuck that pic triggers me<br><br>MLK was one of the few good ones","time":1490347961,"resto":118063084,"id":"9gq3l8lB","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"},{"no":118063945,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)05:34:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Weinstein<\/span>","time":1490348047,"resto":118063084,"id":"PRhOO0r0","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":118063962,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)05:34:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118063084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118063084<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the mistakes made by prosecutors<\/span><br><br>the only mistake was charging an innocent man","time":1490348060,"resto":118063084,"id":"BDZHXxeN","country":"PR","country_name":"Puerto Rico"},{"no":118064077,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)05:36:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118063084\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118063084<\/a><br>Why would Weinstein make a movie about a black man?

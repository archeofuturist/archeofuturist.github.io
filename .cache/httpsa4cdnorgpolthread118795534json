You feel bad for a family that has made it&#039;s money off of conning the American people into buying shitty stuff?<br>Sorry but for a lot of people, the apples don&#039;t fall far from the tree. She&#039;s using the Trump name to sell crap clothing made in other countries that is extremely overpriced. The same tactics her dad uses to sell his stupid Vodkas or Steaks or whatever other QVC scam he&#039;s had in the past.<br>And now, she&#039;s getting an office in the White House. Why? Because the fucking first lady is a foreign Model who has no idea what she&#039;s gotten herself into. She posts luxurious pictures from the million dollar apartment she lives in that costs taxpayers shittons of money so that their precious Bannon can stay at the same exclusive private school because God forbid he should have to do what other kids have to do when their parents get a new job and start at a new school. Ohhh no, no way they could do that! Have they paid or reimbursed the country for any of those expenses? Will they? Probably not. They&#039;re mooches, all of them. They&#039;ve mooched off their father who&#039;s been mooching off the American people for decades. And now, he&#039;s the President, and is only mooching even more than ever, with his weekly golf trips to his shithole golf course, again, on the taxpayers dime. He&#039;s wasting millions and millions of dollars in taxpayer money, and then has the nerve to continue slashing American benefits to pay for some dumb ass, misguided wall. His family has been a cancer on America, and the cancer is growing out of control. His family has no idea what public service is, and that is why they receive so much hate. It is absolutely deserved, and he continues to earn it on a daily basis.<br>Sorry for the rant, but no, his family is just as culpable as he is.","filename":"file","ext":".png","w":698,"h":768,"tn_w":227,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490800654688,"time":1490800654,"md5":"ef6SKefA4Yeg1JyeUKIxEg==","fsize":578136,"resto":0,"id":"UA60NLS3","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"you-feel-bad-for-trumps-family","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":118795781,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)11:20:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118795534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118795534<\/a><br>Kys","time":1490800804,"resto":118795534,"id":"GJdRrPNL","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":118796026,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)11:22:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ivanka for first female President","time":1490800974,"resto":118795534,"id":"\/A7BXdqi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118796462,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)11:27:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"are bongs turning into the new leafs? what the heck is happening?","time":1490801253,"resto":118795534,"id":"ZrJjnV1P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118796490,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)11:27:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118795534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118795534<\/a><br>Good Lord, mad much buddy??","time":1490801265,"resto":118795534,"id":"8ldHmjqA","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":118796621,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)11:29:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118796462\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118796462<\/a><br>Relax.

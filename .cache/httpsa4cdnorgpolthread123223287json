Perhaps you can help me.<br><br>When did the term &quot;social justice&quot; or &quot;social justice warrior&quot; become a negative thing? Isn&#039;t any sort of natural karma a good thing? Like for example if somebody who is a real bastard suffers some sort of misfortune, isn&#039;t that a good thing? Don&#039;t they deserve that? Like a feeling of schadenfreude. <br><br>I&#039;m no SJW by any means. And I&#039;m all for not being a rat on another mans scam. But I can&#039;t see anything bad about people getting what they deserve. I guess the argument is that SJWs take it too far and make everybody so precious, and that can intrude into another mans free speech. But I also think calling somebody a nigger or a spic or whatever is much worse. Purposely making people feel shitty just to use your right to free speech is a pretty shitty thing to do. <br><br>The fact is there is social inequality because of race. Or even gender. Nobody picks who their ancestors are. IMO the people who want to bridge the gaps and make the world overall a happier place are doing a good thing. Isnt that social justice? Am I right? Am I wrong? Why is trying to get justice for something a bad thing?","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":1146,"tn_w":163,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493402787396,"time":1493402787,"md5":"twUdRpnk7oJT3eMs8ZLaXg==","fsize":105075,"resto":0,"id":"CwxezQVg","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-is-sjw-so-bad","country_name":"Australia","replies":26,"images":3,"unique_ips":14},{"no":123223658,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)14:09:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Did You Know: On 9-11-2001 five dancing Israelis were arrested after being witnessed filming and celebrating the attack on the twin towers.

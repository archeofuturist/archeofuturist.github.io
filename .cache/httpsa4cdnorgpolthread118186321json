Called &quot;The Albany Plan of Union&quot;, the proposed government would have looked quite a bit like the current US federal system, but with the President elected by Parliament in Britain. It would have given the colonies the ability to raise a single army between them, and would have had more autonomy.<br><br>Had the Albany plan gone forward, it would have created a strong continental military under the control of the British-appointed President. The problems of maintaining a military occupation of a land weeks away would be greatly alleviated. And many of the American factions might not have materialized: the Albany Plan&#039;s greater autonomy would have reduced the strength of one of the themes of the revolution, that of self-determination. &quot;No taxation without representation&quot; would not be relevant: they would have representation. And those taxes the colonists were so hung up on were levied against them to pay for, in theory, the cost of defending the colonies during the Seven Years&#039; War (aka, the French and Indian War in the Americas) which was precisely what the Plan of Union was created to do: allow the colonies to defend themselves. That war debt would surely still have existed, but rather than pay taxes to the Empire directly, the colonies would instead be paying their own unified government.","filename":"DoomFranklin","ext":".jpg","w":1228,"h":777,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":79,"tim":1490422059243,"time":1490422059,"md5":"E3iJywx2U+dmI8mDifAVKw==","fsize":632527,"resto":118186321,"id":"1D6GP7b1","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118195231,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)02:22:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118193937\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118193937<\/a><br>I&#039;d like us to take a moment to consider a world where the Americans never left the Empire.

The question of whether the United States would enter a major European conflict would be irrelevant, so imagine how differently the World Wars might have been.

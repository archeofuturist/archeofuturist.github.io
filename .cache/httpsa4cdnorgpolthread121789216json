Whites grew crops while Indians hunted. Only when Europeans tried to also claim hunting rights did the Indians become violent. <br><br>Today, Indians still cause problems- turns out that exclusion did not work. <br><br>We face a similar resource problem today, but with women instead of land. The difference is that while land can&#039;t choose who owns it, women can. <br><br>The problem is the sole claim of ownership towards women- just as in the 1700s, a peaceful existence only existed while resources were used by Europeans\/Indians simutaneously. Problems were few, asides from occasional disease transmission. <br><br>Considering White\/Black mental\/physical disparities, either Whites\/Blacks may be preferable to women, and at different times, even for different purposes. Considering White\/Black disparities, a woman may want a White man for certain purposes, and a Black man for other reasons. And considering women&#039;s differing ability to accomdate White\/Black performance in different roles, both White\/Black have roles to play for women. A peaceful existance is possible so land as resources are used for multiple roles.","filename":"3","ext":".jpg","w":276,"h":183,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1492570113729,"time":1492570113,"md5":"G7497hVsSgXnFrD05ZF\/4Q==","fsize":11060,"resto":0,"id":"soHMZBkb","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"racial-disparities-and-resource-useownership","country_name":"Canada","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121789906,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:53:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121789216\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121789216<\/a><br>OK","time":1492570401,"resto":121789216,"id":"dpxY5Yvu","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121790405,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:57:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121789906\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121789906<\/a><br>Are you OK with multiple resource roles not filled?","time":1492570642,"resto":121789216,"id":"soHMZBkb","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

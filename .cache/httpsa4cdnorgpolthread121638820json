You will never hear music the way it was meant to sound. You are missing out on so much. <br><br>The only real way to listen to music is original vinyl pressings, of course, but if you absolutely must go digital, make sure it is a FLAC encoding (and not shitty YouTube mp3).<br><br>FLAC uses lossless compression, while MP3 is &#039;lossy&#039;. What this means is that for each year the MP3 sits on your hard drive, it will lose roughly 12kbps, assuming you have SATA - it&#039;s about 15kbps on IDE, but only 7kbps on SCSI, due to rotational velocidensity. You don&#039;t want to know how much worse it is on CD-ROM or other optical media.<br><br>I started collecting MP3s in about 2001, and if I try to play any of the tracks I downloaded back then, even the stuff I grabbed at 320kbps, they just sound like crap. The bass is terrible, the midrange\u2026well don\u2019t get me started. Some of those albums have degraded down to 32 or even 16kbps. FLAC rips from the same period still sound great, even if they weren\u2019t stored correctly, in a cool, dry place. Seriously, stick to FLAC, you may not be able to hear the difference now, but in a year or two, you\u2019ll be glad you did.","filename":"barron-disdsain","ext":".jpg","w":393,"h":462,"tn_w":106,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492492747092,"time":1492492747,"md5":"A+g2uvxwC1Qwrep00NECeA==","fsize":50725,"resto":121638820,"id":"A7Sc5alV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121643365,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:20:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121643187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121643187<\/a><br>any streaming services use flac?","time":1492492856,"resto":121638820,"id":"PX5mPffJ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121643549,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:22:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121639741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121639741<\/a><br>Came to post this, more or less.","time":1492492962,"resto":121638820,"id":"TuY0kZmD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121643837,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:25:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121643187\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121643187<\/a><br>Haven&#039;t you heard?

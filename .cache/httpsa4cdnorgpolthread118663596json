So they have some interest in fiscal conservatism.<br><br>In a way I do think they separate the fiscal from the social because they are not aware that being poor can often put a person&#039;s character to the test and many come up wanting. They also separate the two on the converse because their considerable wealth isolates them from the fact that immorality can often lead to impoverishment.

Dude don&#039;t you worry, Venezuelans have had EVERY chance to get rid of Chavez and also him. <br><br>One problem is that, as the Jews, they wouldn&#039;t die for each other in a real revolt to save themselves. They probably expect &#039;murica to come and save the day. <br><br>What I hate the most is that the wealthy vzuelans are all out, living large in other countries, using their oil money to inflate real estate prices, buying shit to safeguard their money at the cost of the citizens of said smaller countries. The situation in vzla affects many Latin American countries. The way rich vzlanos treated poorer ones is the reason Chavez got into power firstly...

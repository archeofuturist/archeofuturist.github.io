They rise to high positions because they often have very good work ethic and intelligence. If one might want to say that they&#039;re overwhelmingly liberals, that&#039;s only because their primary demographic, which is to say upper middle class, is also mostly liberal.<br><br>A great counter example to the &quot;Jews are liberal shills&quot; is someone like Ben Shapiro. There are many, many others, obviously, though I don&#039;t disagree with the assessment that most Jews are liberal. However, it&#039;s a non-sequitur. By and large, Jews are members of their countries and culturally integrated far more than anything else.<br><br>I really can&#039;t state this any more clearly. There is no evidence of an evil cabal of Jews, and even if Jews were some coherent group with plans (they aren&#039;t), there is no evidence to say that their plan would be pro or anti West. They are almost all Westerners. Please provide some evidence that there is something nefarious going on, or else, really, the argument holds about as much weight as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion.","filename":"591276_900","ext":".jpg","w":659,"h":900,"tn_w":183,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490175394248,"time":1490175394,"md5":"C9GtYP04cJoEM358zB5lBA==","fsize":86378,"resto":0,"id":"UUCcnb0v","country":"MY","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"jews-are-not-a-monolithic-group-they-rise-to-high","country_name":"Malaysia","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

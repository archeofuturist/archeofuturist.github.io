America was a land of immigrants when we needed people to settle the west and build our railroads. America was a land of immigrants when we needed workers for our factories. <br><br>Now, anywhere worth living in America has been settled. We have a large population of educated people to draw from for a working environment that increasingly places premiums on higher education and training. <br><br>The only places where we could possilby benefit from having immigrants from are Europe, and Europe wants those educated people for their own economies. <br><br>America being the land of immigrants just isn&#039;t the case anymore. Things have changed. Of course every poor person in their shit countries wants to come here, they want to live in a prosperous and free country.

We have planes and shit from the 70s, and they&#039;re in complete disrepair, unable to be replaced due to a lack of budget.<br><br>For all the billions we put into the whole defence budget, it&#039;s still not enough in some areas. A smarter policy would be to cut out unnecessary spending, axe new projects, and fix what&#039;s broken.<br><br>But muh military industrial complex, si what the Pentagon says.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Foreign Aid<\/span><br><br>Go fuck yourself.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Increase contributions to the UN and NATO<\/span><br><br>It doesn&#039;t work like that.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Military assistance to Kiev <\/span><br><br>You wanted to cut Defence spending, but get into more fights?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Ban Keystone XL and DAPL<\/span><br><br>Fucking why?","filename":"i_dont_understand","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":240,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491018773562,"time":1491018773,"md5":"9uO1l5GAqTzkeyudJA0xpw==","fsize":14137,"resto":119137568,"id":"x81T7+tk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119140570,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:53:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119137568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119137568<\/a><br>Clear the west coast of all the chinks and spics","time":1491018788,"resto":119137568,"id":"PDKNnr0j","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119140708,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:54:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119140570\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119140570<\/a><br>I&#039;d rather see the Indians eradicated with smallpox blankets for real this time desu","time":1491018876,"resto":119137568,"id":"EuMpU4Tb","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119140971,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:57:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119138517\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119138517<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;allow refugees in<\/span><br><br>And that worked fucking great for the EU didn&#039;t it?","filename":"1490865462717","ext":".jpg","w":306,"h":306,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491019049330,"time":1491019049,"md5":"eeD3byL0Kdxqeeu+jztITQ==","fsize":20309,"resto":119137568,"id":"suThubsy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119141340,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:01:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"can someone on here please explain to me why Americans still defend the iraq war?<br><br>I don&#039;t understand why some people are so proud to have helped make globalist jews line their pockets with cheap iraqi oil.<br><br>why are american soldiers willing to die for jews and white elitist?","time":1491019291,"resto":119137568,"id":"jFaI4z5V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119141476,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:02:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119138517\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119138517<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;pass universal healthcare<\/span><br><br>did you know, mexico has universal healthcare called Cuvertura Medica Polular?","time":1491019371,"resto":119137568,"id":"jFaI4z5V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119141584,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:03:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119137568\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119137568<\/a><br>I want a bi-partisan agreement on infrastructure spending.","time":1491019438,"resto":119137568,"id":"LtGVqTy9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119141671,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:04:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119140971\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119140971<\/a><br>it was america who destabilized the middle east and your mad at arabs?<br><br>how does that work exactly?","time":1491019485,"resto":119137568,"id":"jFaI4z5V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119141804,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)00:06:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119140547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119140547<\/a><br>Hey retard, you do realize that other than spic immigrants asians, middle eastern, Indian, and even African immigrants are all majority uni graduates and skilled workers right?

The distinction of apathy and pride are more noticeable than ever. You pretty much fall into 2 categories of you don&#039;t give a fuck or you give too many fucks. Unfortunately the first is the majority. Apathy has created a society in which those who would make a change are berated or isolated while the apathetic are considered &quot;normal&quot;.

There&#039;s no point to living a certain way or any way really if theres no pay off in the end. Modern society idolizes the few and leaves the rest to rot around them.

Depression hit me like a truck when I hit 20, and for the past six years I&#039;ve been in an existential funk flowing between one job to the next and being in and out of college trying to find something worth doing. I want to go down fighting. I&#039;m tired of squeaking by day to day. I don&#039;t want to go out with a whimper, I want to stand up and yell, I WANT MY LIFE TO MEAN SOMETHING. Where people can actively change the world, where government can and will be limited. No more spying on people, no more forcing itself into your daily lives. A world where senators and house reps will say &quot;Man maybe we do need term limits on ourselves and we should quit gerrymandering districts too while we&#039;re at it.&quot; I want people to act like they have some goddamn common sense and quit running around with pink hair and a dildo in their pocket. I was an eagle scout for fuck&#039;s sake and here I am lamenting how my country is falling apart.

My depression is something I can&#039;t put my finger on, it&#039;s a lethargy, it&#039;s this energy draining weight that keeps me sedated. I take my soma and it only helps a little bit, enough to get up for work, but it&#039;s just not enough. I don&#039;t know what to do and this ranting and rambling is just making these feelings even more exacerbated. Helplessness. I was brought up thinking that you can take care of everything on your own, and coming up into adulthood I&#039;ve realized that while I can care for myself, the world is far beyond what an individual can fix.","filename":"john goodman loses his shit","ext":".gif","w":240,"h":180,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493243806344,"time":1493243806,"md5":"OoB9avbmB06JOInM2mHyTw==","fsize":2991833,"resto":122937017,"id":"\/AEdlkmS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122945957,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)17:56:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122944543\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122944543<\/a><br>I almost certainly do, agreed on that.<br><br>I&#039;ve never actually listened to Dr. Sort-Yourself-Out.

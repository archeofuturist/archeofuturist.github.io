The distinction of apathy and pride are more noticeable than ever. You pretty much fall into 2 categories of you don&#039;t give a fuck or you give too many fucks. Unfortunately the first is the majority. Apathy has created a society in which those who would make a change are berated or isolated while the apathetic are considered &quot;normal&quot;.

This has cause a lot of people to &quot;wake up&quot; and start seeing the world for what it really is. The concepts that the world isn&#039;t fair and nobody really cares about you are hard to swallow. Once these things are realized the average person seems to give up because of the menial nature of success. There&#039;s no point to living a certain way or any way really if theres no pay off in the end. Modern society idolizes the few and leaves the rest to rot around them.

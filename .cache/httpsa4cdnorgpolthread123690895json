Short list of -stan countries: Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan. In other words, awful countries that for the most part represent the kind of scourge \/pol\/ is opposed to at it&#039;s core. Anons with an IQ above 70 see this immediately and that&#039;s why no one likes this dumb meme. <br><br>Which historical nation is at the meme center of \/pol\/? Gee wiz, could it be Deutschland? Why didn&#039;t you call it Kekschland you fucking imbeciles? Kekschland. Kekschlanders. Respectable anons would accept this meme. It would actually make sense instead of being a dumb failed meme full of contradictory symbolism.","filename":"-1","ext":".jpg","w":320,"h":320,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493681347240,"time":1493681347,"md5":"VxA\/7zTB4Lmskp+BrkQ1tA==","fsize":21195,"resto":0,"id":"ge7S019B","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"kekschland-not-kekistan-ie-why-this-meme-is-so","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

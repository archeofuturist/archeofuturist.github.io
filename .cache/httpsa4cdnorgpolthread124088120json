You can have a muslim or a nigger ina white neighborhood and chme are they will act like a decent person, but get a large enough number of them and you might as well start learning to speak swedish.c","time":1493926897,"resto":124088120,"id":"8qiDYga1","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":124100121,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)15:43:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124096386\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124096386<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124099807\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124099807<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;culture and times change<\/span><br>Culture change is an extremely slow and complex process that requires at least several generations of people to live and pass in order to occur, because people&#039;s habits and opinions stop developing at the age of 30 at best in most cases. You might have developed a slightly different worldview than your parents, and your kids might develop a slightly different worldview than yours, but for it to cause a significant change in culture there needs to be millions of kids introducing millions of slightly different worldviews, they must work out common ground for the whole population and then you just might have a noticeable change in culture. That&#039;s why niggers will have a tribal gangsta mentality for the next thousand years and muslims will view &quot;infidels&quot; as cockroaches and not worshipping allahu kekbar as a crime meriting death penalty for the next thousand years too. And Poles and Germans\/Russians\/Ukies will remain enemies for the next thousand years, even if we manage to keep non-hostile and even maintain mutually beneficial political\/social relations for a couple of years between the wars ww ought to fight. Believe me or not, but we WILL be in a war in our lifetime.","time":1493927038,"resto":124088120,"id":"8qiDYga1","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"}]}

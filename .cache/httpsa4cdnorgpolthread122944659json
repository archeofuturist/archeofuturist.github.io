The date of their extinction had been disputed because they seem to have disappeared close to the limit of what can be dated with radiocarbon and many dated samples had been contaminated with modern radiocarbon. In 2014, a team led by Thomas Higham of the University of Oxford used a new radiocarbon decontamination technique on material from 40 archaeological sites to show that Neanderthals died out in Europe between 41,000 and 39,000 years ago.

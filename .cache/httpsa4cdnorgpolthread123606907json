Or you&#039;re working from the assumption British are superior and get to do whatever they want.<br>Holding such ideas is damaging, because you&#039;re no longer a superpower in any way, you&#039;re arguably the weakest out of great powers in modern world.<br>Brexit will come with consequences and they will be negative for you. <br>Don&#039;t get me wrong, you made a legitimate choice, but it&#039;s also legitimate for Germans and others to punish you now. Especially given how UK tried hard to join European organizations in past and then took a highly negative stance towards everything, always wanted a special treatment and sabotaged EU and previous organizations many times. <br>You suffer from post-superpower syndrome.<br>And finally immigration was the main reason for you leaving (at least for people here), yet ironically your worst immigrant groups are still fully backed by cuckservatives you put in power.<br>It&#039;s easier to take it out on Poles I guess.

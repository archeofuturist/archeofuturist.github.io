In order to match the US, each of the 27 nations would need to average over $22 Billion each. Currently, there are only 4 nations meet this requirement, UK, Italy, France, and Germany. Together they make up between 1\/4 and 1\/3 the spending of the US, meaning the remaining $400 Billion + needs to be made up by the weakest nations of the union. With over half of the nations remaining having expenditures comparable to Estonia, it can be seen that the US spends far more than double that of the rest of the EU.

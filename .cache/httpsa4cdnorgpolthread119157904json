Regulations and compliance related to doing an IPO (initial public offering- a company&#039;s first issue of stock on the public markets for you illiterates) from Dodd-Frank did immense damage to the IPO market which meant that well run new corporations wouldn&#039;t be able to get nearly as much selling their stock, since again, large corporations would have the wherewithal to lowball companies. <br><br>Take the case of an actual company in Portland, OR.

The 1100 dollars are also counted as part of his adusted gross income, which is counted from to determine the taxpayer&#039;s taxable income, so 1100 dollars in this guy&#039;s income are being taxed by two separate sources despite being an average joe. This is a really light case but it still sucks ass to be the taxpayer here. I thought about including the Schedule D but I figured it would probably be a waste of time since nobody here probably cares.","filename":"1396504910093","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":491,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":122,"tim":1491040868587,"time":1491040868,"md5":"P0oawxHw\/k4oSjnwQdiBXg==","fsize":41530,"resto":119157904,"id":"o2WrQNIb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119165688,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)06:01:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119165671\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119165671<\/a><br>https:\/\/my.mixtape.moe\/jhuchx.pdf<br><br>Woops, here&#039;s the actual form.","time":1491040886,"resto":119157904,"id":"o2WrQNIb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119166206,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)06:09:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119160244\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119160244<\/a><br><br>Honestly if a situation like that ever arose I would be fine with busting up those big monopolies and giving certain people from those companies a lifetime credit card or something.

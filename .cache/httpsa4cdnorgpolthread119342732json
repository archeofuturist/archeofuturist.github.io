After that its important to build good social skills and shit with other kids, hopefully in a nice school.","time":1491240740,"resto":119342732,"id":"qOXV2R\/u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119353540,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)13:32:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s perfect.

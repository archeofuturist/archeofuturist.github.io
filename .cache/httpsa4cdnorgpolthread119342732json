Automation pushed out just about every single aspect of the time it took to care for a home that women started having to work in factories before their rights existed to pull in the money the house hold was no longer getting from their textiles. for the gentry that could afford a woman who did not have to do these things, they ran her through the home like a military leads a private through their barracks, everything had to be spotless every day and the monotony drove them insane.

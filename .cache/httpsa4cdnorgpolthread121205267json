Many EU members are relatively poor countries whose economies are very rapidly growing, like Poland, and who will likely eventually be forced to accept and use the Euro as their primary and then only exchange currency nationally. If the trend continues the EU&#039;s total economy will surpass the US&#039;s economy as the largest in the world, and there&#039;s a chance more trade may be conducted with the Euro than even the dollar. Wouldn&#039;t it make sense for it to at least compete as a reserve currency then?

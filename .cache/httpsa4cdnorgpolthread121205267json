Many EU members are relatively poor countries whose economies are very rapidly growing, like Poland, and who will likely eventually be forced to accept and use the Euro as their primary and then only exchange currency nationally. If the trend continues the EU&#039;s total economy will surpass the US&#039;s economy as the largest in the world, and there&#039;s a chance more trade may be conducted with the Euro than even the dollar. Wouldn&#039;t it make sense for it to at least compete as a reserve currency then? Countries could probably start bargaining for different currencies to back oil deals, etc.","time":1492260366,"resto":121205267,"id":"qPTofUWK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121206806,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:47:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121205543\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121205543<\/a>","filename":"55c","ext":".png","w":611,"h":672,"tn_w":113,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492260460011,"time":1492260460,"md5":"hVmNyNmtcuQ6nYwk+oohwg==","fsize":130643,"resto":121205267,"id":"rnl\/\/s7D","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121206835,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:48:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121205267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121205267<\/a><br>A couple of years back some oil producers wanted to start charging in Euros because Dollar was cheap as fuck, then suddenly the Arab Spring happen xD","time":1492260480,"resto":121205267,"id":"FcJdRGgf","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":121207122,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:51:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121205543\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121205543<\/a>","filename":"354deaa3770912621bb816da070346ab","ext":".jpg","w":258,"h":245,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1492260695278,"time":1492260695,"md5":"auR+oQ+teS2EK2OEdqfqbw==","fsize":12193,"resto":121205267,"id":"EvF7ri8Q","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":121207135,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:51:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121206679\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121206679<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If the trend continues the EU&#039;s total economy will surpass the US&#039;s economy as the largest in the world<\/span><br>yes, this will definitly happen.<br>Every day the european union is recieving smart engineers from africa anad middle east. <br>While us is taking only filthy mexicans","time":1492260707,"resto":121205267,"id":"MQ6mjPEJ","country":"CZ","country_name":"Czech Republic"},{"no":121207238,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)08:53:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121205267\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121205267<\/a><br>The Euro is plagued with so many problems its standing is losing with every month of the unsolved crisis in the mediterranean countries.<br>The Euro can only gain in significance when it is reduced to the northern parts of the Eurozone.

Despite having a large portion of their artillery positions destroyed, NK will successfully fuck Seoul up. South Korea and the U.S defend against a massive assault across the NK\/SK border. China refuses to help North Korea as they lend their air forces to the U.S and their allies but that is all they are willing to do at this point. NK is losing ground at this point so they try to hold off the invasion by deploying their nuclear weapons on the battlefield. After a couple of weeks or months the U.S and it&#039;s allies make it to Pyongyang while china takes the rest of the land unclaimed by the allies. The war lasts a couple of months but their will still be resistance.","filename":"whatever-trump-said-to-china-about-north-korea-it-seems-like-it-worked","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":300,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492190382879,"time":1492190382,"md5":"saveZ6QYFjyIu7KtXbnoIw==","fsize":23650,"resto":0,"id":"VgsIQOHl","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"korean-war-20-scenario","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":121087644,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:37:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ok","time":1492191424,"resto":121085660,"id":"Q5ia6+6Z","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":121088292,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)13:42:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121085660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121085660<\/a><br>gr8 story m8","time":1492191722,"resto":121085660,"id":"idv\/BVSi","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

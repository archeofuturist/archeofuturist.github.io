Nowadays, when each bomber costs $400,000,000, you just can&#039;t afford to do that. Not to the same extent.

Medical equipment too. The more expensive something is, the less you can afford to test it.<br><br>When people say that the THAAD has a 20% interception rate, that&#039;s fucking theoretical.

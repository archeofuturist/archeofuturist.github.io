Again, it is not clear whether he believes them or merely uses them. But to cling to disproven \u201calternative\u201d facts; to retweet racists; to make unverifiable or false statements about rigged elections and fraudulent voters; to buy into discredited conspiracy theories first floated on fringe websites and in supermarket tabloids \u2014 these are all of a piece with the Barack Obama birther claptrap that Trump was peddling years ago and which brought him to political prominence. It is deeply alarming that a president would lend the credibility of his office to ideas that have been rightly rejected by politicians from both major political parties.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fringe websites<\/span><br>I think we&#039;re famous now guys<br><br>This truly is the best timeline","filename":"autismawarenessday","ext":".png","w":205,"h":115,"tn_w":205,"tn_h":115,"tim":1491172284464,"time":1491172284,"md5":"9aTYn7c4aqOJlduIHZ5bcg==","fsize":1169,"resto":0,"id":"SBT9tiyy","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"la-times-talking-shit","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":3},{"no":119256438,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:40:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"Trump skewered Trump<br><br> Part I<br>Our Dishonest President<br><br>What is most worrisome about Trump is Trump himself. <br>He is a man so unpredictable, so reckless, so petulant, so full of blind self-regard, so untethered to reality that it is impossible to know where his presidency will lead or how much damage he will do to our nation. <br>His obsession with his own fame, wealth and success, his determination to vanquish enemies real and imagined, his craving for adulation \u2014 these traits were, of course, at the very heart of his scorched-earth outsider campaign; indeed, some of them helped get him elected.

Whilst the government now is modeled after the American 3 branch system. He president holds more power and sway over the national agencies. So much so that when a new president is elected its commonplace that he changes the heads of all agencies to people from his party. And in turn those heads change the top critical people in the agencies. Because of this no agency will go against him and he does what he wants.","time":1490370902,"resto":118077795,"id":"5uCkuTuZ","country":"EC","country_name":"Ecuador"},{"no":118094271,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:56:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118093644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118093644<\/a><br>well , not like THAT but i guess this is something that kind of sounds like it<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YtN<wbr>pLS4GQOA","time":1490370984,"resto":118077795,"id":"oN5ti9fk","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":118094623,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:59:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118077973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118077973<\/a><br>Rude","time":1490371174,"resto":118077795,"id":"6tkHs3Tz","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":118094866,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)12:01:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118093099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118093099<\/a><br>no, they all he us for being white, or at least having some percentage of pure white argentinians.<br>our mestizos hate us white argies as well so ye, its an aboriginal resentment problem<br><br>lazy spaniards columbus should of wiped them off when he had the chance, roca\/sarmiento should have done the same in our country.<br><br>the problem are not white argies\/brazilians but rather mestizos and niggers. they ruin these countries","time":1490371316,"resto":118077795,"id":"AtzRq9Sl","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":118096968,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)12:21:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118079534\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118079534<\/a><br>This could work.<br><br><a href=\"#p118080925\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118080925<\/a><br>There is no decent right-wing politician either.

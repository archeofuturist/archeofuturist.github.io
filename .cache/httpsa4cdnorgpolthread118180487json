Already that I hadn&#039;t actively watched tv in years and was already aware of the kind of bollocks the MSM pull from its ass at time (from living in Quebec, the Canadian MSM love to shit on us over the most mundane of thing, ain&#039;t rare to see some influential newspaper call the entirety of Quebec racist xenophobe or some nensensical shit like that, almost like clockwork at this point) Never would the entirety of the MSM so unilaterally shit upon someone at once, especially someone who was part of the showbiz for many years like Trump, if it wasn&#039;t because they feared him for one reason or another. The way they acted prior, during and after the election only reinforce this belief. <br><br>They are acting like a cornered beast, they have on one side the peoples breathing down their neck asking for a genuine answer and on the others they have the elites breathing down their neck that they mustn&#039;t reveal anything too compromising, while somehow keeping the facade that everything fine under the sun while a simple peek out the window show that a mighty tempest is a brewing.","filename":"1489903304378","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":486,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490413992543,"time":1490413992,"md5":"nNKsdyz+qGqhO\/7neb\/moQ==","fsize":33647,"resto":118180487,"id":"BI1daKGp","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

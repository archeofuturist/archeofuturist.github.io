That&#039;s also present in EverQuest and likely inspired the inclusion in SAO (Like so much else).<br>For an example, let&#039;s say that Silica was about level 35 at the time. Now Silica wasn&#039;t really that skilled at actual combat, she really just paraded around and let her party members do all the work because she was popular. That&#039;s not to say she made no effort, but rather everyone else was generally stronger than her. So as a result you can assume her equipment level would be some level 32 or something. This is static. It does not change. In EverQuest it is used to determine whether you can equip the item (For instance a level 50 ranger cannot equip Fused Coral equipment, that&#039;s for level 100s.). Now, in some MMOs you can equip up to 10 levels higher than your actual level, your actual level then decides the maximum equipment level you can wear. Kirito gave Silica equipment that would likely be something around level 38.<br>Equipment level is effectively a grade for the equipment. Think of it like Runescape, that probably does the best job: Bronze is shit and it&#039;s equipment level 1. Barrows is pretty solid and equipment level 60.

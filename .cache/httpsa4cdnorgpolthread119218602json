They are incapable of presenting their arguments.<br>This is getting really fucking tiring to just see them resuming to reacting to far left SJW episodes and spouting talking points and completely misrepresenting the arguments of the left.<br><br>This is how people started to believe in shit like climate change being a hoax, and antivaxxing shit.<br><br>I understand making fun of SJW shit but how in the fuck is NOBODY capable of a good faith discussion against the moderate left? When presented with facts in the form of any figure from any kind of authority such as scientists or even government data they jump to dismiss them as conspiracy theories.<br><br>Can you recommend to me a proper fucking person that isnt a mouth breathing retard, someone actually capable of debating and argumenting?<br><br>For example, Peterson is praised by far right retards as one of their own, but all he talks about is religion, psychology and speaks out against the far left laws proposed in canada trying to control speech, I agree with lots of the things he says and respect him, but he is literally the only person I&#039;ve seen who succesfully argues for one of the many far right viewpoints.<br><br>So is there anyone in the far right actually capable of arguing like peterson is for other things?","filename":"1397988396845","ext":".gif","w":355,"h":200,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491152374759,"time":1491152374,"md5":"h3gVzGRR99fds4mRPqfRNg==","fsize":2739625,"resto":0,"id":"S7NvHJxa","country":"RO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-go-out-of-my-way-to-challenge-my-beliefs-and","country_name":"Romania","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

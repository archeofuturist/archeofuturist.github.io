It became something of a status symbol to not use your land to grow food, because you were wealthy enough not to. Sort of like the term &quot;dirt poor&quot;. We all used to have dirt floors in our houses, unless you could afford to put down stone or something else. Lawns originated to display wealth and were adopted by the lower classes, like carpet.

The US should reformulate its urban planning like it is in Europe, with all the houses relatively close to the street, allowing for a bigger backyard garden. With a bit of hedging and communal effort the houses can form a wall against any pollution that might result from traffic, and the backyard spaces will be a big protected nice place to be and grow stuff.<br><br>You&#039;ll need a certain level of intelligence to realise that this is good for you as a supplement to your atrocious industrial diet, and tax breaks wont incentivize a population with a trailor trash mentality. The best thing one can do is seek out communities that already allow gardening and move in.","filename":"1481898738674","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":666,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492888218523,"time":1492888218,"md5":"cEwZp5F2epfEK0Z5SAU7Hw==","fsize":61384,"resto":122305682,"id":"kZ66LOT\/","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":122313756,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)15:10:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122308129\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122308129<\/a><br>a 60% one","time":1492888246,"resto":122305682,"id":"ApDRcqAT","country":"PE","country_name":"Peru"},{"no":122313758,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)15:10:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122305682\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122305682<\/a><br>Backyard, people will fuck with it.","time":1492888246,"resto":122305682,"id":"wV4uZ2+W","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122313761,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)15:10:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122313573\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122313573<\/a><br>Yeah the native mulberries don&#039;t grow as much as the invasive species does around here.

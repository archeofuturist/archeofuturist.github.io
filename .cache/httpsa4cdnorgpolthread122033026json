This ends up hurting blacks and other low income people.<br><br>Example: 2 guys are working at McDonalds for $8.00 \/ hour. The federal minimum wage is raised to $15.00 \/ hour. McDonalds will fire one of those guys and make the other work almost twice as hard or instead of 2 guys getting 40 hours \/ week, they each get 20 hours per week after the minimum wage is almost doubled.<br><br>Business&#039; simply can&#039;t double the amount of money they pay for labor because some words were written on paper stating they have to pay employees x now.","time":1492719061,"resto":122033026,"id":"qYwduFHp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122038176,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:23:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122036303\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122036303<\/a><br>This basically.<br><br>It&#039;s been done before, corporations just fire people, raising the number of unemployed. Only a small percentage of the full time employed are in poverty, the majority of the impoverished are unemployed. Raise the minimum wage and you bring something like 900,000 people out of poverty, and then millions of people get fired, become unemployed and end up in poverty.<br>That, or the corporations raise prices to compensate and the cost of living goes up for everyone, so the poverty line is adjusted and you have even more people in poverty.<br>Businesses won&#039;t take the hit, they are always looking to increase profits no matter what, they will not accept lowering profits just to keep staff.","time":1492719825,"resto":122033026,"id":"SNzCBJH+","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122038397,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)16:25:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122033419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122033419<\/a><br>Because it&#039;s just not that important you get fat eating McDonalds.","time":1492719918,"resto":122033026,"id":"xmONyopG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

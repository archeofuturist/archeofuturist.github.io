I bet your games of LARPing about wearing wizard clothing shouting &quot;Fire Ball&quot; and each other is really &quot;Cool&quot; for you. <br><br>Mean while it is nothing more that SMOKE SCREEN. All to mask the real army moving in right under your pathetic Jewish noses. Heritage is being destroyed, traditional values and history of truth. It is nothing more than subversion to turn the far right to the left.<br><br>How? http:\/\/www.me-and-us.co.uk\/psheskil<wbr>ls\/bva.html This is the same philosophy being taught in communications. Everyone who does public speaking is taught that beliefs are hard to change and never the goal in open speech. But it can be done if you work backwards. <br><br>Attitude, Lose pride in the confederacy by associating it with Racial and Radical ideas.<br><br>Values, Not wanting to be associated with Radical and Racial Ideas, destroy everything Damnito Memoria. <br><br>Beliefs, make the radical and raciest believe their heritage, traditions, and beliefs are indeed just that and they will convert to your cause.

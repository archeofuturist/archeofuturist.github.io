Every thing that technology can do is one less thing that a human has to do to survive. You buy a car? That means you no longer have to walk everywhere. You lose strength. You lose fortitude. When technology and money are the modes of survival, women can bone the weak and survive, but there&#039;s a catch......<br><br>The child does not drive out of the vagina in a cadillac. We&#039;re all born several generations deep into a systemic weakening of the human gene-pool. And now, with the current and upcoming generations, throw in a society that has decided it is in love with weakness, autism, cuckoldry, shyness, homosexuality, disability and even disease. You have a recipe for disaster.<br><br>Even genuinely mildly retarded people can now have sex and live their lives (provided they willingly submit to a quiet slave life in a menial labor job, as mild-tards are usually very willing to do). <br><br>It&#039;s a cruelty to the future generations. It&#039;s a cruelty to the children who must be born to weak parents (and thus born in weak bodies) and it&#039;s the reason why women today are simply not very attractive :(","filename":"3dc569159e9ed5d899004c961231c4ac","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1635,"tn_w":152,"tn_h":249,"tim":1491799027079,"time":1491799027,"md5":"RjWCWqceZWRvBxkMAFtL5A==","fsize":1411354,"resto":0,"id":"MUyKUlXo","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-are-women-from-the-80s-and-90s-so-much-hotter","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":4,"unique_ips":8},{"no":120393551,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)00:42:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"mild-tards and half-tards are usually emotionally needy and become dependent on one other mild-tard or half-tard of the opposite sex. which means they pair-bond and breed. whilst the good, strong, sexy people in our society almost universally put off having children, or even partaking in long term relationships. This means the weak are breeding and the strong are not.<br><br>Nature was intended to give a woman babies from one night stands. She is supposed to bang the alpha and get knocked up. Birth Control has ruined natures mechanism to ensure that offspring are strong and healthy. Instead now, she might still have one night stands, but she will end up breeding with the weakest beta available, who will worship her out of his own weakness.<br><br>Is this misogyny? Is this wrong? Is this cruel? Do you think it&#039;s not wrong and cruel to bring a weak, infirmed child into this world? One who must be hooked up to all sorts of sensors and tubes in the hospital for its first weeks of life because it has failure to thrive? One that needs multiple operations to get it through its first years of life?

A fucking wall from California to Texas? Has anybody ever driven that distance? It&#039;s like 3 straight of driving through a flat desert road. It seems impossible, and also pointless. <br><br>Why doesn&#039;t he just drop it? I can tell he regrets ever making it his policy. It&#039;s fucking retarded, we can keep out the illegals other ways.","filename":"17795790_441117196224245_1653403401700884832_n","ext":".jpg","w":486,"h":442,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":227,"tim":1493438830702,"time":1493438830,"md5":"KpEm+aCcn5du7nTfRq1p0w==","fsize":55979,"resto":0,"id":"PUFxGNvT","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trumps-wall-is-stupid","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

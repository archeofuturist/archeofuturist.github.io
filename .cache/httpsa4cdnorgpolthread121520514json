To make things even more terrible, the scientist say that humans have a more ancient starting point since Abo DNA is 400,000 years old not 60,000 that jew scientist say it is. The common ancestor of blacks and eurasians is said to be something &quot;isnt of human origin&quot; meaning an unknown ancient proto-hominid mutated into blacks and abos and then one more into eurasians.","filename":"thefirsthumans","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":467,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":184,"tim":1492432551509,"time":1492432551,"md5":"arUD\/ZI\/AeuGbwWwV37UKA==","fsize":100598,"resto":0,"id":"29b8SW+r","country":"BS","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"out-of-africa-is-wrong-humans-came-from-australia","country_name":"Bahamas","replies":15,"images":1,"unique_ips":12},{"no":121520679,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:37:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121520514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121520514<\/a><br>BUMP","time":1492432663,"resto":121520514,"id":"29b8SW+r","country":"BS","country_name":"Bahamas"},{"no":121521124,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)08:42:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121520514\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121520514<\/a><br>Literally no.

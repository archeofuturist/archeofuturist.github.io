Except for relative risk values, all input parameters of the simulation model were based on data from The Netherlands. In sensitivity analyses the effects of epidemiologic parameters and cost definitions were assessed. Until age 56 y, annual health expenditure was highest for obese people. At older ages, smokers incurred higher costs. Because of differences in life expectancy, however, lifetime health expenditure was highest among healthy-living people and lowest for smokers. Obese individuals held an intermediate position.

The insurer is basically betting on your healthcare costing less than your premium over your lifetime.

That&#039;s pretty unlikely, and the chance of any one insurer getting suddenly stuck with a high bill on a new fat customer is potentially higher than healthy people.

I can&#039;t remember getting a call about booking two seats but we were trained to offer it.<br><br>Heck that Ruby person who had a reality show was over 700 lbs at one point, couldn&#039;t fly at all for long distances because she can&#039;t fit in the bathroom. When she was over 300, they booked a private plane for the tv crew and she took Immodium before flying so she wouldn&#039;t have to get up (does it work for peeing, too?). She sat next to her skinny relative and it seemed to work out even though she took up half his seat.","time":1490179185,"resto":117743796,"id":"9P3y0PdV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117746479,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)06:41:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117746104\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117746104<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;giving you the proper diets, fat removal surgery, exercise and etc<\/span><br><br>Just give them DNP, problem solved.","time":1490179317,"resto":117743796,"id":"SaWaBeg1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117746528,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)06:42:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117743796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117743796<\/a><br>THEY SHOULD CERTAINLY PAY MORE FOR AIRFARE.","time":1490179366,"resto":117743796,"id":"2GTtN9La","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117746547,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)06:43:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117743796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117743796<\/a><br>you are all imbeciles<br>how the hell would you enforce this? <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fag doctor charges 20 more for a consult because you are fat<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;literally hundreds of other doctors willing to do it at market price<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;fag doctor loses patients<\/span>","time":1490179382,"resto":117743796,"id":"BQjLULW4","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"},{"no":117746636,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)06:44:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117743796\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117743796<\/a><br>Yes.

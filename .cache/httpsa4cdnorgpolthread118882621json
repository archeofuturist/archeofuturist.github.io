It is known in occult circles as the black sun, the inner trauma that binds us to karmic cycles. The wound in Christ&#039;s side. This is the result of denial of self love, which is projected onto the external world, often resulting from a reaction to being position of subjugation to an oppressor and reflecting the others nature outwards. It might sound like hippy washy bullshit, but love is syntropy and homeostasis, which naturally arises OUT of chaos. You don&#039;t realize this because you are like a fish immersed in water, unconscious of the ocean. You, consciousness, arises out of the same chaotic fluctuations into which cyclically it perishes, however it&#039;s very arising suggests a momentum toward increased complexity as a consequence of increased entropy, an increase in the wavelength of the wave, within the universal system. This appears to happen in a fractal fashion as above so below.<br><br>My understanding is that there is an infinite mathematical set that consists of all self perpetuating patterns which give rise to stable coherent geometries with stable levels of entropy, enough novelty and redundancy to continue generation of a logarithmic growth pattern and also enough entropy to allow for robustness in adapting to fluctuation in the incoming data stream.<br>There is also however, an infinite set of patterns that are inherently self limiting and create vicious cycles of karmic annihilation. Whatever entity we may refer to as &quot;God&quot; must operationally consists of, by definition being of being the monad or source of all, of both these sets.<br>Entropy or ignorance is the operative function of God&#039;s primary creation algorithm.","filename":"16716324_10211921979782491_6736664086106300029_o","ext":".jpg","w":1364,"h":736,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":134,"tim":1490848185885,"time":1490848185,"md5":"LFYpPlDlKqwGl6tYs5w4JQ==","fsize":202888,"resto":0,"id":"GzvyunUJ","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-message-to-the-biological-intelligence-of-the","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":6,"unique_ips":4},{"no":118882688,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:30:28","name":"Coyote","com":"God is not anthropomorphic in his desires, although human motives are a reflection of the field of information within which it exists. And that field of information is what we are referring to as &quot;God.&quot; God&#039;s primary search algorithm in creation seems to center around the conquering of ignorance and the creation of &quot;knowledge of self&quot; which constitutes an increase in the coherency of God&#039;s stable field of self refracting fractal perception of itself. This is mirrored in biological evolution as well as the psychological evolution of individuals (as to the maxim, as above - so below). All forms of evil in creation arise from God&#039;s ignorance of parts of himself, which we as conscious beings, refractions of God&#039;s infinite knowing nature immersed in the field of his eternal ignorance are in the process of correcting through a process of logarithmic self-investigation.","filename":"pia20027_updated","ext":".jpg","w":3482,"h":1959,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490848228260,"time":1490848228,"md5":"tD\/PY9+PSJ05zF8COI\/r5Q==","fsize":1441656,"resto":118882621,"id":"GzvyunUJ","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118882851,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:32:10","name":"Coyote","com":"The universe was formless and void; chaos reigned supreme and ignorance inseminated the abyss, a child forming in reverberation over the surface of the abyssal waters; giving birth to samsara through the temple gates of Kali&#039;s womb, reborn through the wings of a Phoenix spread wide, the wind of creation danced over the surface of the waters, and Brahma opened his eyes.","filename":"14517609_1128956687189203_2477496490623960642_n","ext":".jpg","w":389,"h":512,"tn_w":94,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490848330562,"time":1490848330,"md5":"OMXnBCbEy2MNhm9l84mENw==","fsize":58797,"resto":118882621,"id":"GzvyunUJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118883715,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:41:26","name":"Coyote","com":"If platonic ideals exist there has to be a platonic ideal of a non idea. IF platonic ideas exist. So perhaps there is an idea that represents the primordial state of ignorance that a being is born into, or an idea that represents the primordial idea of entropy and novelty generation. Evil would be the result of the creation of less than perfect copy images of these platonic ideals. HOWEVER, EFFICIENCY, GOOD, AND HARMONY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO EXIST IF IT WERE NOT OUTLINED BY THE SHADOW OF ALL THAT IS NOT GOOD, EFFICIENT, AND IN HARMONY. Thus pain is the teacher of pleasure, and pleasure the teacher of pain. God&#039;s first crime was to have the idea to create novelty, which, because &quot;god&quot; existed as a perfect infinite being, de facto had to create an imperfect being with limitation, so God created the veils. Infinity had to be reduced to create time through the illusion of ignorance and separation. However there&#039;s a strong sense in me that the process of imperfection and the rectification of Tikkun Olam happens by default, in a way creating to eventual perfection which loops in on itself in an eternal cycle approaching but never quite reaching a certain value like a logarithmic spiral.<br>Also would a platonic ideal represent the best qualities of all the possible variations of an idea? And where does one idea stop and another begin, the borders seem kind of fuzzy as this entire process is mediated by time which is an illusion.<br>And I say time is an illusion because of relativity theory and time dilation which basically tells you the universe is a hologram and time dilation is a result of going from one informational point of entropy to another within the hologram. And if entropy is always increasing in the universe except for areas with life, and the universe is always growing and expanding, then the universes&#039; entropy de facto grows because it is expanding as entropy is a measure of ignorance and possibility.","filename":"17103238_1859822264299025_2984674446846123750_n","ext":".jpg","w":280,"h":480,"tn_w":72,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490848886082,"time":1490848886,"md5":"+enyPFvwGXJDQ0rk5Iud2A==","fsize":57109,"resto":118882621,"id":"GzvyunUJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118883774,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:42:08","name":"Coyote","com":"Therefore Choronzon is a platonic ideal of novelty but at the same time he is the source of all evil.<br>We ARE choronzon and the source of evil, as well as the source of all good.

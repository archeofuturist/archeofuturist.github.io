He really tried to do the right thing in Iran but the rescue was bungled by American military organization -- instead of one team, each different service insisted on having a piece, so you had Marine pilots flying an Air Force helicopter they had no experience with from Navy support craft. The Marines trained for months and by all accounts did an excellent job of learning the unfamiliar vehicle. They noticed a mechanical glitch and the manufacturer said it was nothing to worry about. Because of that glitch, made possible by the fetish for having squabbling military fiefdoms, the rescue ended catastrophically at a refueling point.","time":1493572601,"resto":123492753,"id":"rFdFGX68","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123499582,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)13:18:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123497219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123497219<\/a><br>I thought Carter is critical of Israel?<br><br><a href=\"#p123498909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123498909<\/a><br>Not based, but better than Raygun.

If 1 out of the first 5 replies to this post isn&#039;t &quot;kill urself faget&quot; I might stick around to answer your questions. I have general knowledge of things you may be curious about. Illuminati? Yes. I have never signed a nondisclosure agreement, although President William J. Clinton asked me to in 1994, but I refused. Here&#039;s a warning in advance. Things may seem controversial to you, but I&#039;m a jaded son of a gun that&#039;s been through the wringer more than once. I won&#039;t insult you, but I will explain things literally in a way that tends to depolemicize.","filename":"As Good As It Gets 2","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":900,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493354118734,"time":1493354118,"md5":"21zKiIFrnCtCMbuWjbzU8g==","fsize":204504,"resto":0,"id":"PgQ6LZM5","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"general-contract-since-1990-mkultra-ama","country_name":"United States","replies":22,"images":0,"unique_ips":13},{"no":123147730,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:37:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123147477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123147477<\/a><br>Kill urself faggot","time":1493354252,"resto":123147477,"id":"RhDwNyEk","country":"KR","country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":123147823,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:38:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123147477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123147477<\/a><br>Kill yourself faggot","time":1493354295,"resto":123147477,"id":"IiTnd6Ho","country":"KR","country_name":"South Korea"},{"no":123147884,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:38:42","name":"Blizzard Guy","com":"<a href=\"#p123147730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123147730<\/a><br><br>hope you don&#039;t play starcraft, otherwise you&#039;ll probably end up feeling apologetic","time":1493354322,"resto":123147477,"id":"PgQ6LZM5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123147919,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:39:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123147477\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123147477<\/a><br>kill yourself faggot","time":1493354344,"resto":123147477,"id":"S\/etlDIg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123148082,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:40:31","name":"Blizzard Guy","com":"interesting coincidence that I was listening to this song on youtube and the first 2 posters were from south korea<br><br>https:\/\/youtu.be\/1rmo3fKeveo","time":1493354431,"resto":123147477,"id":"PgQ6LZM5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123148088,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)00:40:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123147884\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123147884<\/a><br>What is the Illuminati&#039;s plan for one world government?

All indicators suggest that Donald has reached the end of his patience and he&#039;s getting ready to squash North Korea once and for all, and oddly enough, China and Japan both seem to be on-board with it. Despite all this, North Korea keeps running tests like they think they&#039;re going to get away with it. What&#039;s their deal? They should be literally begging for their lives at this point.","filename":"160210-north-korea-2230_75e488f50468a97dc27052e4d3794e67.nbcnews-ux-2880-1000","ext":".jpg","w":1517,"h":1000,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":164,"tim":1493425273615,"time":1493425273,"md5":"DWu4Z6C3iykD6LA8IjxnNA==","fsize":186323,"resto":0,"id":"\/UjmLXoI","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"can-somebody-explain-to-me-what-the-fuck-the-dprk","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":0,"unique_ips":11},{"no":123269445,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)20:22:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"Read Sun Tzu.

Have they considered their incapacity to have abstraction in politics is what keeps the glass ceiling? That their unapologetic complicity in warmongering is the motor of a disastrous international politics?

Most women joined politics in order to virtue signal in a more public space. The fact that it&#039;s a male dominated realm also contributes to a primal need for attention. However, as most in politics get free female attention from elsewhere, they ignore the cries from young female politiciansand go about consolidating their power. This in turn angers many a young female politician and they then start to radicalize, thinking that the reason why they&#039;re not getting attention is that they&#039;re not doing anything to draw attention to themselves.

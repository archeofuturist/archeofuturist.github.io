Do you want to be a lawyer, doctor, engineer, nurse, pharmacist, dentist, or other regulated profession? Then the answer is an obvious yes. Do you want to be a business executive, work in consulting, work in government, or have a white collar job? Then the answer is also a yes. Do you want to do a trade or work with your hands? Don&#039;t go to college (not bad mouthing those jobs btw, but also keep in mind most people in the upper tiers of society are not tradesmen). Do you want to work at a bottom tier job? Don&#039;t go to college. <br><br>You may have realized that most of the above require a graduate like degree (e.g. MD, MBA, JD, DDS, etc). That is because most undergraduate degrees only get you to the middle class tier at best. There are a select few that will get you to upper middle that are otherwise reserved for professional degrees. The best course of action for college is the following:<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Be smart (i.e. get a scholarship)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get into a sensible undergraduate degree (includes engineering, accounting, nursing, and some computer science. this is a closed list)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get internships.Given the above fields they should be paid internships. <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Get a professional degree (MBA, DDS, MD, JD, etc)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do not get an academic graduate degree unless you are really intelligent (IQ of 130+), really hard working (compared to others be the top 10 % of hard working people), got into a good school, and really REALLY want to do research (as you could make more money doing the professional degree thing).<\/span><br><br>Your college experience will be worse with each of the above bullets you don&#039;t follow. College is very much a entry ticket to the professional world which has major rewards if you don&#039;t fuck up (e.g. a six figure job where you can sit on your ass in an air condition office writing documents).

Also it has 3 bomb shelters underneath it. If you ever wonder why he&#039;s golfing while we&#039;re carrying out big overseas military operations, that&#039;s probably why. He looks like he&#039;s careless on the golf course, in reality he&#039;s 30sec away from a fallout shelter. Mostly it&#039;s because of the surveillance I&#039;m sure. Also he&#039;s saved 100x more in wasteful spending than he&#039;ll ever spend in added security and travel. Furthermore if liberals weren&#039;t so radical and intolerant, maybe he wouldn&#039;t have to have such a high security cost.","time":1492359906,"resto":121372612,"id":"6vS9II1p","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121376841,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)12:26:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121372863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121372863<\/a><br>This.

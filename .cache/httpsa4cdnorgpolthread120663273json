And don&#039;t get me started on the street performers outside the space Needle. Speaking of the space Needle, do you know how long the line is for that damn thing? You wait about thirty minutes just to get your ticket, then you move an inch per mituite until you get shoved into a small sardine packed elevator with fifteen other people, only to spend five minutes shoving regards out of your way to get onto the outside of the observation deck, which is crowded as hell too.<br><br>Then you got your baseball and football games where you sit in the blistering heat for an hour for the game to begin. And forget about concessions, a damn cup of beer is nine bucks. And we&#039;re just talking normie shit like Bud light. Would you like a burg to munch on during the game?

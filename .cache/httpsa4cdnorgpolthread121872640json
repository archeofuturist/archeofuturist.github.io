I don&#039;t go into churches, I don&#039;t pray... but there is something in the scripture that is beyond our compreension.<br><br>ESA recently announced that our magnetic field is weakening faster than they expected. There are a group of scientists that don&#039;t discard the possibility that the earth is in the middle of a pole shift.<br><br>You know what is expected to happen in a pole shift? Tsunamis, Earthquakes, Birds\/Fishes (and animals that sense the magnetic field) dying, Volcanoes. All those things are mentioned in the scriptures.<br><br>Even the blood moons... the blood moons that are mentioned in the scriptures are about to happen. By the next year it is expected that we have 4 blood moons. That&#039;s amazing.","filename":"ajesusthinking","ext":".jpg","w":352,"h":309,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":219,"tim":1492624981973,"time":1492624981,"md5":"nanRAnUGR312gxlVitMYFA==","fsize":29836,"resto":0,"id":"3CObGZdN","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ive-been-watching-what-is-happening-in-the-world","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":2,"unique_ips":5},{"no":121872963,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)14:05:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121872640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121872640<\/a><br>You ought to look into Christianity","time":1492625158,"resto":121872640,"id":"MY0kR4RI","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121873079,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)14:07:01","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IMG_0994","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":1136,"tn_w":70,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492625221449,"time":1492625221,"md5":"K9w1lDhmpCEtNuAMlgBR1A==","fsize":113464,"resto":121872640,"id":"ml+KIR7r","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121873113,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)14:07:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121872640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121872640<\/a><br>the poles shift all the time, it&#039;s literally nothing.

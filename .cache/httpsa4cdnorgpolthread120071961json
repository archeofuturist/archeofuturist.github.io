My moderate friend texted me last night (it should be known that he didn&#039;t vote for Hillary or Trump and we regularly get into arguments since I&#039;m pro-Trump) and was cheering and happy that Trump launched the missiles. I tried explaining that the only two options for Syria right now are Assad and ISIS. I was trying to convince him that this was a seriously risky move by Trump, but he was just pumped that we sent some fireworks over there. People don&#039;t understand the subtle nuances of dealing with the Syria problem. Back in 2013, a U.N. investigation concluded that it was the rebels who used the chemical weapons, not Assad. Trump didn&#039;t even let an investigation happen. He saw pictures on TV and decided to bomb Assad. That is not smart.","time":1491620673,"resto":120071961,"id":"7cV75Cdj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120075885,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)23:05:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120075696\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120075696<\/a><br>try reading what I wrote again.

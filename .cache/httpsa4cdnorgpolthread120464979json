Just consider the following: currently all EU states have their own air defense forces including in most cases their own fighter jets which patrol their own airspaces. Polish planes may not enter German airspace and German planes may not enter Polish airspace. This is a massively inefficient and obsolete way of protecting Europe.<br><br>Another example: right now the EU has 4 aircraft carriers: 1 French, 1 Spanish and 2 Italian ones. The problem is that except for the French one, they aren&#039;t real aircraft carriers that can project power. With an EU military, it would be possible to at least have a fleet of 4-5 capable aircraft carriers.<br><br>At 2% GDP for defense, the EU by 2020 would have a close to 300 billion defense budget (higher if the UK were still in the EU, but it is exiting). 300 billion is enough for a good Navy, a credible airforce, a combined nuclear force of about 500 ICBMs and a dozen or so nuclear subs, and a 1.3 million troop army (down from a combined 1.8 million troop level now).","filename":"download","ext":".png","w":381,"h":132,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":86,"tim":1491846984038,"time":1491846984,"md5":"2o6V1035bCdZWRguDFWjRQ==","fsize":4318,"resto":0,"id":"yIEZLl6n","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"eu-military-when","country_name":"Germany","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":120465096,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:57:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120464979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120464979<\/a><br>What language would the EU army speak?","time":1491847038,"resto":120464979,"id":"+jWG109D","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120465195,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:58:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Never.<br>And this is a good.","time":1491847082,"resto":120464979,"id":"9FrawetP","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120465297,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:58:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120465096\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120465096<\/a><br>it all sounds the same anyway","filename":"SWEDISH-CHEF-psd71677","ext":".png","w":400,"h":400,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491847122596,"time":1491847122,"md5":"UUeihVQR0bp1GW088Qw1Kw==","fsize":449127,"resto":120464979,"id":"g6LP6qQC","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":120465400,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)13:59:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120464979\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120464979<\/a><br><br>They&#039;re well on their way, don&#039;t worry.","time":1491847169,"resto":120464979,"id":"5y7mF2oY","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

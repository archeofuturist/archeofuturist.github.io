Even after American troops arrived on the ground in Iraq, an incident happened where a group of Peshmerga fighters was killed and their commander survived, but can no longer walk or speak. It was reportedly friendly fire,\u201d Fuad Masum told RIA Novosti.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;\u201cFor instance, in the old city there are no proper streets, only paths maybe two meters wide or less. Armor cannot go there and neither can cars. And IS is using this terrain, using people as a human shield,\u201d he explained, adding that the terrorists \u201cfire at planes from rooftops and their snipers shoot at Iraqi troops from there. And if we hit them with airstrikes, many people would die.\u201d<\/span><br><br>Can&#039;t wait for the Dems calling the Iraqi president a genocider and a racist.","filename":"1339359564451","ext":".jpg","w":544,"h":463,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":212,"tim":1490700354047,"time":1490700354,"md5":"Thmu5ZzkgeYwNObhhfXr0Q==","fsize":171788,"resto":0,"id":"eXwYCLKR","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"though-civilians-are-being-killed-in-mosul-as","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

He reacts to things and occasionally plots countermoves, but isn&#039;t particularly subtle or cunning. He&#039;s also verbally inept to a degree that is stunning. His Twitter feed has lost all steam and is now impotent. Trump sincerely pushed the healthcare bill and failed to use its collapse against Ryan. Despite Ryan not being a friend to Trump or Trump&#039;s agenda, he continues to suck up to him. Trump actually conceded that his victory was due in part to Russian interference -- this is perhaps the most damning indictment against this stupid claim. To concede something for which there&#039;s no firm evidence (the DNC wasn&#039;t hacked and Podesta&#039;s password was password) amounts to delegitimatizing oneself. To what end was this done? Trump blathered about Taiwan and then folded. He absolutely folded and failed to use the Taiwan squabble constructively -- it wasn&#039;t leveraged at all. Trump isn&#039;t perspicacious. His understanding of things is superficial at best and, it would seem, he&#039;s intellectually lazy.<br><br>If I were a betting man, I&#039;d bet against major US intervention in Syria.

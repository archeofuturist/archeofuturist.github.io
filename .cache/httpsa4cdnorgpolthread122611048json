Free-trade doesn&#039;t work, and it only ever benefits a small elite who live off the returns on capital. (((Free Trade))) also means free movement of people, as capital and labour flow together around the world. Firms either outsource jobs to the 3rd world, or, since only 10% of a nation&#039;s capital is liquid, the government, lobbied by (((business interests))) import the third world here. This is why Macron likes immigration. Because free-trade, mass immigration, and unrestrained capitalism only benefits the oligarchs at the expense of the labourer.","time":1493055599,"resto":122611048,"id":"C9e7UKXR","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122612740,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:40:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122612177\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122612177<\/a><br>They were until you forcibly shuttered their doors.","time":1493055647,"resto":122611048,"id":"I6nC1Soa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122612835,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)13:41:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"Did you know that American honey is legally not required to contain ANY honey? its you guessed it high fructose corn syrup.

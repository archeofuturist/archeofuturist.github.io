It probably originally did not have connotations of doing evil, but rather, some kind of magic forbidden due to association with the practices of idol worshippers. The traditional commentators tell us that it mentions women alone here because men are mentioned separately, in Deuteronomy. The more academic answer is probably that the Exodus verse is a late JE text, and probably only refers to priestess-practitioners of magic associated with forbidden goddess-worship; the Deuteronomy text is a D text, of course, and probably has much wider meanings.<br><br>Deut. 18:10-11<br><br>There shall not be found among you anyone ....that useth divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter or a witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer.<br><br>The verses 10-14 in Hebrew read: &quot;Lo yimatzei bekha ma&#039;avir beno uvito b&#039;eish, kosem k&#039;samim, me&#039;onen, menakhesh, umekhashef.

One who passes his son or daughter through fire. For the worship of the god Molekh, whose practices demanded human sacrifice, often in the form of burnt children. From this, and from the succeding verses, it is generally agreed that this list of practices was deemed to fall under the category of deeds Israelites were commanded to avoid because of their use by idolatrous neighboring peoples.<br>2. A diviner of divinations. One who divines, either by extispicy, sileximancy, stipomancy, cartomancy, or suchlike. However, the Tosafist Rabbis of 12-14th century France authored several Jewish legal responsa which clarified that this prohibition specifically refers either to extispicy alone, or to any divination method so long as it is done by invoking the power or guidance of any god but the One God.<br>The word &quot;kosem&quot; comes from the root QSM (kuf-samekh-mem), having to do with dividing or distributing things, or assigning them.<br>3. A soothsayer. Specifically, a nubilomancer: one who divines by gazing at cloud patterns. The word me&#039;onen comes from the root &#039;NN (ayin-nun-nun) meaning &quot;a cloud.&quot;","time":1492615095,"resto":121840238,"id":"i8khDeDU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121854735,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:19:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121854648\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121854648<\/a><br><br>4. An augur. Specifically, a colubromancer: one who either divines or casts spells using snakes, either real or symbolic. This may be a diviner, or a sorcerer. Colubromancers were often healers, and indeed, Moses is instructed to use sympathetic colubromancy to heal the people (Numbers 21:4-9). This discrepancy is one of the key arguments that show JE had no problems with many kinds of magic that D\/P find irredeemable.<br>5. Witch. the word translated as &quot;witch&quot; in the Hebrew Scriptures is &quot;mekhashef\/ah&quot; from the root kaf-shin-peih. Now, that root is itself the product of a proto-Hebraic Akkadianism meaning &quot;to cut&quot; or &quot;to shred.&quot; Thus, it is likely that it referred to one of the following two kinds of sorcerous practitioner: either a maker of blood magics or diviner by extispicy (i.e., mekhashef = &quot;one who cuts flesh to get blood&quot;), or perhaps alternatively to a maker of potions and herbal brews (i.e., mekhashef = &quot;one who shreds herbs into a pot&quot;).<br>6. Charmer of spells. One who casts binding spells. Possibly an exorcist, or one who allows themselves to be posessed of spirits or demons. The root kHBR (khet-bet-resh) refers to joining or binding or knotting something up tightly, and can also indicate the reverse: unbinding, releasing, or untying a knot. <br><br>7. Consulter of Ov and Yidoni. In the Talmud (Sanhedrin, 4th chapter), a baal (one who consults Ov) is defined as one who speaks from his armpit, which the commentators believe refers to summoning a spirit which, for some reason, speaks out of the sorcerer&#039;s armpit. But it might also simply refer to a charlatan, who throws his voice to imitate the spirit speaking; this latter was later the opinion of the Rambam (Moses Maimonides). A baal (consulter of Yidoni), according to BT Sanhedrin, is one who takes an enchanted bone, places it in his mouth, and then the spirit or demon or miscellaneous entity speaks through him.","time":1492615147,"resto":121840238,"id":"i8khDeDU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121854792,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:19:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121853816\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121853816<\/a><br><br>My current understanding is that the spiritual roots of christianity were the attempts of answering questions about reality with the toolset of mysticism.<br>&quot;The Church&quot; is more an abuser of the heritage, or misinterprets elements of it as a measure of control.<br><br>My question is: why does this persist?

It is also possible that this refers to a practice of using a death-talisman, placed in the mouth, or bound to body parts, in order to evoke a spirit or demon to possess the magician temporarily (one hopes). The same Tosafist Rabbis who were lenient in defining &quot;kesem&quot; and permitting divination, tell us that Ov and Yidoni are an entirely different matter, and there is no permitting such magic, for it is all black magic.<br><br>8. A necromancer. This referred originally specifically to the practice of calling up the soul of a dead person, in order to ask them questions. The Tosafist Rabbis tell us that attempting to raise a dead body into life is also forbidden. However, they say that it is not forbidden to ask questions of dead spirits if one shows up without being called, nor to pose questions to a medium if the medium is not summoning the dead, but only listening to those spirits already present.<br><br>The following verses make clear that these practices are being interdicted due to prevalence among the Seven Nations, whose practices are forbidden to the Israelites. The word choices and forms in Hebrew are fairly clear in indicating that all these things are connected, and that it is because of the dedication of the indigenous Canaanitish peoples to priests or shamans who use such magics in the services of their foreign gods that YHVH is taking away their land and giving it to the Children of Israel. In any case, this is a very clear example of D-text outlawing magical practices not only accepted by JE, but included in canonical Tanakh stories as examples of the magical powers of Israelite heroes and prophets.<br><br>Cont.","time":1492615711,"resto":121840238,"id":"i8khDeDU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121855825,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)11:29:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121855719\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121855719<\/a><br> <br>The best discussions of these matters in the Jewish tradition have never been accurately translated from Hebrew and Aramaic.

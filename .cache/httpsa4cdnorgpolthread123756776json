Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493723590917,"time":1493723590,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"iasehG5o","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":20,"images":9,"unique_ips":13},{"no":123756909,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)07:15:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123756776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123756776<\/a><br>Fuck You<br>\/thread and Saged.","time":1493723710,"resto":123756776,"id":"uCtYRlG+","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":123757205,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)07:19:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123756909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123756909<\/a><br><br>Are you horny comrade?","filename":"c5e1d59ab11c19da5e074a9473f15cacc6f2152fceb62dae429dc0f00361e41b","ext":".jpg","w":1500,"h":3000,"tn_w":62,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493723951328,"time":1493723951,"md5":"bBAnxMHEvaaUi3YnryLD4w==","fsize":792668,"resto":123756776,"id":"iasehG5o","country":"ES","m_img":1,"country_name":"Spain"},{"no":123757215,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)07:19:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123756776\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123756776<\/a><br><br>Happy belated May Day, comrade! <br><br>Let me get the thread started with a question of strategy for us: now that the Cold War is over, and international communism has lost its major state supporters worldwide, how do we proceed with the cause of the working class?

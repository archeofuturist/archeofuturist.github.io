Thimerosal has been an ingredient in vaccines and biologicals since the 1930s but, with increases in recommended childhood immunization doses, by the 1990s it became possible for a six month old infant to have been exposed to a cumulative dose of organic mercury that exceeded certain limits set by government health agencies. This, paired with the immense growth in numbers of children diagnosed with autism in the 1990s prompted many in and out of the autism community to wonder if there could be a connection.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The body of evidence gathered through epidemiologic research to date does not currently support a causal relationship between thimerosal in childhood vaccines and autism risk. However, it is very difficult for even the best epidemiologic study to rule out the existence of small susceptible subgroups of children with autism in whom thimerosal exposure may have played a causal role.<\/span>","filename":"1488242885294","ext":".png","w":780,"h":800,"tn_w":243,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492750621394,"time":1492750621,"md5":"J7YId9MUwYzTxyaTjUcTvg==","fsize":157607,"resto":0,"id":"nyn1XyHt","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"do-vacines-cause-autism","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

On Saturday morning, a federal judge followed suit, issuing a preliminary order staying the executions in response to a lawsuit mounted by the death-row inmates.<br><br>State officials quickly vowed to fight both orders, which added further uncertainty to a situation that had recently made Arkansas the epicenter of the country\u2019s debate over the death penalty. The state\u2019s original plan to execute eight inmates over 11 days, an unprecedented schedule, has prompted criticism from former corrections officials and drawn national attention. Arkansas has said this scheduled is needed because one of its lethal drugs will expire at the end of the month.<br><br>The executions in Arkansas were scheduled to begin Monday evening with two back-to-back lethal injections, with double executions following on three other nights. Court orders have already delayed two of the planned executions, including an Arkansas Supreme Court order on Friday afternoon that stayed one of the lethal injections planned for Monday.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-15 at 10.10.07 AM","ext":".png","w":1552,"h":1170,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":188,"tim":1492265515512,"time":1492265515,"md5":"\/Sz2Gv0jVenrtfeWSD9bvA==","fsize":1403644,"resto":0,"id":"iip4ZrXb","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"modern-human-sacrifice-ordainers-btfo","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":7},{"no":121214027,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)10:16:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why not just hang the fuckers","time":1492265809,"resto":121213658,"id":"RsppaWWw","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121214322,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)10:20:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121214027\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121214027<\/a><br>This.

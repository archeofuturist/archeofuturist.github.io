Laos got granted autonomy later until 1953 when it become a independant country in the form of a democratic monarchy. Sadly it fell into the Vietnam War and become a proxy war between the Royal Lao government and its American allies and the Pathet Lao (a communist Lao group closely aligned with Viet Minh). CIA covert operations were also present which is why the civil war in Laos is nicknamed the &quot;Secret War&quot;. Laos fell under control by the Pathet Lao in May 1975 and established a communist state 8 months later (December 2).<br><br>&quot;The existence of the conflict in Laos was sometimes reported in the U.S., and described in press reports as the CIA&#039;s &quot;Secret War in Laos&quot; because details were largely unavailable due to official government denials that the war existed. The denials were seen as necessary considering that the North Vietnamese government and the U.S. had both signed agreements specifying the neutrality of Laos. U.S. involvement was considered necessary because North Vietnam had effectively conquered a large part of the country and was equally obfuscating its role in Laos. Despite these denials, however, the Civil War was actually the largest U.S. covert operation prior to the Soviet\u2013Afghan War, with areas of Laos controlled by North Vietnam subjected to years of intense US aerial bombardment, representing the heaviest bombing campaign in history. Overshadowing it all was the struggle of the Cold War, with the United States&#039; policy of the containment of communism and the policies of the People&#039;s Republic of China and the Soviet Union of spreading communism via subversion and insurgency.&quot;","time":1490951949,"resto":119034511,"id":"jZbE3V3l","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":119039841,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)05:20:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119038897\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119038897<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;SJWs here and there do more than beta males that can&#039;t stand up to the (((progressive))) mindset.<\/span><br><br>&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;beta males&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot; that voice disagreement in opinion on Non-White people arriving here risk losing their<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Job, ie source of income<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Life, ie killed by SJW lynch mobs or 2 gunshots to the head suicides :^)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ability to get heard at all (the owners of our (((media))) shut off any dissenting voices, never invites __openly_ anti-immigration people for debates - only Civic Nationalist cucks like Sweden Demcrats (s) that only want to deport illegal muslims while allowing legal tax-paying muslims\/jews\/nigs to stay and outbreed us further)<\/span><br><br>About that last point, the stuff you hear from swedes on \/pol\/ or YouTube comments is hardly every voice IRL or in newspapers or anywhere where someone might document it, because social ostracizing -----&gt; fired from work or lynch mob&#039;d by white marxists and nonwhite dindu\/SJW hordes<br><br>Swedes already have a reputation of being &quot;Silent&quot; and &quot;Cold&quot; to strangers, so why do you assume that the vocal minority of SJW - who take up normie media space JUST AS THE WHAT WE&#039;VE SEEN IN THE U.S. ELECTIONS - represent our populace in its entirety","time":1490952055,"resto":119034511,"id":"sE3r0M4Z","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119039915,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)05:22:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119034662\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119034662<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hey man he had a job and a family. he was working. cant split up families.<\/span><br><br>So fucking what?

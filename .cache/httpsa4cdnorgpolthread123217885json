A lot of the time, the term rape culture is used to describe the culture of dehumanization, named so because that&#039;s what the act of rape does too. Rape, of course, is included, and that&#039;s where men&#039;s issues become tremendously important to discuss, but cat-calling is part of rape culture because of how disproportionately it targets women for the sake of dehumanizing.<br><br><a href=\"#p123230047\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123230047<\/a><br><br>This is just where we&#039;re gonna have to fundamentally disagree, but, on an interesting note, do you think girls aren&#039;t as distracted by guys wearing more revealing clothes?","time":1493406519,"resto":123217885,"id":"C1pucRMj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123231170,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)15:09:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123230711\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123230711<\/a><br>Yeah this should be a huge red flag.

Kaczynski&#039;s govt did a lot of bad things already, but at least they do a bit of good, especially regarding the promotion of Polish identity and sovereignty, as well as anti-immigration politics. This is enough for this govt to be a large improvement over the liberal govt we had for 8 years. Sure, besides those two things they mostly suck, but it&#039;s not like we had realistically a better alternative. Of course Kukiz 15 got a lot of votes in elections, that I must admit, but not for one moment did I delude myself that this would be the breakthrough in Polish two-party political scene. Maybe in the next elections something will change and we&#039;ll finally get a govt other than PiS or PO, but I think it&#039;s unlikely.","time":1493928617,"resto":124094741,"id":"5fb3sFtM","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":124103402,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)16:10:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124098319\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124098319<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124099595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124099595<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124099735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124099735<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124100208\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124100208<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124100863\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124100863<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124101173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124101173<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124101473\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124101473<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124101871\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124101871<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124102329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124102329<\/a><br><a href=\"#p124103012\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124103012<\/a><br>hey mr macron.<br>hows that 70 year old pooonani l m o a","time":1493928618,"resto":124094741,"id":"Qeijp9fJ","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":124103479,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)16:11:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124102536\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124102536<\/a><br>this map is a lie, as we had a terrorist attack last year, luckily a failed attempt- but what else can you expect from alt-right Korwin supporter lol","time":1493928661,"resto":124094741,"id":"ZiBbS5mh","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":124103504,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)16:11:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124101635\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124101635<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Implying the disapora aren&#039;t the biggest supporters of the Polish government even amongst educated people<\/span><br><br>It&#039;s like you don&#039;t know anything","time":1493928672,"resto":124094741,"id":"X8e\/WFpA","country":"CH","country_name":"Switzerland"},{"no":124103538,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)16:11:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124094741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124094741<\/a><br>If you want to use Poland in discussion, look at the economy (structure, exports and major owners) and show your fellow amphibians, how a german takeover ends for a country.

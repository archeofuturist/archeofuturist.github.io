And if so, how would you do it?<br><br>Personally, I&#039;d make a fixed proportion of seats (for arguments sake, let&#039;s say 70%) directly elected every 5 years, like the house of commons. However, candidates can in no way be affiliated with any political party and cannot run as part of a party (it is okay if they were part of a political party, but they must leave the party before becoming a lord).<br><br>The other 30% would be made up of members of institutions within the UK, similar to the guilds in the City of London. The CofE would have a fixed number that they nominate every 5 years. As would the Police, Fire service, NHS, Armed Forces, etc.<br><br>The executive power of the Lords would stay the same.","filename":"13-House-of-Lords-AFP-Gettyv2","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1536,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491855023168,"time":1491855023,"md5":"6vY3kUJu8xnnhak64XtZyA==","fsize":1093169,"resto":0,"id":"oL62q8aG","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"does-the-house-of-lords-need-reform-and-if-so-how","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

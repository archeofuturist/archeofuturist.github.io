When the early Northern states began to industrialize, the only way the South could maintain economic relevance while sticking to its agrarian roots was to keep the profit margins on its cash crops high. The South accomplished this by cutting costs in manpower (the most expensive part of any operation) through the use of African slaves. The reason they used Blacks is because they could be easily identified in a society of European (primarily British) decent.<br><br>BUT, slavery is really fucking mean thing to do, and if you&#039;re not an asshole, which most people aren&#039;t, you won&#039;t be mean to people arbitrarily. Thus it was in the South&#039;s best interest to encourage the idea that Blacks were less than human, or at the very least a lesser class of human being as compared to Europeans. This way, nobody would bat an eye at the abuse of the Blacks, and the South could continue to exploit extremely cheap labor. <br><br>This ended up being a big fucking deal, and the slow death of slavery led to the bloodiest war in all of American history and the massive and persistent economic inferiority of the Southern States. This economic stagnation to this day still makes the South really fucking mad. Combine this with the fact that race baiting - the societal facilitation of slavery - ended up outliving the institution of slavery, and you have a recipe for a lot of hate and oppression.<br><br>Snap back to Blacks. The culture of American Blacks is rooted in ignorance imposed by the Southern states. Combined with a lot of fucking resentment for the treatment of their forebears, this gave birth to a characteristically aggressive culture that distrusts authority and the rule of law (the tools used to oppress them). <br><br>Fast forward a few hundred years.

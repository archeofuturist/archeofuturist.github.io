Genes and their expression are heavily influenced by the environment and the stressors that come with it. These stressors come in the form of both eustress and distress. The longer these genes are expressed in a certain way in response to the environment, the longer they will continue to be expressed independently of environment in their offspring. It will take awhile for the genes to express themselves differently in response to different stressors when introduced to a new environment. However, this is very difficult and examples can actually be seen in southerners. <br><br>In the south, for whatever reason, there were more distressors that elicited a genetic expression of high cortisol levels. Over time, the genes responsible for increased cortisol levels were passed down to the southerner&#039;s offspring and children were being born with elevated cortisol levels and an increased cortisol response to environmental stressors independent of their environment. It is for this reason that southerner&#039;s tend to be more violent than northerners and quicker to anger in general.<br><br>Once those genes are flipped on and expressed in a certain way, they are passed on to children. Unless the environment offers opportunity for different expression of these genes and multigenerational inheritance of these genes, the undesireable expression of these genes will be very difficult to change without mutation.<br><br>Epigenetics is a thing, and it&#039;s the next red pill.","time":1490593141,"resto":118466910,"id":"vWCrj1Ua","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118477833,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)01:40:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=ICs<wbr>PQnGJEpY<br><br>Here&#039;s another Sowell video where he talks about wealth, poverty, and politics.","time":1490593252,"resto":118466910,"id":"OLqQbO\/O","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118478215,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)01:44:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118476244\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118476244<\/a><br>when kids were given IQ tests that were based on inferring how many blocks were stacked in a 3d arrangement, the blacks and whites did about the same on these tests.<br><br>it&#039;s only on the verbal\/reading comprehension that they differed, because the black kids were not educated in reading and writing. somewhere in that video Sowell mentions that the black kids didn&#039;t know the meaning of the word &quot;opposite&quot; so they all failed a certain question. it&#039;s not a lack of intelligence, it&#039;s a lack of knowledge.<br><br>but if you are constantly told in a welfare society that the reason you don&#039;t have what other people have is because they are keeping you down, and you buy into it, you&#039;re not going to try hard in school, and therefore you&#039;ll never gain knowledge.<br><br>that is what has been happening in america since the 1960&#039;s in a nutshell, and now it&#039;s spreading to other places like here","time":1490593486,"resto":118466910,"id":"OLqQbO\/O","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

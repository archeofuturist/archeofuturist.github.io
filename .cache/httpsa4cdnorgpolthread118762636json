It has been estimated that as a result of Earth&#039;s rotation on its axis during its formative state, polar depressions and openings thus formed would measure about 1,400 miles in diameter. <br><br>Some of the original fire and incandescent materials remained in the center of Earth to form a central &#039;sun&#039;, much smaller, of course, than our Sun, but capable of emitting light and supporting plant growth. We shall also see that the Aurora Borealis and Aurora Australis that illuminate the sky over the poles come from this central &#039;sun&#039; whose rays shine through the polar openings. Thus, if Earth was originally a ball of fire and molten metal, some of this fire remained in its centre, while centrifugal force as a result of its rotation on its axis caused its solid matter to be thrown toward the surface, forming a solid crust and leaving its interior hollow, with a fiery ball in its centre, forming the central sun, which provides illumination for plant, animal and human life.<br><br>&quot;The Church says the Earth is flat, but I know that it is round, for I have seen its shadow on the Moon, for I have more faith in a shadow than in the Church.&quot; - Ferdinand Magellan","filename":"flatfagsbtfo","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1490775829986,"time":1490775829,"md5":"8aasvMZx0L1NMV8u1TOUcA==","fsize":21778,"resto":118762636,"id":"xodsccLu","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118764146,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)04:24:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118764031\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118764031<\/a><br>Pretty sure you called me out the other flat earth thread my child","time":1490775844,"resto":118762636,"id":"26jv\/IeS","country":"VA","country_name":"Holy See (Vatican City State)"},{"no":118764182,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)04:24:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118764093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118764093<\/a><br>What&#039;s wrong, darkie?","time":1490775875,"resto":118762636,"id":"0mZgd7bM","country":"SI","country_name":"Slovenia"},{"no":118764201,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)04:24:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118762636\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118762636<\/a><br>Shaq is lit","time":1490775888,"resto":118762636,"id":"H21zZoVZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118764214,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)04:25:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118763575\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118763575<\/a><br>This doesn&#039;t account for Antarctica.","time":1490775900,"resto":118762636,"id":"GLeDJ8Wh","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118764376,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)04:27:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118764214\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118764214<\/a><br><br>Why do you think no one has colonized antarctica yet?

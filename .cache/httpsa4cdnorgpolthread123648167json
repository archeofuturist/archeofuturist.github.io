But Republicans insisted on an April 28 deadline. They argued the House and Senate would spend the first few months of the Trump administration repealing and replacing ObamaCare. Confirming the President\u2019s Cabinet would consume months. Then there would be the confirmation process for Trump\u2019s Supreme Court selection. This would all chew up weeks. So congressional leaders elected to punt on government spending until late April. After all, many of the annual spending bills for fiscal 2017 \u2013 which runs through Sept. 30 \u2013 were close to completion late last year. How hard could it be? Well, it was. Senate Democrats slowed confirmations for many of the president\u2019s cabinet members to a crawl. Democrats dragged out debates and votes in the middle of the night and at the crack of dawn. House Republicans stumbled badly to approve a bill to repeal and replace ObamaCare, exhausting countless cubic centimeters of political oxygen on that process over the past several weeks.<\/span>","time":1493661085,"resto":123648167,"id":"O2pCKvZV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123648522,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:51:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123648368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123648368<\/a><br>When will he be back on Tucker?

After they successfully got Republicans to jettison all of Trump\u2019s priorities, Democrats secured the Puerto Rico bailout. And while the bill does not contain an Obamacare bailout (cost-sharing subsidies), the White House agreed to continue illegally promulgating the insurer bailout without congressional appropriations as part of the condition for Democrats affording Republicans the honor of capitulating to them.<br><br>The only plus side of this bill is that the president did secure a $15 billion boost for the military, but Democrats always agree to spending more on the military, as it has become a consensus, albeit without offsetting the cost with cuts to non-defense spending. That is exactly the deal they secured. They increased spending in many of the areas where Trump proposed cuts.<br><br>Meanwhile, Nancy Pelosi is bragging about blocking 160 GOP priorities in the bill!<br><br>Some defenders of this deal will claim that we should wait for \u201cthe next time.\u201d The president is coming out with the FY 2018 budget this week, and they will fight for it in September. But that budget is a complete joke. If they can\u2019t fight for modest cuts and their basic campaign promises with control of all of government \u2013 with the momentum of the first 100 days \u2013 they certainly won\u2019t fight later in the year for real spending cuts. Instead, the fear of a shutdown led them to increase spending. That will not change in September.","filename":"1473509397540","ext":".jpg","w":200,"h":176,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":110,"tim":1493661208387,"time":1493661208,"md5":"A\/VvSuZXFMFzesnbo1LR9A==","fsize":10066,"resto":123648167,"id":"4baR2buX","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":123648781,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:53:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123648167\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123648167<\/a><br>Found the list in the description of the GST stream.","filename":"spicer the spicy","ext":".png","w":450,"h":885,"tn_w":63,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493661225102,"time":1493661225,"md5":"dR++DxEOZolTskhNH\/gEXQ==","fsize":74887,"resto":123648167,"id":"rm8ng4eF","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123648787,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:53:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123648576\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123648576<\/a><br>Thanks Michelle Obama","filename":"michelle lunch 2","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1493661230265,"time":1493661230,"md5":"kaDNWSz6LhQl5I8BJl5eWA==","fsize":28471,"resto":123648167,"id":"pWLrDhgS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123648789,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:53:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"When do we start winning?","filename":"1492976768282","ext":".jpg","w":1106,"h":1012,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":114,"tim":1493661232952,"time":1493661232,"md5":"xnNoS0juww7RJRsf3TgLOw==","fsize":370727,"resto":123648167,"id":"Xik3baNc","country":"RO","m_img":1,"country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123648791,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)13:53:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123648566\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123648566<\/a><br>That&#039;s fanaticism.

You have to be aware of what&#039;s coming, right? So how do you plan to escape it?<br><br>Are there any countries left where one can escape globalism? <br><br>I&#039;m not just talking about the EU, the same of course applies to the US and I&#039;m sure the same things are happening even in other (Russia-aligned and China-aligned) blocs except it&#039;s their version of it.<br><br>Do you think you can live outside society? Are there any countries where there are still normal people who aren&#039;t indoctrinated into these insane ideologies? Or is a house in the woods the only option (if you&#039;re rich enough, and only for a few years until it all becomes too much regardless)?<br><br>What kind of a life can one have in this world outside the mainstream that could still be considered worth living? I wish I could go to the rural US and have a nice homestead and hunt and fish and farm with a wife of similar mindset, but that&#039;s just a pipe dream (and the US doesn&#039;t seem to be doing that well either despite Trump). Doing it alone in a shitty cucked country is obviously pointless. <br><br>Tell me, \/pol\/, is there anything left to hope for?","filename":"Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder_-_The_Tower_of_Babel_(Vienna)_-_Google_Art_Project_2","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1405,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":182,"tim":1492971234961,"time":1492971234,"md5":"nAYiQyE593vkyhI9rlkZ7g==","fsize":1386521,"resto":0,"id":"NEFOioXo","country":"HR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-now-that-lepen-is-finished-and-globalism-won","country_name":"Croatia","replies":10,"images":0,"unique_ips":9},{"no":122459894,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)14:17:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122459335\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122459335<\/a><br>i really dont get why you people think globalism, do you really want to be amish?","time":1492971430,"resto":122459335,"id":"aNjkx7sR","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":122460380,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)14:20:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122459894\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122459894<\/a><br>that&#039;s a false dichotomy if I&#039;ve ever seen one<br><br>For your sake I hope you&#039;re being stupid on purpose.","time":1492971600,"resto":122459335,"id":"xeSRbyGL","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122460392,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)14:20:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122459335\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122459335<\/a><br>I&#039;m gonna win by not playing.

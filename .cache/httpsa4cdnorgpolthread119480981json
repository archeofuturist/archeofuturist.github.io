Tibetan tantric Buddhism is full of all kinds of wacky shit, but it&#039;s still consistent in a way that Judaism just isn&#039;t. I have some books on Dzogchen and Mahamudra that I&#039;m not supposed to have because they&#039;re esoteric and are supposed to make your brain melt if you&#039;re uninitiated, so I do know roughly what&#039;s in there. There just isn&#039;t any way to make your idea make sense, sorry OP.","time":1491331276,"resto":119480981,"id":"7wFsFj1e","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119500218,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)14:46:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119499154\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119499154<\/a><br>I was referring to the idea that in order to perceive the truth about some external object your own mind needs to be totally pure.<br><br><a href=\"#p119499396\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119499396<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119499527\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119499527<\/a><br>what is a hypothesis<br>what is the concept of entertaining a thought without accepting it","time":1491331584,"resto":119480981,"id":"WRJH8N1w","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119500368,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)14:48:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119499647\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119499647<\/a><br>Their is a prevalent story I don&#039;t know it&#039;s authenticity or source that the tribe of Krishna the yadavs were cursed that they would die out fighting among themselves so the yadavs moved to the middle east and became the yahudis (Jews)","time":1491331683,"resto":119480981,"id":"de7ggPmg","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":119500419,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)14:48:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119499526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119499526<\/a><br>will read later perhaps. im tired now. can you give me a tldr. and also how it connects to the topic if you have anything to say about that.","time":1491331709,"resto":119480981,"id":"WRJH8N1w","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119500506,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)14:49:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119480981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119480981<\/a><br>...transcended the material world","time":1491331766,"resto":119480981,"id":"S0Hwn10N","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119500958,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)14:53:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119500419\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119500419<\/a><br>It points towards usage of sanskrit names in Syria and Egypt for their kings and quite a few things the Egyptian and Jewish mythology share with Indian mythology","time":1491332008,"resto":119480981,"id":"de7ggPmg","country":"IN","country_name":"India"},{"no":119501043,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)14:54:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119480981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119480981<\/a><br>Sounds like Maitreya flavored cryptokikery.

You have to keep in mind that Buddhism didn&#039;t arise in a vacuum, it was a reaction to the Brahmanism of the time. So in the sutras there&#039;s a lot of discussion with other prevailing views of the time, and there&#039;s a lot of things like &quot;no, seriously, the universe is not eternal and neither is God, and here&#039;s why in excruciating, repetitive, technical detail&quot;.

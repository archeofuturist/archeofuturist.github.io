In 1948, Britain was the last empire to hold it, decided to give it up and the U.N. decided that since the Arab and Jewish populations don&#039;t get along, two countries will be formed - One under Jewish leadership and one under Arab\/Muslim leadership. Land split was based on land ownership and the population living within that land. Jews accepted, Arab refused, went to war to slaughter the Jews and steal their land, failed and got the opposite happen. Since then, Israel has been trying to reach a peace agreement and the Palestinians have been refusing. See Israel&#039;s peace proposals in 2000 and 2007 as examples. Simple, no?<br><br>As for the Palestinian Christians not getting Israeli citizenship, I think you&#039;re mixing something up mate. Arabs living in Israel, no matter what religion - Christian or Muslim, all have Israeli citizenship. In fact, 26% of Israelis(i.e. with Israeli ID) are Muslim. On the other hand, there&#039;s Arab Christians living in Palestinian territory under Palestinian control, who all have Palestinian citizenship. Except East Jerusalem which is a complicated business, every person in Israel - Arab, Muslim, Christian, no matter what - Has an Israeli citizenship, while those under Palestinian control have a Palestinian citizenship. No one is in limbo.<br><br>A zionist is someone who believes Israel has a right to exist. That&#039;s it.

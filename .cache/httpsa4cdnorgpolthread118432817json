The problem is that both those parties are essentially the same fucking party anyway. HOWEVER Trump and Ron Paul are obviously not strictly republicans as we all know Ron Paul is a libertarian and Trump is probably more of a mix of a few different things as he isn&#039;t a traditional republican retard or a libertarian or a leftist. Its something competently different that we&#039;ve been trying to put into the white house. The media has been shilling that Trump is a republican and the republicans actually listen to trump but guess what. Trump doesn&#039;t run the republicans at all they are all for the most part running against him (i&#039;d say 70\/30) behind closed doors if not right out in the open. I&#039;m not sure why you don&#039;t understand this it seems you just now started coming \/pol\/","time":1490570991,"resto":118432817,"id":"Wdc3PfzX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

One minute he&#039;s a conservative nationalist, next minute he&#039;s a neo con about to start ww3. This is exactly what everyone warned you about during the primaries. Everyone was saying I agree with Trump on this and that, that&#039;s why I&#039;m voting for him. Then two months later he pulls a complete 360 and moonwalks away from that position. Trump is an empty vessel you put all your hopes and dreams into but in reality I don&#039;t think there&#039;s a single position he has that can&#039;t change on a moment&#039;s notice. So far it&#039;s been health care, Syria, even golfing during presidency. Next it will be tax reform, mark my words.","time":1491933455,"resto":120627253,"id":"2iPSAnRu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120629051,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)13:59:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120627253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120627253<\/a>","filename":"15648976465467","ext":".jpg","w":219,"h":230,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491933551349,"time":1491933551,"md5":"dSIVgJ\/q6o6RhqjiNUv5cg==","fsize":11531,"resto":120627253,"id":"usF3WF7+","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120629415,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:01:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120628833\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120628833<\/a><br>actually hes delivered everything i voted for him on. i could give a shit about the middle east. <br><br>he does one thing and cowards box him into one paradigm, he does another and cucks scatter to find another corner to box him in on with labels. so get fucked","time":1491933702,"resto":120627253,"id":"SvJLd55h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120629676,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:03:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120629415\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120629415<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;actually hes delivered everything i voted for him on.<\/span><br><br>What are those things he delivered on?","time":1491933818,"resto":120627253,"id":"2iPSAnRu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120629839,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:04:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120627253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120627253<\/a><br>Maybe he just has no fucking idea what he&#039;s doing.","time":1491933889,"resto":120627253,"id":"gMnC3v0x","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120630087,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:06:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120629676\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120629676<\/a><br>suck a dick lol how bout dah. i already see your jewey way of arguing. how about you list the promises he delivered on and ill pick out the ones i voted for<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;inb4 REEE BUT HE DIDNT DO ANYTHING THO!<\/span>","time":1491933999,"resto":120627253,"id":"SvJLd55h","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120630147,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:07:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120627253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120627253<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;WHO IS TRUMP WORKING FOR?<\/span><br><br>Chabad.<br><br>&quot;But Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner are already quite invested in the ultra-Orthodox outreach movement - or to be more precise their parents are.&quot;","filename":"kushner_chabad","ext":".jpg","w":776,"h":886,"tn_w":109,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491934026265,"time":1491934026,"md5":"vQ88V1kwTciVRJxDljtbKQ==","fsize":434764,"resto":120627253,"id":"kWQ8IR\/\/","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120630299,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:08:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120627253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120627253<\/a><br>America","time":1491934096,"resto":120627253,"id":"BPIHEaIa","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120630998,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)14:13:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120627253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120627253<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120627648\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120627648<\/a><br>Judging by the fact that he&#039;s steering your country into full on war with Russia.

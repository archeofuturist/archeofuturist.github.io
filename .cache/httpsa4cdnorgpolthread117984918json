A person who can think and feel in broader ways than a person of no faith; who lacks guidance and meaning to his pitiful existence. <br><br>The problem with atheism isn&#039;t the absence of religion, but of faith. If you keep your faith intact, you&#039;re in business. The Swedish people are very uninspired. There&#039;s nothing that guides them. For most people that guiding light is God, and it does them well. The human animal has severe constraints. Mental; emotional. Some emotional placating has to happen. That&#039;s called faith.

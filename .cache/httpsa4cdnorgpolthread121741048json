Be prepared to defend yourselves and others IF FORCED, bring defensive implements IF YOU MUST, but do NOT under ANY circumstances bring weapons.<br>3) Do NOT come dressed like stomcunts or tacticool fags. Bring safety\/sporting gear if you have it, but don&#039;t look like you came dressed for a riot.<br>4) Do NOT talk to press about stupid alt-right shit or memes, stay on-message.<br>5) Do NOT cause damage to the campus or the downtown area.<br><br>1) DO wear Auburn colors to the rally - dark blue and orange<br>2) DO act civil and composed - there must be a stark contrast between you and the Antifa hooligans<br>3) DO take lots of pics and vids so you can report any Antifa to police\/university.<br>4) DO talk to press about the importance of defending speech, ESPECIALLY unpopular speech, on college campuses.<br>5) DO stay after the rally to help clean up damage caused by Antifa. Bring trashbags for litter, medkits to help with bystander injuries.","filename":"C9mLMT5XoAElWCR.jpg-large","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1278,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1492549890609,"time":1492549890,"md5":"bHg8UfFcnP8dsOEHd3U8NQ==","fsize":247467,"resto":0,"id":"vkMhVxqQ","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"attack-at-auburn-3","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121741490,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)17:14:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"Is this now something like the new national burger sports?

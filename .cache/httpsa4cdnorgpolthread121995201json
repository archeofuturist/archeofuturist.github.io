I have met Italian women and find them to be horrible garbage even worse than American women. They also smell alot worse than American women do. I do know there is a stereotype about Italian men being playboys and stuff but those are only the dark skinned nigger type Italians.<br><br>I ask this question because the Japanese have a huge MGTOW\/Herbivore movement yet they have women in their country that men around the world all want. Meanwhile in Italy, I don&#039;t know what the men there do but I do know that the women are disgusting, hairy, and smell horrible along with having a bad temperament that nobody wants.","filename":"de4","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":390,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":97,"tim":1492698422543,"time":1492698422,"md5":"d8adw6C3xPaq7Ua+uoZVNQ==","fsize":1919958,"resto":121995201,"id":"Ok+bvPQj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121999918,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:32:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121999428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121999428<\/a>","filename":"bait anon","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":294,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":73,"tim":1492698744690,"time":1492698744,"md5":"BF84s7VgOxKQ3x0F0Ns\/FA==","fsize":43628,"resto":121995201,"id":"Yhwh3DAj","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":121999957,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:32:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why are pastaniggers so addicted to magic mushrooms?","filename":"download (2)","ext":".jpg","w":225,"h":225,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492698774048,"time":1492698774,"md5":"nRtRf++MS6LyoGviWBVwVQ==","fsize":12141,"resto":121995201,"id":"MHpnolMi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121999981,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:33:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"Und er so: neger bitte","time":1492698787,"resto":121995201,"id":"y6w4z7zp","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":122000090,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:34:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121995201\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121995201<\/a><br>Do you drive sexy Lambo, m8?","filename":"6869","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":489,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":76,"tim":1492698857829,"time":1492698857,"md5":"CVz2fSFEBBVH8R4AlP2f8g==","fsize":137961,"resto":121995201,"id":"pRRAX+JV","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":122000166,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:35:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121999918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121999918<\/a><br>Well I guess I will never know.

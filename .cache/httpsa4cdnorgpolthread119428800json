As a Catholic, I also have reservations about the conduct of the Church in different areas. I will say, though, Catholic teaching on death can offer real comfort and a place to start deeper personal exploration. As far as finding comfort, try reading on the Blessed Virgin Mary, particularly how she found joy and sorrow at the same time while at the foot of the cross. The lives of the Saints and asking thm to pray for you and your family can be a great help. If you want a little bit to meditate on look to Father Richard Rohr. He&#039;s a bit more liberal politically, but spiritually is open to the cosmic and mystical side of doctrine.

He said: \u201cIn a certain town there was a judge who neither feared God nor cared what people thought. And there was a widow in that town who kept coming to him with the plea, \u2018Grant me justice against my adversary.\u2019\u201cFor some time he refused. But finally he said to himself, \u2018Even though I don\u2019t fear God or care what people think, yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will see that she gets justice, so that she won\u2019t eventually come and attack me!\u2019\u201d And the Lord said, \u201cListen to what the unjust judge says. And will not God bring about justice for his chosen ones, who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off? I tell you, he will see that they get justice, and quickly. However, when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on the earth?\u201d<\/span>","time":1491284824,"resto":119428800,"id":"g+daiwvm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119437490,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:47:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119436792\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119436792<\/a><br>Thank you, anon.

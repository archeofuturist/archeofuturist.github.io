I know that some of you here are quite learned. I&#039;m grappling with a terrible amount of existential fear and despair. Both of my parents are ill, my mother with an ugly neurodegenerative disease. <br><br>If anyone could point me in the direction of any comforting scripture, lectures, sermons, etc., my soul could really use it. Anything that deals with fear and death, pertaining to self and loved ones. I haven&#039;t been a Christian for very long so I don&#039;t have much of a toolkit built up yet.<br><br>Thank you and God bless you.","filename":"1491261968524","ext":".jpg","w":537,"h":1024,"tn_w":131,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491278922324,"time":1491278922,"md5":"Y+csi4NNx4yfoYRAvrzPgw==","fsize":137425,"resto":0,"id":"WYEH+eSW","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"christians-of-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":13,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119429600,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)00:16:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1491279396,"resto":119428800,"id":"WYEH+eSW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119431324,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)00:35:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119428800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119428800<\/a><br>It&#039;s not exactly what you&#039;re looking for, but here&#039;s this: <br>I Thessalonians 4:13-18<br>Revelation 21:3-5","time":1491280509,"resto":119428800,"id":"Xxo2bn10","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119431462,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)00:36:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119428800\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119428800<\/a><br>I can&#039;t believe I&#039;m the first one to post in your thread.

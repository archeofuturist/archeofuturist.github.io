As a Catholic, I also have reservations about the conduct of the Church in different areas. I will say, though, Catholic teaching on death can offer real comfort and a place to start deeper personal exploration. As far as finding comfort, try reading on the Blessed Virgin Mary, particularly how she found joy and sorrow at the same time while at the foot of the cross. The lives of the Saints and asking thm to pray for you and your family can be a great help. If you want a little bit to meditate on look to Father Richard Rohr. He&#039;s a bit more liberal politically, but spiritually is open to the cosmic and mystical side of doctrine.

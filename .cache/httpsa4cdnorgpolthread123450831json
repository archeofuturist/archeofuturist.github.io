That&#039;s why they need to control the media; as soon as we do unite, shall reform the EU in our image, take their structures and make them our own. It is needes as well, because the population boom in Africa is just starting to begin.<\/span><br><br>I really can&#039;t tell if you are delusional or just shilling. You are basically arguing that we should be pro-EU so that we can one day take e.g. the European Court of Human Rights and turn it to our own purposes. That&#039;s completely delusional and could never happen. It&#039;s like black people saying we should keep the KKK in place because it can be infiltrated and repurposed for some good cause. Really nice theoretical construct, highly unrealistic to subvert the entire EU. Blocking it and taking its power away is far more realistic than subverting it to an anti-Islam anti-African pro-White agenda -- in fact the latter is completely unrealistic and not a good reason to be in favor of the EU. Sounds like something a shill would argue because he knows that 4chan likes, but maybe you are just delusional.","time":1493553647,"resto":123450831,"id":"XdKcUc4I","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":123470835,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)08:01:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123470275\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123470275<\/a><br>The star should be a Star of David and no Star of Davids amongst the crosses and crescents.","time":1493553661,"resto":123450831,"id":"MS7wkRE8","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123470973,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)08:02:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123470598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123470598<\/a><br>I see, but that&#039;s really small stuff.

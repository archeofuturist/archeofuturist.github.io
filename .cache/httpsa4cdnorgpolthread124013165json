It started out with lots of love and lots of passion. Then slowly she kept shutting me down and never wanted to have sex. I felt so dejected and pathetic. I finally asked her if she loves me anymore. She took a deep sigh before answering, and that was all I needed to hear. I interrupted and said &quot;I have to break up with you.&quot; It was the hardest thing I ever did. I think ever. I really loved her in that way that&#039;s impossible to explain. You just have to hope that the person listening has experienced it and can understand.<br><br>Anyway, apparently all I had to do was show some fucking spine and she came crawling back to me after 4-5 days of radio silence. Funny how that works. But that&#039;s the thing, it was REALLY MY FAULT. I showed no balls for a long time, trying to be understanding and caring and blah blah blah. Fuck that shit. If she won&#039;t give it up, you dump her. It&#039;s not like she needs to be in &#039;the mood&#039; like you do. She can get fucked any time, no coaxing needed. And when she&#039;s your girlfriend, that&#039;s what she&#039;s supposed to do.<br><br>But by the time she came back, I had already made plans to leave. So I did. I took off, and she drove 4 hours to come find me after 3 months. I forced myself to stick with my plan. I&#039;m leaving, I&#039;m leaving, I&#039;m leaving. I had a ticket to move to the west coast by the time she drove all the way after me. We fucked one last time and I flew off a week later.<br><br>To this day, she still tries to get in touch. She&#039;s flown all the way out here to try and rekindle things. I met her for coffee and told her that was all I could do. She even contacted my mom when she saw photos of me with a girl on my mom&#039;s normiebook feed.<br><br>All I had to do to turn her back into that loving, romantic girl I once knew was go away.

This is the end of the sham of democracy in America. The Deep State is more than just Obama&#039;s holdovers and the 7th Floor Group, it includes all the PNAC\/Neocons\/ZOG, Neoliberals and others who have been burrowing into the establishment for AT LEAST the last 30 years, and all hope is lost short of armed revolution. <br><br>God how I wish it were 1, but given that McCain met with the rebels last month...

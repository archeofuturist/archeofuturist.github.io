Swinburne, Byron, William Blake, Baudelaire, Coleridge, Rimbaud, Mallarme, the Surrealists, the Dadaists... these were not centrists in any sense of the word. Some were far right, some were far left, some were beyond both the right and left and could be characterized as spiritualists. And let&#039;s not forget that left and right really only comes into usage after the French Revolution.

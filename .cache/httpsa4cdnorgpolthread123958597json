From my country it is easy to go there as a tourist using ESTA visa, but I don&#039;t want to go there as an illegal immigrant. Right now I am 21 y.o. working as a C++ developer for embedded devices, I own two flats in Hungary (one of them is rented out on AirBnB, I live in the other one) so I have a pretty decent life. I am telling this so that you will know that I don&#039;t want to go there for welfare, aid etc. I would like to explore many states, cities, try a bunch of things and eventually settle down. My problem is that I don&#039;t see a clear way on how to get there legally.<br>I haven&#039;t finished the university because I got a pretty good job which required only talent rather than the papers. Right now I am planning to go back but there are the following issues:<br>- Any non-american university degree is pretty much worthless if I want to work in the US.<br>- Every university which gives an acceptable degree costs waaay too much for me (of course I&#039;d work along with my studies.)<br><br>The question is:<br>Is there anyone who got a job in the US with a European degree? And if yes, when did you move out and how hard it was?<br><br>Thank you if you&#039;ve read this through &amp; give a reasonable answer. (Pic not related, it is my cat yawning)","filename":"20170424_113545","ext":".jpg","w":4032,"h":2268,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493843349436,"time":1493843349,"md5":"8\/NitIwyR21Rei02Dyahkw==","fsize":3010663,"resto":0,"id":"oUdnQMyT","country":"HU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-everyone","country_name":"Hungary","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

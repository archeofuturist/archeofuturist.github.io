I&#039;ll start with the worst part. <br><br>Online directories of history caches and individual indexes that were not allowed to be viewed at all are now perfectly legal. It basically made your search history from 2001 onward to be made public. As easy as yellowpages. <br><br>Another bill passed two years ago actually allows for your name, address, phone number and political affiliation to be posted online legally. Both of these laws together is dystopian. <br><br>Some people say the index won&#039;t happen but oh it will. It will because there is literally no law of someone starting a website with your search history on it. Of individuals purchasing your search history. Of wealthy people paying to disallow sites from accessing search history made under accounts on varying engines. It&#039;s completely and utterly compromised. <br><br>So who allowed this? Both parties of congress, the senate and DONALD J. TRUMP. <br><br>So when redditors claim everything is fine, it&#039;s out of being outright misinformed and naive.

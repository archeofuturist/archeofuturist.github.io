Nevertheless, while we prefer the republic, we must recognise and proclaim that whatever the form of government may be, so long as human society continues to be divided into different classes as a result of the hereditary inequality of occupations, of wealth, of education, and of rights, there will always be a class-restricted government and the inevitable exploitation of the majorities by the minorities.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The State is nothing but this domination and this exploitation, well regulated and systematised.<\/span><br><br>(Mikhail Bakunin)","time":1493937513,"resto":124112427,"id":"YznE4KAd","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124122892,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)18:38:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124122046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124122046<\/a><br>Anyone who has meet any of the Royals always say that Philip is their favourite","time":1493937537,"resto":124112427,"id":"NQb3uT3c","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":124122954,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)18:39:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124112427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124112427<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;On finances, in 1969: The Jews control the world.

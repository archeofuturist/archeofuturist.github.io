The whole idea behind this failed idea isn&#039;t that it&#039;s passes, or even that it tanks. The idea behind this bill to to tank Ryan. He&#039;s an untrustworthy cuck and has been for the longest time. Breitbart has been raging relentless war against him since forever, and this is simply the nest step of Bannon&#039;s master plan. <br><br>http:\/\/www.breitbart.com\/big-govern<wbr>ment\/2017\/03\/24\/report-steve-bannon<wbr>-says-american-health-care-act-writ<wbr>ten-insurance-industry\/<br><br>By attaching Ryan&#039;s name to this shitshow of legislation, which will likely not pass, will set Ryan up for replacement. They&#039;ve had 8 years to find a better bill, and this is what Ryan presents? A shit insurance industry ass wipe that will fuck us over more. Meanwhile in article related, Breitbart is distancing Bannon and by extension Trump from this shitshow. This solidifies his position. Cuck Ryan&#039;s house is built on cuck sand.","time":1490369482,"resto":118090802,"id":"Dgr0Nx60","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118091681,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:31:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118091565\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118091565<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;She&#039;s hot<\/span>","filename":"1484929726723","ext":".jpg","w":302,"h":259,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":107,"tim":1490369489514,"time":1490369489,"md5":"m6T4b6NTpB013fT7yp2sjg==","fsize":8869,"resto":118090802,"id":"K9EtySHR","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118091689,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:31:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118091517\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118091517<\/a><br>you&#039;re totally right, we should forget about the Russians messing with our politics","filename":"Shill4Prezzzz","ext":".png","w":574,"h":601,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490369493602,"time":1490369493,"md5":"+M7gzfjlG\/qTZz90dNcjrA==","fsize":167633,"resto":118090802,"id":"UN14XILA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118091718,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)11:31:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118091088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118091088<\/a><br><br>At the end of the day win or lose Trump is still president and theres plenty of shit to do besides healthcare.

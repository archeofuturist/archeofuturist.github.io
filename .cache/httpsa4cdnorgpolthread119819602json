The Iraq invasion already led to massive persecution of Christians. The Christian communities in both Iraq and Syria that have been there since the earliest times of Christianity will be minuscule soon thanks to the unbelieveable depths of evil of America and its allies including globalist establishment media, Israel, and the Sunni Gulf states. In the meantime, the multiculturalist\/libtard lunatics are destroying Western societies from within almost as if it were systematic.","time":1491524054,"resto":119819602,"id":"UuA+AXy+","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"}]}

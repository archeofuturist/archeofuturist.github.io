Some writers point out that strict necessity isn&#039;t required and it can still be characterized as a slippery slope if at each stage the next step is plausible.[2][4] This is important for with strict implication p will imply z but if at each step the probability is say 90% then the more steps there are the less likely it becomes that p will imply z.<br><br>A slippery slope argument is typically a negative argument where there is an attempt to dissuade someone from taking a course of action because if they do it will lead to some unacceptable conclusion. Some writers point out that an argument with the same structure might be used in a positive way in which someone is encouraged to take the first step because it leads to a desirable conclusion.[5]<br><br>If someone is accused of using a slippery slope argument then it is being suggested they are guilty of fallacious reasoning and whilst they are claiming that p implies z, for whatever reason, this is not the case. In logic and critical thinking textbooks slippery slopes and slippery slope arguments are normally discussed as a form of fallacy although there may be an acknowledgement that non-fallacious forms of the argument can also exist","time":1492602518,"resto":121834936,"id":"wovMr10V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121835279,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:49:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"The only reason people call it a fallacy is because they wish to dismiss it and are deluding themselves.","time":1492602575,"resto":121834936,"id":"MdSzB8AH","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121835432,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:51:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121835220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121835220<\/a><br>If we treat faggots like we treat normal people this will happen<br><br>someone in the 60s,probably","filename":"untitled-article-1459521947","ext":".jpg","w":2000,"h":1123,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492602695479,"time":1492602695,"md5":"LBnoqWpmjM0I\/LkNQAAdWA==","fsize":168496,"resto":121834936,"id":"iiLkPC+D","country":"GR","m_img":1,"country_name":"Greece"},{"no":121835543,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)07:53:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121835220\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121835220<\/a><br>If we treat pre marital sex as a part of our culture and we reject traditionalism this will happen<br><br>Someone in the 50s,probably","filename":"1491456580655","ext":".jpg","w":1825,"h":4361,"tn_w":52,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492602791248,"time":1492602791,"md5":"\/G5FTcDX0ymRLQ\/3b00AoA==","fsize":675465,"resto":121834936,"id":"iiLkPC+D","country":"GR","m_img":1,"country_name":"Greece"},{"no":121837486,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)08:17:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121834936\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121834936<\/a><br>slippery slope is your beautiful mind equipped with meaningless phrases of social science that you are capable of juggling like those cavemen saving on car insurance.

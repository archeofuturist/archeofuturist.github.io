My original idea was to just have \u201cCalgary ...-Fascist Action\u201d and maybe underline the letters FA-T and GA-Y. He talked it over with me and said instead of being edgy, just totally discredit them and make it a total meme show so normies will just be like \u201cHaha, hug?\u201d. So he said \u201cjust put a massive XD and :^) over it and leave\u201d.<br><br>1) Don\u2019t be edgy by writing Nazi KKK because then they just put it on their website and win, and say \u201cWe are correct! Look how racist these people are\u201d but if you make it a total shit-show they can\u2019t use it.<br>2) Don\u2019t be edgy because don\u2019t want to get kicked off campus \/ cops called like the time someone put up alt-right posters.<br>Also wanted to keep it fast, 3.0 hours of work : 15 min of shit, so that as little effort by us is used to wreck it and piss them of even more. If you draw a painting the same level as them, you\u2019re wasting as much time as they did. There was a real pepe on it a year ago and it just got blacked out.<br>Blame it on 9gag.<br>Also as a tribute to all our vets and men in uniform I added \u201cKilroy was here\u201d.","filename":"ggrefd","ext":".jpg","w":1496,"h":2097,"tn_w":178,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492001939483,"time":1492001939,"md5":"oDNH5irQacvWT20Ei\/y\/Yg==","fsize":418730,"resto":0,"id":"7jGw\/LQB","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-so-a-friend-and-i-went-out-yesterday-my","country_name":"Canada","replies":6,"images":2,"unique_ips":4},{"no":120753927,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:16:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"old thread<br><br><a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/120697500#p120703661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120703661<\/a>","time":1492002994,"resto":120752396,"id":"7jGw\/LQB","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120754232,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:19:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"Nicely done. <br>Now kill...","time":1492003187,"resto":120752396,"id":"XEwjLd3E","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120754352,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)09:21:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s a little small.

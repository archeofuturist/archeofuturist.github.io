Our rights are constantly being stripped away, families are broken, we lack morals, children are abused and fed shit from the minute they are born until they die, the air is polluted, we are mostly middle class (middle class is now on the verge of lower class for most people) and younger generations have no chance in hell of living as comfortable and prosperous a life as the 20th century boomers did. This would be okay if they weren&#039;t constantly berating us for dealing with the problems their selfishness caused, and if we had the economy to at least allow people to own land and raise a family.","filename":"1492575128628","ext":".jpg","w":650,"h":900,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493439988884,"time":1493439988,"md5":"rtq+FR3yek5F8yftVf9smQ==","fsize":173778,"resto":123293595,"id":"Oczg3faf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123295551,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)00:30:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123293595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123293595<\/a><br>annex us britain-senpai","time":1493440248,"resto":123293595,"id":"tbPbhiEs","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123295780,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)00:33:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123293595\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123293595<\/a><br>The US isn&#039;t a threat to the world, it IS the world.<br><br>Bow down to your masters or get crushed.","time":1493440404,"resto":123293595,"id":"3vOgMANy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

William Petty estimated (in the 1665-66 Down Survey) that the death toll of the wars in Ireland since 1641 was over 618,000 people, or about 40% of the country&#039;s pre-war population. Of these, he estimated that over 400,000 were Catholics, 167,000 killed directly by war or famine, and the remainder by war-related disease.Modern estimates put the toll at closer to 20%.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In addition, some fifty thousand Irish people, including prisoners of war, were sold as indentured labourers under the English Commonwealth regime.They were often sent to the English colonies in North America and the Caribbean where they subsequently comprised a substantial portion of certain Caribbean colony populations in the late 17th century.In Barbados, some of their descendants are known as Redlegs<\/span>","filename":"images","ext":".jpg","w":246,"h":205,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1492554361543,"time":1492554361,"md5":"rkSTQnHO1nVJQ4z226tbRw==","fsize":6919,"resto":121749557,"id":"v+D1L\/+2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121751436,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)18:26:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121751093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121751093<\/a><br>oof, forgot to mention that the gypsys buddy was having a wank on the grass in front of us","time":1492554380,"resto":121749557,"id":"FvIievj6","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121751526,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)18:26:58","name":"Thiobraid \u00c1rann","com":"<a href=\"#p121751387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121751387<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;They were often sent to the English colonies in North America and the Caribbean where<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;North America<\/span><br><br>Nice flag.","time":1492554418,"resto":121749557,"id":"S2OkgkSJ","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121751568,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)18:27:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"we as a nation are dead, we are simply just a shopping mall and daycare center for the rest of Europe to speak broken English in, the latino inquisition has taken over Dublin, rarely hear dub accent anymore, only hear Brazilians, Spanish, Eastern Europeans and beggars , we are a dead nation","time":1492554439,"resto":121749557,"id":"20Qr5COW","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121751629,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)18:27:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121751387\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121751387<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Muh heritage <\/span><br><br>Go fight for Israel good goy","time":1492554463,"resto":121749557,"id":"ZAX5LNDc","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121751676,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)18:28:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Do you know how the Mick first came into being?

Major advertisers pulled ads from the site due to bad PR. Author of the article posted images of alleged Coca-Cola and Toyota featuring ads on a video titled &quot;Chief Keef dances to Alabama Nigger.&quot; This e-celeb posts a video accusing WSJ of doctoring the photo, mainly on the basis that Youtube automatically demonetizes content with offensive titles, and in fact, he talked to the video creator who revealed that he only made money on the video for 3-5 days. The e-celeb figured out after this video was released that the video was actually flagged for content by Chief Keef&#039;s handlers, and it&#039;s very possible the video was still monetized but the revenue was going to them rather than the video creator. E-celeb is now digging to see if he dun goof&#039;d or not.","time":1491183554,"resto":119273868,"id":"Zld68zLG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119274645,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:39:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119274521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119274521<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119274418\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119274418<\/a><br><br>They can try a defamation lawsuit but i doubt it will gain any traction in court since the WSJ would need to prove that he knew the evidence he had was false.","filename":"08810","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":375,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491183561674,"time":1491183561,"md5":"yN3baMoCjaGWw2JElQGXbQ==","fsize":22166,"resto":119273868,"id":"2CnQ1Q8F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119274674,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:39:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119274521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119274521<\/a><br>but that doesn&#039;t fit the narrative of OP&#039;s agenda","time":1491183586,"resto":119273868,"id":"JhpfRdLS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119274683,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:39:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"he&#039;ll be alright, Ethan will pull out the Jew card","time":1491183591,"resto":119273868,"id":"Htoem4Iz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119274789,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:40:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119274645\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119274645<\/a><br>if hes responsible for the distribution of that information, then it won&#039;t matter if he knew it was false or not.","time":1491183657,"resto":119273868,"id":"YebFgyVJ","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":119274976,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:42:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119274632\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119274632<\/a><br>Not a fan of h3h3 but the shit the WSJ is doing is pissing me off<br><br>they&#039;re literally calling up advertisers to take down ads of any videos they find &quot;offensive&quot;","filename":"1487300672616","ext":".jpg","w":3264,"h":1836,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1491183768023,"time":1491183768,"md5":"lMQQIzIf42pgVAPxuzvnow==","fsize":980565,"resto":119273868,"id":"Xdh5Ql96","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119275036,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:43:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119274789\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119274789<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The 1964 case New York Times Co. v.

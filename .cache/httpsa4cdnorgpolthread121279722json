There is something wrong with our sun. NASA is cloaking our real sun. Why? Why do they need the sun simulator? It&#039;s real, and it&#039;s in orbit. It is approximately 100x300 ft. I believe it is because our real solar sun is rapidly using up it&#039;s hydrogen fuel. Hence becoming dimmer to the point that the masses will notice the brightness change. NASA to avoid a work wide panic, invented the simulator to mask the dimming.<br>If you really want to prove the sun is dimming\/depleting it&#039;s hydrogen, look at the moon. The light that reflects off the moon is the real solar sunlight. Notice how the moon isn&#039;t as bright as it used to be?<br>It&#039;s not the moon. It&#039;s the sun is dimmer. So the moon reflects less light output by the sun.<br>The research I&#039;ve done supports this theory. I&#039;m trying to get in touch with my NASA contact Orlo for clarification. I believe he is not allowed to speak of this, so he contacts me sporadically and very briefly. Maybe if we all pressure Congress, we could find out what is going on with our sun?","filename":"halloween_sun","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":62,"tim":1492298890314,"time":1492298890,"md5":"h8TCNJ6iu1YjCCuB+i29bA==","fsize":49735,"resto":0,"id":"ms0wQUgG","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"massive-coverup-happening","country_name":"United States","replies":52,"images":16,"unique_ips":41},{"no":121279935,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:29:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"time to go to bed kiddo","time":1492298989,"resto":121279722,"id":"DRcPNLL8","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121279941,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:29:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121279722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121279722<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;100x300<\/span><br>The sun simulator is a rectangle?","time":1492298993,"resto":121279722,"id":"OOQXwxlq","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121280007,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:30:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121279722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121279722<\/a><br>lolwut","time":1492299021,"resto":121279722,"id":"B33lnItd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121280098,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:31:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121279722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121279722<\/a>","filename":"1327595107479","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":375,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492299064752,"time":1492299064,"md5":"cAyrVwyvgscDmlIoxBzTsQ==","fsize":29873,"resto":121279722,"id":"\/djKN3zg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121280125,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:31:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"Fuck off to \/x\/<br><br>Sage","time":1492299081,"resto":121279722,"id":"5xiMUC8k","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121280172,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:31:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121279722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121279722<\/a><br>OH SHIT DUBZ ITS HAPPENING","time":1492299102,"resto":121279722,"id":"B33lnItd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121280179,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:31:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121279722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121279722<\/a><br>Well it&#039;s 35 degrees here so the sun simulator works breddy gud","time":1492299105,"resto":121279722,"id":"fD+ULgZG","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121280241,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:32:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"How is your sun simulator powered?<br>With solar power?<br><br>If you have a sun simulator that works for NY latitude, why people living in texas latitudes will notice something, right?","time":1492299130,"resto":121279722,"id":"3OuBt1Ov","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":121280258,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:32:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121279722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121279722<\/a><br>welp tell u\/bottomlulz i said hi when this is screencapped","time":1492299136,"resto":121279722,"id":"JQ1r7y3d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121280289,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:32:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121280125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121280125<\/a><br>I&#039;ll sage you, you motherfucker!","time":1492299150,"resto":121279722,"id":"ms0wQUgG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121280458,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:33:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121279722\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121279722<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sun is rapidly using up it&#039;s hydrogen fuel.<\/span><br>[spoiler]bollocks[\/spoiler]<br>also [citation needed].","filename":"Aufkleber_Trollface","ext":".jpg","w":1100,"h":1100,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492299222266,"time":1492299222,"md5":"ESCT\/0GYUh3bQddTnahQiA==","fsize":82678,"resto":121279722,"id":"Hid2cWti","country":"PL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Poland"},{"no":121280473,"now":"04\/15\/17(Sat)19:33:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121280179\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121280179<\/a><br>That&#039;s fucking cold!

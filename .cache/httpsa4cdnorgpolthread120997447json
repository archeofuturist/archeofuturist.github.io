The more we all do nofap the crazier the happenings will become. Am I just crazy here or has anyone else noticed this connection? When trump got elected I was also doing nofap and I remember we were all channeling our energy towards him...what do you guys think? Does our nofapping affect world events? Keep up the nofap journey then guys, keep it up and things will happen. No porn, no fapping, good luck. :)","filename":"IMG_1249","ext":".jpg","w":251,"h":201,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":200,"tim":1492133303955,"time":1492133303,"md5":"3ivrYpCO36dFuz+33E78IA==","fsize":11045,"resto":0,"id":"gsP0\/vlY","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"have-any-of-you-recently-started-nofap","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

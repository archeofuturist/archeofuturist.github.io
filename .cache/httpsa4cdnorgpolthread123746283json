(Disgaea, Final Fantasy, Persona series)<br><br>I train with my Katana every day, this superior weapon can cut clean through steel because it is folded over a thousand times, and is vastly superior to any other weapon on earth. I earned my sword license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day.<br><br>I speak Japanese fluently, both Kanji and the Osaka dialect, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about Japanese history and their bushido code, which I follow 100%<br><br>When I get my Japanese visa, I am moving to Tokyo to attend a prestigious High School to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become an animator for Studio Ghibli or a game designer!<br><br>I own several kimonos, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to Japan, so I can fit in easier. I bow to my elders and seniors and speak Japanese as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond.<br><br>Wish me luck in Japan!","filename":"me","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":800,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493714553670,"time":1493714553,"md5":"Gl1juFaQ69f8El\/SafPS4A==","fsize":55882,"resto":123746283,"id":"SzROSWcg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123746905,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)04:44:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123746283\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123746283<\/a><br>Don&#039;t see anything wrong with this.

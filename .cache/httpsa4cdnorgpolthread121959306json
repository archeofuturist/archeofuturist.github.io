I wouldn&#039;t expect any different if we chose any random stupid faggot to give his own country to along with the power to enslave that same country and direct their military and stay hidden and safe\/protected without consequence for his actions. I would probably tell people to fuck off also if I felt safe buried deep in my own country where I know nobody would come fuck with me.<br><br>Fuck it though, keeps the world interesting. I actually love all this drama of nukes and shit. I find no joy in watching sports. I don&#039;t see states against other states and just because one team isn&#039;t much of an outcome.

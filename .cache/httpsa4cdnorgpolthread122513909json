But let&#039;s say brand confidence isn&#039;t an issue; you still have to deal with finding the correctly skilled workers, which involves presumably an interview process, and then transporting them to your town, training them and then getting them to a skill level comparable to your old workers. This could take weeks or even months depending on what the job actually requires so in the short term in a society set up for potentially endless (also known as&quot;perfect&quot;) competition it&#039;ll be very hard for your company to survive, let alone recover. <br><br>The big problem with ancap is that it has to, by defintion, believe in open borders, since there is no government to restrict and regulate immigration. You&#039;d have to imagine that if firing all your workers and replacing them with smallish brown people from other countries was a viable option that every other company in the country (such as it is - perhaps society is a better word than country in this situation) would be doing this as well. If it turns out not to be viable well sucks to be you, you just fired all your skilled workers. <br><br>TL;DR you can do this but it is not without it&#039;s risks.","time":1492995031,"resto":122513909,"id":"rIpLw8Fv","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122518011,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)20:52:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122513909\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122513909<\/a><br>You wouldn&#039;t import the workers you dumbass factory owner.<br><br>Export your factory.. like every other management asshole.

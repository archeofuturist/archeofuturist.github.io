I have no problem with Nobles Oblige but I don&#039;t like to think of politics as an arena where ultra rich treat public service as some sort of game to be played. <br><br>Conway could still have a career in KY a little ways down the line, but he&#039;s got a lot of rebuilding to do. His reputation in KY, even among Dems, has to be wearing thin.

When we had the kynect system (Kentucky&#039;s own ACA infrastructure and portal) we never had a single issue. Bevin deconstructed it and now we just the base federal system.

I don&#039;t hate the ACA despite a few problems which I think have been grossly exaggerated. In fact I think that model of a public-private partnership is a winner on healthcare and a lot of other issues. The whole &quot;What&#039;s the Matter with Kansas&quot; approach isn&#039;t a theory I subscribe to. I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the fault of the voters, but the fault of a Democratic party that is mostly based in major cities and increasingly supported by minorities instead of rural and white voters. Jim Webb could seriously help the Democratic Party if they&#039;d have only listened to him when he was in the Senate. I don&#039;t think he&#039;d make a great Presidential candidate, but he represents a constituency that needs to be heard. It&#039;s a constituency that the Democratic Party was founded on.","time":1493503389,"resto":123382859,"id":"+ZBw2ujq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123389937,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)18:14:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump for Conway","time":1493504083,"resto":123382859,"id":"+ZBw2ujq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

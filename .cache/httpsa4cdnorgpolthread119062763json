The early signs suggest they will choose single payer.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;That would be the height of political irony, of course. Donald Trump, Paul Ryan and Tom Price may succeed where left-wing dreamers have long failed and move the country toward socialized medicine. And they would do it unwittingly, by undermining the most conservative health care system that Americans are willing to accept.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;You\u2019ve no doubt heard of that conservative system. It\u2019s called Obamacare.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Let me take a step back to explain how we got here and how the politics of health care will most likely play out after last week\u2019s Republican crackup.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Passing major social legislation is fantastically difficult. It tends to involve taking something from influential interest groups \u2014 taxing the rich, for example (as Obamacare did), or reducing some companies\u2019 profits or hurting professional guilds. Those groups can often persuade voters that the status quo is less scary than change.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But when big social legislation does pass, and improves lives, it becomes even harder to undo than it was to create. Americans are generally not willing to go backward on matters of basic economic decency. Child labor isn\u2019t coming back, and the minimum wage, Social Security and Medicare aren\u2019t going away. Add Obamacare to the list. \u201cAmericans now think government should help guarantee coverage for just about everyone,\u201d as Jennifer Rubin, a conservative, wrote.<\/span>","filename":"Donald-Trump-SNL-screenshot","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":480,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1490972021544,"time":1490972021,"md5":"c20Pkkii9lImxUldgYYogQ==","fsize":31927,"resto":0,"id":"XUSS6KHB","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"republicans-for-singlepayer-health-care","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119064440,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)11:12:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1490973155,"resto":119062763,"id":"YFUw2X\/H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

It was a political movement to make the concept of &quot;Euskal Herria&quot; belong to the basques as far as I can tell. I&#039;m no history buff, but I&#039;m pretty sure it was a move meant to annex Navarra under Basque power under some odd rationalization of &quot;the Basque Country represents Euskal Herria, therefore come to us&quot;. There is no Basque nationalist movement for Arana if he didn&#039;t spur it as a thing for Biscay, is what I think.

I regard politics as a closed system: Most people in any given country will never, in their entire lives, have any real influence on politics. Yes, you can vote once every few years about how many seats on the council your leaders get to divide among themselves. Which they will then do behind closed doors, with no checks, no demands, no nothing. People who get into politics are mostly people who pursue it as a career since puberty. In that way politics are exactly the same as sports. If your parents didn&#039;t put you into some sort of club, tough shit, you&#039;re never going to make it, barring some fluke or hidden talent.<br><br>So right off the bat we can conclude that politics are largely influenced by whatever the fuck it is politicians want to do, and are not an accurate reflection of the wishes of the people of a nation at any given time.<br><br>And this is where the power comes into play, because politics can decide what information is available. And they&#039;re pretty panicky that any random Joe can now go onto the internet and say what he really thinks without any sort of check on it. That&#039;s a right they want purely for themselves. Because this is how they keep many people cucked: These are people who in a lot of issues are essentially uncucked. They are against migration, against support for terrorism, etc. But they vote for a cuck party, because they have their heads filled with propaganda 24\/7 about how voting for an uncucked party is bad in some way.<br><br>And then there are the true cucks. And I don&#039;t mean the leftist radicals. They are the ones doing the cucking. They aren&#039;t being fooled in the slightest. I mean the social democrats. The &quot;reasonable&quot; people who sound smart, obviously aren&#039;t terrible people on their own, but who&#039;s political discourse seems to come directly from the radicals. They have internalized cuckdom.","time":1492698779,"resto":121997284,"id":"BqW6\/pxY","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122000086,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:34:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121999277\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121999277<\/a><br>Defending Jews, blaming muslims for antisemitism instead of calling out the Zionists, please watch (till 4:54):<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=nKD<wbr>s7TVKCRI","time":1492698855,"resto":121997284,"id":"Sf2XLFY5","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122000348,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)10:37:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121999967\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121999967<\/a><br>And this last group definitely agrees with being cucked.

I&#039;m wondering if you have any stats on &quot;slaves shipped in by the shipload from Africa continuously for decades&quot;. I don&#039;t have any ready myself but it is important to question everything even something accepted as true and taught in public schools. The statement is very likely true, however; &quot;continuous&quot; could mean a small number of ships maybe 10-20 travelling back forth across the ocean for a century. Given the distance of the trip and the ships they used at the time its possible that the slaves only account for 1-2% of the American population at the time. I did pull all of those numbers out of my ass just now but I&#039;m trying to show you that if you just think about it for a minute you can see why you shouldn&#039;t automatically dismiss the possibility that black slaves were only 1-2% population as well as the possibility there may have been more white slaves than blacks. You&#039;re outlook is very blue-pilled. You were told slaves were shipped here continuously and you interpreted that to mean it was the largest slave trade of the time (it wasn&#039;t). I&#039;m sorry I don&#039;t have any stats to show you and I&#039;m not claiming to have the answers to the questions I am suggesting you ask yourself. Just be more open minded for lack of better phrase.","time":1492884531,"resto":122300002,"id":"LaMfWn+s","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122306766,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:10:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"\/pol\/thread\/122295534#p122300000\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122300000<\/a>","time":1492884600,"resto":122300002,"id":"bIBMrWp8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122306961,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:11:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122306617\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122306617<\/a><br>Ignore my shit grammar and punctuation.","time":1492884703,"resto":122300002,"id":"LaMfWn+s","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122307219,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)14:13:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122306766\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122306766<\/a><br>No one cares about quints","time":1492884838,"resto":122300002,"id":"O7HTim9e","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

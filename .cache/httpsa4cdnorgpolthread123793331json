The taxes are low as fuck. It&#039;s a good place to live and raise a family as long as you stay away from the large urban centers, just like any other state; general rule of thumb, check the demographics before you move somewhere; that goes for wherever you choose. Ohio has open and concealed carry; you only need a permit for the latter. Ohio is not prone to natural disasters at all. Tornadoes, floods, and ice storms are the only possible threats, but they&#039;re extremely rare. I live in central Ohio, and the only thing I&#039;ve experienced was an ice storm, and that was over a decade ago. It only knocked out power for a day or so. Tornadoes and floods are pretty much a threat everywhere though. <br><br>Personally, I wouldn&#039;t go too far north, like North Dakota or Wyoming for example. The winters are considerably longer, so if you&#039;re an outdoorsy type of person and you want to live up there, you better get used to only four months of nice weather.

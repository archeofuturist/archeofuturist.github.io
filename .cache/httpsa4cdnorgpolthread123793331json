The taxes are low as fuck. It&#039;s a good place to live and raise a family as long as you stay away from the large urban centers, just like any other state; general rule of thumb, check the demographics before you move somewhere; that goes for wherever you choose. Ohio has open and concealed carry; you only need a permit for the latter. Ohio is not prone to natural disasters at all. Tornadoes, floods, and ice storms are the only possible threats, but they&#039;re extremely rare. I live in central Ohio, and the only thing I&#039;ve experienced was an ice storm, and that was over a decade ago. It only knocked out power for a day or so. Tornadoes and floods are pretty much a threat everywhere though. <br><br>Personally, I wouldn&#039;t go too far north, like North Dakota or Wyoming for example. The winters are considerably longer, so if you&#039;re an outdoorsy type of person and you want to live up there, you better get used to only four months of nice weather. That&#039;s what makes a state like Ohio better; we&#039;ve got the same climate as Kansas or Missouri.","time":1493747925,"resto":123793331,"id":"suFfC30j","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123795356,"now":"05\/02\/17(Tue)13:58:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123795155\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123795155<\/a><br>I don&#039;t know much about Montana other than it has beautiful scenery.

But at least sharks can&#039;t walk on land and eat you. It&#039;s typically richer and whiter. However, don&#039;t live right on the beach because then the property tax skyrockets.

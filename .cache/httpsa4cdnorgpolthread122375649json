I imagine that if we showed up his house armed to the teeth his first reaction would be calling the cops or Homeland security.<br><br>These people do not realize that government is something not so good but is way best than the other option. A social contract that rules over everyone is better than an anarchist village where everyone is free and happy until the neighboring village attack and the men are killed, the women are kept as sex slaves and all newborns killed because who needs cops lol. <br><br>In anarchism there is no one to call. When your neighbor puts an AR up your face and says he&#039;s going to fuck your thirteen y.o. daughter, then he&#039;s going to do it, because there no one above the individual.

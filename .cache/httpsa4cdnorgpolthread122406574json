It&#039;s where the UK&#039;s nuclear arsenal is kept along with nearby Coulport. It&#039;s been there for nearly 35 years and is the oldest site of its nature worldwide (apparently). It used to be extremely active in actions penetrating the base, causing blockades and holding regular demonstrations. These days, in its current guise and with its current residents, it is little more than a jumped-up squat.","time":1492942467,"resto":122406574,"id":"nTr7n2uk","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122407732,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)06:25:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122406574\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122406574<\/a><br>OP, we don&#039;t know enough about this to ask you questions.<br><br>So I guess just talk about it?","time":1492943134,"resto":122406574,"id":"RXmr6LtG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

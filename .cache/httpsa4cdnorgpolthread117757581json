My brother is typical. He works for a small specialty manufacturer with less that the Obama care cut off of 70 employees. He had a group health plan through his employer. It was one of the &quot;if you like your plan, you can keep it&quot; plans that the ACA eliminated. After shopping around for a replacement plan, my brother&#039;s employer basically said, &quot;Sorry, you&#039;re on your own.&quot; So he bought a plan on the exchanges and his monthly premium went from $150 a month to $475 a month. A week before the election, a 40% premium increase was announced. At this point, he&#039;s in the position of deciding whether or not to just drop coverage and pay the annual penalty. The people losing coverage if the ACA is repealed will be Obama and Clinton voters. The actual white working class Trump voters will see some relief from a system specifically designed to fuck them with Uncle Sam&#039;s giant cock.","time":1490195735,"resto":117757581,"id":"LyO0YW0C","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117770810,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)11:16:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117767228\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117767228<\/a><br>National Review is right wing.

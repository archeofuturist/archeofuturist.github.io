The other day a teacher got security to kick me off campus because she threw a temper tantrum and didn&#039;t like what I was saying. Turns out that&#039;s illegal. She can&#039;t do that. We actually have a free speech zone on campus but it is extremely tiny, to the point where it&#039;s almost laughable. Tell me, what kind of sign should I carry around campus to help fight against this stupid free-speech zone policy? What should it say? If I refuse to get touched by campus security, should I get the police involved? <br>Also, have some tits.","filename":"IMG_4340","ext":".jpg","w":780,"h":1200,"tn_w":162,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492349154272,"time":1492349154,"md5":"KzweNjWigHemhoTi8pzBxA==","fsize":103721,"resto":0,"id":"peCihhYc","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"free-speech-on-college-campus","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121358461,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)09:31:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"Will bump once","filename":"IMG_2096","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":1600,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492349514087,"time":1492349514,"md5":"Jx\/iZSB3RMcD1nkl0xKiRA==","fsize":311273,"resto":121357964,"id":"peCihhYc","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121358503,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)09:32:23","name":"SomeTwat","com":"<a href=\"#p121357964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121357964<\/a><br>Normies seem to relate to &quot;#&quot; so why don&#039;t you use Computing forever&#039;s #allspeechmatters<br><br>Other than that you could write something utterly triggering which would be funny.<br>Maybe follow in the footsteps of that guy who said &quot;It&#039;s free speech you communist faggot&quot;.","time":1492349543,"resto":121357964,"id":"7csbtZ0W","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121358715,"now":"04\/16\/17(Sun)09:35:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121358503\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121358503<\/a><br>Good idea.

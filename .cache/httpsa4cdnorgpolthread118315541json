This means that even if you use the percentile metric, India is more than 3 times the size of USA. This means a bunch of things: 1. There are a fuck ton of poor people. 2. There are a fuck ton of average to smart people (not speaking relatively. Just numbers). Poor people are SO numerous in India that you have to stop yourself from crying just walking from one place to another because of what you get to see. These people can&#039;t even afford food, let alone toilets. This is why they just shit everywhere. I still have this memory of myself throwing rocks at this homeless woman because she was shitting on the street. Still makes me sad that I did it. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;India is the largest democracy <\/span><br><br>In addition to the 1.1 billion people, the fact that it is a democracy means that if you let that many people do whatever they want (within reason), you&#039;ll get some VERY smart people emerge. Indians, that can afford it, almost always put their children through at least a bachelors. In fact, the word &quot;graduated&quot; in India means that you have a 4 year post secondary degree and not just passing high school, which is not even celebrated. I am not saying Indians are special, I am just saying that if you have that large of a population with education at the forefront of their minds, you will get very educated people and among them you will get very smart people. This is why you see India sending a shuttle to mars in their first shot on the cheap.

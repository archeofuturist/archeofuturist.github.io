In chemical, Germany showed its scientific skills and led the production of potassium salt, dyes, pharmaceutical products, and synthetics. It led to rise of agricultural produce, thanks to its increasing production of fertilizers. Germany also controlled 90% of dye production worldwide. Companies like Bayer and Hoescht led the chemical industry of Germany. Germany also beame a leader in automobile. First cars were made in Germany. Daimler and Benz became the most popular brands of automobile in Germany and the world.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Factors that led to Germany\u2019s boom in the Second Industrial Revolution included its education and government support. Germany imposed new high tariffs against imports and protected local industries and allowed them to flourish. It also stated government subsidies towards businesses. But education played a key role. For decades Prussia and many German States invested in education. Technical schools produced great minds and inventors. Eventually, by the time of the Second Industrial Revolution, Germany had a huge supply of talented and skilled population.<\/span>","filename":"986379604[1]","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":270,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":62,"tim":1491271077701,"time":1491271077,"md5":"mtanyouLM8iZ438KDCXUEg==","fsize":32041,"resto":119404971,"id":"ftUaOBjR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

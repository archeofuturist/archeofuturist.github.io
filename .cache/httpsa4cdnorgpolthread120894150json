Think of USA where those on death row wait for the execution for decades. So they have nothing to lose masterminding anything and taking humanity down with them. So anyone on death row should be person of interest. Keep in mind that with revelation of phenomena such as suicide bombers - i&#039;m sure such &quot;switcheroos&quot; with similar looking pokemons can be arranged by alphaBET angencies to extract those on death rows.","time":1492079689,"resto":120894150,"id":"I7U7wBbq","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":120896846,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)06:57:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;Switzerland&#039;s&quot; fight. <\/span><br><br>Reminder that in my country &#039;The Murder (Abolition of Death Penalty) Act 1965&#039; was passed without a democratic mandate. The majority of people actually supported hanging all the way though to the mid 00s. Now it&#039;s about 55-45 against, although most immigrants from the 3rd world support it, for the wrong reasons. Hanging was a humane and necessary fact of social life, it wasn&#039;t cruel or pseudo-medical like the bizarre set of American killing machines. Tony Blair (the blood god) abolished hanging for treason in 1998 without public consent, the more cynical would say he perhaps wanted to cover his own back, lol. <br><br>It was not &quot;Britain&#039;s&quot; fight then, and it is not now. The abolition of hanging was a willed act from our liberal elites, like our entanglement with the EU and mass immigration, which were unpopular and so governments did not seek public consent. <br><br>I&#039;m sure Switzerland&#039;s elites don&#039;t speak for them, as mine don&#039;t speak for me. Be very wary of any media outlet or politician that claims to speak for the people. Unless there is a referendum on the death penalty, or the European Union the elites will steamroller popular, common-sense politics in pursuit of eurocommunism. One way I fear they&#039;ll avoid referenda is by escaping national democracy and outlawing certain political positions on an international level. Hanging, anti-immigration policies, deportion, populism, and reactionary views of all kinds will become infringements of &quot;INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS&quot;. Meaningless edicts from a plutocracy losing its grip over our culture.","filename":"EU","ext":".jpg","w":853,"h":543,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":79,"tim":1492081021236,"time":1492081021,"md5":"Vj2afnlpcHtpWBlfZ3KnBw==","fsize":109811,"resto":120894150,"id":"bQj7hBuX","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

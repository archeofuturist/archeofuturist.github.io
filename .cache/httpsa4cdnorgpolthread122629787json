I know not many of you agree with the dogmas of Communism here, but where did the change come from? <br><br>I am quite busy as of late, however, I managed to put some time away and download discord. Soon after I joined a few right wing, troll, w\/e channels and started looking to a join a few leftist channels. I was soon linked to the channel of r\/socialism. <br><br>Unlike the inclusive &quot;extreme right&quot; channels, i had to be screened before I was allowed to join the socialist ones. A few questions were asked, namely, what sparked my interest in socialism etc etc. <br><br>When They asked me that I told them that it was mostly their opposition to Nationalism, and I wanted to talk to Marxist Leninists who would most likely not share my opinion on race, nationalism, culture, and ethnicity, given that I am quite anti-egalitarian. <br><br>There was another guy in the screening lobby there with me. He was also asked a few questions. He was younger and didnt have any strong political beliefs - he was simply interested in politics as a whole and wanted to explore new horizons. In one of the answers, he used the word &quot;crazy&quot; which he got penalized for, and told that he should watch his mouth because the word is &quot;ableist&quot;. At this point, I was quite shocked, as if all the memes on the internets were actually true.","filename":"1492986505235","ext":".jpg","w":590,"h":720,"tn_w":204,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493064103647,"time":1493064103,"md5":"Qohc83YhPcLnKVAfLUVaQg==","fsize":90832,"resto":0,"id":"476Y4jeG","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-happened-to-communism-lately","country_name":"Canada","replies":28,"images":3,"unique_ips":15},{"no":122629835,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)16:02:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Soon after I told them that I am not a specialist on the issue, but something that I would like to explore would be gender and trans-sexualism.

This made me raise an eyebrow too, because if they are actually normal people just like us, the ratio of trannies, gays, agenders and others should equal, in other words, this should not influence your political stance. This was not the case, just like an immigrant who votes for the immigrant friendly party, these people vote for the gay\/tranny friendly party. <br><br>Soon after the debate, I was kicked out of the group, as &quot;many people have been feeling uneasy&quot; about the things I had to say.

Americans on \/pol\/ love to brag about their second amendment rights, but they never use them even when the government spies on them and takes them to war over oil. They have been outbred by hispanics. Black musicians take priority over the whites and race mixing is actively encouraged. When whites are murdered by blacks, the media ignores it, but when blacks are murdered by whites there is outrage. Caitlyn Jenner and Chelsea Manning - two men who have chosen to change their gender with surgery, and this is encouraged too. Their universities have seen the rise of feminism, multiculturalism and cultural marxism, which has spread throughout the world like a plague. I could go on, but the point is, why aren&#039;t American men doing anything to save their culture? After all, they have the guns, but never seem to use them.","filename":"asfasffa","ext":".png","w":980,"h":939,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":239,"tim":1492222689212,"time":1492222689,"md5":"mAfcjwz0gAWTebGg4BJEOg==","fsize":670339,"resto":0,"id":"0yUXDooQ","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-are-american-men-particularly-the-whites-so","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":10,"images":1,"unique_ips":8},{"no":121153814,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:19:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121153655\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121153655<\/a><br><br>It&#039;s not just &quot;nu-males&quot;, all western men are effeminate.<br><br>Yes, even the ones that browse \/pol\/.","time":1492222768,"resto":121153655,"id":"U9A\/+eW6","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121153955,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:20:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121153814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121153814<\/a><br>I&#039;m aware of this, I just find it strange how the Americans seem to think they are above it when they are the greatest examples.","time":1492222842,"resto":121153655,"id":"0yUXDooQ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121154366,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:23:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121153814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121153814<\/a><br>only if you&#039;re a leaf","filename":"average leaf poster","ext":".png","w":1023,"h":396,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":48,"tim":1492223034447,"time":1492223034,"md5":"K6LqLkIqh7l+ECo2nSitXQ==","fsize":122232,"resto":121153655,"id":"5NHNWBeG","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":121154554,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:25:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121153814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121153814<\/a><br>D-d-delet this","time":1492223128,"resto":121153655,"id":"gbwmU1SW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121154601,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:25:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121153655\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121153655<\/a><br>Anglos are genetically predisposed to being effeminate.","time":1492223155,"resto":121153655,"id":"QinWz1Hd","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":121154658,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:26:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121153814\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121153814<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes, even the ones that browse \/pol\/.<\/span><br>ANIME ISN&#039;T EFFEMINATE IT IS RED PILLED AS FUCK","time":1492223180,"resto":121153655,"id":"NmGvlr+9","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121154699,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:26:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121154366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121154366<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;black <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;business man<\/span><br>It&#039;s the little details.","time":1492223195,"resto":121153655,"id":"0yUXDooQ","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121155034,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)22:29:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121154366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121154366<\/a><br><br>Leaves are also effeminate on \/pol\/.

My dad told me later when I grew up that my mom would &quot;protect&quot; me from him making me do shit around the house. Up until I was like 12 I wished I was a girl and only hung out around girls, so yeah America has some fucked up homes. There&#039;s way too many laws favoring mothers to the point that good fathers have no choice but to watch their son degrade into a cancerous mindset of pure emotion and bullshit. I corrected it myself in my later teens. No clue how we can fix this as a country, we&#039;re in way too deep through many generations of the &quot;you&#039;re awesome&quot; mindset.","time":1492224229,"resto":121153655,"id":"ZWp69sqA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Normally it&#039;s not one thing but a coumpounding of things, like not sleeping as much as I want and being a bit late, forgetting to do something, breaking a rule you imposed on yourself, having people breaking their word and having people being rude and unaware of their issues. Then I just sleep and the next day I&#039;m fine. I just gotta know that anger doesn&#039;t have a filter and it just mixes everything into one thing, so that you blame one thing that is at the center of it for everything that is wrong, but when you sleep you work it out that it&#039;s never that simple.<br><br>I also stress eat and masturbate to numb anger and boredom. I also try to stand up for myself when needed, risking your skin metaphorically by calling people out on their shitty behaviour can be good to relieve anger, though if you&#039;re angry while you do it it&#039;s too hard. You have to be honest enough to articulate your thoughts in a rational manner through speech in such a way that the fact that you&#039;re angry is seems as something people sympathize with rather than use as an excuse to ignore you.","filename":"1491599519865","ext":".png","w":1200,"h":1000,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":104,"tim":1491892417655,"time":1491892417,"md5":"YCtAGjkMQpSiLSjDeXTkzA==","fsize":839206,"resto":120561409,"id":"\/T9xkCRc","country":"BR","m_img":1,"country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120565129,"now":"04\/11\/17(Tue)02:34:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"I left 4chan and stopped posting forever.

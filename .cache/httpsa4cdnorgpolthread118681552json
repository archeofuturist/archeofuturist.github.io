Did the states or their representatives have the right to leave the Union? Some senators, such as Maine\u2019s William Pitt Fessenden, insisted that Southern states did not have the right to withdraw from the Union. By leaving the Senate, Fessenden argued, Southern members had effectively resigned their seats. Others, such as Delaware\u2019s James Bayard, believed states did have the right to secede and that seats held by Southern secessionists no longer existed. The Senate should not declare their seats vacant but simply strike their names from the roll. After a heated exchange, the Senate sided with Fessenden and passed a resolution declaring the seats of six of their departed colleagues \u201cvacant\u201d and authorizing the Secretary of the Senate to strike their names from the Senate roll.<\/span><br><br>How many states are officially sanctuary states or contain sanctuary cities?<br><br>If the feds just declared them all to be in a state of rebellion, that&#039;d suddenly be a lot of vacancies in the senate.

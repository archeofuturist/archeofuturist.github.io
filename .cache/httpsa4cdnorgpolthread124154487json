Can you make a Christian of a Jew? I tell you, nay. If a Jew comes into this Church, and honestly professes to be a Saint, a follower of Christ, and if the blood of Judah is in his veins, he will apostatize. He may have been born and bred a Jew, have the face of a Jew, speak the language of the Jews and have attended to all the ceremonies of the Jewish religion, and have openly professed to be a Jew all his days; but I will tell you a secret\u2014there is not a particle of the blood of Judaism in him, if he has become a true Christian, a Saint of God; for if there is, he will most assuredly leave the Church of Christ, or that blood will be purged out of his veins. We have men among us who were Jews, and became converted from Judaism. For instance, here is brother Neibaur; do I believe there is one particle of the blood of Judah in his veins? No, not so much as could be seen on the point of the finest cambric needle, through a microscope with a magnifying power of two millions. This is a secret that you will perhaps find out, in a coming day, to your satisfaction. The Lord knew how to preach to the Jews, and told them what the truth was. You may as well undertake to command the most degraded of these Indian tribes, and give them arms and accoutrements, and try to put them through the regular military exercise, as to preach to the Jews to make them believe in the Lord Jesus Christ.","filename":"7be88cecce3be6d2b31ac4468eb7df22","ext":".jpg","w":542,"h":542,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493953693872,"time":1493953693,"md5":"pHltXKpMe+rUEsBDB7pzeQ==","fsize":248204,"resto":124154487,"id":"B9nYg2uw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124155823,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:09:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124154487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124154487<\/a><br>Guess who can also get to play now.","filename":"Church_of_Scientology_building_in_Los_Angeles,_Fountain_Avenue","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":714,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1493953790797,"time":1493953790,"md5":"e4WPvTP8U6yEZeJWxlMxNw==","fsize":120361,"resto":124154487,"id":"YOO+ovvR","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":124155907,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:10:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124155550\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124155550<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;pissing about with the no true scotsman while the world burns down around you<\/span><br>wew lad yourself","filename":"church_of_jesus_christ_of_latter-day_saints","ext":".jpg","w":485,"h":275,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":70,"tim":1493953831703,"time":1493953831,"md5":"Hria2QiDPIAZmBCe7Cnw4A==","fsize":34908,"resto":124154487,"id":"B9nYg2uw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124155928,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)23:10:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124155372\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124155372<\/a><br>if Mormons start laying the smackdown, then that is proof that god is on their side.

Grant was vocal in his disapproval of the policies of the thirty-second President, especially after the death of his pro-Roosevelt first counselor, Anthony B. Ivins, in September 1934. He would often become upset when discussing FDR, and in one heated discussions slammed his cane on the desk of Franklin J. Murdock, shattering the glass desktop in his anti-Roosevelt fury. It comes as no surprise, then, that in the election of 1936, President Grant openly endorsed the Republican candidate for President, Alf Landon. However, he pointed out that he was speaking for himself and not for the Church\u2026As the 1936 election drew near, an unsigned, front-page editorial in the Church-owned Deseret News accused FDR of knowingly promoting unconstitutional laws and advocating Communism\u2026Former First Presidency member Marion G. Romney, a staunch Democrat committed to vote for Roosevelt, was deeply torn\u2026After fasting and three hours of prayer Marion concluded that the editorial was inspired and given through the Lord\u2019s prophet.

But its problem are different.<br>Italy has a *public* system... this means some managers might take bribes from suppliers or from Mafia bosses who need some special benefits. However, the entire legal system is not rigged to jail people asap. Why? Because since jail managers, jail janitors, jail admins, and jail guards are all State jobs, MORE INMATES = MORE WORK FOR EVERYONE.<br><br>Theoretically speaking, a fully public jail system, when well managed, should make it possible to control criminals but to jail only the dangerous or recidivist ones. Not just every Jack or Sheila who couldn&#039;t afford a good lawyer.<br><br>To the very contrary, it seems to me the prison system of the US, together with its legal system, is 100% rigged against citizens, thus resulting in severe punishments even for misdemeanour and minor offences.<br><br>Why the fuck do you keep feeding the prison-Jew? <br><br>I am well aware some of you think that even your average weed-smoker needs some time behind the bars... but let&#039;s be frank, guyse: that&#039;s fucking ridiculous.

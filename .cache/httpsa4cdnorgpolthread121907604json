They are not training. It&#039;s just a giveaway of resources whose practice is derived from Christianity and, possibly, implemented by cucked institutions such as the Salvation Army.<br>Of course, SOMETIMES gibs are necessary (e.g. in the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster, or in case of wartime reliefs), but<br>###most of the time gibes have the effect of making poorfags want to remain poorfags###<br>i.e. exactly the reason why you&#039;re suspicious of gibs in general -- and rightfully so.<br><br>### PUBLIC SERVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURES ###<br><br>These are not gibs. Not charity. They are not fucking free. The whole society pays for them and they benefit everyone. Typical example: roads.<br>But schooling is more like roads than like charity... because the more you do schooling (which is, unfortunately, a special type of brainwashing -- to handle with care) the more you obtain a peaceful population -- or at least a self-conscious one or, if schooling is very effective, you give most of them the basic tools to make a living and not be a criminal (i.e. supposing you don&#039;t want to teach people morals, but just efficient ways to cooperate).<br><br>So no. Fuck no. Public schools are not gifts... not even in your silly libertarian fuckhead.

In the process of this continuing failure, he did nothing to stop attacks now just like how he let refugees choose between war and starvation.<br>Trump cites a law about chemical weapon use to justify this attack. Obviously, stopping further attacks takes priority.<br>The most pertinent question is, did intelligence know there was gas beforehand?

Local media reported that those two bodies were thrown from the same plane as the body that landed on the hospital. <br>The official did not know if the man was alive when he was thrown from the plane. Officials from the state prosecutor\u2019s office were at the scene, he said. <br>Local media reported that suspected gang members had picked up the two other corpses. <br>Sinaloa is the home state of Joaquin \u201cChapo\u201d Guzman, who ran the Sinaloa drug cartel until his arrest in 2016. He was extradited to the United States earlier this year.","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492096976885,"time":1492096976,"md5":"8QkDrsau9qpGMaQ3LJqhRw==","fsize":30079,"resto":0,"id":"PBPTO8mp","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mexico-body-of-man-thrown-from-plane-found-on","country_name":"United States","replies":17,"images":3,"unique_ips":17},{"no":120921361,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)11:27:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120920846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120920846<\/a><br>He didn&#039;t fly so good!","time":1492097264,"resto":120920846,"id":"9fL+qgUu","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120921541,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)11:29:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120920846\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120920846<\/a><br><br>I guess you could say he dropped in for some emergency treatment. <br><br>Carlos.jpg","time":1492097365,"resto":120920846,"id":"AuA93fnt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120921622,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)11:30:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120921361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120921361<\/a><br>FPBP","time":1492097405,"resto":120920846,"id":"bxWHq+u+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120921661,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)11:30:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"He works for the mercenary, correct?

All atheism really is at its core is a lack of belief. All one has to do to become an Atheist is renounce the reason to follow a number of very important behavioral regulations. While the actual law covers some, there are quite a few essential moral guidelines that cannot be translated into legislation. That&#039;s not to say that the laws of one&#039;s country are the only guiding value for atheists. Just that a large chunk of them tend to have very little in the way of a moral compass. (The best example is premarital sex. It&#039;s objectively bad, yet as society has become more secular, it&#039;s become more accepted.

While Communism&#039;s spectre is currently haunting the West, and Post-Modernism is eroding our civilization, neither ideology is very popular when direct references are made\/drawn. Atheism is something that has been quite intertwined with the Far-Left, so the American public naturally sees it as being inseparable from those things.<br><br>t.

They can&#039;t even fathom thinking of a solution to their own problems, partly because they&#039;re retarded, and partly because of these morons telling them it&#039;s the system oppressing them.<br><br> There&#039;s also the problem of single parenthood. Constantly being coddled by the mother, and never being taught discipline by the father. That&#039;s why the father-mother dynamic is so important to raising a child, the balance between the maternal and paternal instinct. It&#039;s also why it&#039;s important to our society that&#039;s getting too heavily balanced on the maternal side. I&#039;m hoping the pendulum swings back soon, but the rhetoric has to end for it to do so.","time":1492457387,"resto":121560998,"id":"\/2bAIXLm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

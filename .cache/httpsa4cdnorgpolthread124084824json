For example, there are no good movies anymore, and if there are it&#039;s like 1 out of 15 that&#039;s decent, same with video games and music, like the quality has dropped. I know it&#039;s not really relevant but it&#039;s only a part of it. I&#039;m repeating myself but everything just seems off. Shops completely desert, busy streets having almost no cars in them, people not showing up for work, almost no one in the cafeteria at the place where I work. Degradation in the quality of everything, as if people don&#039;t care anymore. People being depressed and angry. It&#039;s hard to explain.

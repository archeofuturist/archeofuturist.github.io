I&#039;ve been gritting my teeth some what with the last 2 seasons of who deliberately portraying the diversity of British history as being on a par with modern London, when frankly it wasn&#039;t like that in the 1980&#039;s so certainly wasn&#039;t in the 1980s or 1480&#039;s. I accepted them doing this as it was clearly an over reaction to criticism and the new BBC mantra. Only being a fantasy I thought what the he&#039;ll, but this week with the 2 in your face moments of walking out the TARDIS and Bill asking about slavery in 1814 that could be a prime opportunity to say, actually not in England since 1066 and that in 1814 the empire so seeking to scrub it from the Earth. Worse though was the history is whitewash comment, it a show which is in fact actively tarbrushing. As people under 20 now are getting their history from TV and can&#039;t see a word different from the present then they will soak up the message that every history book and even contemporary photo drawing or other source it part of some evil conspiry, which is unhealthy. <br>I do support episodes set in the future or present having a full range though as that will be accurate.","filename":"1493629356314259957170","ext":".jpg","w":3840,"h":2160,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493629400707,"time":1493629400,"md5":"eI53\/e\/WiUa70HGB29RXGg==","fsize":2003919,"resto":0,"id":"UGZEans8","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dr-who-changing-history","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":3,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":123599499,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)05:12:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"yup, the future is bleak","time":1493629957,"resto":123598964,"id":"WqUeoznm","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":123599671,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)05:15:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123599499\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123599499<\/a><br>Kek.","time":1493630120,"resto":123598964,"id":"+Xqow3dy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123599895,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)05:18:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123598964\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123598964<\/a><br>History needs to be rewritten to fit the cultural-marxist narrative.

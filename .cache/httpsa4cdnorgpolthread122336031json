I&#039;ll state mine and then reply to comments.<br><br>Good:<br><br>1) He basically single-handedly killed the TPP and thus preserved US sovereignty. <br>2) He is starting the process to build the wall.<br>3) He did not get sucked in to a (((neocon))) conflict in Syria and showed poise and judgment. <br>4) He has continued to attack &quot;fake news&quot;<br>5) He tricked Ryan into falling on his face over his health care bill. <br><br>Bad:<br><br>1) There has been effectively a Deep State takeover, with Flynn fired, CIA Pompeo recruited, Comey retained, and so on. <br>2) Jeff Sessions and Steven Bannon have had their role minimized while Kushner and Cohn, both globalists, have been elevated. <br>3) He has backtracked on many of his positions on investigating Clinton, China as a currency manipulator, friendly relations with Russia.<br>4) He tends to cave in to pressure to get media attention, yet the CNN agenda is 100% opposed to his publicly stated policy goals. <br><br>On the whole then, I believe that he has done better than Bush II (a very low standard) and Obama, but far lower than his possibilities and promises.","filename":"Trump 3 months","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":208,"tim":1492899412881,"time":1492899412,"md5":"QL2gEs\/G8DpF\/HbM+4oGDw==","fsize":40233,"resto":0,"id":"tSNT9cVd","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-at-3-months","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":0,"unique_ips":6},{"no":122336376,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)18:19:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Perhaps my biggest disappointment is that he has changed in mode from Trump ideologist to pragmatic deal maker, and with this, the Trump ideology has faded in importance, as its best spokesperson has been compromised.

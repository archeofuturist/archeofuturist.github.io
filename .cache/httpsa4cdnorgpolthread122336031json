Im at a right wing uni studying a very left dominated topic of study. For the most part the professors have been very open. I critique intersectional femenism and even the far leftists agreed with me and disagreed in a rational manner. Even the super-lefty professors are usually really understanding and open to debate. <br>On the other hand I see the shit my friends at universities like NYU, Yale, and GWU are posting and it makes my fucking head spin. I think that we have a tendency to generalize. Ive met really intelligent leftists and really intelligent righties but neither were in the majority. I was really sad that the election ensured that theres really no room for middle ground anymore, I hate the horseshoe meme but I think its true that rational people are usually not extremists.

The United States offers a premium rural experience. Other countries are better if you prefer an urban lifestyle. The idea in finding an ideal place to live in the US is to avoid places where gangs, Muslims, or Mexican cartels congregate. Islam is cancer. Regular Mexicans are fine. Mormons are fine. Stay out of Mormonism, though. As someone who has had to fake religious belief for family reasons, be advised that this is a miserable lifestyle. Best to just leave them to their own devices and avoid arguing with them.<br><br>Until we finish deporting the foreign trespassers, any area that has a lot of Mexicans is going to have a lot of cartel members. Most of the Mexicans are victims, but that is how the demographics work out. Wherever you go, you&#039;ll get used to the weather. What matters are the people. So, I&#039;d suggest heading up to North Dakota. There is new oil money up there for anyone willing to work damned hard in miserable conditions. The pay is lucrative.<br><br>Think of cold winters and minimal urban luxuries as gang and terrorist repellant. The cold northlands attract the nicest and best people. Go to, say, Alaska, Canada, the US Upper Midwest, Iceland, Scotland, Norway, Finland, Russia, or Hokkaido. Sadly, Sweden is no longer included in this list. South of there reside almost all of the disease, war, crime, and corruption in the world.","time":1490522066,"resto":118340674,"id":"tanNPde7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118345590,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)05:56:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118340674\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118340674<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2000<\/span><br>non-whites are everywhere now","filename":"1486884150049","ext":".png","w":4200,"h":3105,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1490522191143,"time":1490522191,"md5":"oBfl61GXHy2dl+ZxSOSeIw==","fsize":640223,"resto":118340674,"id":"hws\/bkiB","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118345595,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)05:56:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118345438\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118345438<\/a><br>...You know, just avoid New England, the Great Lakes area, or Northwestern Washington.

These were calm times, nothing besides 9\/11 really happened, and their parents probably taught them to live their lives well, being kind, respecting others, fight discrimination and so on. Growing up these people slowly radicalized while thinking they were still moderate and in the right, defenders of free speech and equality, but in reality they became left wing fascists trying to silence everyone who is not 100% on their side. <br><br>Now people from Gen grew up in this enviroment, with people telling them that they should fight for what they believe is right, that free speech only applies in some cases, that some people deserve to be beaten because of their opinions and so on. Lo an behold Gen Z learns this and as they grow up they apply these principles, with the only difference being that they see what Millenials where doing wrong and have the honesty to admit that they are basically fascists. <br><br>Thoughts?","filename":"tmp_15336-14913195503762048284551","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491473138443,"time":1491473138,"md5":"4ee4SqmJa9uE4Du2AF5ZCA==","fsize":44421,"resto":0,"id":"KHzgRX40","country":"IT","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-just-had-this-thought-regarding-sjws-and-gen-z","country_name":"Italy","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119728081,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)06:16:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"GEN Z are supposedly more frugal with their money, and millenials are far better able to tell them that University is a waste of time.

I am well aware of the philosophy he has constructed for himself on this topic after listening to several hour long interviews, round-table discussions, talks, I&#039;ve listened to nearly every phoner he&#039;s done with the press and investors. I&#039;ve read a massive number of articles he&#039;s either written or has been quoted in\/interviewed in as the subject. I&#039;ve read his biography several times, and I&#039;ve read all of the literature he&#039;s made mention of. <br><br>Suffice to say I know Elon Musk. <br><br>Elon Musk started the OpenAI initiative after having several talks with Sergey Brin, being introduced to Ray Kurzweil, and then subsequently being introduced to a guy by the name of Nick Bostrom. Bostrom basically gave Elon a crash course into his own world view, and Elon (being the pragmatic sort that looks at society from a sort of Bayesian lens) subsequently adopted Bostrom&#039;s thoughts. Essentially, if you can give Elon a well reasoned argument and defend your position from essentially every question he throws at you - he&#039;ll agree with it and make it into his own. This is how he went from being a Libertarian into essentially a Social Dem. I&#039;ve watched this unfold over the course of nearly ten years. <br><br>Elon believes that AGI (artificial general intelligence) is going to happen. Most of the people who study the field also believe it will happen. We already know hypothetically one way to make it happen, but it&#039;s extremely unethical and not to mention expensive on the order of (according to Bostrom) ten or more Manhattan Projects. <br><br>With this in mind, he believes that a &quot;take-off scenario&quot; will also occur once AGI has been achieved. Once this happens, AGI will turn into SI (superintelligence) and create a Singleton (a one world power that bends every other world power into submission by a coup). <br><br>Essentially everything else is an irrelevancy because SI is the end goal.","time":1490689152,"resto":118622815,"id":"Gyuh1UMx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118628041,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:19:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118627990\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118627990<\/a><br>i can has skulgun?<br>-zeitgeist<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;(this now now \/DXG\/ Deus Ex General)<\/span>","filename":"2831-system-shock-dos-front-cover","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":1114,"tn_w":89,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490689184579,"time":1490689184,"md5":"VM8ovQGElcoVaG7YfykIWg==","fsize":128099,"resto":118622815,"id":"P4pcEFbC","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":118628065,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:20:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118622815\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118622815<\/a><br>Flesh &gt; Machine","filename":"1","ext":".jpg","w":852,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490689213128,"time":1490689213,"md5":"UVmvjeG8jW1l3OFYCWDdQg==","fsize":115973,"resto":118622815,"id":"WmyuPPR6","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":118628108,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:21:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118628065\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118628065<\/a><br>An organism is merely a machine with a much cheaper manufacturing process","time":1490689262,"resto":118622815,"id":"P4pcEFbC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118628131,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:21:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118622815\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118622815<\/a><br>For the last time Elon Musk is a con man.

It was founded by two guys who created an early tablet and then sold it to the company that owns TV Guide. They started losing money hand over fist and turned to Musk for help. Musk wanted to make an electric car because he thought they were just better than ICE vehicles, and that Detroit had fallen to pieces. Not specifically because he was trying to battle global warming. This is the same reason why he made X.com (later PayPal). He thought that the Banking system was utterly corrupt and incompetent. There&#039;s a rather lengthy story about currency and bond swaps he wanted to implement, but couldn&#039;t because no bank was willing to do it. He almost bought a bank just to try it, but then realized that he could try and make a digital bank instead. Peter Thiel is a fucking imbecile and stopped Musk from upturning the entire banking system like he intended all because Musk wanted to move their infrastructure to MS and keep X.com as the brand name as opposed to PayPal.","time":1490691447,"resto":118622815,"id":"Gyuh1UMx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118630211,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:58:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118630090\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118630090<\/a><br>embrace*","time":1490691518,"resto":118622815,"id":"hGTJ074F","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":118630234,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:59:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118630090\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118630090<\/a><br>No all of us are conservafucks<br><br>I myself was lefty until I saw the Hillary corruption","time":1490691552,"resto":118622815,"id":"lBwRVdS1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118630259,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:59:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118630056\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118630056<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;programs itself<\/span><br>Because it&#039;s programmed to do that by humans and it will program itself as much as humans have programmed it to.","filename":"ackchyually","ext":".png","w":700,"h":700,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490691576638,"time":1490691576,"md5":"ks8cxqgLgkItWnyhjj6RyA==","fsize":21282,"resto":118622815,"id":"BU3GJxCb","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":118630262,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)04:59:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118629685\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118629685<\/a><br><br>That is exactly the case.

Then they ramped up production and hit 150k in two years. These are vehicles that go for anywhere between 100,000 to 150,000 dollars. <br><br>The Model 3 will go for anywhere between 50,000 to 70,000 dollars. This is important, because once you start comparing the number of vehicles sold in the same price range, you see how Tesla outsells their competitors. <br><br>It isn&#039;t about collective number of units sold, obviously they don&#039;t sell nearly as many vehicles. This is because they only have two types of vehicles to sell currently, and only one of them as it stands has the proper production pipeline. The Model X has more or less been sidelined due to the greater impact that the Model 3 will have on their bottom line. <br><br>So compare the number of 50 to 70k vehicles that Ford sells per year, and then compare that to the number of Model 3&#039;s Tesla expects to sell and you&#039;ve got it.

It\u2019s sort of a funny story. In 1972, the revised Democratic rules coming out of the 1968 debacle required that notice be given of caucuses and primaries that would select party delegates. Prior to that, party bosses could schedule primaries without telling anyone. But the new rules required a 30-day requirement. Iowa\u2019s system has four parts \u2014 the caucus, then the county convention, then the congressional district conventions, then the state conventions \u2014 so, to give a 30-day notice for all of them, Iowa had to start advertising early.<br><br>The second part, the state convention, is normally held in June. In 1972, they looked and found there were no available hotel rooms in Des Moines on the planned weekend. So they pushed the convention back. And that meant they had to push the caucuses back. And that\u2019s how they ended up in January, in front of New Hampshire. It was not a plan, and in 1972, it made no difference. Edmund Muskie spent about a day there. But in 1976, Jimmy Carter\u2019s campaign noticed Iowa was first and decided to invest some time. He ultimately came in second to uncommitted, but his win got him attention, and ultimately helped him get to the White House.<br><br>EK: And how has Iowa retained it? You would think that some other state, desirous of the same power Iowa has, would just leapfrog it.<br><br>DR: Iowa\u2019s two parties realized very early on that this was advantageous, so they agreed to hold their caucuses on the same day. And then they wrote into Iowa law that the caucuses must be the first event. New Hampshire\u2019s laws say they have to be the first primary, which is what lets Iowa stay in front. But both say they\u2019ll go as early as they have to go.","time":1491259586,"resto":119361034,"id":"H2ceOszt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119393085,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)18:50:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119364567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119364567<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;urbanite vehicles<\/span><br>Suburbanite, they&#039;re all over the westcoast.","time":1491259812,"resto":119361034,"id":"UXgkXplo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119393267,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)18:51:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119388470\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119388470<\/a><br>That you know of...","time":1491259912,"resto":119361034,"id":"cwEZgfbH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119393310,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)18:52:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119362850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119362850<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;HYPE-er-lope<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;physically possible<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;technically feasible <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;economically sound<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;in any way safe if somehow built<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;actually useful<\/span><br>Pick none<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=kx5<wbr>2A-v65Q8&amp;list=PLZO1csBNKgzctRsx2CjC<wbr>p2r01OGxFU0US","time":1491259937,"resto":119361034,"id":"XjQYnejR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119393534,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)18:54:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119392650\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119392650<\/a><br>Fake news, kid. <br>Nice to know you&#039;re simply regurgitating though. <br>Make no mistake, you are part of the problem.

It happens before the collapse. Autos are in trouble, so TSLA is going up because it&#039;s the weakest auto manufacturer who can&#039;t survive a recession. It&#039;s actually happening more often than not when industry encounters problems. The question is what happens after the squeeze. VW was bigger than XOM for a few days. VW didn&#039;t need the access to money in 2008, so it didn&#039;t get destroyed. TSLA does need constant access to money. So what happens to them when other autos flash red? They will reorg.

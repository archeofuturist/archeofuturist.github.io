The desire for the woman to put off raising a family in this pursuit, which also contributes to a long-term negative effect in the <br>creation of a family in section C. <br>B. The unlikelihood that a man with high sexual prowess will settle down and raise a child with the particular woman given the fact <br>that he has many other options and may be animalistic himself. <br>C. The elimination of the possibility of raising a strong family with a man who has less sexual prowess than any man the woman has <br>had sex with before. The reason for this is that a woman will only remain subservient and desire to be with the person who is the top <br>alpha male in her sexual past. The woman is subservient to the feelings and pleasure that the alpha male gave her. A man who remains <br>in a relationship with a woman in which he has no possibility for becoming the top alpha male in her sexual history is a beta and <br>therefore weaker and inferior to the actual alpha male from the perspective of the woman and her feelings. If the woman disregards <br>her sexual hierarchy and starts a family with a beta male, the partnership is doomed to be weak and they will fail in remaining <br>together and fail to create strong offspring. The woman may have chosen the beta for his provider status because of her inability to <br>hold down an alpha male. The beta is a provider of both monetary and emotional support for the woman. The woman is the dominant <br>person in the relationship with the beta male because she holds the locus of power in the relationship- her sexual feelings and needs <br>that are not being met.&quot;","time":1492438479,"resto":121528984,"id":"jA+GJdNm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121530997,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:24:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"One of the five destructive tendencies, wrath. also includes depression, madness, hedonism, and ignorance.<br><br>&quot;Wrath <br><br>Our inherent meaningless existence produces mental and physical anguish.

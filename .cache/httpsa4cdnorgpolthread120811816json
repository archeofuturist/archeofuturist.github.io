Congress shouldn&#039;t need to investigate Rice, Obama, Rhodes, etc. They should be in front of a grand jury. Congress is hoping the public will just forget about all of this, and the media is definitely helping with that.<br>Keep hoping for Sessions to do something, but it could be that pushback is too much\/hard for them to get anything done. I really think there are some good folks in DC that would like to see justice, but it definitely seems like everything continues to be forgotten and swept under the rug.","time":1492032813,"resto":120811816,"id":"invV2fEw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

The term \u201cconstructive murder\u201d should generally be used in preference to \u201cfelony murder\u201d to avoid confusion with the common law: R v Spathis; R v Patsalis [2001] NSWCCA 476 at [209].<br><br>In R v Jacobs (2004) 151 A Crim R 452 at [332] Wood CJ at CL said:<br><br>Constructive murder is not to be regarded as less serious, and thereby attracting a lighter total sentence or non-parole period than that which is appropriate for other categories of murder: R v Mills NSWCCA 3 April 1995. Just as is the case for the other categories, there are degrees of seriousness of constructive murder, and the determination of the appropriate sentence for any individual offence depends upon the nature of the offender\u2019s conduct and the part which he or she played in the events giving rise to death: R v JB [1999] NSWCCA 93.<br><br>Aslett v R [2006] NSWCCA 360 was a case of constructive murder, the foundational crime being one of robbery armed with a dangerous weapon. The court observed at [21] that \u201c[a] murder committed in these circumstances may be as serious as a murder committed with intent to kill\u201d, but on appeal reduced a life sentence to a non-parole period of 28 years with an additional term of six years.<br><br>In R v Mills (unrep, 3\/4\/95, NSWCCA), Cole JA said:<br><br>As the trial judge made clear, taking a loaded firearm and using it as a threat whilst in the course of committing a serious felony is a most serious matter. It is to be greatly discouraged by sentences of this Court.

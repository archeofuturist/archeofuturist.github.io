Shitty for sure, but there&#039;s been no evidence so far that it was a race thing per se. <br><br>Still you have resentful Korean- and Chinese-American aznidentity types stateside funnelling their race-hustling POV to the media back in Asia, where this is turning into a shitstorm.<br><br>A few decades this likely wouldn&#039;t have been seen through the race-hustling frame, sure Chinese would have been angry, but not at &quot;racism&quot; per se but at the abuse of their co-ethnics regardless of the reason.<br><br>But now everything bad that happens to an Asian ever in a white nation is seen through the lens of &quot;arrogant white supremacism&quot; and is used to argue how Asians are too nice to whites, how whites are violent savages blah blah blah...<br><br>This trend is really serious. Because this race-baiting shit doesn&#039;t stay in SJWland where it belongs, but spreads all over the world. The Americanization of the world now extends to race-politics.

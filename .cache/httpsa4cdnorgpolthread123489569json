Rather it just changes its goals slightly. There are some humans that are simply born with genetics or circumstances that make them incompatible with society. Those people simply need to be removed from society. There are yet others who simply need help adjusting to society, even if they commit egregious crimes. These are the ones that require the justice system to adapt. We should be working on rehabilitating those, rather than trying to punish them because we erroneously believe they have simply made the choice to be bad.<br><br>Here&#039;s another hard truth for you since you seem to be into that if you&#039;re reading about how we don&#039;t have free will. The only reason why the human body is so robust today is because countless humans lived a suffering and miserable life from birth through no fault of their own, and our species must continue this trend of we want to remain as we are. That means we have to commit ourselves to some sort of genetic hygiene program, either through technology or selective pressures.","time":1493567429,"resto":123489569,"id":"7hotl7i9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123490501,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)11:51:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123490329\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123490329<\/a><br>This is patently false and your arguments to support it are fallacious.

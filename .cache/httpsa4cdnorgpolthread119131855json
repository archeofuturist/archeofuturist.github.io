They don&#039;t trust the media, they don&#039;t trust governments, and definitely don&#039;t trust others feeding them information without factual evidence to back up their claims. They look at raw statistics and the arguments people make to make a fair assessment on an issue. <br>&quot;Redpilling&quot; is just a term used to describe someone abandoning traditional consumption of information (through news outlets and government) and drawing their own conclusions. Often these conclusions are right-winged because modern media (and most western governments) tend to do a poor job justifying claims using facts. The only way to prevent right wing philosophy from spreading is to debate them on their own terms using statistics, facts, and logic to turn the debate. I don&#039;t think that will happen in the forseeable future.","time":1491014918,"resto":119131855,"id":"x7Y6Wguf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119134910,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)22:50:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119131855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119131855<\/a><br>You just fell for the leftist victim narrative meme that they&#039;ve been spreading for decades now.<br>Blacks and other groups got discriminated openly in America back in the day because they acted like savages.","time":1491015049,"resto":119131855,"id":"gLkxKuYF","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":119135113,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)22:53:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119132530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119132530<\/a><br>we dont claim to be all-knowing, we just have convictions that we like to express<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;most of us dont hate women<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;most of us dont hate blacks<\/span><br>we are free to believe in what we believe and if you are so offended by these views, than please avoid the ONLY PLACE ON THE INTERNET WHERE YOU CAN FIND THEM","filename":"1490568899349s","ext":".jpg","w":125,"h":120,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1491015189131,"time":1491015189,"md5":"8n5fhESpejQkom1hpbPnJA==","fsize":4270,"resto":119131855,"id":"f+Wg2aDr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119135300,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)22:55:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"Confederate States(Republicans states) are fucking are insanes, even now. <br>THEN<br>http:\/\/www.eyewitnesstohistory.com\/<wbr>slaveship.htm<br><br>NOW<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-GX<wbr>MnlIjJtY","filename":"bananaAMERICA","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":648,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1491015302979,"time":1491015302,"md5":"KSAoMtpHB3Vs\/MBh4RQiFw==","fsize":481127,"resto":119131855,"id":"cV6o87iX","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119135304,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)22:55:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119131855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119131855<\/a><br>I guess you didn&#039;t want the original.","time":1491015306,"resto":119131855,"id":"K\/BtSCpy","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119136076,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:03:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119131855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119131855<\/a><br>Here&#039;s the deal, try to fix your ghettos and be supportive of the government.<br>Regardless of what&#039;s the outcome, keep asking questions if the plan seems bleek.","time":1491015822,"resto":119131855,"id":"jYBuiXLK","country":"PH","country_name":"Philippines"},{"no":119138338,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)23:29:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119131855\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119131855<\/a>","filename":"hate31","ext":".png","w":616,"h":190,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":38,"tim":1491017369746,"time":1491017369,"md5":"LVl47hbhuKzem6BQ4eQLqw==","fsize":21751,"resto":119131855,"id":"XhyMbyN0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Whether this is due to something inherent to Islam, or a failure of cultural policymaking in government, the fact is that they are constantly getting bigger, and a natural result of that is that they are getting more assertive about wanting to push their cultural beliefs on others. They maintain loyalty to their Muslim in-group, and as the population shifts, the balance of power does too, and they want to throw their weight around in the balance of power game to renegotiate their position.<br><br>What happens when they&#039;re 30% of the population? 40%? 50%?

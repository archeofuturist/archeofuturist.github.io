They think that spamming lengthy words means they&#039;re good at writing despite their disregard for what makes applicable diction.<br><br>Why did I go on about how leftists write? Because it relates to how they love to criticize Trump for using simple language. It&#039;s rather pathetic that these tools don&#039;t realize that effective language is more important than shoving a thesaurus up your ass and pretending you&#039;re intelligent for it.<br><br>It is the same reason they treat Trump as an idiot yet are always baffled whenever he turns the tables on them.<br><br>These twats lack applicable, practical knowledge that actually carries meaning in the real world. They&#039;re so obsessed with the fallacious that it has blinded them to what real intelligence is.<br><br>If all you can do is parrot the achievements of better people without any input of your own or ability to utilize it in the real world, then you deserve all the student debt imaginable.<br><br>This faux intellectual circlejerking is what pisses people off. Because these cretins think themselves so above everyone else, yet they&#039;re completely useless in the real world while demanding to be obeyed, it is easy to understand the widespread resentment directed at the elite left.<br><br>What Meryl Streep said of martial arts is another sore note. She exemplifies how the left is obsessed with the pretentious that it is completely lost on her what comprises martial *arts*. I suppose these idiots are allergic to anything applicable outside of controlled bubbles.<br><br>The picture is another example. This is how they think why cuckoldry is &quot;intelligent&quot;.<br><br>&quot;It&#039;s sexual torment but for the MIND.

I identify myself as a nationalist and reject pretty much all of the nu-right and left ideologies of multiculturalism, degeneracy, globalism, etc. I also been hitting the gym for about a year now for the sole purpose of improving myself. I&#039;m trying to become more patriotic and at the same time getting more into religion (I&#039;ve been an atheist almost all my life). <br>The problem is that I don&#039;t manage to find that inspiration from within that makes me change my worldview. I still have normie feelings like wanting to be accepted by everyone and even though I don&#039;t go out much to party or meet new people I still want to belong even if i know that society is filled with degenerates that wouldn&#039;t last a second if society starts crumbling. <br>How can I finally detach from all these feelings and solely focus on bettering myself, both physically and mentally, and finding a suitable qt to start a family with? I really want to be an exemplary citizen and human being but I just don&#039;t get that motivation from within that makes me follow my ideals because I love them. Until now I&#039;ve been doing plenty of things that are positive for myself but I do them not because I want to but because I know they are right. How can I find conviction and truly love these ideals so I follow them perfectly because I want to not because I force myself to follow them? I want to feel hate towards the degenerate and love towards the pure. <br>Feel free to post own experience relating your ascension and perfection.","filename":"33894F3B-EE05-47FD-8F5E-E957C1AB6966-16361-0000127B79269F3D","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":682,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1490567804512,"time":1490567804,"md5":"bZdjFL5NFX+gTU4\/veG1Jg==","fsize":149064,"resto":0,"id":"96qJAlTd","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hey-pol-ive-been-reading-pol-and-frogtwitter","country_name":"Germany","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":118429147,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)18:40:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"You seem to be on the right track.

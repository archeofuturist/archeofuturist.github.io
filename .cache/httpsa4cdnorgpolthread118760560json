After researching the topic I really don&#039;t get what is to gain from the Brexit for Britain, besides the symbolic fuck you to the EU. I totally get they want to show the EU that it is cucked and did a lot of bullshit in the recent years, but in the end this whole thing leads to HUGE amounts of paperwork, financial problems to be solved and generally a whole lot of fuzz. I don&#039;t see the advantages, even the all the EU legislations where - even if annoying - kind of minor and now over 20000 legislations have to be revised, lots of stuff has to be rebuilt from scratch. <br><br>And no, I don&#039;t let the &quot;keep your mudslimes, niggers EU!&quot; etc. as an argument, Britain has always accepted lots of poos and other foreigners to their country and they will neither stop doing this nor throw out who is already there because of Brexit. Even if people wished it would happen this has almost nothing to do with Brexit, and is still a decision of the same government that decided to keep them and let them in before.<br><br>And &quot;I don&#039;t want to be ruled by Merkel!&quot; is not an argument either since she has almost no fucking say in Brit politics, she never had. The Brits are far more important to the world than germany, and everytime a Brit has said &quot;We&#039;ll do this.&quot; germany went along with it since we are dependant on Brit economics and - most of all - military power. Brits had more say in the EU than germany all the time, so I don&#039;t get where this myth is coming from.","filename":"1490157559435","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490772479461,"time":1490772479,"md5":"qup1ycdk+bXuDM9BVh+GOA==","fsize":719699,"resto":0,"id":"nSjrup11","country":"DE","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-is-to-gain-from-brexit","country_name":"Germany","replies":142,"images":12,"unique_ips":56,"tail_size":50},{"no":118760575,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)03:28:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"So overall: Britain was always in a position of power in the EU, always decided about refugee and immigration policies on their own no matter what EU thought, and in military and economics they were ruling as well, as is proven by e.g. the Iraq war germany didn&#039;t want to join but Brits did anyways.

In the aftermath of WWII, it was actually the CIA that steered Germany and France to carry on with a plan for the EEC which the German Nazis had planned for even before WWII started. France went along with the Plan because they effectively surrendered but they were promised a few dog bones such as being able to keep their &#039;International role&#039; and colonies.

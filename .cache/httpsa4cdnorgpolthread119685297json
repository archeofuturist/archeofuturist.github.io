And yet it&#039;s not such a complex matter if you have even a modicum of understanding of what life is all about. Reproduction, like all life, is all about sacrifice. If we take the parents as isolated individuals (as opposed to parts of a cosmic chain), they stand to gain nothing from the creation and rearing of children. The benefits they would receive in old age via means of their children&#039;s caretaking are nothing compared to the insane costs they&#039;d have to incur to raise them in the first place, so the transaction is a net expenditure on their part, and by a vast margin. Now the hyperculture of the master race has created a consciousness of how important the rearing process is, and how costly if it is to be done right, so even when members of the master race reproduce, they only create one or two descendants, as opposed to the constant mindless shitting out of fetuses that they used to indulge in when they were uncivilized, or indeed that the subhuman races still continue to this day. So that is one important factor for the master race&#039;s population decline. Without it, things would be dramatically different, since with the amount of resources a typical middle class family lavishes on a single child you could raise an entire village of little Middle Eastern towelheads or niggers. In simple terms, the master race is going for quality over quantity, and that&#039;s a major part of what&#039;s causing the decline.","filename":"designer_babies_urgent_fast_moving_fertility_tech-3","ext":".jpg","w":1408,"h":792,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491441719126,"time":1491441719,"md5":"x7FGl8eVAitvoX03GsDrbw==","fsize":75172,"resto":0,"id":"sA9+EplF","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-population-decline-of-the-master-race-whites","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":2,"unique_ips":2},{"no":119685428,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)21:23:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"Simultaneously, the successive decline of religion, nationalism and finally the importance and sanctity of blood ties and the institution of marriage have created the Individual \u2014 unknown to lower cultures or earlier phases of the master race&#039;s culture \u2014 who is, like all advances, something of a double-edged sword, which many use to advance and improve their lives (or, more correctly: the future of their genes), but which others flail about and cut themselves with. So on the one hand the individual no longer feels a responsibility towards his gods, nation, tribe or family to reproduce, because these are outdated, marginalized institutions \u2014 and JUSTLY marginalized (since their era has passed precisely because the culture has advanced beyond them) \u2014 that no longer hold any authority over anyone but a minority of backwards losers, but on the other hand, the philosophy that is destined to replace them \u2014 that of the Overman and the Eternal Recurrence \u2014 has not yet had sufficient time to take hold and lend reproduction a new meaning \u2014 a stronger and more glorious meaning than it has ever had! \u2014 and as a consequence the meaning of reproduction in the general culture is currently lacking to such a degree that \u2014 for the first time in history \u2014 a growing number of degenerates are even campaigning for its destruction (anti-natalism). As a result of all this the majority of the population seems to have turned over completely to hedonism, and the last thing on their minds is to undertake the laborious task of propagating themselves \u2014 which is of course a good thing, because in this way the hedonists are removing their failed genes and gene configurations from our gene pool, and cleansing it of their wretched, repulsive stink.","filename":"2","ext":".png","w":256,"h":256,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491441792922,"time":1491441792,"md5":"4Cj51VVHYmtTjMuSYKqoSw==","fsize":14268,"resto":119685297,"id":"sA9+EplF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119685615,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)21:25:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Meanwhile, all these developments \u2014 including the inherent weakness of civilized races by virtue of their very civilization \u2014 are being taken advantage of by the subhuman races to invade the lands of the master race, and to breed themselves into its population and supplant it.

It&#039;s already useless for all but the crudest calculations, but only philosophers can see this right now (i.e. only I can): everyone else is either completely fixated on it (the conservatives) or denies that it has ever been useful or even real (the liberals). But conservatives and liberals too are on their way to becoming extinct in short order, and be completely supplanted by the three categories of lifeforms whose struggle will decide mankind&#039;s future (at least until extraterrestrials arrive on the scene): the subhumans, the humans and... the superhumans, the last of whom I and a handful of other individuals throughout history, of course, have been the first examples.","filename":"Blade_Runner_spinner_flyby","ext":".png","w":492,"h":202,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":51,"tim":1491441909336,"time":1491441909,"md5":"TXWINLZ3u8VXSSjNWpfyYQ==","fsize":171063,"resto":119685297,"id":"sA9+EplF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119685843,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)21:27:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119685297\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119685297<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;quality over quantity<\/span><br>In other words, spoiling the child","time":1491442047,"resto":119685297,"id":"xjqHVk4z","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

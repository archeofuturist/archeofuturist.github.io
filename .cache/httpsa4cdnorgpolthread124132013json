The Gish Gallop is a belt-fed version of the on the spot fallacy, as it&#039;s unreasonable for anyone to have a well-composed answer immediately available to every argument present in the Gallop. The Gish Gallop is named after creationist Duane Gish, who often abused it.<br><br>Although it takes a trivial amount of effort on the Galloper&#039;s part to make each individual point before skipping on to the next (especially if they cite from a pre-concocted list of Gallop arguments), a refutation of the same Gallop may likely take much longer and require significantly more effort (per the basic principle that it&#039;s always easier to make a mess than to clean it back up again).<br><br>The tedium inherent in untangling a Gish Gallop typically allows for very little &quot;creative license&quot; or vivid rhetoric (in deliberate contrast to the exciting point-dashing central to the Galloping), which in turn risks boring the audience or readers, further loosening the refuter&#039;s grip on the crowd.<br><br>This is especially true in that the Galloper need only win a single one out of all his component arguments in order to be able to cast doubt on the entire refutation attempt. For this reason, the refuter must achieve a 100% success ratio (with all the yawn-inducing elaboration that goes with such precision). Thus, Gish Galloping is frequently employed (with particularly devastating results) in timed debates.

Despite the prevalence of marijuana use among pregnant women and adolescents, the impact of cannabis on the developing brain is still not well understood. However, growing evidence supports that the endocannabinoid system plays a major role in CNS patterning in structures relevant for mood, cognition, and reward, such as the mesocorticolimbic system. It is thus clear that exposure to cannabis during early ontogeny is not benign and potential compensatory mechanisms that might be expected to occur during neurodevelopment appear insufficient to eliminate vulnerability to neuropsychiatric disorders in certain individuals. Both human longitudinal cohort studies and animal models strongly emphasize the long-term influence of prenatal cannabinoid exposure on behavior and mental health.[34] A study by Campolongo et al.[35] shows that the endocannabinoid system plays a crucial role in the ontogeny of the CNS and its activation, during brain development, can induce subtle and long-lasting neurofunctional alterations.<\/span><br>fuckkk, really gets my almonds a felxin as to why so many edgy kids in school had burnt out hippies as parents","time":1493949387,"resto":124132013,"id":"guht2CQx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124147840,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)21:57:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Hey you fucking autistic frog it&#039;s anon here I just wanted to let you know that I&#039;m smoking a bowl right now and I have dank nug at my disposal at any time, kiddo.

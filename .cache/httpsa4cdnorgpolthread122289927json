You know, the place we go to inside that doesn&#039;t have to think!<br>He got them aroused, made them feel empowered that HE would lead them down a angry, un-directed path that , SOUNDED GOOD,FELT GOOD and was just as stupid as the way they would do things.<br>He was famous and they didn&#039;t have to think, they voted with their emotions and left their brains in the 5th grade phy ed class, locked into trying to figure out how to cheat the rules of the game to look smart.<br>He appealed to them, but he lied and has no interest in helping his constituency. He never showed any interest in them in the past. His voters were dupes, unfortunately. A means to an end for Trump. That&#039;s the way he has always been. Nothing new. He has always been a snob, but he has always used people to get what he wants. He&#039;s a con man, and will go down in history as one. He will destroy the Country. This man has no shame, and doesn&#039;t care about you. Here is my problem with Trump - if I told him, pick ANY topic in the world - real estate, business management, WHATEVER it is - take 3 days to prepare and let&#039;s get in a room for 30 minutes and discuss on that topic. I may not have a clue and I will make sure I come unprepared, you don&#039;t even have to tell me beforehand what the topic you picked it. Let&#039;s just talk, maybe I will ask you some questions, you can ask me some, go back and forth.................. And I know it will be 30 minutes of absolute nothingness from him. He just has absolutely nothing inside that head of his. Even when people say to me that we elected the dumbest of the lot to be President, I have to immediately correct them - not just &quot;of the lot&quot;, there is a good possibility we elected the dumbest guy IN THE COUNTRY!","filename":"trumpandflag","ext":".png","w":777,"h":437,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492875818201,"time":1492875818,"md5":"JYcGqoo3JwZKuSYx\/2EYkw==","fsize":331714,"resto":0,"id":"cU6ENcQ1","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wether-anyone-realizes-it-or-not-he-won-because","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122290351,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)11:47:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122289927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122289927<\/a><br>How exactly did trump &quot;dupe&quot; his base?","time":1492876056,"resto":122289927,"id":"ZHM8tuQH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

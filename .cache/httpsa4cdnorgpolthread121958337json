Then how can we be granted free will? If he knows what will happen then we don&#039;t really have a choice because there is a single outcome. Whatever choice we make will lead to this.<br><br>So either we are under an illusive and god is aware of all action or we have free will and God does not is unaware of the end result?<br><br>And if God knows the results of multiple choices in which we make, and is all knowing would he not know the end choice we decide? Meaning he is fully aware of actions and choices, meaning free will doesn&#039;t exist and that God is either restricted in his ability to prevent or is aware and does not care what happens as he has the ability to control it.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Applying human logic to a Divine being<\/span><br><br>In that case as God is the perfect creator, why create us with a flawed logic that makes us not believe in him and if God is all knowing why would he make it so knowing that would be the case?<br><br>Either way wouldn&#039;t it make God confined to human logic so why would we be punished for something God created?

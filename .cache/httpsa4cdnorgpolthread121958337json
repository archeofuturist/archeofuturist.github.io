In pantheism, God is omniscient (all knowing, all knowledge is attained by only God), God is omnipotent (all powerful, all power is exerted only by God), God is omnipresent (present everywhere, since only God exists), God is omnibenevolent (all good, all goodness is performed only by God). But God is also omnimalevolent (all evil, all evil is performed only by God). And God may also be all suffering (all suffering is experienced by God). And God may be &quot;omni-amnesiac&quot; (all forgetting, all forgetting is performed only by God). And evil would happen due to forgetting, ignorance, harming another being because you have forgotten another being is God.<br><br>The question is whether God is static or dynamic. Muslims would say Allah is static, unchanging, and doesn&#039;t create anything. However, a mystical school of Islam, Sufism, insists that God evolves. There&#039;s a poem by Rumi, who was a Sufi mystic: &quot;I died to the inorganic state and became endowed with growth, and (then) I died to (vegetable) growth and attained to the animal. I died from animality and became Adam (man): why, then, should I fear? When have I become less by dying?&quot; In Sufism, at least the kind espoused by Rumi and Mehere Baba, they believe God evolves from a state of unconsciousness (like the vacuum of space) to higher and higher states of consciousness (gaseous, mineral, plant, wormlike animals, animals with more appendages, animals that walk, animals that walk upright, animals that care for their young, and finally, humans). Throughout that process, only God is on the treadmill.<br><br>Now, there may be a state of God that is always at full consciousness, but another state of God that is always at full unconsciousness. Or they constantly morph into the other state. &quot;In Tao the only motion is returning.&quot;","time":1492668230,"resto":121958337,"id":"IiAtnIJc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121961211,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)02:04:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"What are multiple dimensions.

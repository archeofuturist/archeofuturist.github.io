In some ways, depression is a fork in the road for you. You can choose one path where you accommodate yourself to the horrible reality and fall in line to this very reality, eventually punishing yourself for your cowardice via all sorts of self-destructive behaviors you develop when depressed. Another path you can choose is to realize that you are in many ways inadequate and you must choose to develop your talents and skills, thus growing in confidence in yourself and finally overcoming the depression.","filename":"1491205984153","ext":".jpg","w":753,"h":707,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":117,"tim":1493022011030,"time":1493022011,"md5":"LyglB71Z33LwmiJnmsTlqQ==","fsize":339144,"resto":122561714,"id":"tgT934Wk","country":"EE","country_name":"Estonia"},{"no":122562638,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:21:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122561714\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122561714<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; evolution<\/span><br>Hah, nice try.","time":1493022089,"resto":122561714,"id":"1dCVC+Mg","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":122562935,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:25:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122562526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122562526<\/a><br>There&#039;s studies about depression making us more stable and focused.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=u5u<wbr>m8QWWRvo<br><br>I do think that positive thinking and &quot;optimism&quot; are overrated due to the effect of propaganda.","time":1493022330,"resto":122561714,"id":"qvgSTNBO","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":122562955,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:25:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122562526\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122562526<\/a>","filename":"1475821184889","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":290,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":120,"tim":1493022351360,"time":1493022351,"md5":"kO+g9Jh8zALjeNQ78QJM3w==","fsize":10543,"resto":122561714,"id":"rITplN9H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122563012,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)04:26:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122561960\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122561960<\/a><br>He&#039;s right though.

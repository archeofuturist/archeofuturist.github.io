Of these therefore he reminds him, when he says, \u201cHold fast the form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me.\u201d (Homily III on 2 Timothy \u2013 on 2 Tim 1:13-18)","time":1492669909,"resto":121952338,"id":"fUW6GN1m","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121963609,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)02:32:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121962987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121962987<\/a><br>I was useing it as an example i didnt mean as fufillment i made a post above about that sorry but the jews come back to god after we leave i cant explain that to you on here check out robert breaker youtube","time":1492669958,"resto":121952338,"id":"mVewS2bh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121963789,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)02:34:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121962987\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121962987<\/a><br>And not the new earth the millenium period before the new earth","time":1492670093,"resto":121952338,"id":"mVewS2bh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121964035,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)02:37:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121954532\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121954532<\/a><br>Basil contra sola Scriptura<br><br>\u201cOf the beliefs and practices whether generally accepted or enjoined which are preserved in the Church, some we possess derived from written teaching; others we have delivered to us in a mystery by the apostles by the tradition of the apostles; and both of these in relation to true religion have the same force\u201d (On the Holy Spirit, 27).\u201d","time":1492670254,"resto":121952338,"id":"fUW6GN1m","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

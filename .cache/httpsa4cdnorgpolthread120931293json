Why is this allowed though? Data shows that this type of advertising is not used to inform patients or potential customers about a product or drug, but rather to drive them towards purchasing it.<br><br>Additional data suggests that when patients bring up a specific medication or brand name brought up in an ad to their doctors that they are more likely than not going to be prescribed it, which contributes to overprescriptions and is bad medical practice in general, even if it makes doctors and pharmaceutical companies more money.<br><br>We all know that the medical and pharmaceutical lobbies are huge making it difficult to confront them, but should direct-to-consumer advertising for these products be banned, as is the case in most countries?

Smaller eye apertures helps by limiting the amount of light that enters the eye and reduces the chance of being blinded. Then you also have the Gobi Desert and the Steppes, and having small eye apertures keeps the sand from your eyes. <br><br>However, it&#039;s suspected that some of the Mongoloids (the slanty-eyed East\/South Asian and certain indigenous people of North America) &quot;began&quot; from up north (which is snowy, yet have bright summers) and made their way to China and surrounding East and South Asian regions, then some continued on and went through Alaska and populated North\/Central\/South America. The East Asian Mongoloid group pretty much kept their slanty-eyed adaptation to present day, which repurposed the slanty-eyed adaptation to the Gobi Desert and the Steppes; while their American Mongoloid cousins went to North America, Mesoamerica, and South America. Some of the American Mongoloids lost their slanty-eyed adaptation (mostly the Mesoamerican and South American Indios), while others kept it in varying degrees (Inuits and Injuns).<br><br>Why do Arabs and Semites don&#039;t have the Asian-like, slanty-eyed adaptation, you ask? They developed a different adaptation because they weren&#039;t exposed to the same snow-blinding permafrost environment first. These desert people developed adaptations to protect themselves from the bright desert sun and desert winds\/sandstorms, and one of which is the sunken eyes. To a minor degree, some of the desert-dwellers also developed slanted eyes to protect them from sandstorms (along with the hooked nose, to minimize inhalation of sand particles), but to augment the sunken-eye adaptation.","time":1490593338,"resto":118454644,"id":"iYrE1\/vd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118478031,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)01:42:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118477946\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118477946<\/a><br>Like I said, you&#039;ve never met one.","filename":"81BnRs6c72L","ext":".jpg","w":1847,"h":2560,"tn_w":90,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490593374177,"time":1490593374,"md5":"wn1T+88oPc1lBeAujJmJXg==","fsize":351627,"resto":118454644,"id":"EL2L1yaf","country":"SE","m_img":1,"country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":118478036,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)01:42:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"because they are superior","filename":"thicc","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":647,"tn_w":92,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490593378286,"time":1490593378,"md5":"qJw6VHQz1Mq+XhrR5l9YFw==","fsize":43959,"resto":118454644,"id":"\/nTgJzew","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118478092,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)01:43:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118477888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118477888<\/a><br>obviously not in civilized society. we have rules about apportionment and dances about when it is appropriate.

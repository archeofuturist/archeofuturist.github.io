There is no Purgatory in Orthodoxy. Our priests are allowed to married, but are usually required (actually they were required since the Church is not so strict anymore) to not shave his beard and to wear it long. Monks obviously can&#039;t marry. Only men can become priests compared to some Protestants faith were women can too.<br>I think there are a few more theological differences of which I&#039;m not aware of since I&#039;m quite new to the faith myself (I&#039;ve never been really close to Orthodoxy even though I was baptized into Orthodox Christianity and I didn&#039;t quite believed in it for years until a few weeks ago when I started again to research faith).<br><br><a href=\"#p123216806\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123216806<\/a><br>I would say pretty good. I believe Catholics are brothers and even if we have a different religion I think we believe in the same God. I can&#039;t say the same about Protestants though.

Depends on the person. Depends on how&#039;s she and how&#039;s her family. If they are really religious you might have to wait until marriage for sex. We usually do not speed when it comes to marriage, nobody will force you to marry her in your early 20s. It&#039;s better to know one another in order to make a good traditional Orthodox family. As for the traditional Orthodox family it&#039;s very typical: Husband, Wife, Children. <br><br>I think as Orthodox we might come off as some sort of backward people stuck in the past as some cultists do, but that&#039;s not true. We&#039;re pretty much ordinary people. We accept blood transfusions, we own TVs and computers and so on.","filename":"arseie_boca_index","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":355,"tn_w":88,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493400485610,"time":1493400485,"md5":"xvM\/yQMdw0JN7k3xl229oQ==","fsize":19571,"resto":123214045,"id":"kWhzocVs","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123219401,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:31:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123214045\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123214045<\/a><br>Opinions on western rite orthodoxy?<br><br>I love latin liturgy","time":1493400710,"resto":123214045,"id":"N\/3rHPLq","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123219941,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:36:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"There is this picture floating around, but it&#039;s a meme so I wouldn&#039;t take it to seriously.","filename":"1492532354357","ext":".jpg","w":604,"h":390,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1493401001813,"time":1493401001,"md5":"Q68rY0iL0KzlaToSpQWScQ==","fsize":57030,"resto":123214045,"id":"kWhzocVs","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":123220900,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)13:45:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123219941\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123219941<\/a><br>I&#039;d say it&#039;s more or less spot on.

These children often hear fewer words by age 5 than other kids do.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;And that&#039;s a problem, Kraus says, because &quot;in the absence of stimulation, the nervous system ... hungry for stimulation ... will make things up. So, in the absence of sound, what we saw is that there was just more random background activity, which you might think of as static.&quot;<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In addition to that &quot;neural noise,&quot; as Kraus calls it, ability to process sound \u2014 like telling the difference between someone saying &quot;ba&quot; and &quot;ga&quot; \u2014 requires microsecond precision in the brain. And many kids raised in poverty, Kraus says, simply have a harder time doing it; individual sounds can seem &quot;blurry&quot; to the brain.

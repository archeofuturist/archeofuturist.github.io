I replied like any man who didn&#039;t believe in hackers would do &quot;fuck you pussy&quot; silence. Not a word until i got the message that made my heart run cold &quot;this is your IP right&quot; he said, he knew he had me. I still thought it was a joke this is didn&#039;t die hard 4 nerds don&#039;t have this power. Then it started. First i got the final message &quot;enjoy your 66666 seconds of hell&quot; he cruelly remarked, as i tried to solve this riddle i was logged of psn witha message saying i was now banned for basically forever. Then it happened he somehow made my internet cut out, how did this monster attack me at home this isn&#039;t Angelina Jolie in swordfish this is real life. Somehow this guy was able to ban me forever from psn, cut off my internet ey for hours with an ipflood or something and managed to make my mum hate me just a little bit more.","filename":"download (1)","ext":".jpg","w":299,"h":168,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492666549256,"time":1492666549,"md5":"xJdiXu27zYSwOpoVTNkKdQ==","fsize":7329,"resto":0,"id":"6omC7X5x","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"run-in-with-hackers-stories","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":6},{"no":121959427,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:44:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121958521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121958521<\/a><br><br>thats a question for \/g\/ not \/pol\/","time":1492667097,"resto":121958521,"id":"NAaTA4zh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121959461,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:45:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Theres a key difference between &quot;skid&quot; and &quot;hacker&quot;.","time":1492667115,"resto":121958521,"id":"nj3zuGM\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121959594,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:46:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121958521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121958521<\/a><br>Russian hackers strike again","time":1492667210,"resto":121958521,"id":"VSdkuYnc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121960238,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:53:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121958521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121958521<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;went camping with brother<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bring laptop and tablet with car charger<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;brother complains about bringing technology into nature<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;ignore and enjoy vidya <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;eventually go fishing with brother since fishing is laziest form of hunting<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he tells me to watch his pole while he takes a leak<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;half hour later no return<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;head back to camp<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;find laptop in pieces and tablet folded in half<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;brother used his hatchet to break them<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;my brother outed himself as hackerman<\/span>","time":1492667626,"resto":121958521,"id":"AR3WQeg0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121960400,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:55:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121958521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121958521<\/a><br>heh.

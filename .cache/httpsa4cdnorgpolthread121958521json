I replied like any man who didn&#039;t believe in hackers would do &quot;fuck you pussy&quot; silence. Not a word until i got the message that made my heart run cold &quot;this is your IP right&quot; he said, he knew he had me. I still thought it was a joke this is didn&#039;t die hard 4 nerds don&#039;t have this power. Then it started. First i got the final message &quot;enjoy your 66666 seconds of hell&quot; he cruelly remarked, as i tried to solve this riddle i was logged of psn witha message saying i was now banned for basically forever. Then it happened he somehow made my internet cut out, how did this monster attack me at home this isn&#039;t Angelina Jolie in swordfish this is real life. Somehow this guy was able to ban me forever from psn, cut off my internet ey for hours with an ipflood or something and managed to make my mum hate me just a little bit more.","filename":"download (1)","ext":".jpg","w":299,"h":168,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492666549256,"time":1492666549,"md5":"xJdiXu27zYSwOpoVTNkKdQ==","fsize":7329,"resto":0,"id":"6omC7X5x","country":"GB","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"run-in-with-hackers-stories","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121959427,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)01:44:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121958521\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121958521<\/a><br><br>thats a question for \/g\/ not \/pol\/","time":1492667097,"resto":121958521,"id":"NAaTA4zh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

They will sit on your business, destroy it, they will sit on your bank account and close it, so good luck trading with Cuba, you have to go through USA and USA doesn&#039;t wants Cuba to succeed. USA wants to control market all around the planet, if it&#039;s Syria or Ukraine or EU, as long as the dictator or democrat gives them what they want and allows them to order American products\/build American companies on own land, then it&#039;s ok for USA, but once you go solo or side with any other country not controlled by USA, then you get attacked or sanctioned.

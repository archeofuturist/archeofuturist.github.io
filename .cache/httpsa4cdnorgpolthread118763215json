In a survey performed by TNS Forschung for SPIEGEL (see left-hand column), 84 percent of respondents said that the large number of refugees currently coming to Germany will result in &quot;lasting changes&quot; to the country. Some 54 percent said they are concerned that the danger of terrorism is higher due to the influx of refugees and 51 percent believe that the crime rate will rise. Forty-three percent are worried that unemployment will increase.\u201d<br><br>The head of the AfD demanded, in all seriousness, that we shoot at refugees who come to the German border [based lol].

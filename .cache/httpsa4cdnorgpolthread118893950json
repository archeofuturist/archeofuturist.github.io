A good portion of my family, and nearly all of my friends are raging lefties politically, so a lot of the shit I see on \/pol\/ should make me cringe or fucking reel back in disgust . . . but it doesn&#039;t. I find myself seeing so much that I try to refute but really can&#039;t and so I&#039;ve found a lot of things I agree with coming from you fucks. There is one thing holding me back from taking that plunge into the painful abyss of what is likely the brutal truth and from excepting the most wild claims with little evidence.<br><br>The fucking Holocaust.<br>I&#039;ve seen some pics of the census numbers before and after, and watched a few videos linked by others. But I&#039;ve known older folks as a kid who said they were survivors and gave some horror stories, its covered very heavily in schools. This has been so heavily ingrained in me as the truth I don&#039;t know if I can accept that it&#039;s false. So much of the entire planet as it is now was shaped by that story. I need your strongest Red-pill(s) on this subject, because if it didn&#039;t happen and that&#039;s the truth I NEED to know.","filename":"theprecipice","ext":".jpg","w":257,"h":320,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490855684925,"time":1490855684,"md5":"JEnPK9OZP0zzfABJpvNHLQ==","fsize":19168,"resto":0,"id":"EmfbCT9L","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"push-me-down-the-rabbit-hole","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":5,"unique_ips":8},{"no":118894043,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)02:36:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118893950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118893950<\/a>","filename":"1490376246722m","ext":".jpg","w":793,"h":1024,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490855773768,"time":1490855773,"md5":"5TCogyTusacf2YgR8pcEMQ==","fsize":205507,"resto":118893950,"id":"EJXWEIAe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118894147,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)02:37:30","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1489255820753","ext":".jpg","w":722,"h":463,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":80,"tim":1490855850072,"time":1490855850,"md5":"mpFklvID\/uQHPoDS8\/xOyQ==","fsize":123969,"resto":118893950,"id":"EJXWEIAe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118894345,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)02:40:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"I didn&#039;t learn full about the holocaust until I came to \/pol\/.<br><br>When I was a kid it was never taught to us in school.

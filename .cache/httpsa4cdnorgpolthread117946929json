They all rely on gibs.<br>If your country does something as simple as completely ending welfare (and don&#039;t pretend it&#039;s difficult or impossible, it&#039;s an incredibly trivial policy change to make with a simple stroke of the pen), 99% of these shitskins will die from starvation within two weeks or simply go back to their home country. The only &quot;problem&quot; you have is that no one has pushed the legislation through yet. Even that isn&#039;t a problem though, because if you don&#039;t fix your countries soon, then Trump and Mattis will do it for you by 2019.<br>You all spend all day obsessing over issues you have no say in one way or the other. There is literally nothing to worry about. This &quot;immigration&quot; &quot;crisis&quot; has been a totally contrived &quot;problem&quot; from the start.

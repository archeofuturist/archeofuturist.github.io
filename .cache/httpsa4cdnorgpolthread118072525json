The reason is simple: GDP is simply the sum total of<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Personal Consumption<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Investment<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Net Exports (yes, it may be negative)<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Government spending<\/span><br>in a given region, usually country.<br><br>GDP is intended to capture the &quot;economic activity&quot; of a country, and it generally does. Countries with higher GDP are richer than countries with low GDP, although to determine standard of living it helps to use Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) to adjust for differences in prices in different countries. <br><br>Unfortunately it can be abused, and there are three main ways. The first is an econometric problem -- what counts as each category? If I buy a truck, is that consumer spending or investment? In reality this is solved by drawing often rather arbitrary lines to avoid double counting. Secondary sales are usually not counted (used cars, thrift stores) because their initial sale was already counted. The black market is not counted for practical reasons although some economists attempt to estimate its size. These problems are all well understood.<br><br>The second is monetization. If your wife stays at home and takes care of your children, this generates $0 GDP. However, if she gets a job at Wal Mart for $10\/hr and then pays a caretaker $10\/hr for daycare, now your nation&#039;s GDP has gone up. But governments love this because now they can tax that money -- in fact, both when your wife is paid and when she pays for daycare. Which brings us to why immigrants are so great for GDP.<br><br>The government takes money from people and spends it, which tautologically causes GDP to rise. Often that money is spent again, further increasing GDP.","time":1490360656,"resto":118072525,"id":"xxO\/ZElB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118078286,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)09:04:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118077741\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118077741<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Swedish economist Tino Sanandaji, who himself has an Iranian-Kurdish background, recently described what\u2019s happening in Sweden as \u201cquite disastrous\u201d.

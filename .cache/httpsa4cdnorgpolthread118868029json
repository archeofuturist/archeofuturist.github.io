I draw cartoons and comics on my tablet, and spend my days perfecting my art and playing superior American games. (Halo, Gears of War, Call of Duty) <br><br>I train with my 1911 every day, this superior weapon can shoot straight through steel because it kicks ass, and is vastly superior to any other weapon on earth. I earned my gun license two years ago, and I have been getting better every day. <br><br>I speak English fluently, both the Midwestern and the East Coast accents, and I write fluently as well. I know everything about American history and their Constitution, which I follow 100% <br><br>When I get my American visa, I am moving to New York to attend a prestigious High School to learn more about their magnificent culture. I hope I can become an animator for Nickelodeon or a game designer! <br><br>I own several cowboy outfits, which I wear around town. I want to get used to wearing them before I move to America, so I can fit in easier. I keep cool to my elders and seniors and speak English as often as I can, but rarely does anyone manage to respond.","filename":"mrkenichi","ext":".jpg","w":624,"h":388,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":155,"tim":1490839998002,"time":1490839998,"md5":"IHbNnoNWoMWW7Vdje2Jgeg==","fsize":30294,"resto":0,"id":"JidPe2mk","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"howdy-pol-my-name-is-kenichi-smith","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

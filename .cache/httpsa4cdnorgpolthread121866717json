This is very underrated because culturally it means they actually go about doing things rather than waiting for things to happen. <br><br>They believe in the purity of the elements (water, air, fire, earth) so they try to keep them clean. However, in the past they didn&#039;t have a scientific understanding of what it meant so they had weird rituals like going to a nearby lake once a year and massacring turtles and fish that were seen as polluting the clean water.<br><br>The book of laws of the last Zoroastrian dynasty is much like the same as the laws of Islam. They believed in praying 5 times a day, the veil for women for modesty.

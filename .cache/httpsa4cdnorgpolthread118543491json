And it is required as well, as our societies are far more detailed and nuanced than a chimpanzee&#039;s (usually).

All the while, the simple truth remains that we are mostly challenged by other humans in our environment, because we struggle for the same resources.<br><br>Any more simple explanation is sadly would take up too much of our time and effort, and \/pol is - sadly - not the place for it.<br><br>Nonetheless, I bid you farewell on your journey to truth.

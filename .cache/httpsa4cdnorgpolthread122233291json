My big problem is the % victory system instead of threshold. <br><br>Basically in all the prior games to win you&#039;d need to meet a threshold like 8 &quot;Superior Culture&quot; cities or build a certain number of buildings. In 6 it&#039;s all a percentage, so for a religious victory the moment somebody hits majority religion points they win. What sucks is if you&#039;re playing a good game with people and one person is in last place but focuses solely on religion for example they can win at like 1400 AD despite being in a terrible position.","time":1492834301,"resto":122233291,"id":"+jaqhMnX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122233876,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:11:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122233700\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122233700<\/a><br>Why state the obvious?","time":1492834305,"resto":122233291,"id":"xxlyJKb1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122233920,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)00:12:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"Videogames are the Jew&#039;s most powerful weapon.

Also why you should uninstall things like the Facebook app that drain your battery spying all day. Because the gov has been doing this since flip phones. Getting your phone company to update your software so it can be turned Into a listening device at their whim.<br><br>Its the same today as it was back then the only way to tell is to notice the sudden battery drain. And unlike back then they don&#039;t need a warrant.<br><br>Also a thumbprint is not a legal lock since you do not have a right to the privacy of your print. Courts have allowed police to open phone with prints and no probable cause. Get a password. I&#039;m pretty sure eye scanning or face recognition will not be good either.","time":1492741790,"resto":122081727,"id":"MHmaxriN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

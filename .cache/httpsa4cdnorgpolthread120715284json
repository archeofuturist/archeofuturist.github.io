They tried to Arab Spring the new guy, but it failed, the kike CIA, globalists, and Israel, SA, were drawn into a long bloody war they knew they were losing. Along comes king kike, bullshits his way into office through bold face lying. First thing he does is attack Assad, and tell him he has no place in Syrias future. Those terrorists have butchered Christians in that nation since they got there. Assad literally defends them with the SAA.

Dems are going to win by a landslide next election if they manage to provide a candidate that isn&#039;t a mouthbreathing retard. <br><br>The only thing left for trumpkins to defend is &quot;HE HASN&#039;T STARTED A WAR YET&quot; so as soon as that&#039;s gone they&#039;ll have literally no defense for their retarded president. As for when boots will touch the ground, mid 2018 seems a good estimate.

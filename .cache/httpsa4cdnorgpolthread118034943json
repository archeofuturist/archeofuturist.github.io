One reason is that leftism is overwhelmingly secular (more than merely secular: it is inherently opposed to all traditional religions), and therefore people do not regard it as a religion. Another is that leftism so convincingly portrays itself as solely the product of reason, intellect, and science that it has not been seen as the dogma-based ideology that it is. Therefore, the vast majority of the people who affirm leftist beliefs think of their views as the only way to properly think about life.<br>That, in turn, explains why anyone who opposes leftism is labeled anti-intellectual, anti-progress, anti-science, anti-minority and anti-reason (among many other pejorative epithets): leftists truly believe that there is no other way to think.<br>How successful has leftism been?<br>It dominates the thinking of Europe, much of Latin America, Canada, and Asia, as well as the thinking of the political and intellectual elites of most of the world. Outside of the Muslim world, it is virtually the only way in which news is reported and virtually the only way in which young people are educated from elementary school through university.<br>Only the United States, of all Western countries, has resisted leftism. But that resistance is fading as increasing numbers of Americans abandon traditional Judeo-Christian religions, lead secular lives, are educated by teachers whose views are almost uniformly left-wing and are exposed on a daily basis virtually exclusively to leftist views in their news and entertainment media.","time":1490328993,"resto":118034943,"id":"fUyIVYu4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118039120,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)00:17:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118034943\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118034943<\/a><br><br>jews distracting christians stray away from their faith by social propaganda.","time":1490329050,"resto":118034943,"id":"SMyCdj3l","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118039227,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)00:18:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118039002\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118039002<\/a><br>Extremely well said.","filename":"13006689_1320050268011411_3975515144592626273_n","ext":".jpg","w":630,"h":350,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1490329108028,"time":1490329108,"md5":"nP4mnu6ALcznhgs2FxjxSw==","fsize":40643,"resto":118034943,"id":"6mTonC42","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118039268,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)00:18:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118034943\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118034943<\/a><br>Muslim here, with a message for all the ignorant cumskins on this board:<br><br>It was you who divided up the land.<br><br>It was you who put in the puppet governments.<br><br>It was you who built the oil wells on Muslim holy lands.<br><br>It was you who allowed the Jews to exterminate and enslave the Palestinians.<br><br>It was you who played geopolitical games with Iraq and Iran during their war.<br><br>It was you who gave Saddam chemical weapons.<br><br>It was you who caused the Ayatollah to come into power in Iran.<br><br>It was you who created the Mujaheddin, Osama Bin Laden, and Al Qaeda.<br><br>It was you who killed 1 million children with your economic sanctions on Iraq.<br><br>It was you who, with your gluttonous oil consumption, gave power to Saudi Arabia and turned a blind eye to their funding of Wahhabi extremism.<br><br>It was you who abused the Arab world so much that they felt they had to attack your soil on 9\/11.<br><br>It was you who started an endless massacre across all of Afghanistan in retaliation against a small group that lived there.<br><br>It was you who invaded Iraq unprovoked, destroyed it&#039;s infrastructure, massacred it&#039;s people, and left it in shambles in your wake.<br><br>It was you who covertly ignited civil wars in Libya and Syria because it suited your geopolitical interests, only to let the bloodbaths stagnate when your goals failed.<br><br>It was you who not only caused ISIS to exist, but allowed them to grow like a cancer unchecked.<br><br>It was jouz who destroyed the lives of millions of Arabs and forced them to leave their homeland.<br><br>You are the cause of all of this.

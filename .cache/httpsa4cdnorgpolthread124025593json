I&#039;m thinking about setting up an early Christmas gift exchange between the Donald and our sister site, \/pol. <br><br>I think we&#039;ve grown kinda hostile toward each other, which is a shame considering we worked together to elect the greatest president of the last 100 years. <br><br>Granted, we have our differences, but at the end of the day we&#039;re brothers in arms working to make America great again. Let&#039;s continue the great work we do to continue triggering leftists. <br><br>What do you think? Should I set it up?<br><br>Also, I know you guys are renown trolls, but please don&#039;t give me a hard time. I&#039;m coming from a good place and I want to see both our communities thrive.","filename":"gift","ext":".jpg","w":1996,"h":2279,"tn_w":218,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493876351870,"time":1493876351,"md5":"gMhZkXFgqzWVwf8ZP640kw==","fsize":248890,"resto":0,"id":"7hcMJz\/\/","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-thedonald-gift-exchange","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":124025908,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:42:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124025593\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124025593<\/a><br>Die.","time":1493876556,"resto":124025593,"id":"CZJG4sc7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124026026,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)01:43:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"I&#039;ll take some bbc","time":1493876630,"resto":124025593,"id":"ixxe4wzS","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]}

They always cite the same single study done by amateurs from a college institution that claimed they found cases of homosexuality in over 1000 species. However, they fail to acknowledge that even in these animals homosexuality is only rarely, if not occasionally practiced and only in desperation or practice. Humans are the only animals that practice the sexuality as a lifestyle. animals do not go out intentionally seeking same sex partners. I have nothing against homosex but I am just tired of people pushing it in my face. They seem to think homosexuality should define a person&#039;s entire character. Their identity is strictly faggots and nothing else. no personality. no reason.","filename":"download (2)","ext":".jpg","w":285,"h":177,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":155,"tim":1490308146930,"time":1490308146,"md5":"htqLh5DpeMCtRCe+Zla3jQ==","fsize":9428,"resto":0,"id":"xq5HIe1d","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-homosexuality-unnatural","country_name":"United States","replies":51,"images":15,"unique_ips":39},{"no":117995001,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:30:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117994755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117994755<\/a><br>also there is no gay gene no matter how much they say its their blood.","time":1490308249,"resto":117994755,"id":"xq5HIe1d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117995097,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:31:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117994755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117994755<\/a><br>Me on the left","time":1490308286,"resto":117994755,"id":"6W6UMY\/D","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117995183,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:31:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117994755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117994755<\/a><br>my dog likes to shag the couch pillow, does that make him couchophile or something ?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;humans are like animals<\/span>","time":1490308316,"resto":117994755,"id":"t+aXbtxe","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":117995368,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:33:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117994755\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117994755<\/a><br>Male animals fuck each other to display dominance and make the dominated male unwanted by females","time":1490308395,"resto":117994755,"id":"9w0Ezm5l","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":117995416,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:33:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117995097\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117995097<\/a><br>Me in the middle.

If homosexuality was a biological imperative, which let me remind you there is no evidence of, how would one explain the changes in the prevalence of homosexuality throughout time? Have we evolved from ancient Greek and Roman peoples who would be seen as effeminate if they didn&#039;t bugger another man? Or did our societies simply develop and change? <br><br>Pointing to deer and dogs and saying it must be a natural imperative because non-humans do it is a call to nature fallacy.

So they get affection from females in the form of a gay best friend relationship and respect from males because they can just call anyone who doesn&#039;t applaud their narcissistic flaunting of their sexuality as homophobic, which they must accept because women will back up their GBFs and deny the males sex.<br>Similarly in the animal kingdom, gamma males often pair off with each other in a wolf pack to give each other sexual gratification and communal affection which is monopolised by the Alpha and Betas. They must do this because only the Alphas of the pack can breed without their pups being eaten or themselves ostracised and denied food and protection.<br><br>These are just two very specific examples of why some people and some animals practice homosexuality. To trivialise the causes to a catch all answer ,biological\/natural imperative, one must ignore the vast intricate systems which humans and animals create which aren&#039;t written in our DNA. societies and miasmic economies within both nature and the human realm are largely separate, and so form entities and aberrations which are not determined by genetics or instinct but by societal psychology relative to the context.","filename":"1490129310572","ext":".jpg","w":443,"h":750,"tn_w":73,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490309569993,"time":1490309569,"md5":"dOsDELZXyFadNW1ke2hzEA==","fsize":46782,"resto":117994755,"id":"z\/CCRzB4","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":117998278,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)18:54:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117996824\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117996824<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;because pounding boipussi is equivalent to murdering children<\/span><br><br>Christcucks said that homosexuality was a &quot;crime against nature&quot;.

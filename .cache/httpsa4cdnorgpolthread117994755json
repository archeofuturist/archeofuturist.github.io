They always cite the same single study done by amateurs from a college institution that claimed they found cases of homosexuality in over 1000 species. However, they fail to acknowledge that even in these animals homosexuality is only rarely, if not occasionally practiced and only in desperation or practice. Humans are the only animals that practice the sexuality as a lifestyle. animals do not go out intentionally seeking same sex partners. I have nothing against homosex but I am just tired of people pushing it in my face. They seem to think homosexuality should define a person&#039;s entire character. Their identity is strictly faggots and nothing else. no personality. no reason.","filename":"download (2)","ext":".jpg","w":285,"h":177,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":155,"tim":1490308146930,"time":1490308146,"md5":"htqLh5DpeMCtRCe+Zla3jQ==","fsize":9428,"resto":0,"id":"xq5HIe1d","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-homosexuality-unnatural","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

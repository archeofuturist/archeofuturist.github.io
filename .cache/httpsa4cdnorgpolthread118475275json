It IS possible some do legitimately descent from the kings of given tribes that were later conquered and set to work as slaves, though that would be, again, by other Africans.<br><br>Most African slaves used in North America were purchased by Jews from African slavers and shipped across the ocean, where they were finally sold in the market.

Black people growing up in white culture have no real sense of identity because of their white environment, so they must find an identity. However, this identity is not based on African standards, but the standards of white culture, which are the civilizations we&#039;ve built, what we&#039;ve achieved, the lands we&#039;ve conquered, etc. Therefore, they come up with theories that Egypt was a Negro civilization, or prop up Negro civilizations like Ghana to be on the level of Rome or something, when it was less advanced than Hammurabi.<br><br>Sad but true.

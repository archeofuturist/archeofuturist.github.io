This makes sense as before modern times, travel across distances like that was more or less impossible. So as Europeans were setting up society, they stopped having a need for things like dance circles and whatnot. Meanwhile, they needed things like conformation to societal norms and rules. A self imposed artificial selection of sorts. Developing a strong society and civilization is what Europeans focused on, with things like strong, permanent settlements, farming, career specialization, etc. Meanwhile the people in places like Africa and the New World (think Hispanic) didn&#039;t develop as strong societies and therefore didn&#039;t need as much conformation to societal rules. Drums and dancing remained an important aspect of their societies because it brought them together and whatnot, thereby increasing their likelihood of survival. <br><br>So the lack of focus on advancing civilizations and technologies (such as farming) kept the need for drums as an important aspect of their relatively simplistic societal structures and traditions. So those who could dance and play drums well had a better chance of survival. The focus on drums and simplistic, beating rhythms is what gave rise to the good senses of rhythm (and can be seen in modern African-American music as well). Meanwhile law breakers are bad for advanced societies as a whole. So those not willing to follow the rules of society were weeded out in Europe. <br><br>If you accept this as true, then it becomes apparent that societies that place heavy importance on drums and simplistic music and dancing are more likely to be lawless and have simplistic societies, cultures, civilizations, and technologies. <br><br>Any thoughts, pol?","filename":"warrior dance","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1066,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493536015731,"time":1493536015,"md5":"M2TNMf3Ple5x5dVJMiFXlA==","fsize":388056,"resto":0,"id":"XUPC8CIg","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-i-recently-came-up-with-a-social-theory-that-i","country_name":"United States","replies":42,"images":3,"unique_ips":18},{"no":123450105,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:10:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123449813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123449813<\/a><br>not true. i&#039;ve been to drum circles on Venice Beach. you should go to on any Saturday so you can experience it for yourself.","time":1493536222,"resto":123449813,"id":"uPke2CAU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123450452,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:15:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123450105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123450105<\/a><br>I am speaking specifically of evolutionary and sociological trends, not anything specific.

How we interpret that seems that it might be a little different though. I am proposing that purpose of the music in simple cultures is to bring the people together in a way that isn&#039;t as needed in more advanced cultures. In more advanced cultures, the music is allowed to go to more recreational places, branching out and developing and becoming more complex. Whereas the music in simpler cultures is more necessary for maintaining the societal structure. Having it be such an important part of their society and way of life enforces the need to live together and cooperate. This is something which isn&#039;t really necessary in the more advanced societies, so instead of music being something that everyone would gather around to experience together every night or every week or whatever, it was more of a fun pass time. It&#039;s role in maintaining the structure was not needed, so it was allowed to develop and change and branch out. We aren&#039;t likely to see much change in the sound of the music in simpler societies because of this important role that it plays in the society, whereas in more advanced societies where it isn&#039;t as necessary, it is free to try new things. <br><br>Of course, that isn&#039;t to say that the people are incapable of developing more advanced and varied musical structures. They just don&#039;t have the opportunity in more simplistic societies where the music is more important to the society and needs to be played more regularly by and for more people. Give the chance, away from such a society, black can and do develop more advanced and varied music such as jazz, hip hop, rock, blues, etc. Like I have been saying the music is a symptom of the society, not the other way around.","time":1493540888,"resto":123449813,"id":"XUPC8CIg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123456082,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)04:34:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123454661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123454661<\/a><br><br>Exactly, yet OP posits that African music=simplistic which is in itself a simplistic argument: Music from the Sahel is way different from music from C.

Basically, your point is that in such small scale, simple societies, music plays the role of keeping the fabric of society knit together; while in more large scaled industrialized societies with advanced technology art is made for its own sake. Relegated to the realm of culture and nothing more, it has more freedom to advance as it pleases without threatening societal order.<br><br>We could also then add that music not only reflects the volkgeist, but also the spirit of the times.<br><br><a href=\"#p123456082\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123456082<\/a><br>It&#039;s not as simple as that, since different peoples and tribes in a single continent have also different spirits.

The link between societal structure and willingness to break laws. I think that this one is less polarizing. It makes more sense too. If your people evolved in a society without much in the way of rules or regulations, then you would be less inclined to follow rules and laws in general. Now, whether or not the increased crime rate with these peoples can be attributed in at least some part to nature over nurture can be hard to determine. The impact of ones rearing can&#039;t be overstated, but the amount of crime in majority minority areas of developed countries (and by that I mean ghettos in the US and the like where minorities are the most common demographic) as well as in the countries that they hail from (South America and Africa) give a good indication that there is at least some amount of criminality which can be attributed to the nature of those people. Again, these are vague generalizations for the purpose of evolutionary and sociological theories. Of course not every S American or African or African-American commits many crimes, but the trend is apparent. <br><br>The obvious next step in evaluating this aspect of the theory would be to somehow evaluate the crime rates of minorities that were raised in environments which exactly matched that of a control, white group. The only way that I could see that being possible is to look at black and white adoptees of affluent white parents. And I highly doubt that there is a study or statistics which we could find about that to really investigate. And that wuold be ignoring the impact that society as a whole would have on those individuals.","time":1493544133,"resto":123449813,"id":"XUPC8CIg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123460685,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)05:28:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123459547\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123459547<\/a><br>I think that I have finally managed to explain at least this aspect of my theory sufficiently, as you seem to understand it the same as I do now.

In smaller societies, there is not nearly as much specialization. Whereas in Europe, you could easily find someone who, for example, would do nothing all their life but fix shoes (cobblers have been around for a long time), in smaller tribes and the like, most people have to have a wide variety of skills in order to make sure that everything gets done. There aren&#039;t enough people to have someone for every specialization. <br><br>This need for a sense of community with your immediate relatives in tribal societies would be met in part at least by their music and dancing practices.

This makes sense as before modern times, travel across distances like that was more or less impossible. So as Europeans were setting up society, they stopped having a need for things like dance circles and whatnot. Meanwhile, they needed things like conformation to societal norms and rules. A self imposed artificial selection of sorts. Developing a strong society and civilization is what Europeans focused on, with things like strong, permanent settlements, farming, career specialization, etc. Meanwhile the people in places like Africa and the New World (think Hispanic) didn&#039;t develop as strong societies and therefore didn&#039;t need as much conformation to societal rules. Drums and dancing remained an important aspect of their societies because it brought them together and whatnot, thereby increasing their likelihood of survival. <br><br>So the lack of focus on advancing civilizations and technologies (such as farming) kept the need for drums as an important aspect of their relatively simplistic societal structures and traditions. So those who could dance and play drums well had a better chance of survival. The focus on drums and simplistic, beating rhythms is what gave rise to the good senses of rhythm (and can be seen in modern African-American music as well). Meanwhile law breakers are bad for advanced societies as a whole. So those not willing to follow the rules of society were weeded out in Europe. <br><br>If you accept this as true, then it becomes apparent that societies that place heavy importance on drums and simplistic music and dancing are more likely to be lawless and have simplistic societies, cultures, civilizations, and technologies. <br><br>Any thoughts, pol?","filename":"warrior dance","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1066,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493536015731,"time":1493536015,"md5":"M2TNMf3Ple5x5dVJMiFXlA==","fsize":388056,"resto":0,"id":"XUPC8CIg","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-i-recently-came-up-with-a-social-theory-that-i","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123450105,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:10:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123449813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123449813<\/a><br>not true. i&#039;ve been to drum circles on Venice Beach. you should go to on any Saturday so you can experience it for yourself.","time":1493536222,"resto":123449813,"id":"uPke2CAU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123450452,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:15:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123450105\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123450105<\/a><br>I am speaking specifically of evolutionary and sociological trends, not anything specific. We are all still human and still have a lot of the traits which came from our time before splitting off into the relatively distinct groups in Europe, Africa, etc. This includes an affinity for certain musical aspects such as a 4\/4 time signature and rhythms that closely resemble a beating heart. But again, this post is more about the trends more than anything specific.","time":1493536537,"resto":123449813,"id":"XUPC8CIg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123450591,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:17:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123449813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123449813<\/a><br>A load of shit. The reason why &#039;lawful&#039; societies are memed about not having rhythm\/whites can&#039;t dance is because they don&#039;t practice it anymore, simple as that. Look at musicians of any origin and you&#039;ll notice that they have excellent rhythm because they practice it.<br><br>If there are two people who aren&#039;t professional musicians, one who never dabbles into music at all, and the other who e.g freestyle raps or beatboxes frequently because its part of his culture, the latter will have a better sense of rhythm.","time":1493536645,"resto":123449813,"id":"dphMFD44","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":123450980,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:23:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123450591\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123450591<\/a><br>Again, I am speaking generally about the trends of societies. Sure anyone can learn to have rhythm, and sure practice will definitely help. But it comes more naturally to hispanics and blacks. That is something that I assumed that everyone had come to terms with by now. It is pretty apparent imo by just observing people. I didn&#039;t think that the &quot;white peopel have no rhythm&quot; stereotype was true at all until I was around a large group of them which originated from places that were not primarily black. It was very obvious that they had very little, if any sense of rhythm. Some white people that I know have to actively focus in order to maintain any semblance of rhythm, hardly able to clap on beat.<br><br>And those people who don&#039;t have any rhythm don&#039;t practice it? You practice just by listening to music. It is literally the most basic of musical structures. So by simply listening to music regularly, you should have at least a decent sense of rhythm. But I can attest that many white people don&#039;t. I didn&#039;t think that was something that was disputed.","time":1493537005,"resto":123449813,"id":"XUPC8CIg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123451326,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)03:28:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123450980\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123450980<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;But it comes more naturally to hispanics and blacks<\/span><br>no it doesn&#039;t<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; So by simply listening to music regularly, you should have at least a decent sense of rhythm<\/span><br>depends on the music","time":1493537336,"resto":123449813,"id":"dphMFD44","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]}

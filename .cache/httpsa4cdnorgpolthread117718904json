Because to secure votes they had to appeal to households and the best interests for those in that household.

This extends across all parties as well, the democrats have secured the black woman vote by creating a welfare state for them, they secure other identity politics voting blocks by targeting certain demographics.","time":1490161575,"resto":117718904,"id":"avo2afND","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117727012,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:47:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why is the pink ID bitch so asshurt in this thread?

Just take a look at how the left wing in the West is supported by Islamist&#039;s, why do SJW&#039;s, the polar opposite of Islamist&#039;s support Islam?

Because to secure votes they had to appeal to households and the best interests for those in that household. You created policies that tried to better those households in the poverty bracket, you encouraged wealth generation in the households who held a modicum of wealth and you created fair policies for those households who happened to be in the upper class bracket of wealth.<br><br>Since giving women the right to vote what you have done now is split the household vote into two, this is the start of identity politics, because now instead of creating policies that are good for families you are now tailoring policies that are good for either men or women to try and secure their votes, so no longer are policies driven towards family values or is society working towards treasuring the family unit you are now working towards individuals, and inherently individuals are selfish.<br><br>Step it forward a few years and look at what you have, you have policies that are designed to appeal to certain parts of society, what is that, you are a single mother, it is all good, we have welfare for you (encouraging single mothers), what is that, you are to lazy to get a job, that is cool, we have welfare for you as well as long as you vote for me. This extends across all parties as well, the democrats have secured the black woman vote by creating a welfare state for them, they secure other identity politics voting blocks by targeting certain demographics.","time":1490161575,"resto":117718904,"id":"avo2afND","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":117727012,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)01:47:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why is the pink ID bitch so asshurt in this thread?

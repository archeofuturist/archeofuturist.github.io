They&#039;re nuclear armed, and I don&#039;t say this about many governments, but these people are outright insane. What, you want us to wait until AFTER they glass Seoul? Too fucking late.","time":1491226684,"resto":119323819,"id":"EDE7yPfy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119329149,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)09:40:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119323819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119323819<\/a><br>hes a fucking genious how cant you see that<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;make a huge paper tiger so that chine would shit its pants<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;they start expedning shitloads of money on defense<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;eventually they fuck up<\/span><br>this star wars program 2.0","time":1491226830,"resto":119323819,"id":"\/ijpnlZD","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"},{"no":119329166,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)09:40:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119328918\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119328918<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I could give you an unending list of threats they&#039;ve made against us.<\/span><br><br>THREATS =\/= ATTACKS<br><br>DPRK HAS NOT ATTACKED THE USA EVER","filename":"1483906919092","ext":".png","w":1059,"h":962,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":113,"tim":1491226840460,"time":1491226840,"md5":"NwLic5AVF7D3DKupLS4GPw==","fsize":499527,"resto":119323819,"id":"hhiPlxyM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

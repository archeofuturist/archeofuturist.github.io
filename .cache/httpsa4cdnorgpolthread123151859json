You thought you knew Hillary when the primary campaign began. You knew the sound of her voice and her laughter and you made up your mind that those things bothered you. You thought the way she smiled\u2014or when she chose not to\u2014told you a lot about her, but your sneers told us more about you.<br><br>She\u2019s a fighter. She was never going to stop unless they found a way to stop her, and it\u2019s our country\u2019s greatest loss that she was stopped.<br><br>I look at her and I see a hero. I look at her and see someone who took it and took it and took it and then took it some more. I also see someone who gave a speech on women\u2019s rights as human rights, someone who had to swallow a lot of nonsense from arrogant pricks to try to pass universal healthcare back in the \u201990s. I see a woman who got out there anyway, despite our culture\u2019s utter rejection of how she looks, what she wears, how she laughs. Most of us just want to zip it up and shut it down, but Hillary? She spent her life defying the built-in endgame for women.<br><br>Shame on the media for its treatment of her. Shame on the hard left for its dismissal of her, shame on the worst of America gathered in stadiums wearing t-shirts that said \u201cTrump that bitch,\u201d in a room full of men and women whose right arms were itching to stiffen to Sieg Heil! Whose dubious erections wriggled slightly every time they chanted, \u201cLock her up, lock her up,\u201d joining an invisible hand with the Bernie supporters who chanted \u201cShe\u2019s a liar, she\u2019s a liar,\u201d as though it was decided then and there. Mob rule.<br><br>History will treat Hillary Clinton kindly despite all of that, and in ten years\u2019 time the only thing anyone will remember about this election was that it took a village\u2014with torches and pitchforks\u2014to bring down Hillary Clinton, the first woman who should have been president","filename":"IMG_3581","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":635,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":132,"tim":1493356502558,"time":1493356502,"md5":"9ROW2sJ0y7ysMKSLLBxfCg==","fsize":190623,"resto":0,"id":"xMU7npyM","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"dear-pol","country_name":"United States","replies":23,"images":9,"unique_ips":15},{"no":123152081,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)01:17:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123151859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123151859<\/a><br>can&#039;t wait till that cunt dies, will be a great day.","time":1493356633,"resto":123151859,"id":"HJUL7+HH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123152096,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)01:17:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123151859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123151859<\/a>","filename":"mind virus","ext":".jpg","w":1548,"h":1545,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1493356640207,"time":1493356640,"md5":"MbVjSOpnKi1ise\/2Clwo9g==","fsize":530526,"resto":123151859,"id":"3vUtXrvN","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":123152255,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)01:18:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123151859\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123151859<\/a><br>This is a board about politics.<br>All threads should be about politics.<br>If you&#039;re posting bullshit that isn&#039;t about politics, you&#039;re probably going to get reported and banned like the subhuman shitposter you seem to represent so well.","time":1493356734,"resto":123151859,"id":"7zsKlWfn","country":"TH","country_name":"Thailand"},{"no":123152483,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)01:21:02","name":"MicanO31","com":"You mean the woman who defends, and does not criticize a rapist, the one who broke the law, the one who does not care about our troops, the one who wants an ever-growing government, the one who payed Bernie off so she could win the nomination?

Each has at least one episode about eviromentalism. Some have dozens of episodes about bullying, racism, class division, inequality, sexism, etc. This has created a sense in millenials that they must come to the rescue of those less fortunate in a way that surpasses simple charity or being a good samaritan. They feel it is incumbent on them to destory inequality and bad feels--by any means necessary. <br><br>Socialism, as it is preached, claims to eradicate the very inequality millenials hate so veheminately. This is why they flock to it anon. They feel it is their moral responsibility. <br><br>In other words this entire generation is cucked ad has no grasp on the reality of the way the world works. They see the state of nature much as Roussau would, a state of happiness, cooperation, and good intentions.

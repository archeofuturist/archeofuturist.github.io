I know he did that John Miller thing a while back and leaked stuff about himself to get publicity, but that barely seems liked 2-d chess let alone 4-d. Even just going over his entire life, it seems like he&#039;s played it pretty straightforward and has in fact gotten fucked up a lot of times (Trump steaks, Casino closure, Trump airlines). I mean 30 years ago he took out full page ads and claimed that the Gang of Five were guilty, and to this day still claims they were guilty even though the real Central Park Rapist got caught and they were all exonerated and given huge settlements. How is any of this 4-d?<br><br>And please don&#039;t start claiming that winning the election was 4-d chess when it was the result of a great campaign staff and grassroots strategy from Bannon\/Kushner. <br><br>Just show me 1 (one) example of legitimate 4d chess by Trump and I will believe and trust in him.","filename":"4dchesss","ext":".jpg","w":591,"h":555,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":234,"tim":1492085077387,"time":1492085077,"md5":"Ap4CTjECTsqiZKwf3ExevQ==","fsize":70091,"resto":0,"id":"4CR4lsB2","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"serious-question-to-chesskeks","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":3,"unique_ips":9},{"no":120902452,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)08:06:27","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1491586677881","ext":".jpg","w":349,"h":642,"tn_w":67,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492085187692,"time":1492085187,"md5":"ws4Bvf4mzh9BXh6AlmOz2w==","fsize":58384,"resto":120902294,"id":"tSRU4dd5","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120902646,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)08:09:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120902294\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120902294<\/a><br>By being obnoxious and the antithesis to whining, easily-angered liberal faggots such as yourself, he has managed to make you his advertising slaves, posting threads every minute on every social media site known to man, making his name literally more recognizable than Jesus Christ in the modern era.<br><br>Hell, that isn&#039;t 4d chess, it&#039;s 40d chess.","time":1492085341,"resto":120902294,"id":"lruPKyFi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120902756,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)08:10:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120902294\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120902294<\/a><br>Literally shilling","time":1492085432,"resto":120902294,"id":"GI\/THsTZ","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120902760,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)08:10:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120902646\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120902646<\/a><br>I&#039;m not a liberal or a shill you dumb nigger.

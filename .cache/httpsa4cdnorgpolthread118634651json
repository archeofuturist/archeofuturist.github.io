But why does this needs to be a fund where the government is in charge? Just arrange for your own savings. Preferably not in cash of course because then you don&#039;t have the money working for you.<br><br>One of the best financial tips you can give is telling people they should have their money working for them. Example: not simply owning real estate (liability) but renting it out so it produces more than it costs (asset). You want to have the money active. Another tip would be of course investing in companies, here you have two options: either spend time learning how the whole stock market works or just put it all in an index. Depends on how much you want to risk.<br><br>The thing is, it&#039;s time for the negative stigma to go away on investing and real estate or even having money. You don&#039;t have to be poor and government reliant. Your goal should be to be financially free.<br><br>I wish you all good luck in the future and get that motherfucking money.

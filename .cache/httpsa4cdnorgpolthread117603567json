Like a charter or something, Send us goods at this low price for X years and supply men for our armys for X and after that period you are free but receive no more benefits from the old homeland.<br><br>People wise lets be honest it would best for etho-colonies. And i dont just mean white and black but like a japanese settlement, american, Russian, whatever.<br><br>Finally we should not have all colonys under the same charter, that would lead to a large country when independence is granted, but difficulty for then as each land would develop their own culture a bit differently. Not as bad as the liberal multicult shit but enough to hurt. Think california vs applachia, same base, drastic differences.","time":1490083962,"resto":117603567,"id":"o3P+\/TtQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117604330,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)04:13:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117603567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117603567<\/a><br>Why would a bunch of paper folding enthusiasts even want to colonize a planet?","time":1490084018,"resto":117603567,"id":"fv1l0spp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117605344,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)04:29:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117603915\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117603915<\/a><br>Fuck I hope the sea reclaims your worthless country.","time":1490084959,"resto":117603567,"id":"8UvilZgu","country":"ZA","country_name":"South Africa"}]}

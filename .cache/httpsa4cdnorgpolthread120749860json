This is nothing but agitation which necessarily evokes national wrath .... The conclusion of this is that the &quot;multinational, multiracial society&quot; of the South Korean pro-US flunkeyist traitor forces denies the unity of the Korean people (minjok), displaces, muddles, and Americanizes the Korean people, and is an unforgivable idea for national destruction .... South Korean pro-US traitors of the nation, proposing the idea of &quot;multinational, multiracial society&quot; are fools who do not have the faintest idea of the national consciousness (minjokkwan) and social and historical development, and are empty of any national spirit. The argument for &quot;multiethnic, multiracial society&quot; cried for by pro-American flunkeyists in South Korea is an unpardonable argument to obliterate the race by denying the homogeneity of the Korean race and to make an immigrant society out of South Korea, to make it a hodgepodge, to Americanize it.<\/span><br><br>This is an accurate description of the threat of racial annihiliation that Korea faces at the hands of America, which is still occupying Korea and defiling it by stationing mongrel and negro soldiers at the DMZ.","time":1492013880,"resto":120749860,"id":"bbOvLylw","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":120773059,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)12:18:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120763428\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120763428<\/a><br>nice mal","time":1492013930,"resto":120749860,"id":"IYzIG6Rr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120773304,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)12:20:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120772956\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120772956<\/a><br>you really seem to think that life in the DPRK is cool and stuff<br>Why don&#039;t you live there?","time":1492014055,"resto":120749860,"id":"Eo3NEBMt","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":120773406,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)12:21:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120749860\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120749860<\/a><br>North korea literally did nothing wrong<br><br>I will debate anyone who says anotherwise","time":1492014110,"resto":120749860,"id":"PqdG29yz","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120773479,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)12:22:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120773304\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120773304<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Austrian keeps pushing for the US to invade<\/span><br>Why do you guys insist on starting every major war?","time":1492014144,"resto":120749860,"id":"1Qs6OTb1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120773500,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)12:22:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120772710\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120772710<\/a><br><br>Fuck that clown, and thanks for the post.

They think that everyone and everything is going to be sovereign and abide by the NAP and no violence and have a little homestead etc. but in reality the logical conclusion of anarcho capitalism is just hereditary monarchy or oligarchy wherein someone or some group will end up just forming another government. The only thing that makes it different is the decentralization and exclusionary possibilities that the landowners (monarchs) would have. And the free movement. So essentially it would just be feudalism where there you can live in whatever society you want or that people form, however since it is business driven the monarchs would want a system in place that ensures stability and sustainability for the longest period of time possible, effectively rendering every society to a totalitarian right wing fascist state. So it doesnt even really matter to me anymore, we either have fascism now or we have it later. It truly is the only way.

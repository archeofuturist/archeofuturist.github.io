San Francisco dermatologist Andrea Hui says balding millennials are coming to her more than ever, asking her for everything from natural supplements like Nutrafol to more invasive procedures like PRP, which involves injecting your own plasma into your scalp. New York City stylist Angelo David has seen a \u201ctremendous\u201d number of young and balding clients too: \u201cThe new hair extension story is no longer short to long but thin to thick,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople want full and voluminous hair.\u201d One of his most recent clients, in fact, was a college student just shy of her 20th birthday who had severe hair loss. \u201cShe was devastated,\u201d he says, spending roughly $4000 on a customized, couture wig to cover up the issue.<br><br>One big reason for the follicle freakout? High stress, say both Hui and David. Indeed, millennials are more stressed out that any other generation, according to research from the American Psychological Association. And that stress can lead to hair loss, research shows. There\u2019s a condition called telogen effluvium, which happens when \u201csignificant stress pushes large numbers of hair follicles into a resting phase\u201d and then hair falls out, and one called alopecia areata, in which your immune system attacks the hair follicles, which can be exacerbated by stress. There\u2019s also a disorder called trichotillomania, in which stressed-out people feel an irresistible urge to pull their hair out.","filename":"1492763413132s","ext":".jpg","w":250,"h":250,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493676414790,"time":1493676414,"md5":"lb828YT4AxrxrHU6BFMmOA==","fsize":8195,"resto":0,"id":"XDYYUblI","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-the-actual-fuck-is-going-on-is-it-the-gay","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":4,"unique_ips":15},{"no":123681975,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:17:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123680658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123680658<\/a><br>The average IQ for university graduates used to be 115-120. Nowadays, higher education is considered the standard and most people in my generation would feel like failures if they didn&#039;t get one. The average IQ of a university graduate is now close to 100, meaning it has approached the mean for the general population.<br><br>While many universities are responding by dumbing down the curriculum and inflating grades so that the mediocre masses can keep up, the fact remains that many millennials are stressed because they&#039;re out of their league. They have to work that much harder, especially if they&#039;ve chosen a more demanding program. They&#039;ve been told that they need a university education to compete in the modern job market (which isn&#039;t incorrect) so they go heavily into debt to pay for an education that they&#039;ll find challenging so they&#039;ll have the credentials for a field they couldn&#039;t have qualified for in previous generations.<br><br>I commend anyone of average or below average IQ who possesses the determination and industriousness to complete challenging programs, but I&#039;m not surprised that they&#039;re balding from the stress.","time":1493677053,"resto":123680658,"id":"Jb57GjWS","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123682121,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:18:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123680658\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123680658<\/a><br>Damn.

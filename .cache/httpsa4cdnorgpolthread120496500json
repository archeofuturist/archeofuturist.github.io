Here is a short list of his broken promises:<br><br>1. Build a wall and make Mexico pay for it.<br>2. Jail Crooked Hillary.<br>3. Avoid war with Syria.<br>4. Restore good relations with Russia. Russia was our closest ally in<br>the fight against ISIS, but now they have announced they will no<br>longer cooperate with us.<br>5. A TOTAL AND COMPLETE shutdown of Muslims entering the United<br>States. He did announce two Muslim bans, but they only applied to 7<br>countries, and neither of the bans applied to Saudi Arabia, the<br>world&#039;s leading source of radical Islamic terrorism, including the<br>9\/11 attack.<br>6. Repeal Obamacare.<br>7. Divest in his businesses to avoid conflicts of interest.<br>8. Deregulate the economy.<br>9. Establish national handgun permit reciprocity.<br><br>Whether or not you agree with any of these decisions, either he was wrong before or he&#039;s wrong now. He can&#039;t have it both ways. He&#039;s only been in for a few months, so it&#039;s not too late for him to get his act together, but at this point, I seriously doubt that it will happen.","filename":"hot air","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":877,"tn_w":171,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491860700848,"time":1491860700,"md5":"qndhAehRGpp5xFM8y+SRKA==","fsize":463871,"resto":0,"id":"ovD2Aqy8","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-is-proof-that-physics-is-right-when-it-says","country_name":"United States","replies":26,"images":8,"unique_ips":18},{"no":120496638,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:45:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120496500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120496500<\/a><br>Why are we even still talking about Trump?<br><br>The guy is fucking finished, man. He&#039;s getting maybe 40 delegates tops, and that&#039;s being generous, according to what Nate Silver writes on project538.com. After 8 years of Obama, people want someone who&#039;s got a proven record of having consistent conservative values and who hasn&#039;t alienated half of the voter base with his divisive comments and demagogic rhetoric.<br><br>I can&#039;t support Klumpf especially after he&#039;s turned out to be just another neocon Jewish puppet. Trump is fucking finished, he&#039;s not recovering from this. This really was the last straw. All the credible news outlets estimate his approval rates at something like 40% anyway, that&#039;s lower than any other president at this point.<br><br>Do you HONESTLY think that Klumpf can recover after launching the nuclear missile codes at based Assad? I mean, do you even read the \/sg\/ threads? Everyone knows you cannot Mossad the Assad. There even was a Turkish minister who said that he didn&#039;t like Assad in 2011 and he has since then resigned and is no longer the minister. There is clearly a curse associated with people who try to Mossad the Assad.<br><br>Literally all the prominent intellectuals who used to support Klumpf and helped him win the election like Stefan Molyneux and also Jared Taylor have repudiated Klumpf, and no longer want him to have access to the nuclear codes.<br><br>I&#039;m telling you man, Klumpflets are delusional if they think they can keep the nuclear codes. Klumpf will get impeached any second now. It&#039;s just a matter of time.<br><br>Even \/pol\/, which makes up about 95,3% of his supporters, according to Nate Silver has turned on him. He&#039;s not getting the nuclear codes anymore. He&#039;ll have the nuclear codes taken away from him any second now. <br><br>I even heard from sources that there are people on their way to take away the nuclear codes from wummpf as we speak.","time":1491860752,"resto":120496500,"id":"I5c1eLxO","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":120497181,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:49:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Everyday I thank God that Hillary is not in office<br><br>Supreme Court, Constitution","time":1491860954,"resto":120496500,"id":"M\/zBz6nH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120497186,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:49:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120496500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120496500<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120496638\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120496638<\/a><br>hello shillbillies; how&#039;s business?","filename":"slide warning","ext":".png","w":1156,"h":2031,"tn_w":71,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491860955821,"time":1491860955,"md5":"MQYcjjFVppI3Vdhe7m4ajw==","fsize":296781,"resto":120496500,"id":"YUzXUXE9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120497476,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:51:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120497181\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120497181<\/a><br>Being better than Crooked Hillary is not a high bar to set.<br><a href=\"#p120497186\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120497186<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;EVERYONE I DON&#039;T AGREE WITH IS A SHILL!<\/span>","time":1491861062,"resto":120496500,"id":"ovD2Aqy8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120497992,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)17:54:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120496500\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120496500<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120496638\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120496638<\/a><br>The burger and leaf want a dictator instead of a president.<br><br>1st Amendment, <br>2nd Amendment,<br>and a Scotus to protect them<br>Trumps your faggotry","filename":"1485908633041","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":1066,"tn_w":93,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491861260807,"time":1491861260,"md5":"kOJZxK4a0hRruULALMHFbw==","fsize":313843,"resto":120496500,"id":"M\/zBz6nH","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":120498928,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)18:00:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120497476\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120497476<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;i&#039;ll keep making terrible threads lined with hillshill propaganda in an attempt to bait people who forget to sage when responding to my massive faggottry while denying that i am one while simultaneously attempting to falsely equate the calling out of said faggottry to &quot;everyone i dont like is hitler&quot;<\/span>","filename":"shill is kill","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":640,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491861643444,"time":1491861643,"md5":"hk\/UXvM87racy+J1oozTwA==","fsize":54818,"resto":120496500,"id":"YUzXUXE9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120499712,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)18:06:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120498928\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120498928<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hillshill<\/span><br>If you had any reading comprehension, you&#039;d have noticed that I was never in favor of Hillary and indeed asked why Trump hasn&#039;t jailed her for leaking massive amounts of classified information.

If you want the most accurate translation go for the NRSV. That&#039;s what serious scholars use and includes gender-neutral language when supported by the text. For example, it&#039;s &quot;he&quot; but refers to both men and women it would be &quot;person&quot;. <br><br>However, I find the NIV is more readable and this is done on purpose. Just know you&#039;re getting this translation for readability rather than accuracy.","time":1493347425,"resto":123125317,"id":"eoL63Ina","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123133666,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)22:46:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123125317\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123125317<\/a><br>read the bible<br><br>these might help<br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gkw<wbr>LnvY9jVM<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=VeK<wbr>avDdRVIg","time":1493347608,"resto":123125317,"id":"lAdubRrP","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123134173,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)22:50:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123133243\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123133243<\/a><br><br>^I am clarifying a little bit.<br><br>For example, in the KJV, Romans 3:28 states &quot;For we maintain that A MAN is justified by faith apart from works of the Law.&quot;<br><br>However, the NIV translates Romans 3:28 as &quot;For we maintain that A PERSON is justified by faith apart from the works of the law.&quot;<br><br>You may be thinking: Why do they do this?<br>Although, it may not seem like much, the latter of the two is more accurate.

I&#039;d love to. Here are some of my favorite bible videos. <br><br>Things that are in the bible that have been found: <br><br>Noah&#039;s ark: big as boat in armenia, near mount urarat that has the exact dimensions of the boat described in the bible and, get this, is full of fur and feces from all kind of different animals. So old its petrified (i think).<br><br>Sodom and Gomorrah: The location checks out, the structures on this shore of the red sea are geometrical (meaning obviously man-made) there is hella ash every where and a ridiculous amount of a certain kind of sulfur (brimstone) that only occurs in small amounts in volcanic eruptions just litter the entire ground. No natural explanation for this find but it is in keeping with if, say, fire and brimstone literally rained down from the sky onto this settlement.<br><br>Mount sinai: in Arabia, the top of this mountain is still freaking scorched black to this day, there are pillars that were mentioned being erected in the bib;e still standing, hebraic hieroglyphs painted on stone including a couple cows (with people dancing around it), and nearby a rock that was split in two (it is said moses struck the rock, against gods instructions, and it split in two and produced water.<br><br>Playlist of those things: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=xFp<wbr>vKKmTF7c&amp;index=14&amp;list=PLH2uhJ2RmgY<wbr>WPI0MWW2dtZRzahOy4Ttfg","time":1493347992,"resto":123125317,"id":"pXuFW1Ei","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

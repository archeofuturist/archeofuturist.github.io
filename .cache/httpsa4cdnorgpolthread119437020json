Kushner&#039;s crew was able to tap into the Republican National Committee&#039;s data machine, and it hired targeting partners like Cambridge Analytica to map voter universes and identify which parts of the Trump platform mattered most: trade, immigration or change. Tools like Deep Root drove the scaled-back TV ad spending by identifying shows popular with specific voter blocks in specific regions--say, NCIS for anti-ObamaCare voters or The Walking Dead for people worried about immigration. Kushner built a custom geo-location tool that plotted the location density of about 20 voter types over a live Google Maps interface.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;As the election barreled toward its finale, Kushner&#039;s system, with its high margins and up-to-the-minute voter data, provided both ample cash and the insight on where to spend it. When the campaign registered the fact that momentum in Michigan and Pennsylvania was turning Trump&#039;s way, Kushner unleashed tailored TV ads, last-minute rallies and thousands of volunteers to knock on doors and make phone calls.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Trump campaign, meanwhile, delved into message tailoring, sentiment manipulation and machine learning. The traditional campaign is dead, another victim of the unfiltered democracy of the Web--and Kushner, more than anyone not named Donald Trump, killed it.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For fundraising they turned to machine learning, installing digital marketing companies on a trading floor to make them compete for business. Ineffective ads were killed in minutes, while successful ones scaled. The campaign was sending more than 100,000 uniquely tweaked ads to targeted voters each day. In the end, the richest person ever elected president, whose fundraising effort was rightly ridiculed at the beginning of the year, raised more than $250 million in four months--mostly from small donors.<\/span><br>(From the Forbes Article)<br><br>You fags are more pathetic and idiotic than the birthers","time":1491285255,"resto":119437020,"id":"aCY89AT4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119438125,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:54:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119437707\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119437707<\/a><br>Why would Russia be in any way connected to the Trump campaign, which this server is?<br><br>You Russian shills really need to learn that your job is over and you&#039;re going to have to go back to the bread line.","time":1491285296,"resto":119437020,"id":"CQfd1ibw","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119438464,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)01:59:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119438125\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119438125<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Why would Russia be in any way connected to the Trump campaign, which this server is?<\/span><br>Because Trump is a businessman.

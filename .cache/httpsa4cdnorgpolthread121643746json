This is assuming the US military could easily win a short-lived war against Mexico to force the primary Mexican government to be subjugated. I don&#039;t think the US military would have any problem doing this, and then immediately turning around and whipping the Cartels like the ragtag fuckwads they are doesn&#039;t sound like a huge challenge.<br><br>I say legalize marijuana and hemp first because let&#039;s be honest, you can easily grow tons of it in Mexico and it would immediately be a cash crop, spurring investment into the region due to the recently increased levels of security and safety in the concept of Mexican agricultural investment.<br><br>They could keep their current organization of government, though many things would become redundant and therefore would be completely eliminated due to lack of need. Whether it would be broken down into many states is up for discussion, but the general concept of taking it and using their land to increase the overall federal budget via taxes sounds worthwhile due to long-term profits.<br><br>Not to mention, annexing Mexico would, in a relatively short time, bring up the general quality of life for all Mexicans and resolve the immigration crisis. They can just stay the fuck home and build an economy there. Also, a southern wall would get quite a bit cheaper due to the smaller Mexican border.<br><br>Also, why the fuck hasn&#039;t the Mexican government just asked the US to Annex them yet? Most of their land is Cartel-Owned practically, US forces ripping their spines out through their assholes would make it easier and safer to live there.<br><br>Win-Win for the US and Mexico, who loses here?","filename":"Untitled","ext":".png","w":410,"h":283,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":172,"tim":1492493083735,"time":1492493083,"md5":"DJS\/WgvhfhDPYdfelndbuw==","fsize":52551,"resto":0,"id":"d6e\/vRZZ","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"us-should-annex-mexico","country_name":"United States","replies":188,"images":29,"unique_ips":92,"tail_size":50},{"no":121644086,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:27:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121643746\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121643746<\/a><br><br>The cartels and Mexican ruling class would turn the populace against the invading anglo, drawing upon centuries of hispanic inferiority complexes to add fuel to the fire.<br><br>It&#039;d be like Iraq but worse.<br><br>we should just nuke the place desu","time":1492493269,"resto":121643746,"id":"ibihnCLm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121644766,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:34:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"You niggas can&#039;t deal properly with Puerto Rico, let alone a 130 gorillion G20 beanconomy.<br><br>You had your chance, be glad you got Calexico out of it.","time":1492493662,"resto":121643746,"id":"mDNTJmtO","country":"MX","country_name":"Mexico"},{"no":121644904,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)01:35:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Not only are the cartel soldiers smarter than the pigs\/narcofags\/deafags in the us, but they have bigger balls and just as big weapons, and just as much funding.

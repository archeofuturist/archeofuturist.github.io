The problem with democracy is that people can vote entitlements on to themselves without actually doing anything worthwhile, essentially becoming leeches on the system. These people will vote for the same &quot;entitlements&quot; every year siphoning more and more money from the taxpayer attracting more and more people to the welfare nanny state. <br><br>With starship troopers however, to get the right to vote, you must contribute to society first. Starship troopers isn&#039;t perfect, because it uses citizenship as a recruiting tactic (much like the US uses honor, glory, and games like call of duty to recruit young idiots) and it doesn&#039;t portray &quot;wars for isreal&quot; like what&#039;s happening today. But it allieviates the problem with democracy, because citizens can at least say they contributed to humanity before going to the ballot box. This would bolster recruiting and remove the retarded quotas that we have in place to meet at the expense of poor classes. It would also eliminate the &quot;leeches&quot; from society, because the military instills discipline and honor in people, setting them up for society later on by being less lazy and more productive. The leeches would either be converted or never have the right to vote. It seems like a system that would garner a more productive workforce.","filename":"IMG_0489","ext":".jpg","w":1125,"h":606,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":134,"tim":1493004501295,"time":1493004501,"md5":"xbATfgqhNNqOa8hB58ddWg==","fsize":165759,"resto":0,"id":"i6fJ+oUl","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"service-guarantees-citizenship-a-starship-trooper","country_name":"United States","replies":26,"images":3,"unique_ips":14},{"no":122536445,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)23:32:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"You&#039;re just doing what the left does with Star Wars or Harry Potter.

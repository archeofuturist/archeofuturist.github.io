It is a historical fact that slavery was used by most ancient civilizations including African, Asians, Whites, and Middle Eastern people in ancient times. The reason why Africans believe in Islam is because of the Islamic slave trade that was used against the west during the crusades.<br>So my point is if any other color of skin and their civilization had the global market that white people had during manifest destiny, that they themselves wouldn&#039;t create the slave trade system that whites are demonized <br>for to this day? <br>Every. Goddamn. Civilization.<br>Has conquered and created slavery just as whites. Are whites to be damned just because we globalized the system of slavery?<br>Fuck. White people fought a war over their freedom. Yet we blame them for the oppression of the race before it that had the same system in place, only smaller? <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I live in liberal cuckifornia.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;should I do it?<\/span>","filename":"1490146252857","ext":".jpg","w":678,"h":960,"tn_w":176,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490236577629,"time":1490236577,"md5":"ssRjT+VuyYjqw69Hy6im2g==","fsize":118727,"resto":0,"id":"e4opLr7A","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"weeeeeeeeeeew-lad","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":117874337,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)22:41:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117873642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117873642<\/a><br>Nope I&#039;m guessing.","time":1490236891,"resto":117873642,"id":"e4opLr7A","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

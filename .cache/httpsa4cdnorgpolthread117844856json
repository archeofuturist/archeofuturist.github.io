Looks like they want to get requests for climate change and &quot;explaining the news.&quot; I picked Finance instead. If they choose that topic, they may have to explain the Federal reserve system, risking redpilling normies. At the very least, some normies and libcucks might learn to balance their checkbooks, leading them on the road to conservatism and away from the liberal debt spiral.<br><br>Plz help make PBS great again and go fill out the survey, voting for whatever you feel would make PBS great again. And don&#039;t be too obvious with your answers (don&#039;t set your gender to nonbinary and write Apache or 0x1488bbc69) lest your response get ignored.","filename":"Screenshot_20170322-185659","ext":".png","w":1080,"h":1920,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490224118395,"time":1490224118,"md5":"\/kElbdOl2F2YDpp+OcJH3g==","fsize":407781,"resto":0,"id":"BO2G\/VMx","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mpga-make-pbs-great-again","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1,"unique_ips":1},{"no":117845572,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)19:13:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"the call that saved PBS","filename":"tmp_1929114891041257172077264359","ext":".png","w":600,"h":639,"tn_w":117,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490224438054,"time":1490224438,"md5":"3qKgpDwQUgDdcvDz8yxIIg==","fsize":183717,"resto":117844856,"id":"BO2G\/VMx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

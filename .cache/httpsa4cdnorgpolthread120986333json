That conclusion is that we really fucking need Christianity. I&#039;m actually an atheist, but I&#039;ve thought quite a while on this, and this is the conclusion I&#039;ve come to. Everything is shitty in the way it is right now thanks to religion going out of style. As much as the bible is filled with authoritarian bullshit...some of that bullshit is highly potent truth about maintaining society. It is entirely possible to live without a bible to guide you and still have strong morals and understanding of values in society, however it is not a given. I think many attempting to think freely reach this state...they think a little bit about religion, and realize 1) theres some bullshit, and 2) some of it is restrictive. The automatic reaction is to fully reject religion. Unfortunately it seems most stop there, they don&#039;t continue to contemplate about the idea of God, or the point of humanities existence etc etc.<br>This, combined with innate instinctual desire to see humanity succeed, creates your typical liberal atheist: A person who doesn&#039;t give the slightest fuck about religion, and likely a loose understanding of morals.<br><br>Given all I&#039;ve learned about religion and Christianity...I&#039;ve concluded we desperately need religion, and Christianity is the absolute best one, most likely to be the most successful and lead to the best most civilized world. I do think eventually religion will be obsolete. Perhaps in a world with less anti-intellectualism, less propaganda, and better education.<br><br>For the time being tho, yall need Jesus.<br><br>I&#039;m probable going to start going to church, and you should too.","filename":"1492112304104","ext":".jpg","w":398,"h":900,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492128217774,"time":1492128217,"md5":"3PXouZA1chaIYBSZCuAmHA==","fsize":19749,"resto":0,"id":"dVyjKeGj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"christian-atheism","country_name":"United States","replies":37,"images":9,"unique_ips":24},{"no":120986607,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)20:05:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120986333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120986333<\/a><br><br>post original image pls?","time":1492128339,"resto":120986333,"id":"Mv2WED4F","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120986731,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)20:06:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120986607\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120986607<\/a><br>yes<br><br>are you going to church this sunday? you should. :)","filename":"1492112304103","ext":".png","w":398,"h":900,"tn_w":55,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492128399692,"time":1492128399,"md5":"\/Ztxy6hpEeK7UiQf+xbgZQ==","fsize":238323,"resto":120986333,"id":"dVyjKeGj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120987185,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)20:10:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120986333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120986333<\/a><br>have fun lad","time":1492128631,"resto":120986333,"id":"gqCTp2Y5","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120987201,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)20:10:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120986333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120986333<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;3 repeating 3s<\/span><br>OP SPEAKS THE TRUTH","time":1492128636,"resto":120986333,"id":"MkQWhxgh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120987323,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)20:11:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"I might get in on this.

This is the fundamental point of a religion - to give a sense of purpose to a people in a nation or culture on a higher level than just to mindlessly survive in a nihilistic sense. <br><br>Now, due to technological innovation and progress, human societies have co-mingled and moral\/cultural relativism became a thing. In this moral relativistic state, a certain segment of the population in most of the successful world has come to believe that religion is outdated. <br><br>But this is not the case. <br><br>Most people other than a select group within any population NEED religion to give them purpose. If there is no organized religion, they will create one for this reason (see Social Justice in the modern American\/Western context - it is a secular cult that borders on religion more and more as it grows in popularity and power and it&#039;s there because a whole generation in the west has grown up without God). <br><br>You have to understand the core disagreement between Plato and Aristotle I suppose to get this, but Plato understood the importance of mysticism and Aristotle (being the autist he was) rejected it. Aristotle was correct in a technical sense that mysticism was garbage and unnecessary, but that&#039;s because he was a ridiculously smart autist. Like all autists, his obsessions gave him purpose. But people who don&#039;t get obsessed over a pursuit of knowledge or philosophy or whatever can&#039;t as easily block out the need for purpose, they&#039;re the ones that need religion and what was later identified as the people holding a &quot;slave mentality&quot; by Nietzsche.<br><br>For society to work in any region, the slave mentality majority NEEDs religion. 100% of the time.","time":1492132560,"resto":120986333,"id":"d5GcIgZO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120997605,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)21:29:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120994422\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120994422<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;99<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;44<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;22<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;942<\/span><br>WHAT DOES IT MEAN","time":1492133390,"resto":120986333,"id":"dVyjKeGj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

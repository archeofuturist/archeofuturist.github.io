Liberal groups paid protesters to stage a phony protest (as exposed in DNC emails) to bring fire on Trump. They had headlines like \u201cTrump Calls Mexicans Rapists\u201d and other libelous\/slanderous wording.

They run hitpiece after hitpiece, describing Trump as Hitler. The worst outlet is CNN which has been proven to have colluded with Hillary. CNN is worldwide, and so their slanderous coverage was broadcast to the eyeballs of foreigners around the world. In addition, other biased coverage from the globalists continued to ratchet up with increasingly alarming language. Every week it got more frantic, describing Trump as dangerous and warming that if he got the nuclear codes, he could blow up the world.","filename":"IMG_4110","ext":".png","w":600,"h":600,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493460953000,"time":1493460953,"md5":"37YKc8zzs70\/X54UsHE4cg==","fsize":503245,"resto":123318892,"id":"3eK6y3UH","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123319689,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)06:16:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123318892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123318892<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Roosevelt<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Not a massive faggot<\/span>","time":1493460977,"resto":123318892,"id":"f5dEIRgJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123319695,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)06:16:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s just sad because Nighttime has gone from real awoo hours to real shill hours, they always raid at night. \/leftypol\/ needs to go back to their containment site.","time":1493460982,"resto":123318892,"id":"5uyaDQM6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123319699,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)06:16:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123319640\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123319640<\/a><br>Copy this post, people.

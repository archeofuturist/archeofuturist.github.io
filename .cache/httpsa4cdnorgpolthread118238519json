In the first scene, there are black people dancing in a castle. Apparently those people also live in the castle. <br><br>What an actual fuck Disney? Immersion ruined in the first five seconds. Black people were slaves at that time.<br><br>Second thing to note, forcing a gay relationship with two white male characters. WHAT? Those people would literally be stoned to death.<br><br>How can anyone watch this historically incorrect bullshit? It&#039;s even more sad when you think about the cause why Disney is doing this. It&#039;s obvious that they want white people to die off from the planet when they promote black and white partnership and white and white same sex partners. Why don&#039;t we ever see black on black same sex relationship &quot;jokes&quot;?<br><br>Otherwise the movie was great. Emma Watson was such a perfect choice for the role of main actress and the design of the beast was actually pretty noice.","filename":"landscape-1485464623-audra2","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":400,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490457865239,"time":1490457865,"md5":"QaDpv+XbbSPvFaEVj5jVEw==","fsize":72232,"resto":0,"id":"q\/dLdmMl","country":"FI","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"note-to-self-boycott-disney","country_name":"Finland","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

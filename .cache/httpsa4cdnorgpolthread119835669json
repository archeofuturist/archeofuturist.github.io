It hasnt changed my mind about him. Im still a Deplorable but I am very disappointed. I really do not want a repeat of W.Bush standing on tv saying he was against nation building then being the biggest nation builder ever. That is sortve what this feels like, sad to say. Bombing syria to disprove the deep states smears still has him doing exactly what the DS wants and that is very troubling. IDGAF about Assad and i know those children were being taught to hate Americans in their Saudi sponsored educations and were being taught to behead infidels by ISIS so I dont cry for them either beyond the general sadness of being a human being. Now, we have to hope that our guys havent misjudged Russia.

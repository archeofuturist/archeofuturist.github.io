Neanderthals have a larger occipital region of the brain but a smaller frontal cortex compared to humans. This means they had better vision\/hunting abilities but we&#039;re dumb as shit compared to today&#039;s standards. Also neanderthals were on average larger than homo sapiens explaining their overall larger brain. However, intelligence\/ brain capacity is determined by the ratio of body mass to brain mass.

We know the Neo-Cons\/Neo-Libs want Assad gone and were funding the jihadis for regime change. All public knowledge of the attack indicates a false flag - unless Trump is sitting on undeniable evidence that Assad just committed suicide by using gas like a brainlet moron. HOWEVER - it&#039;s irrelevant whether it&#039;s true or not in the grand scheme of things.<br><br>And this is why:<br>1. If it wasn&#039;t a false flag he responded appropriately. All he did was bomb an airfield storing the chemical weapons - targeting aircraft and infrastructure while avoiding personnel - after warning the Russians. No Russian casualties = No WWIII. Currently conflicting reports on SAA casualties - Pentagon says none, SAA says yes one dead. Doesn&#039;t matter. By targeting the air base and not Assad&#039;s headquarters (like Libya) he demonstrated this had NOTHING to do with regime change. Just sending a message.<br><br>2. He just put Assad in check while sedating Neo-Cons like McCain, liberals who want Assad gone, and Israel (who are the people who would have supported the false flag). He&#039;s winning over support from people stonewalling him with a glorified firework show.<br><br>3. He&#039;s being tough on China and North Korea. He was meeting with the leader of China today. By pulling the trigger unannounced like this he&#039;s showing he&#039;s not fucking around with North Korea. No doubt a message to Iran as well<br><br>4. Even if Syrian forces are grounded they still have Russian air support. Essentially nothing has changed strategically speaking.<br><br>5. The momentary salt of some of his supporters will fade as the hysteria dies down when it&#039;s seen as it is - truly nothing of significance. He gets to keep them too.<br><br>6. Another nail in the coffin for the Russian collusion narrative","time":1491549554,"resto":119903578,"id":"KXMdyf0K","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119906782,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)03:25:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119905998\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119905998<\/a><br>Fucking shill","time":1491549941,"resto":119903578,"id":"X4OCw3GX","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119906974,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)03:27:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119903578\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119903578<\/a>","filename":"steady_lads2","ext":".png","w":1298,"h":309,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":29,"tim":1491550048312,"time":1491550048,"md5":"aUxytZqMoHRnArBCJk2zVw==","fsize":81857,"resto":119903578,"id":"wwZa1gcU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119907283,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)03:30:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119905819\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119905819<\/a><br>This, so fucking much.","time":1491550218,"resto":119903578,"id":"\/Tmabq\/8","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":119907378,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)03:31:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119903578\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119903578<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;tfw realizing the reason Trump won the presidency was because the globalists WANTED him to win<\/span><br>They wouldn&#039;t have let trump win if he wasn&#039;t a globalist.","time":1491550268,"resto":119903578,"id":"\/Tmabq\/8","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":119907405,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)03:31:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119903578\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119903578<\/a><br>0\/10 b8 m8<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;aged and ridden<\/span><br><a href=\"#p119903667\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119903667<\/a><br>kek","time":1491550283,"resto":119903578,"id":"hSNTDZ1q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119907421,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)03:31:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119905998\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119905998<\/a><br>spamming is against the rules Trumpshill","time":1491550291,"resto":119903578,"id":"bdURQ3qO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119907498,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)03:32:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119905998\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119905998<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;IGNORE SHILLS<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;IGNORE NEO-CON LABELS<\/span><br>*blocks ears*","time":1491550330,"resto":119903578,"id":"\/Tmabq\/8","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":119907978,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)03:36:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119904322\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119904322<\/a><br>underrated enlightened post","time":1491550589,"resto":119903578,"id":"MQwzIWb3","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":119908440,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)03:40:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119905998\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119905998<\/a><br>Hell, makes sense to me.","filename":"hqdefault[1]","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":360,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1491550829816,"time":1491550829,"md5":"OmB+QaXWSgkF302jSCXDcA==","fsize":11564,"resto":119903578,"id":"900P6e4f","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119908735,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)03:43:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119903578\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119903578<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;globalists rigged the election just to give \/pol\/ a false sense of hope<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;at the same time \/pol\/ is nothing but shills, robots, and roleplayers<\/span><br>you aren&#039;t very good at this senpai","time":1491550986,"resto":119903578,"id":"PS+3TbMW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

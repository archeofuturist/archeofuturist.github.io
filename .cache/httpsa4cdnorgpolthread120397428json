They pitch shorter, less gratifying routes for people, programming them to prefer instant gratification more. Take for example how sex and sexual appeal is so much more widely acceptable today. America, founded on Christian ideas still retains the concept that sex is a sacred act between a couple who loves each other, yet this has been watered down by an amalgam of capitalism exceeding it&#039;s morally acceptable boundaries and society&#039;s projection of the human body&#039;s desire to live an easier, more stimulating life. The previously solid concept has been turned into a rough guideline. &quot;Sacred&quot; has become &quot;special&quot; which is watered even further down to &quot;not an every day occurrence&quot; and &quot;love&quot; has been lowered to &quot;infatuation&quot; and even simply &quot;lust.&quot; It&#039;s quicker to achieve, gratifying, yet less meaningful, but many do not care.<br><br><a href=\"#p120408871\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120408871<\/a><br>Alright, cool.

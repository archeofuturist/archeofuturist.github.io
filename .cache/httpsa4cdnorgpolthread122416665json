It literally makes me sick trying to comprehend how easily manipulated and brainwashed these people are while being wholely incapable of self-actualization and are therefore inherently dishonest to a degree where they fight to protect a deranged and damaged reality from the objective truth.<br><br>It feels like basic common sense and integrity are becoming lost on people in favour of much more insidious ideologies. <br><br>I look at reddit and I see corporate sponsored cancer meant not only to root out dissent and free thought but also to steal and twist ideas until they lose any semblance of significance to their original intent.","filename":"serbianinstincts","ext":".png","w":664,"h":637,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":239,"tim":1492949751751,"time":1492949751,"md5":"+zChvm\/O9CaDlHKT+LUmAw==","fsize":446032,"resto":0,"id":"f+zsdsOh","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-does-reddit-suck-so-much","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

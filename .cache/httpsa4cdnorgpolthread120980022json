Assad had no reason to use sarin \u2013 he essentially won the war with Russias help. Even if it did occur, it wasn&#039;t him \u2013 Russia&#039;s version that a plane mistakenly bombed a stockpile of chemical weapons of the rebels seems plausible. It&#039;s not the first time this has happened.<br><br>Trump&#039;s office replies by immediately tomahawking the shit out of the airfield, yet pictures show that 1) the landing strip is essentially intact, 2) Russia was warned hours before thereby warning Assad to get his forces out of there. The US didn&#039;t even bomb the airfield. Its staged.<br><br>Whats the profit here \u2013Trump has had shit ratings even among his supporters. The situation around his Russian connections wasn&#039;t helping. I presume Trump purposely agreed with Putin to have him bomb the airfield so that he can get recognised in his local theatre as a hero. Putin, seeing the overall benefit of having a relatively sane guy as opposed to Shillary president, agreed to take the fall to avoid Trumps potential impeachment.<br><br>Meanwhile, as this shit is brewing, both Russia and the US focus on North Korea. NK is a huge liability and threat to Russia and the US (and its allies too). Russia looks favorably at getting rid of Kimmie. Tillerson even said that Russia and the US have an agreements on NK. All of NK&#039;s military tech is essentially Russian, meaning Russia has all the intel which the US lacks. Perhaps there is a plan to strike there.<br><br>All in all, burgers, I believe we&#039;re still homies yo.

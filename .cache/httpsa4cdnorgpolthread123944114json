I got to see lots of England actually from Nottingham to London and all the major historical cities to visit. What makes me sad is that I never got to visit the Germany countryside, only the English and French. I&#039;d like to have known someone with a farm and worked\/lived there for a few weeks or months, get a taste of traditional life. I guess there is plenty of that in the USA too, but it isn&#039;t really the same.","time":1493837549,"resto":123944114,"id":"RTy2XCwC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123945778,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:54:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123944831\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123944831<\/a><br>nah dude a friend of mine has a russian friend in London who says he is legit scared and wants to move... he said every time a lorry comes around the corner he is worried this is it. he said the radicals in england are so bad... maybe not as bad as Paris in terms of disruption on the streets, but in terms of radicals.... he has become extremely islamophobic living in London over the past 10 years or so, i guess its gotten really bad the past few years.","time":1493837692,"resto":123944114,"id":"RTy2XCwC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123945961,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:56:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123944614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123944614<\/a><br>delet","time":1493837780,"resto":123944114,"id":"x67qkctD","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123947635,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)15:09:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123944614\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123944614<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;tfw you don&#039;t live in Birmingham, Manchester of London, but your area is green on the map<\/span><br><br>They seem to have a habit around here of turning buildings into Mosques, but not in the way you think.

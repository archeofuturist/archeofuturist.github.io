To gain the support of the power players so to speak, you essentially need to craft your political agenda to suit those who you are seeking support from. So if you for example want the Freedom Caucus behind you when you get into office, so you can push legislation through congress, you need to craft your platform to pander to them. This inevitably means that unless you are already aligned completely with their values (which are fucking ass-backwards by the way) you are going to compromise your beliefs to do so. And the same goes with every other group. Also keep in mind that aligning yourself with one group inevitably means losing support among another for doing so. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;why pick individuals that come from such powerful backgrounds which are almost certain to want more money and power?<\/span><br>We don&#039;t pick them.

Often in other countries they not only have to deal with what I am talking about but (certainly to a larger degree than the US) also how the US will react to the elected candidate.

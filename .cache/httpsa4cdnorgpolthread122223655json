Low crime rate, I&#039;ve only seen like two niggers since I moved here in January. Both my neighbors are sweet old ladies that bring me and my wife sweets every now and again, and my other neighbor let me borrow his tractor so I could level my driveway. There&#039;s no fucking jobs out here unless you can manage a construction company or drive a truck, but that is the only downside.","filename":"1Tetons6559","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":93,"tim":1492828910296,"time":1492828910,"md5":"AE2kFY4Q8q1Nn8In1d1tcw==","fsize":880433,"resto":122223655,"id":"dWtPrpFq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122225086,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)22:41:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"White water rafting.","time":1492828912,"resto":122223655,"id":"Lx4xznGG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122225111,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)22:42:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122223655\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122223655<\/a><br>I&#039;m from Boise and too many shitskins the past 3-5 years, I&#039;m moving North","time":1492828920,"resto":122223655,"id":"+VXPNkgx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122225122,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)22:42:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"idaho seems like a nice place to live if you want to get the fuck away from people","time":1492828928,"resto":122223655,"id":"X81Xx\/6H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122225156,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)22:42:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122224902\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122224902<\/a><br>In Utah?

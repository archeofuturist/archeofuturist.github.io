As much as I hate the bastards, whenever they have elections results seem to COMPLETELY shift from predicted polls according to the candidates, platforms, ideas and circumstances. In every other nation parties have sympathisers (cucks) and free voters are very few, swinging elections 5-10% away from the polls at most. Only frogs seem to actually vote freely and only for their interests.","filename":"a263f0f5009352bcaec45723ff07af1b","ext":".jpg","w":200,"h":260,"tn_w":192,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492936788905,"time":1492936788,"md5":"30DvVpFu7bEpNU2gi90djA==","fsize":8643,"resto":0,"id":"E7688KNt","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-frogs-the-most-democratic-free-strong-nation","country_name":"Germany","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

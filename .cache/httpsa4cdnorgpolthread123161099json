Why would you take over a country and then burn it to the ground by needlessly brutalizing your people?<br><br>These impoverished countries end up pissing off first world nations because of human rights violations and put under military\/economic pressure until finally the dictatorship collapses and the former leader is put to death.<br><br>These dictators could easily appease diplomatic ties by instating basic human rights and open up to foreign relations but still secure their positions are literal kings of their respective country by switching into a constitutional monarchy or similar form of government. <br><br>I mean, why not? If you owned a country, wouldn&#039;t you naturally want it to make it strong and productive? Dictators like Napoleon and Hitler seemed to have the right idea in that regard. They were able to unite their country under their rule.","filename":"957061_14595169907724_rId15","ext":".jpg","w":1750,"h":1312,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493361952142,"time":1493361952,"md5":"SisnP6E7G0wBubH+HuVjxQ==","fsize":84012,"resto":0,"id":"WxUaB1Xk","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-be-a-dicktator","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":123161158,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)02:46:27","name":"Anonymous","filename":"lukashenko better to be a dictator than to be gay","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":960,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493361987605,"time":1493361987,"md5":"mk8OnxAdj\/Y0CgY230J39A==","fsize":60435,"resto":123161099,"id":"SMzaOC75","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":123161730,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)02:51:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123161099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123161099<\/a><br>Wouldn&#039;t expect an American to know what pride in country and people are","time":1493362310,"resto":123161099,"id":"sUwyjHHk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123161969,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)02:54:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123161099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123161099<\/a><br>They are motivated by greed and power, you naive dip shit","time":1493362451,"resto":123161099,"id":"xe6StYTo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123164632,"now":"04\/28\/17(Fri)03:26:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123161099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123161099<\/a><br>Its not needless brutilization, its reminding people who they serve.

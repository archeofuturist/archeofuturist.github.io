Conservatives, on the other hand, have always been the group that wants restrictions against the people, and want war, and want to profit at the cost of another country&#039;s loss. <br>Nowadays I see liberals as a giant bunch of sniveling children who would love to see all forms of media and free speech policed closely as to defend not only their agenda but to defend an imaginary group they&#039;ve created that may be offended by some uses of free speech. Conservatives have become either extremely old wealthy and\/or white men or young boys who&#039;ve grown up during this strange liberal opposition to basic freedoms who are tired of feeling misrepresented and have created their own group (alt-right) in an attempt to have a voice in politics. <br>As I&#039;ve grown I&#039;ve began to see a gap between the bipartisan parties where a solid majority of americans don&#039;t feel they are represented and don&#039;t feel the need to interject in our political system.<br><br><br>I would describe myself as a pacifist and would not like to see my country in war, because I don&#039;t believe my country has the grounds to go to war for any good reason. <br><br>I don&#039;t see our current political system solving itself through anything other than civil war because the leaders of both sides seem to not want any conversation or peacemaking, they seem to be out for throats, trying to destroy key members of the opposing party.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;TL;DR: general discussion of the future of American politics, will we have one party take control of the entire country for a few decades or will there be a divide where the bipartisan system is somehow overthrown?<\/span>","filename":"akshually","ext":".jpg","w":811,"h":767,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":236,"tim":1491726457733,"time":1491726457,"md5":"i8xlYO5Ho39WUv8EvoBfiA==","fsize":80191,"resto":0,"id":"00VyXQFe","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"do-we-amerifags-have-any-options-at-this-point","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":0,"unique_ips":8},{"no":120259325,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:30:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120259121\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120259121<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I was raised to believe were the party to choose because they were the ones that respected the rights of each individual and they were the ones that would help america stay safe and grow<\/span><br>I bet you were","time":1491726630,"resto":120259121,"id":"MvxeHdyf","country":"AR","country_name":"Argentina"},{"no":120260186,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)04:41:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120259121\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120259121<\/a><br>Until the left accepts a more neutral position on immigration and cares about workers again.

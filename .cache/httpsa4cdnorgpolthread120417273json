On paper it says I&#039;ve been taking it daily since, but I haven&#039;t been taking it since about junior year of high school. I still get it refilled monthly. So how exactly should I go about that when I&#039;m trying to join? Don&#039;t mention it at all? I stopped taking it because I grew out of adhd. I&#039;m not spastic nor do I show signs of adhd.","time":1491815941,"resto":120417273,"id":"SEXvFLk6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120417624,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:20:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120417537\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120417537<\/a><br>My parents get it refilled monthly*<br>It&#039;s late, my bad.","time":1491816014,"resto":120417273,"id":"SEXvFLk6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120418214,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)05:28:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120417273\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120417273<\/a><br>Bump","time":1491816501,"resto":120417273,"id":"SEXvFLk6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

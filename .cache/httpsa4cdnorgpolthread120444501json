I&#039;m a Black girl (shocking, right? Lol), a caramel colored black girl born and raised in the suburbs. I wear a size 2 and have C cup boobs so any dumb Reddit style stereotype of black women doesn&#039;t exactly describe me, I attract a lot of men. I&#039;ve never been interested in White men, but that&#039;s just me right? Well, no. I think in general these days, in the dating world, your average white guy isn&#039;t really seen as being very hot or desirable - except to average looking Asian females. I honestly think that&#039;s why those couples are so common and more often unattractive. It seems White guys have a hard time admitting they aren&#039;t considered the best in the dating world and it&#039;s making them bitter. Their bitterness makes them worship Asian females for being the only women they feel safe\/confident enough liking because Asians are known to like them back. They call white women names because your average white girl has too many options in the dating world and therefore also does not put average white men on a pedestal. Latinas typically like and stick to Latinos (or black men) and Black women typically stick to black men or Latinos. Without Asian women, even more of those guys would be angry online complaining about feminism or MGtOw type stuff<br><br>In fact, this idea came to me wondering why white men seem to have such a desire to see black women in a negative light and I think it&#039;s for the same reason they put Asians on a pedestal. Black women don&#039;t generally like white men, and we make them feel insecure for that, especially considering they don&#039;t understand why when they see black men as being so much lower than them. It&#039;s easier to tell yourself all black women are horrible and unattractive when your chances of a cute, nice black girl wanting you are low. It&#039;s easier to believe all asians are better and cuter when your average Asian is considered easy to get. So yeah, I&#039;m just sharing, bye :)","filename":"I_think_the_popularity_of_wmaf_is_mainly_due_to_white_guys_realizing_their_lack_of_options._hapas","ext":".jpg","w":1046,"h":631,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1491835482978,"time":1491835482,"md5":"SysQzheRku8VWG72LkvyvA==","fsize":232963,"resto":0,"id":"bG2LlvbP","country":"BR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-just-wanted-to-share-and-hear-opinions-because","country_name":"Brazil","replies":3,"images":2,"unique_ips":3},{"no":120444740,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)10:47:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120444501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120444501<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;you actually typed all that out<\/span>","filename":"1485668408439","ext":".jpg","w":623,"h":713,"tn_w":109,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491835647478,"time":1491835647,"md5":"IAVtFUXrW47QOXK2i92uRA==","fsize":63454,"resto":120444501,"id":"xQGRXQcT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120444971,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)10:50:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/hapas\/comm<wbr>ents\/64i40f\/i_think_the_popularity_<wbr>of_wmaf_is_mainly_due_to\/","time":1491835804,"resto":120444501,"id":"bG2LlvbP","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120446901,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)11:09:49","name":"Sage","com":"<a href=\"#p120444501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120444501<\/a><br>Wrong.","filename":"Dating stats","ext":".png","w":760,"h":2813,"tn_w":33,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491836989189,"time":1491836989,"md5":"pzeYPtMVi4DIrIfnlFk7Qg==","fsize":273496,"resto":120444501,"id":"AxrIUOYt","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

It&#039;s always a lie.<br><br>Every time leftist politics are implemented, we have shortages, skyrocketing prices, no opportunity, race riots, misery, non-stop crime and social upheaval. Still, all the young people run to the polls to vote for young, hip, happening leftists who make everything more expensive and difficult.<br><br>To vote, people should earn at least $35,000 per year so they are voting their interests, not for some politician to promise them free shit.<br><br>Hint: There is no free shit. If you vote for free shit, the government takes more money from you to pay for the government workers that administer the programs that give free shit to people who don&#039;t work. You always lose.<br><br>I work with in-debt millennial young people all day. They have no future and pathetic jobs and all want Hope and Change. They hate Trump and love TV comedians who have no answers, just endless insults. They love the guy whacking conservatives with a bike lock. The love Black Lies Matter.<br><br>These young people shouldn&#039;t vote. They want a leftist dictatorship so &quot;everything is free&quot;. They truly believe there is just a limited amount of wealth and it just needs to be divided up so the losers, deadbeats and addicts can sit around and enjoy life on someone else&#039;s money.<br><br>America needs a Pinochet. Someone on the political Right who will END the leftist agitators and bring peace and prosperity for a few decades. Antifa and BLM need to be erased. <br><br>How many years do you want people whacking you on the head with metal bike locks before you hand over your entire paycheck to them? <br><br>That&#039;s what they want... <br><br>Redpill me on why we shouldn&#039;t purge our leftists.","filename":"bo.jpg","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1492706869305,"time":1492706869,"md5":"w\/bQyfEbUygUMdtf3rytEg==","fsize":90993,"resto":0,"id":"\/fKYgpug","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"leftists-shouldnt-be-allowed-to-vote","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":122013103,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)12:49:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122012931\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122012931<\/a><br><br>I feel you.

I&#039;m doing fine financially, but all these young people love Obamacare.

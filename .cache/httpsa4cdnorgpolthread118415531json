But when the film came out, all the gayness came from was a two line exchange that could be easily missed. That&#039;s literally all it was.<br>It was like when Universal congratulated themselves for making Sulu gay in Star Trek: Beyond. All it was was a quick shot of Sulu with another man that happened to be his significant other.<br>I haven&#039;t seen the new Beauty and the Beast with gay LeFou, but i&#039;m sure it&#039;s the same deal.<br>This is what I really hate in movies. The studios don&#039;t make characters gay because of equality or diversity or representation or some other buzzword shit, it&#039;s because they want money. They make such a huge deal out of a small detail in the movie because when the Tumblr fangirls read about it, they&#039;re gonna go see the movie and they&#039;re gonna like it no matter what.<br>(If you don&#039;t believe me then search up Power Rangers on Tumblr. It&#039;s literally the only thing they talk about)<br>I&#039;m not upset about this because I&#039;m one of those Tumblrites that demand representation. I&#039;m upset because I see it as Product Placement for a sexuality, in a way.<br>(Speaking of product placement, I don&#039;t care if the Power Rangers do a crossover with the Avengers and Justice League. I will NEVER forgive them for that Krispy Kreme scene.)<br>You can tell it&#039;s all for the money because it&#039;s always a minor detail. If they really cared, they would&#039;ve incorporated it more into the character and story.<br><br>Bottom line, I don&#039;t care about a movie&#039;s social standing. I care about getting a good movie. And when a character&#039;s sexuality is only to help marketing, it takes away from the movie.","filename":"trini","ext":".jpg","w":462,"h":462,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490562431879,"time":1490562431,"md5":"khAIVZ6a+v\/Rvq6sBSFWbA==","fsize":43456,"resto":0,"id":"FwDhXrXA","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-upset-about-trini-being-revealed-as-gay-but","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":3,"unique_ips":9},{"no":118415792,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:08:55","name":"Anonymous","filename":"IMG_0981","ext":".gif","w":200,"h":113,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490562535742,"time":1490562535,"md5":"g1pGk3hPK+Mht6EnZbuwlg==","fsize":1345611,"resto":118415531,"id":"vomFGFiq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118415865,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:09:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118415531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118415531<\/a><br>your on pol","time":1490562568,"resto":118415531,"id":"P+wJluoq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118415961,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)17:10:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118415531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118415531<\/a><br>I think she&#039;s kinda hot.

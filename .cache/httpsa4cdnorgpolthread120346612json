McMaster is the one you should be hating on. He deceived Trump and gave him false information on Assad. Trump decided to strike Syria because of this. Assad may or may not have used chemical weapons. Either way, it shows a message that Trump does not screw around and we will be having a safe 4 years. Stop taking the black pill, ww3 is not happening *yet*. Stay calm and spread the information.

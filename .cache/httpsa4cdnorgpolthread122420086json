The Labour Party rules for the 2016 election stated that if you want to be a candidate in the leadership election you have to be nominated by 20% of Labour MPs (231) and MEPs (20). For the 2015-2017 parliament that&#039;s been 51 nominations. Jeremy very likely couldn&#039;t have achieved this, so sought to get himself put on the ballot as the incumbent which was a success.<br><br>But consider that this is a proportion of MPs and MEPs, not a fixed number.<br><br>So let&#039;s say Labour sinks down to 150 MPs, which is entirely possible. Are Jeremy then only needs 35 MPs+MEPs to nominate him to run again, 16 fewer than last time. 79 MPs\/MEPs decided not to nomination anyone last time round, many of whom would have nominated Jeremy but couldn&#039;t because he was automatically placed on the ballot as an incumbent.<br><br>So what does Labour losing shitloads of seats mean in terms of getting hard-left candidates onto the ballot? Well, if the rules do not change and the nomination procedure relies on a proportion of the PLP, it undoubtedly makes it easier. This could pave the way for Corbychev&#039;s successor. Consider who will lose their seats too. It&#039;s not going to be the Diane Abbotts and the John McDonnells of the Commons. It&#039;ll be the blairites and moderates who will lose seats in tory-lite areas, and so their grouping will have less power. Jeremy barely got 35 MPs to nominate him originally in 2015, many of whom did it just to &quot;widen the debate&quot; (read: pander to the labour gommunist wing) and then severely regretted it. If he has in any way managed to replace retiring Labour MPs in safe seats with hard leftists then he&#039;ll add to his total necessary for nomination.<br><br>tl;dr full gommunism take-over of labour incoming","time":1492954894,"resto":122420086,"id":"ini1cP0N","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122424914,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)09:42:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122424333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122424333<\/a><br>I understand that Conservatives being financially responsible is a meme and have successfully pinned every negative effect of 2008 on Labour ever since.","time":1492954925,"resto":122420086,"id":"G4JhIEFb","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122424936,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)09:42:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122422838\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122422838<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;17<\/span><br><br>Fucking christ how much of a skeltal are you?<br><br>I&#039;m 5&quot;6&#039; and 8st 4lbs and even i&#039;m at 18.7 BMI.

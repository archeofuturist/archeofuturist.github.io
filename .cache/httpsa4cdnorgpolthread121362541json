Trump is a vehicle for our ideas- a useful idiot, you could say. We used a variety of methods to bring people on board, but those methods are no longer needed. It&#039;s time to transition away from Trump support, including memes.<br> <br>We will be part of the chorus of voices that opposes Trump, even if that means forging alliances with those who we would normally oppose. Expect to see big news coming soon on this subject.<br><br>The Alt Right are and will be the ones doing the actual 4D chess around here. <br>Striking the Assad government is a major wrong that cannot be forgiven. Assad is a natural ally to our movement, and to Russia, therefore we must keep hands off. The same goes for any interference in Ukraine. We should discourage any increases in defense spending or expansion of capabilities.<br><br>The Alt Right has an obligation to get frank with Trump and misguided Trump supporters when he digs us deeper into a hole- he&#039;s not our guy, and we have an obligation to shut him down whenever possible. We need to make this clear in tweets and on the streets.<br>It&#039;s time to wake up. And it&#039;s the Alt Right&#039;s job to do the waking. <br>\/pol\/ has an important role to play. Continue to shut down pro-Trump rhetoric, especially Trump General threads. Mock and drive away Trump supporters, and steer the conversation into criticism of Trump, and American imperialism in general.","filename":"RS_TRSad3","ext":".jpg","w":587,"h":602,"tn_w":243,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492352287414,"time":1492352287,"md5":"HPoelPw0sTK2xt\/VIGJ1sQ==","fsize":198705,"resto":0,"id":"K4lE+uL5","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"guidance-for-the-alt-right","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

It appears that someone cut this segment from a re-release of the episode.<br><br>In the clip reported on by The Federalist, pulled from the January 19, 1996 episode of the series, a young woman explains that \u201cinside each of our cells are these things called chromosomes, and they control whether we become a boy or a girl.\u201d She goes on to explain how we all receive sex chromosomes from both parents, leading to a fertilized egg\u2019s 50\/50 chance of being a boy or a girl.<br><br>This clashes directly with Nye\u2019s current feelings on sex: in a recent episode of his new Netflix series, \u201cBill Nye Saves the World,\u201d Nye claims that the \u201cmale and female\u201d binary is \u201cmore like a kaleidoscope.\u201d Instead of the simple XX and XY combinations, Nye asserts that \u201cwe see more combinations than that in real life.\u201d<br><br>\u201cWhat makes someone male or female,\u201d Nye says, \u201cisn\u2019t so clear-cut.\u201d<br><br>Nye\u2019s evolution on the subject of biological sex is roughly in line with that of standard progressive gender ideology, which is hardly surprising\u2014Nye has become something of a progressive spokesman. What is shocking, however, is that Nye or someone else appears to have gone back and censored the episode of \u201cBill Nye the Science Guy\u201d that featured the original chromosome segment.<br><br>On Netflix\u2019s collection of episodes of \u201cBill Nye,\u201d the 23rd episode, entitled \u201cProbability,\u201d is identical to that which originally aired in 1996\u2014except that the segment on sex and chromosomes has been excised completely. The episode offers no explanation whatsoever. The show simply moves from the segment immediately prior the deleted clip to the segment immediately following it<br><br>https:\/\/archive.fo\/1yQzA<br><br>https:\/\/thefederalist.com\/2017\/05\/0<wbr>2\/bill-nye-censor-transgender-ideol<wbr>ogy\/<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M5z<wbr>9s_bimnw","filename":"Bill_Nye_the_Cucked_Guy","ext":".jpg","w":1832,"h":1716,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":234,"tim":1493787343634,"time":1493787343,"md5":"3zh6+SSGDpz3tL1BpncAMg==","fsize":829863,"resto":0,"id":"busFcl3u","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"signal-boost-this-dont-let-them-win","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

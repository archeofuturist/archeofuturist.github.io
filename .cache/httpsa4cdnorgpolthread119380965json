In fact, to apply under the Federal Skilled Workers program, you need to have either a Canadian degree or get your foreign degree assessed for it&#039;s equivalence and credibility by the CIC. While there are Indian cardiologists driving cabs, that has more to do with the highly limited number of residency spots available for foreign medical graduates. It still doesn&#039;t prevent many professions from having a lot of foreigners involved. There really aren&#039;t that many MSc&#039;s driving cabs. <br><br><a href=\"#p119386773\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119386773<\/a><br>I actually do think that America has an immigration problem. For the past couple of decades you&#039;ve had an unprecedented deluge of migrants from Latin America, legal and illegal. Thankfully, because of our geography, we don&#039;t have the same problems. I think many leafs on \/pol\/ mistakenly assume that Canada has similar immigration issues to Europe or America because they see a lot of chinks when they go downtown. The difference is that we&#039;re highly selective and we can be, whereas Europe is getting hordes of young men. Hordes of young men from any country is going to be bad news because young men are the most violent and crime-prone demographic by far, let alone young men from low-trust societies.<br><br>Because we have a pretty boy who says nice things on Twitter as our leader, people assume we have a generous immigration policy, when we don&#039;t. We&#039;ve never taken in more immigrants per year than there have been Canadians born in the same year. Most of the Mexican migrants who tried to come here after their visa requirements were removed have found that they&#039;ve spent thousands of their own dollars to be rejected and deported. If the Canadian immigration system were marketed by a conservative in another country, it would likely be met with uproar from liberals, and praise from conservatives. Instead, we have a liberal populace that thinks we&#039;re international heroes with our immigration policy, and a bunch of misinformed leafs who think that we&#039;re Sweden.","time":1491257332,"resto":119380965,"id":"JJ0nwLYp","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119388863,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)18:14:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119387850\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119387850<\/a><br>I&#039;d rather not, and I think it would be silly if I was forced to leave. For one, I was born here in Canada, and for another, Canada has spent a considerable amount of resources on my education and training. I&#039;m about to enter the workforce as a physician now and start paying back what I owe the country for the opportunities it&#039;s given me, so if you send me &quot;back&quot; now, you won&#039;t get any of the returns on that investment. At any rate, I&#039;m culturally Canadian and whenever I visit the so-called mothership, I just think, &quot;this place is fucking weird.&quot; English is my native tongue, and I learned French because I think it&#039;s important to learn both official languages. I don&#039;t speak my parent&#039;s language well, in fact, my Spanish is better.","time":1491257672,"resto":119380965,"id":"JJ0nwLYp","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]}

part is that communists,<br> the ones who truly believe the idea can work arnt totally incorrect. There are few economic systems that won&#039;t work in an ideal society of a righteous and perfectly moral society. When you plan an economic system you can&#039;t simply design a system that will function properly, macro economics should be 70% and 30% psychology. The perfect system to me is a modified system of capitalism that heavily deters illmoral of selfish actions. Off topic from the rest of the post soft of but I&#039;ve truly come to believe that no group or single individual should reach a point of excessive wealth. I think a billion asset and cash total would go a long way to support a more moral society","time":1491737840,"resto":120270439,"id":"QpOhSzza","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120273447,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)07:37:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120273269\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120273269<\/a><br>He said &quot;great and\/or significant figures in history&quot;.","time":1491737845,"resto":120270439,"id":"yke61dF2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120273768,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)07:41:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120273088\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120273088<\/a><br>literally over 95% of the population is smaller than 190 cm<br>obviously the number of tall leaders and famous people will me much much less than the manlets","time":1491738095,"resto":120270439,"id":"2O4Vd4hw","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":120274022,"now":"04\/09\/17(Sun)07:44:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120270439\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120270439<\/a><br>lenin was a manlet as well","time":1491738287,"resto":120270439,"id":"Y60yLBp9","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"}]}

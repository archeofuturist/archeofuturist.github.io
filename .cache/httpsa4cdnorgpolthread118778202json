Rent in Riga is anywhere from 250-400 Euros a month, all included, depending on if you live alone or share a flat<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Are the women good?<\/span><br><br>Latvian women are pretty awesome. They&#039;ve got your standard Northern European beauty, but with much less degenerate values. Are generally quite traditional and loyal, liked to be treated like ladies, but also laugh at feminism and generally have no time for that shit<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What are the jobs like?<\/span><br><br>Sallaries in Latvia really arn&#039;t that good by EU standards, are a bit better than in Russia so you do have some Ivans coming here to work. If you&#039;re a forienger though you can make a bit more, especially with good English language skills, usually starting around 1000 Euros a month<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How is the food?<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Latvian food is really good. I&#039;m German, so it&#039;s quite similar in many ways. Have some awesome dairy products here. The food here is about as expensive in Germany, but the quality is better (excepting some meat products though)<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How is the internet?<\/span><br><br>Latvia has some of the fastest internet in Europe, and there is a lot of free wifi spots in Riga<br><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Where are you from originally, what do you like the most about Latvia, and what do you miss the most about your old country?<\/span><br><br>I&#039;m from Germany. I like how they&#039;ve preserved their traditions and culture in Latvia, promote them are are willing to defend them as well. I also like how they havn&#039;t been brainwashed with all of this liberal shit that we have in western Europe. I also like that there is space, because in Germany it can get a bit crowded at times. Riga also has a super German feel to it. And of course, Latvia is 98% white.<br><br>I miss the beer in Germany (Latvian beer is really good too, but there is nothing like a good Bavarian Hefeweizen Beer for me). I do miss the langauge as well, but there some Latvians that speak really good German here as well.","time":1490790404,"resto":118778202,"id":"t4f5mGUd","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":118780665,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:28:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118780528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118780528<\/a><br>Sorry about the green text, didn&#039;t used to post a lot on pol before due to fear of getting in trouble with Mutti Merkel for my &#039;illegal opinions&#039;","time":1490790502,"resto":118778202,"id":"t4f5mGUd","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"},{"no":118781144,"now":"03\/29\/17(Wed)08:33:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118780528\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118780528<\/a><br>Sounds pretty good.

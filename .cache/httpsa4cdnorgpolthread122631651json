On another note I often hear posters from European countries talking about the US&#039; degeneracy, we used to have TV specials about commercials from Europe that were &quot;too hot for American TV&quot; that included tons of nudity and various sexual situations. We still don&#039;t have nudity in commercials here in the states, only suggestive things are implied. Can that meme die?

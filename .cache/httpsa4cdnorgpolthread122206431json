Within one thousand years after he had gotten there he was on all fours, couldn&#039;t stand upright. You watch an old cracker today. Crackers don&#039;t walk upright like black people do. Every time you look at them, they&#039;re about to go down on all fours. But those who have had some education, they straighten up a little bit because they&#039;re taught how to straighten up. But a black man can be the most dumb, illiterate thing you can find anywhere, and he still walks like a million dollars because by nature he&#039;s upright, by nature he stands up. But a white man has to be stood up. You have to put a white man on the square. But the black is born on the square.<br>Can we prove it? Yes. You notice in the East, dark people carry things on their heads, don&#039;t they? Just throw it up there and walk with it, showing you they have perfect poise, perfect balance. It just comes natural to them. You and I lost our poise. We, you, can&#039;t even wear a hat on your head, hardly, today [chuckle]. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that within one thousand years after the white people were up in the caves they were on all fours. And they were living in the outdoors where it&#039;s cold, just as cold over there as it is outside right now. They didn&#039;t have clothes. So by being out there in the cold their hair got longer and longer. Hair grew all over their bodies. By being on all fours, the end of their spine begin to grow. They grew a little tail that came out from the end of their spine...Oh yes, this was the white man, brother, up in the caves of Europe. He had a tail that long. You ever notice that anything that walks on all fours has a tail? That which straightens up doesn&#039;t have a tail, because when you get down, you see, you just make that spine come right on out. And just like a dog, he was crawling around up there.","time":1492819781,"resto":122206431,"id":"ZGOp70bD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122207000,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)20:09:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"He was hairy as a dog. He had a tail like a dog. He had a smell like a dog. And nothing could get along with him but another dog. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad says that all the beasts up in Europe wanted to kill the white man. Yeah, they tried to kill the white man. They were after the white man. They hated the white man. So, he says, what the white man would do, he&#039;d dig a hole in the hill, that was his cave. And his mother and his daughter and his wife would all be in there with the dog. The only thing that made friends with the white man was the dog. Everything else hated him. He&#039;d sit outside of the cave at night in a tree with rocks in his hand, and if any beast came up and tried to get in the cave at his family, he&#039;d throw rocks at it, or he&#039;d have a club that he&#039;d swing down and try to drive it away with it. But the dog stayed in the cave with his family. It was then that the dog and the white man amalgamated. The white woman went with the dog while they were living in the caves of Europe. And right to this very day the white woman will tell you there is nothing she loves better than a dog. They tell you that a dog is a man&#039;s best friend. They lived in that cave with those dogs and right now they got that dog smell. They got that dog...they are dog lovers. A dog can get in a white man&#039;s house and eat at his table, lick out of his plate. They&#039;ll kiss the dog right on the nose and think nothing of it. You&#039;re not a dog kisser. You don&#039;t see black people kissing or rubbing noses with dogs. But little white children will hug dogs and kiss dogs and eat with dogs. Am Iright or wrong? You -- all have been inside their kitchens cooling their food, and making their beds, you know how they live. The dog will live right in the white man&#039;s house, better than you can; you try and break your way in there and they&#039;ll put a rope around your neck [chuckle], but the dog has got free run of the whole house.

The name of that prophet was Moses. Moses never went down into Egypt. Moses went into the caves of Europe and civilized the white man. It was Moses who raised the devil from a dead level to a perpendicular and placed him on the square. Moses taught the white man how to cook his food. Moses taught the white man how to build a house for himself. He taught the white man also some of the tricknology that Yacub had originally meant for him, and it was Moses who put the white man back on the road toward civilization. He told him that he was supposed to rule for six thousand years, but that much of the time had already been lost, and at the end of time one would come who would destroy the whole white race. Moses taught them this. And this is why when the Jews, two thousand years later, were looking for the Messiah, they thought that Jesus was the Messiah and they put him to death because they knew when the Messiah came he was going to destroy that whole race of devils. The Jews knew this, so they put him to death thinking that they could stop him from destroying them. But actually, they made a mistake because Jesus two thousand years ago wasn&#039;t the Messiah. Their time wasn&#039;t up two thousand years ago. Their time would not be up until two thousand years later, the day and time that we&#039;re living in right now.","time":1492819814,"resto":122206431,"id":"ZGOp70bD","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122207058,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)20:10:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"So, brothers and sisters, my time has expired. I just wanted to point out that the white man, a race of devils, was made six thousand years ago. This doesn&#039;t mean to tell you that this implies any kind of hate. They&#039;re just a race of devils. They were made six thousand years ago, they were made to rule for six thousand years, and their time expired in the year 19914. The only reason God didn&#039;t remove them then was because you and I were here in their clutches and God gave them an extension of time -- not them an extension of time, but they received an extension of time to give the wise men of the East the opportunity to get into this House of Bondage and &quot;awaken&quot; the Lost Sheep. Once the American so-called Negroes have been awakened to a knowledge of themselves and of their own God and of the white man, then they&#039;re on their own. Then it&#039;ll be left up to you and me whether we want to integrate into this wicked race or leave them and separate and go to our own. And if we integrate we&#039;ll be destroyed along with them.

In real science, it is a theory about changes. In popular science, it is a fact about improvements. Thus a real scientist like Professor J.B.S. Haldane is at pains to point out that popular ideas of Evolution lay a wholly unjustified emphasis on those changes which have rendered creatures (by human standards) \u2018better\u2019 or more interesting. He adds, \u2018We are therefore inclined to regard progress as the rule in evolution. Actually it is the exception, and for every case of it there are ten of degeneration.\u2019 (&quot;Darwinism Today, Possible Worlds, p.28.) But the Myth simply expurgates the ten cases of degeneration. In the popular mind the word \u2018Evolution\u2019 conjures up a picture of things moving \u2018onward and upwards\u2019, and of nothing else whatsoever. And it might have been predicted that it would do so. Already, before science had spoken, the mythical imagination knew the kind of \u2018Evolution\u2019 it wanted. It wanted the Keatsian and Wagnerian kind: the gods superseding the Titans, and the young, joyous, careless, amorous Siegfried superseding the care-worn, anxious, treaty-entangled Wotan. If science offers any instances to satisfy that demand, they will be eagerly accepted. If it offers any instances that frustrate it, they will simply be ignored.","time":1493863539,"resto":123990057,"id":"yRkr2rxF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124002207,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:08:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124001703\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124001703<\/a><br>moron","time":1493863685,"resto":123990057,"id":"mh27\/wq+","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":124002213,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:08:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123990057\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123990057<\/a><br>This thread made me so angry so I had to jump out of my bed, take my camera and some old soviet lens just to make this picture","filename":"proof_of_bullshit","ext":".jpg","w":1440,"h":2944,"tn_w":61,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493863686195,"time":1493863686,"md5":"Zghj8oYVLWp7vjuAJn2ATA==","fsize":342439,"resto":123990057,"id":"X9BUF+Ha","country":"PL","m_img":1,"country_name":"Poland"},{"no":124002225,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:08:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123996288\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123996288<\/a><br>They are so fucking out of focus, you can see the infrastructure of the telescope.<br><br><a href=\"#p123996772\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123996772<\/a><br>Amateur=\\= not real<br><br>Amateurs in astronomy are actually able to contribute to the actual science.<br><br>Hale-Bopp was found by two amateurs.","time":1493863691,"resto":123990057,"id":"yRVybdyh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124002674,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)22:11:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124002213\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124002213<\/a><br>Thank you.

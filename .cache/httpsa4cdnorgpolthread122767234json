Never seem political, just be a friendly co-worker, as normie as possible. Get people to like you. When you bring up anything regarding your agenda (which I probably agree with you on most of) do it in a way that is utterly harmless and subtle. Phrase everything as a question like &quot;I really wonder how well the migrants will immigrate when there is so much dogma in Islam&quot; or &quot;how are they going to learn computer programming when they cannot read or write and have shell shock?&quot; Or &quot;why so many military age males?&quot; That flag is Estonia, right? so... I doubt Muslim refugees are much of a problem there. My point is that if you want to red pill normies. Just get them to like you,don&#039;t seem clearly political, ever. Many people are &quot;programmed&quot; to hate politics, one side or in general. Be really subtle and friendly and never show any hate. You&#039;ll have most of the office agreeing with you. At least in small group or one on one conversation. Also don&#039;t bring up topics too much unprovoked.

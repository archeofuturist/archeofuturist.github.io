It&#039;s what they did with Benghazi, it&#039;s what they did with the emails, it&#039;s what they did with the debate questions and it&#039;s what they&#039;re trying again. The Rice scandal is different because it involves both sides of the aisle. They have to address it or they&#039;re effectively giving Trump the go ahead to spy on his political enemies too. So instead of letting them worm their way out of the scandal to address it later, we need to keep the outrage going until they&#039;re forced to acknowledge the severity of what&#039;s been going on. <br><br>We need Rice general threads, we need fuck CNN threads, we need meme creation threads and twitter campaign threads. Make a thread until the shills can&#039;t handle them all.

People with conservative views tend to be people who are prone to fear and distrust. People with liberal views tend to be idealists: they want to believe they can trust everyone. So, if something strange happens, a conservative is more likely to find it suspicious and research it, while a liberal is more likely to roll their eyes and ignore it, assuming it&#039;s fine. That&#039;s not to say liberals are incapable of being conspiracy theorists. I think the past year has shown they are quite capable of it.<br><br>The thing about conspiracy theories is that the term itself has become an insult in the mind of the general populace. This is actually pretty scary if you think about it; one of two problems existing currently related to the term. A conspiracy theory is simply the idea that some person or persons are secretly conspiring with one another. If your neighbor sold pink flamingo lawn ornaments for a living and you saw him talking to some shady-looking teenagers not from the neighborhood, and later that week everyone&#039;s pink flamingo lawn ornaments disappeared, to think those teenagers stole everyone&#039;s flamingos so your neighbor would be able to make money off everyone trying to replace them would be a conspiracy theory. There is no concrete evidence, but is it truly unreasonable to think there&#039;s a possibility? Everyone is ultimately looking to get ahead in life. Are people in power immune to this? Or are they not the primary benefactors of events that allow them to retain or gain even more power? Could you blame them if they were? Obviously not, so why is it impossible?<br><br>People who try to brand others as conspiracy theorists to deflect anyone from listening to them are not only making themselves look suspicious, but they&#039;re advocating ignorance; they&#039;re telling others to accept all suspicious activity as innocent, which violates one&#039;s own sense of self-preservation, especially when it&#039;s conducted by people with power.","time":1490587585,"resto":118450471,"id":"0Gk8Ycfe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118469012,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:08:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"It&#039;s basically just pattern recognition unbound by logic, which is actually a sign of high IQ, at least a lot of the Mason\/Illuminati type conspiracies. 9\/11 truthers and muh aliens kind of stuff is just retards","time":1490587696,"resto":118450471,"id":"0ACpOrCk","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118469590,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:14:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118450471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118450471<\/a><br>In my 41 yrs, I&#039;ve learned that conspiracy theory + 20 yrs = accepted fact.<br><br>..and nobody ever apologizes to the conspiracy theorists","time":1490588058,"resto":118450471,"id":"yRZ4u7nG","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118469661,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:15:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118468170\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118468170<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;zerohedge<\/span>","filename":"dick","ext":".png","w":420,"h":160,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":47,"tim":1490588103798,"time":1490588103,"md5":"01f4e8xxvolVAUzrUzAvsA==","fsize":24306,"resto":118450471,"id":"8QMWIjde","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"},{"no":118469731,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:15:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118469661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118469661<\/a><br>Not an argument.","time":1490588143,"resto":118450471,"id":"7YTv5dfr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118469939,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:17:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Let me spell it out for you guys.<br><br>The Russia story has so much evidence behind it that the FBI was willing to pay Christopher Steele to continue his work.<br><br>Meanwhile, pizzagate was immediately debunked by law enforcement and all rational news organizations.

However, smart right wingers can see the left wing bias and occasional lies that they mold the message with. This opens up right wingers to question a wide range of falsehoods they have seen on the media and in the classroom, and then make the conclusion that, well if the left is lying about the hacking, maybe they are lying about the moon landing, or some other conspiracy theory. <br><br>As bad as we have it in America, other countries are even more into their conspiracy theories. Particularly countries with corrupt state controlled media, like for instance, Saddam era Iraq. Nobody believed a word his government said practically, and they were rife with conspiracy theories as a result, to the point of the X Files being the favorite western television show, and was viewed as if most of the shows premise was real. <br><br>Personally, I can&#039;t buy into conspiracy theories, not out of blind trust in authority, but out of my understanding of human nature. We are horrible at keeping secrets. Two examples from US history point this out more than any other. After victory in WWII, we couldn&#039;t keep our most precious secrets from our commie rivals, see the Rosenbergs. The other example is the Monica Lewinski scandal. Three people couldn&#039;t keep secret the most powerful man in the world getting slobbed on in the Whitehouse. This is not abnormal, this is human nature. So when I hear of conspiracies that involve hundreds of people keeping a secret, I tend to dismiss automatically.","time":1490590179,"resto":118450471,"id":"mgJ0mCAo","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118473477,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:53:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118473119\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118473119<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Personally, I can&#039;t buy into conspiracy theories, not out of blind trust in authority, but out of my understanding of human nature.

Though we once regarded Christ in this way, we do so no longer. 17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come:[a] The old has gone, the new is here! 18 All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: 19 that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people\u2019s sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation. 20 We are therefore Christ\u2019s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ\u2019s behalf: Be reconciled to God. 21 God made him who had no sin to be sin[b] for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.","time":1492037783,"resto":120813447,"id":"EugRLLcY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120825319,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)18:56:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120824001\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120824001<\/a><br>The cited scripture speaks volumes, for every article therein the word of God mirrors every other word therein.

I&#039;m not trying to start shit, it&#039;s just I don&#039;t know a lot on this topic and whenever you hear someone speaking out against immigration, there&#039;s always someone there to shut them down by basically saying that Americans should feel empathy for immigrants because many were immigrants themselves. That since we were allowed to come here for a chance to make a better life, that everyone and everyone should be allowed to do the same.

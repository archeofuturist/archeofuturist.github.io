In Serbia they house Serbs, in Japan the Japanese, and us Kekistanis? No. Our people have been kicked around by the normies for far to long. No man nor NEET of conscious may turn a blind eye to our struggle of independence. When they say \u201cban,\u201d when they say \u201ccensor,\u201d when they say \u201cNazi,\u201d you say \u201cRRREEEEEE\u201d and stand your ground! We didn\u2019t choose the meme war but if it\u2019s the will of Kek we fight for our right to be a people then in the name of Kek we will! AND WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER!<br> War is not our motive we\u2019re a people of peace. But when the normies decry our dank memes and attempt to degrade all or ancestors worked for with plebbit memes we are left no choice. Are we, my fellow Kekistanis, willing to see our memes be degraded and vandalized by the army of limp-wristed cucks who threaten our very right to exsist. They think we\u2019ll rollover when they call out \u201cNEET\u201d or \u201cBasement Dweller.\u201d We say NO to your stereotypes and epithets. We say NO to your hatred of our noble culture.<br> Our values are principled our right to exist derived from Kek, our saviour, our memes are dank and our posts are shit. Our country, our beloved homeland, is a model for humanity. Where, I ask you, could an An-Cap and a National Socialist join together under the same banner and sing with pride our anthem Shadily? Where? Certainly in no normie country I know of.<br> Kekistanis - shitposters, LARPERs, An-Caps, Stormfags, NEETs, Alphas and Betas - we are united under Kek and the banner of Kekistan. The normie wants to keep you down. WITH EVERY INCH YOU MARCH UNTIL YOUR LAST BREATH REMEMBER THE CALL OF OUR PEOPLE \u201cRRRRREEEEEEEE NORMIES GET OUT!\u201d<br> Never forget the dream of a homeland. Only through our own labor and determination will we prosper. Praise Kek!","filename":"He+s+obviously+one+of+the+proud+kekistani+people+_87a7df28ca42d2fc735c00b1408aaab0","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":563,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491663621545,"time":1491663621,"md5":"H\/qgBrLMdQargZlwVaMnQQ==","fsize":67474,"resto":0,"id":"tndTgi3p","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-declaration-for-a-homeland-from-the-stateless","country_name":"United States","replies":7,"images":2,"unique_ips":8},{"no":120141670,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)11:13:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"praise KEK<br><br>death to the normies","time":1491664410,"resto":120140361,"id":"cwYQunBW","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":120142255,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)11:19:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Check this shit m80s","time":1491664744,"resto":120140361,"id":"5T386bNY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120142487,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)11:21:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120142255\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120142255<\/a><br>Oh fugg","time":1491664888,"resto":120140361,"id":"YCBtKuvu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120142644,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)11:22:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120142255\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120142255<\/a><br>well played<br><br>Praise him!","time":1491664976,"resto":120140361,"id":"uenDinoZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120142677,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)11:23:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120140361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120140361<\/a><br><a href=\"#p120141670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120141670<\/a><br>Enough with this &quot;\/pol\/ identity&quot; faggotry you fucking redditors.<br><br>That flag is this board&#039;s ginger Tomoko and you all know what happened.","time":1491665001,"resto":120140361,"id":"Y3sI\/G1R","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":120143371,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)11:29:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120140361\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120140361<\/a><br>I want reddit to leave","filename":"1453664954957","ext":".jpg","w":514,"h":536,"tn_w":119,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491665380012,"time":1491665380,"md5":"gHmYhZ2vtekD8VajsDneJQ==","fsize":32574,"resto":120140361,"id":"aLTQseI3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120143562,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)11:31:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"Zozzle &gt; kek<br>#FreeZozzlestan","filename":"Zozzle","ext":".png","w":2133,"h":1281,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":75,"tim":1491665491695,"time":1491665491,"md5":"OnD0etK89VoUrRWWc4dI1Q==","fsize":120519,"resto":120140361,"id":"JOaYSNuS","country":"LV","country_name":"Latvia"}]}

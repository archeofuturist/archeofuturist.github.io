However, Hillary Clinton is a woman and feminist slogan generator, so the SJW far-left got behind her early. Meanwhile, the new anti-identity politics center-left got behind Bernie as a reaction against SJWs and because Bernie better represents actual left-wing ideals (especially on fiscal and foreign policy). So basically, the center-left now appeals to the far-left and the far-left now appeals to the center-left.","filename":"wewouldbothbebadforUS","ext":".jpg","w":1180,"h":842,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":178,"tim":1493488789770,"time":1493488789,"md5":"CbHJhAhWAZsNdKBNXnE72A==","fsize":75732,"resto":0,"id":"uY66fqS8","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-centerleft-and-farleft-have-switched-places","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

When I got there it was the usual cigarette butts in the toilets and ashes on the floor. This time though a couple students where cutting class and smoking marijuana in the bathroom.<br><br>At first they tried to hide it but then realizing it was too late they asked me if I wanted to smoke. Obviously a joke since I don&#039;t associate myself with the scumbag stoner group in school. I replied with a witty remark I once heard on a anti-drug program we watched in health class. &quot;I can&#039;t get high I don&#039;t have a pilot&#039;s license,&quot; I said.<br><br>I then stormed out of the bathroom and straight to the principals office to inform him that people are smoking marijuana in the bathroom.<br><br>You marijuana smokers disgust me. You all listen to shitty classic rock and smell like garbage. I never see any of you with any nice looking girls. They are just a bunch of dirty junkies like you guys.","filename":"no marijuana","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":1000,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492749669453,"time":1492749669,"md5":"5OeasKeRWZkNRNzVOHrs5g==","fsize":105262,"resto":0,"id":"XpvzYgE3","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"earlier-during-class-i-excused-myself-to-go-use","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":122097460,"now":"04\/21\/17(Fri)00:46:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"nice blog post","time":1492749993,"resto":122096939,"id":"qpnLuJ83","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

Large amounts of dietary sugar are extremely unhealthy and addictive, much like the other substances described, and yet almost no government action is taken against the sugar industry.<br><br>The sugar lobby exists yes, but so does the tobacco lobby and action was still taken against it. Why don&#039;t we take actions like banning advertising of sugary foods a la tobacco, maybe taxing sugar more, trying to replace sugar with stevia, limit the amount of added sugar in products, etc.?<br><br>Sugar is possibly the largest contributor to obesity, and by taking such actions we could universally improve our countries by decreasing obesity and healthcare costs while improving general health and happiness.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":1080,"h":1236,"tn_w":218,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492092244750,"time":1492092244,"md5":"WIsMBqGDlgrWsN042OktlQ==","fsize":217171,"resto":0,"id":"vFE0hEgj","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"taking-on-the-sugar-industry","country_name":"United States","replies":14,"images":0,"unique_ips":11},{"no":120913037,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:06:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;addictive<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;hurr durr It&#039;s not my fault I can&#039;t stop eating<\/span><br>Neck yourself you fat fuck","time":1492092401,"resto":120912780,"id":"aNB7fXSU","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120913081,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:07:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120912780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120912780<\/a><br>wtf i love nanny states now","time":1492092436,"resto":120912780,"id":"LE+XQN9y","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120913105,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:07:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120912780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120912780<\/a><br>jews<br><a href=\"#p120913037\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120913037<\/a><br>lardass detected","time":1492092452,"resto":120912780,"id":"PrXK0HeH","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":120913109,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)10:07:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120912780\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120912780<\/a><br><br>No. We do not need to regulate FOOD.<br><br>We need to improve our education system.

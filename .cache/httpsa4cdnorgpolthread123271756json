He would have you lot have him walk up to the window at sunset and sunrise every day. Wouldn&#039;t that have been a glorious thing? For people to come see Assange, twice a day? That would be a magnet for tourism, good will and exposure. <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;He is not Justin Beibor, and he is not in the UK to make their economy thrive. To even say that makes me think you must be about 12 years old, a female or a liberal. <\/span><br><br><br>But wait, you argument is why would he do it even once, cause he&#039;d be forced to never stop? <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;it was a body double, he had a wonky eye<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2 weeks later: he is compromised again, spelling mistake in his tweet, we demand to see you at the window again.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;never ending cycle <\/span><br><br>He hasn&#039;t appeared once since this started! Don&#039;t pull that shit.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Yes he has. Learn the subject before debating it. <\/span><br><br>If there is such a risk that he&#039;d be killed he can&#039;t even appear in the window, I don&#039;t see whats stopping them from rushing the embassy? Or poisoning him? <br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the UK government is spending millions per year guarding him. He is completely surrounded and under surveillance 24\/7 it would be impossible and is seen as an act of war against said country to attack an embassy <\/span><br><br><br>And by killing him you would trigger the deadman switch, which is kinda the reason he is presumably still alive<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;yes he is alive in the embassy, whilst having visits from family, friends etc on a weekly basis. <\/span><br><br><br>You actually no fuck all about Assange and you are a shill.

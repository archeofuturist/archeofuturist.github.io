The best way to explain this is to imagine what sort of morale code a slave would have.<br><br>&quot;Turn the Other cheek&quot; is a plead not to attack your aggressor because your entire peoples lives are at stake if you do. The very idea of &quot;I&#039;m might be losing in life but I&#039;ll go to heaven in the afterlife and you&#039;ll go to hell&quot; is a slave morality, but it fatalistically revokes any need to change your lot in life because in a slaves world there is no hope to escape it in life, therefore conform because you&#039;ll win in the next life.<br><br>This makes a lot of since for Jews, because for the majority of their existence they&#039;ve been living in other peoples lands, often having to appease a nations customs (of course until they seize power)<br><br>Islam has elements of slave morality because it&#039;s obviously based on a Judaeo element, but it has a lot of shit basically designed to aggressively assault non-believers.","time":1492050154,"resto":120847132,"id":"v0xE\/kQc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120852764,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)22:23:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120852026\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120852026<\/a><br>Fucking this.

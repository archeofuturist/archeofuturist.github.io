But with the expectation of that stable, profit-maximizing cash flow, the companies (hundreds of them working every day) are easily willing to invest in the best doctors, trials, QC in the world.","filename":"kram","ext":".png","w":315,"h":318,"tn_w":123,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490970798528,"time":1490970798,"md5":"0d2\/tK3hYyW0G5MUJI7v+Q==","fsize":185089,"resto":119058263,"id":"p9OrZ+ax","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119061054,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:33:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119058898\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119058898<\/a><br><br>Half of your youth is unemployed. <br><br>I don&#039;t get how a Spaniard of all people acts all smug about his economy.","time":1490970801,"resto":119058263,"id":"7Vu+2DrZ","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":119061077,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:33:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119060871\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119060871<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119060867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119060867<\/a><br>We are fundamental Christians, and if you aren&#039;t then you&#039;re an ignorant bastard that swallowed the kike pill.<br><br>She also makes more money than both of you combined while working from home because The Lord has blessed her business and her house.","time":1490970815,"resto":119058263,"id":"n36P8mOr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119061128,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:34:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119060867\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119060867<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119060871\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119060871<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119060975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119060975<\/a><br>You fell for some shit bait.","time":1490970858,"resto":119058263,"id":"fGRt\/BTq","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119061139,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)10:34:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119060984\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119060984<\/a><br>People are.

To get drugs approved (even drugs that are already known to be safe) it costs several hundred million dollars and years of inspections and approval steps. The FDA not only has to approve your drug, but approve the manufacturing facilities and methods. If I came out with a synthetic pathway to make all drugs cheaper by 50%, it would probably not be economically worth it given the massive amount of money required to get alternate synthetic pathways approved.

Kennedy who was Roosevelt\u2019s Ambassador to Great Britain in the years immediately before the war]. I asked him about his conversations with Roosevelt and Neville Chamberlain from 1938 on. He said Chamberlain\u2019s position in 1938 was that England had nothing with which to fight and that she could not risk going to war with Hitler. Kennedy\u2019s view: That Hitler would have fought Russia without any later conflict with England if it had not been for Bullitt\u2019s [William C. Bullitt, then Ambassador to France] urging on Roosevelt in the summer of 1939 that the Germans must be faced down about Poland; neither the French nor the British would have made Poland a cause of war if it had not been for the constant needling from Washington. Bullitt, he said, kept telling Roosevelt that the Germans wouldn\u2019t fight, Kennedy that they would, and that they would overrun Europe. Chamberlain, he says, stated that America and the world Jews had forced England into the war. In his telephone conversation with Roosevelt in the summer of 1939 the President kept telling him to put some iron up Chamberlain\u2019s backside Kennedy\u2019s response always was that putting iron up his backside did no good unless the British had some iron with which to fight, and they did not.&quot; Diary of James Forrestal, Dec 27th, 1945","time":1492421613,"resto":121503902,"id":"yC5yhlqk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121506189,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:34:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121505737\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121505737<\/a><br>Because he let his generals decide","time":1492421663,"resto":121503902,"id":"ZiuMZ75O","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":121506231,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:35:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121506063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121506063<\/a><br>france and england declared war on germany","time":1492421701,"resto":121503902,"id":"mP4mV620","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121506287,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:35:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121505797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121505797<\/a><br>If you seriously think killing white people and letting jews infiltrate your goverment is better than an authoritarian state that survives without the international banking system, you must be totally retarded.","time":1492421741,"resto":121503902,"id":"Io812NtW","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121506290,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:35:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121506231\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121506231<\/a><br>Doesn&#039;t change the fact that he invade them.","time":1492421747,"resto":121503902,"id":"K3qNobmt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121506319,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:36:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121505295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121505295<\/a><br>IN","time":1492421776,"resto":121503902,"id":"LJ\/nmpSP","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121506327,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:36:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121506063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121506063<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121506078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121506078<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121506120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121506120<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hitler clearly wanted to take over the world guys<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Look at how he went to war with us after France and England declared war on him and dragged their subjects into it<\/span><br>Your argument is poor.

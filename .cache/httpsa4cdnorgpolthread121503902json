Kennedy who was Roosevelt\u2019s Ambassador to Great Britain in the years immediately before the war]. I asked him about his conversations with Roosevelt and Neville Chamberlain from 1938 on. He said Chamberlain\u2019s position in 1938 was that England had nothing with which to fight and that she could not risk going to war with Hitler. Kennedy\u2019s view: That Hitler would have fought Russia without any later conflict with England if it had not been for Bullitt\u2019s [William C. Bullitt, then Ambassador to France] urging on Roosevelt in the summer of 1939 that the Germans must be faced down about Poland; neither the French nor the British would have made Poland a cause of war if it had not been for the constant needling from Washington. Bullitt, he said, kept telling Roosevelt that the Germans wouldn\u2019t fight, Kennedy that they would, and that they would overrun Europe. Chamberlain, he says, stated that America and the world Jews had forced England into the war. In his telephone conversation with Roosevelt in the summer of 1939 the President kept telling him to put some iron up Chamberlain\u2019s backside Kennedy\u2019s response always was that putting iron up his backside did no good unless the British had some iron with which to fight, and they did not.&quot; Diary of James Forrestal, Dec 27th, 1945","time":1492421613,"resto":121503902,"id":"yC5yhlqk","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121506189,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:34:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121505737\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121505737<\/a><br>Because he let his generals decide","time":1492421663,"resto":121503902,"id":"ZiuMZ75O","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":121506231,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:35:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121506063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121506063<\/a><br>france and england declared war on germany","time":1492421701,"resto":121503902,"id":"mP4mV620","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":121506287,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:35:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121505797\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121505797<\/a><br>If you seriously think killing white people and letting jews infiltrate your goverment is better than an authoritarian state that survives without the international banking system, you must be totally retarded.","time":1492421741,"resto":121503902,"id":"Io812NtW","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":121506290,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:35:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121506231\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121506231<\/a><br>Doesn&#039;t change the fact that he invade them.","time":1492421747,"resto":121503902,"id":"K3qNobmt","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121506319,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:36:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121505295\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121505295<\/a><br>IN","time":1492421776,"resto":121503902,"id":"LJ\/nmpSP","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":121506327,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)05:36:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121506063\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121506063<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121506078\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121506078<\/a><br><a href=\"#p121506120\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121506120<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Hitler clearly wanted to take over the world guys<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Look at how he went to war with us after France and England declared war on him and dragged their subjects into it<\/span><br>Your argument is poor.

Modern designs like British Comet came too late to be meaningful in war. Only two projects matched every requirement (speed, armor, gun, manoeuvrability) and asked for more: M24 Chaffee and T-34, and the last got it right due to the engine, above all: the only 400-500hp tank engine which could be made to tip the scales at just 750kg dry weight. Before the British Meteor engine came, which was more powerful and even lighter, all other 1941-vintage engines weighed 1000-1200-1500kg easily, while the Chrysler Multi-Bank engine in the Sherman weighed a ridiculous 2384kg (5244lbs!).<br><br>The T-34 design and craftsmanship varied, with the early model 1940 being exceedingly poor: petrol engines which died after 350km (and not 350 thousand, as people may believe) in the field, an inferior transmission and a very cramped turret. A lack of radios meant that tanks built in 1940 had to communicate via flags. At cramped two-men turret in T-34\/76, rubberless track wheels and links and so on. Later war build quality vastly improved, especially with the introduction of the vastly superior diesel engine and transmission and with build and production defects resolved (and the threat of immediate attack to the factories removed).","filename":"rumia___bloody_youkai","ext":".png","w":900,"h":506,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492424651474,"time":1492424651,"md5":"cmtyoWAVo81D0EUmCTTmIQ==","fsize":570906,"resto":121503902,"id":"lJuHAT3V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121510024,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)06:25:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121508661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121508661<\/a><br>As a consequence of poor planning, hasty adoption and the colossal disruption caused by Operation Barbarossa, build quality was ridiculously variable (to the point where incompatibility of parts was called into question). The tanks from factory 112 were extremely poor and built with serious flaws, and the tanks built at factory 183 at Kharkov (the tank that originated the T-34 prototype) were excellent, being finished as well, or even better, than anything manufactured in Germany or France. Armor quality was consistently excellent, and in fact so good that it was a factor in the Germans being unable to directly copy the T-34 design. The ability of all T-34s, even inferior models, to be brought back into service despite being wrecked on the battlefield probably had to do with the chassis&#039; flexibility for other purposes (for highly effective tank destroyers, for example), and all T-34s, even the lemons, featuring points that revolutionized armored vehicle design, namely wide tracks, sloped armor, a powerful diesel engine, and superb suspension.<br><br>T-34 set the standards that every subsequent Soviet tank followed: it was reasonably well armored, very well armed, yet lighter and faster compared to its contemporaries partly due to being relatively small and compact (especially in height). On the other hand, its dimensions severely limited the internal space, lowered crew effectiveness, and made upgrades difficult (problems that also hampered T-55 and T-72). The small size, however, also gave it much tactical advantage, especially in concealment (many German generals thought their own Panther and Tiger were too big and that the smaller T-34 was much better in defensive operations) and in strategic mobility, such as in river crossings (German Tigers could not cross many bridges in Soviet Russia. Even after the war, strategic bridges in Eastern Europe were built so that lighter Soviet designed tanks could use them, but bigger and heavier NATO tanks could not.)","filename":"8dc9e09cf1d4adf4e8f0a8e24c7b6969_480","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":619,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492424752511,"time":1492424752,"md5":"cggShuF8Gh0HRFcz9wm81g==","fsize":35968,"resto":121503902,"id":"lJuHAT3V","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121510031,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)06:25:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121508816\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121508816<\/a><br>Yes, largely in thanks to having multiple industrial nations supporting it, as I said.

Some say they don&#039;t actually have nukes, or at least, nukes capable of reaching the US. Some say they have spent more time money and energy into weapons systems that the public and even most other governments don&#039;t know about. I&#039;m sure the US could and would destroy them in the end. But I also believe they&#039;re being seriously underestimated.","filename":"this-is-what-north-koreas-military-arsenal-looks-like","ext":".jpg","w":1584,"h":1188,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":187,"tim":1492219648640,"time":1492219648,"md5":"t0dX70x1Y2T9Lb+jW6QfYw==","fsize":290637,"resto":0,"id":"EhkEg0H7","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpill-me-on-the-norks-military-some-say-they","country_name":"United States","replies":4,"images":1,"unique_ips":4},{"no":121148198,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)21:34:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121147318\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121147318<\/a><br>What i think we would see is the North quickly overrunning the south and pretty much a Rape of Nanking electric boogaloo. Eventually US forces and SK holdouts will begin pushing them back once they are able to get fresh forces over from the US bases in Japan. This is where we would most likely see the use of Nukes either leveling part of Seoul as a fuck you or to cover a retreat. The Norks have a lot of man power but their tech is ancient also China would probably cut their oil and starve out their armor. It would be a costly fight but the North would fall it would just be a matter of time. However another situation we could just as likely see is mass surrender&#039;s like we did in the first gulf war.","time":1492220047,"resto":121147318,"id":"gjbgjKbm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121148465,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)21:36:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121148198\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121148198<\/a>","filename":"no no nonono","ext":".gif","w":504,"h":280,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1492220170838,"time":1492220170,"md5":"piXtsYxMxK8F+4EAK3V6Gg==","fsize":1350665,"resto":121147318,"id":"Ehib0r7u","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121149002,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)21:40:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121148465\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121148465<\/a><br>Meh it wouldn&#039;t be Nuclear Armageddon we would probably only see the use of like one or two shitty nukes weaker then the ones we dropped on Japan. China is just as sick of them as we are. China dont want that shit on their border either.

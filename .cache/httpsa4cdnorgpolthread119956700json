You can, however, do shit about this:<br><br>There has been a week long of protests happening in all cities across Serbia after the newly elected president committed voter fraud by illegally assigning 800 000 dead voters to him. He has been a known EU supporter and globalist Clinton-set puppet, rulling this country for decades.<br><br>Police and Army will be joining the student-lead protests tomorrow in an attempt to show the whole country that enough is enough, they want all ministers fired.<br><br>I&#039;ve heard talks during protests which I took part in, that the &quot;Final Protest&quot; will also take place on Saturday. I wouldn&#039;t go as far as saying there may be a coup, because neither Police nor the Military confirmed they won&#039;t come unarmed.<br><br>One of my close friends recorded the protests live this thursday, the rest of the videos are on this profile.

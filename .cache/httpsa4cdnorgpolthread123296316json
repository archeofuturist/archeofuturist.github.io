Some people like America and appreciate the things you&#039;ve done (like Hiroshima and Nagasaki). Other people don&#039;t like America and feel like America has done a lot of bad things in Korea (like an American tank driver ran over two school girls or when America was importing bad beef into Korea, and some people blame America for Korea being a divided country).<br><br>Personally, I realize no country is flawless. I feel like the bad stuff America did is outweighed by the good stuff they&#039;ve done. I like the USA.<br><br>Recently, Trump took a hit in popularity because he said Korea used to be a part of China, but a lot of people seem to be attributing that to him talking to the Chinese president and it seems like a lot more hate is directed at him and the Chinese over that.","time":1493442902,"resto":123296316,"id":"8af1infr","country":"KR","country_name":"South Korea"}]}

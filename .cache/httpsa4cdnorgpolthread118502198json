First, there is the fact that so many people refuse to accept the reality that those who accumulate wealth in a capitalist society do so simply by pleasing large numbers of their fellow citizens with the products or services that they sell. In terms of making money, the movie star outstrips the philosopher. This often creates a lifelong feeling of envy and hatred towards capitalism and capitalists in the mind of the &quot;philosopher.&quot; Many people also insist that they should be judged by some kind of absolute standard (defined by the government, of course) as opposed to the dollar &quot;votes&quot; of their fellow citizens. Consequently, they are frustrated and envious of the more successful among them. The less successful (including the lazy or incompetent) often express hate and enmity against all those who superseded them. Political demagogues take advantage of such people by promising them something for nothing (&quot;free&quot; healthcare! &quot;free&quot; education! &quot;free&quot; you name it!) in the name of egalitarianism.","time":1490614442,"resto":118502198,"id":"lO4hBPfh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118503764,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)07:35:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118503594\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118503594<\/a><br>This is already how it is, at least where I live.

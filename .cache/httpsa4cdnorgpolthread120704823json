My grandmother could do anything and everything related to child raising and domestic survival skills like the ones you listed are why she survived being a teenager during the Great Depression,then a housewife with a husband off at war, and decades of raising 10 kids as dirt farmers practically. Seriously, those are survival skills and go hand in hand with basic prepping. Its a good idea to combine the two I think. Anything your Grandma knew and anything the Boy scouts teach are skills worth knowing, even if it just turns out it was for self-improvement and never need to be used. im going to look into it frankly.","time":1491967740,"resto":120704823,"id":"ywOuSOxa","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

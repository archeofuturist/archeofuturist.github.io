When in fact it was those 999 others who were committing sins and were lacking sensitivity to it being sins, i.e. they were being punished less for the same sins, i.e. they were gentiles and that 1 wacko out of the 1,000 people was the Jew.","filename":"jew_basic","ext":".jpg","w":220,"h":220,"tn_w":220,"tn_h":220,"tim":1492569643212,"time":1492569643,"md5":"lQj+uKhhZS6j+lzrGVUJ\/A==","fsize":19421,"resto":0,"id":"DW5664nb","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-mentally-disordered-people-jews","country_name":"Sweden","replies":6,"images":0,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121790220,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:55:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"To me this also seems to explain why Jews are so against becoming Christians themselves. Becoming Christian is to become forgiving towards sinners, i.e. to become a liberal basically. And if this lifestyle is to be combined with anything other than total poverty and seclusion it must necessarily imply to be joining the herd of sinners, sins you know from gnosis are sins.<br><br>But to push those sins onto others without committing them yourself is another story. And this might be where the main difference lies between Muslims and Jews, the Jews are those who have actual gnosis or enlightenment about the sins and their consequences, while Muslims don&#039;t and only believe it because they&#039;re told so. The Christians don&#039;t believe all of those sins are sins but have not suffered.<br><br>But the behavior of the Christians will lead to an evermore oppressive society which eventually will bring suffering onto themselves. I wonder though if Islam really is a choice, because I notice in the lower races a greater desire to commit sin than in others, a desire which is only thinly veiled by their religion.<br><br>A desire which in fact to me appears to be the main driving force of civilization, a civilization which inherently brings about suffering. This suffering in fact to me appears to be at the heart of what civilization really is. Civilization is that inevitable corruption which leads to suffering which is the enlightenment process.","time":1492570552,"resto":121788091,"id":"DW5664nb","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121790904,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)23:00:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"G\u00e5 och sov ditt mongo","time":1492570857,"resto":121788091,"id":"PzyfDhaA","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121791585,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)23:06:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121790904\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121790904<\/a><br>whatever you do, DON&#039;T QUESTION EVER","time":1492571162,"resto":121788091,"id":"DW5664nb","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121792638,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)23:14:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"bump","time":1492571654,"resto":121788091,"id":"DW5664nb","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121793428,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)23:20:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"\/pol\/ are a bunch of dumbasses","time":1492572036,"resto":121788091,"id":"DW5664nb","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":121794799,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)23:32:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"ok then, keep being parrots and just spew the same old ideas year after year","time":1492572766,"resto":121788091,"id":"DW5664nb","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"}]}

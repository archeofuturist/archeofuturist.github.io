The artist (With the last name Pepe) was born in Fivizzano, which has the Coat-of-Arms on the picture. Someone pointed this out in the original topic, but people were confused as to the meaning. Let me shed some light on it for you.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BEAR CLAW<\/span><br>Now tell me, what is the first thing that you think of that is symbolically linked to a bear? If you aren&#039;t a complete deviant, it should be Russia. Russia, who is linked to Donald Trump, Chosen of Kek. This is very important, but the why will be explained later.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BULL HORNS<\/span><br>No, they aren&#039;t bull horns. It&#039;s a crescent moon. What group is famously linked to a crescent moon? Islam. What most of you should consider the greatest threat to western civilization. The Moon itself is off-center, and is in the grip of the bear claws. The Bear is dragging down the Crescent, symbolically &#039;destroying&#039; it, or at the very least containing it.<br><br>This means that either Russia, directly or through Trump as a proxy will destroy Islam and therefor save western civilization. The minions of Moloch paint Trump&#039;s connections to Russia as a bad thing, trying to cloud the waters. This is a clear sign from Kek that we shouldn&#039;t let their manipulations color our own judgment, for the power of Russia will take down Islam and help usher in a new age.","filename":"Fivizzano Crest","ext":".png","w":353,"h":500,"tn_w":176,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491417135583,"time":1491417135,"md5":"GxcqaJ0cAN2VFGBzNdJK8g==","fsize":53164,"resto":0,"id":"7AfqAecp","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"a-new-message-from-kek","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":1,"unique_ips":5},{"no":119638227,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)14:39:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119637300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119637300<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;dubs<\/span><br><br>MORE PROOF MY POST WAS BLESSED BY KEK, DO YOU STILL NOT BELIEVE?","time":1491417562,"resto":119637300,"id":"7AfqAecp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119638338,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)14:40:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119637300\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119637300<\/a><br>Autism<br><br>This is supposed to be ironic","time":1491417617,"resto":119637300,"id":"idrzH0XP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119638505,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)14:41:41","name":"TruthBlast1997","com":"<a href=\"#p119638227\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119638227<\/a><br>The truth is often times stranger than young adult fiction.","time":1491417701,"resto":119637300,"id":"QLamIYqX","country":"US","trip":"!!b9bl7uAqXBg","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119638524,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)14:41:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"All the proof I need","filename":"IMG_fanend","ext":".jpg","w":592,"h":436,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1491417710768,"time":1491417710,"md5":"xMnrKcfVfDeOg8ZTyS7QcQ==","fsize":18181,"resto":119637300,"id":"zLl3Z9a6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119638733,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)14:43:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119638338\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119638338<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2017<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;still thinks kek is parody<\/span>","time":1491417809,"resto":119637300,"id":"T\/b2NAdP","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]}

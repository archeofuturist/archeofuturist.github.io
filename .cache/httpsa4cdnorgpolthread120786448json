The junction at the big library, if you&#039;re familiar. As for cycling, I agree it&#039;s not that great here, but there are still bicycle lanes on every street with considerable traffic. The reason it sucks is because of all the traffic lights, which is also a problem if you&#039;re in a car IMO, because we don&#039;t have an underground transport system and all the trams can set all the other lights to red. Amsterdam is better for cycling though, but probably worse for driving. I almost never cycle though, only on the best of weather days. I don&#039;t see the appeal of it.

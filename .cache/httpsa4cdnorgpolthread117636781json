However, unlike men, they are wholly incapable of regulating these instincts by themselves, even when they are irrational and destructive, and require external pressures like social ostracism or kinetic corporal negative reinforcement in order to properly function within society as integrated members.","time":1490114435,"resto":117636781,"id":"8zZwDaZx","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117642255,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)12:46:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117636781\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117636781<\/a><br>Yes.

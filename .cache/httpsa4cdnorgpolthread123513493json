The NatSocs for example were a self-admitted authoritarian state, their propaganda was straight up called propaganda by the nazis themselves and when they wanted to get rid of some people, as in jews, Hitler and others made that quite clear for everyone. They didn&#039;t sugar coat or hide anything.<br><br>Orwellianism is mainly about political double-speak and can be applied more to western democracies, take America for example. Your propaganda is disguised as a free and unbiased media that coincidently spouts the same message 90% of the time with the other 10% being heavily supressed, a shit ton of American laws have names completely contradictory to their meaning, Free Trade Agreements actively supress free trade through thousands of pages of regulation to favor big corporations, the Freedom Act is about spying on your own citizens and the Civil Rights Act basically nullified Americans&#039; freedom of association and property rights. America&#039;s political system is almost entirely in control of the media, big corporations and justice departments(most of whom collude with each other) instead of the actual people. That&#039;s Orwellian","time":1493585963,"resto":123513493,"id":"9X+bxm7E","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":123525872,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)17:00:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a

He&#039;s often come to me asking for right leaning news sources, so we are open to civilly discuss politics. <br><br>One day I sent him the tweet of Shkreli saying he&#039;d release wu-tang stuff, and said &quot;you know what you&#039;ve gotta do!&quot; as a joke and I got a &quot;lol&quot; back. So since he&#039;s a lefty but not into the progressive stuff, and starting to lean right, I decided to ask him what his take on Trump was based on his preferred media. Wait an hour, then I said &quot;speak your mind man, you&#039;re not gonna hurt my feelings if you don&#039;t like him&quot;. Nothing back. For a good 3 and a half months. Literally too afraid to talk to me and have his views challenged.","time":1490314359,"resto":118007333,"id":"qnPyKWyE","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118010363,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)20:20:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118007333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118007333<\/a><br>I was already losing friends because of my evolving political stances.

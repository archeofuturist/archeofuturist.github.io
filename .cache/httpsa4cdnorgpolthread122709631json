My sweat glands are operating at the max as I pump weights like a Kekistani spec ops member. Knowing that I am never going to be one of them, It spurs me onward to resist the urge to stop. The thought of taking some innocent snowflake captive and melting them slowly through red pilling helps too. It had kept me going on and on through the curling, sit-ups, and everything else I did to get this aggression out. I didn\u2019t care if the libtard gym counselor said things like: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t do it that way. Do it this way or you\u2019ll get hurt!\u201d I don\u2019t care.<br> The exorcises weren\u2019t working though. I couldn\u2019t be calmed. I thought to myself, \u201cLe Penn for the win or we get a French Dem.\u201d It is raving madness! Muzzies are flooding the borders and people are looking the other way! Fuck them! Fuck them! Fuck them! WE are the WEST! We are WHITE! Cucks are onslaughting everything that we stand for. We need the hearts and minds of the people as Trump barely won. Mainstream media said Putin helped us but I call bull. Even if he had, so what?<br> God Kek is on our side which ironically says something about the West\u2019s religions. Kek is great and so is number magic but they can only do so much.<br>We need people and we need them fast. France must join Kekistan as as Frankistan. France must join so that the rest of the EU finally wakes up. But how? I threw the weight at the gym mirror and It surprisingly doesn\u2019t break the damn thing. Fuck it. I was weak anyway. Shaking from the exorcise or just pure frustration made the air around me palpable. Thankfully the the gym staff were in the back and no one else was present to see my uproar.<br> I got my self gathered both mentally and of my belongings and I left the building thinking, \u201cWe must win or heads will roll in our ranks....\u201d<br><br><br> The news was playing in the corner of the heavy ventilated room from a TV: : \u201cCNN ~ Le Penn and Macron go to round two....\u201d","filename":"Post1","ext":".png","w":1301,"h":897,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":172,"tim":1493106528650,"time":1493106528,"md5":"O2SycKwahhN61Ks34MpmXg==","fsize":365378,"resto":0,"id":"JHeIaXE7","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"le-penn-for-the-win-or-we-get-a-french-dem","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

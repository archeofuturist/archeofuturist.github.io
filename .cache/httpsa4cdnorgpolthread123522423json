At harvest time he sent a servant to the tenants so they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenants beat him and sent him away empty-handed. He sent another servant, but that one also they beat and treated shamefully and sent away empty-handed. He sent still a third, and they wounded him and threw him out. Then the owner of the vineyard said, \u2018What shall I do? I will send my son, whom I love; perhaps they will respect him.\u2019 But when the tenants saw him, they talked the matter over. \u2018This is the heir,\u2019 they said. \u2018Let\u2019s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.\u2019 So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them? He will come and kill those tenants and give the vineyard to others.\u2019 When the people heard this, they said, \u2018May this never be!\u2019 Jesus looked directly at them and asked, \u2018Then what is the meaning of that which is written: \u201cThe stone the builders rejected has become the capstone\u2019\u2019? Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls will be crushed.\u2019 The teachers of the law and the chief priests looked for a way to arrest him immediately, because they knew he had spoken this parable against them. But they were afraid of the people.\u201d","filename":"IMG_0824","ext":".jpg","w":635,"h":294,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":115,"tim":1493584388882,"time":1493584388,"md5":"pBlTraWhZ1\/ddBXa9CPYFw==","fsize":46411,"resto":0,"id":"EUkG51Dj","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"join-christianity-defeat-islam-and-the-jew","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0,"unique_ips":3},{"no":123524621,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)16:50:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123522423\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123522423<\/a><br>This.

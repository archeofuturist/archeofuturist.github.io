I believe in God but I do not believe in an after-life. In other words, whatever created &quot;everything&quot; (universe, dimensions, etc.) is what I perceive to be God. I believe that God is something that is far beyond our comprehension and something that we will never be able to wrap our head around.<br><br>However, I do not believe that God gives admission into some form of after-life but rather is the origin of &quot;everything&quot;.<br><br>Does this make me an atheist \/pol\/?

I happen to know this guy Phil Plait, and worked with him once on a failed TV pilot; he&#039;s just an astronomer, that&#039;s his field, not biology. Just looking out through a telescope. He also smokes weed, so that&#039;s the kind of &quot;scientist&quot; he is. I also recall him being a big believer in 2012 doomsday conspiracies, which he admitted after drinking at the wrap party. So, let people know this is who is writing your children&#039;s science programs when it comes up.","filename":"written by","ext":".png","w":654,"h":537,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":102,"tim":1493220766230,"time":1493220766,"md5":"rgf8aS+G3K0i3438xBXYRA==","fsize":1420910,"resto":122890681,"id":"A6HlDodj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122896003,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:33:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122890681\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122890681<\/a><br>biology is the only science that can point gender out<br>i dont think i need to elaborate on the bill nye situation","time":1493220805,"resto":122890681,"id":"sZmnSSfg","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122896016,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:33:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Bill Nye is a fucktard.","time":1493220814,"resto":122890681,"id":"TU9yxDIO","country":"NL","country_name":"Netherlands"},{"no":122896075,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:34:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122894627\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122894627<\/a><br>Its not subjective it&#039;s just a different approach to basic math with a dumb way to encourage the mental approach instead of the written approach","time":1493220853,"resto":122890681,"id":"ZjHXiis0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122896297,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:35:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122895927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122895927<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; a big believer in 2012 doomsday conspiracies<\/span><br>That&#039;s funny coming from the Bad Astronomy guy.","time":1493220949,"resto":122890681,"id":"1YeMKXC0","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122896304,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:35:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122890681\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122890681<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;psychology<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;sociology<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;scientific proof<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;bill nye, B.Eng.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;scientist<\/span><br><br>What did they mean by this?","time":1493220953,"resto":122890681,"id":"V81hj4Ld","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122896386,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:36:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122895644\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122895644<\/a><br>well of course thats where (((they))) operate","time":1493220996,"resto":122890681,"id":"Lrg0yV7C","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122896412,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:36:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122895927\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122895927<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Phil Plait<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;head science writer<\/span><br>Oh no","filename":"robin","ext":".jpg","w":468,"h":256,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1493221009560,"time":1493221009,"md5":"MTZr3RKk4d+1anxjhU0wKg==","fsize":17584,"resto":122890681,"id":"\/m4esHjn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122896443,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:37:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;body dysmorphia and anorexia are mental issues<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;gender dysphoria on the other hand is not<\/span><br>It&#039;s literally that easy.","time":1493221023,"resto":122890681,"id":"Amww92Oe","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":122896549,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:38:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122890681\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122890681<\/a><br>I wonder if the people who make these tranny images have ever read an actual scientific study in their lives.","time":1493221091,"resto":122890681,"id":"y\/VS8i5N","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122896578,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)11:38:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122891033\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122891033<\/a><br>it happend first to the civilizations in mesopotamia and egypt, then to the romans\/greek, and now is the turn of western civilization.

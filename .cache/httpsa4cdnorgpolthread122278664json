You&#039;d most likely agree that European culture was strongly tied to Christianism. Homossexuality wasn&#039;t enforced, though it was accepted, general meritocracy was in place (aka no quotas for blacks, women or other &#039;minorities&#039;), and immigration was controlled. Women were meant to find long-lasting partners, as were men, and being a slut was generally shunned upon. Men were expected to protect their propriety and found families with traditional values, and children were meant to be just that: children. Cultural marxism comes into play when you insert alien values into this society; such as mass immigration, forceful insertion of homosexuality acceptance (and even heterosexuality despisal), an outright rebellion against conservative values, which are regarded as &#039;boring&#039; and &#039;uninteresting&#039;, and so forth.<br><br>It&#039;s not spam. It&#039;s Cultural Marxism by definition. The same thing happened in Brazil, you see: Past the militar regime a few years ago, most of the population was actually right-wing and overall conservative. It was a good place to live in. Music spoke of love, of life, of happiness. Through en masse populism, however, Lula (aka the commies) won the elections, and Cultural Marxism entered into play. It&#039;s strongly suggested that the birth of strongly immoral &#039;funk&#039; was subsided by this government. It pushed women to be sluts, men to be and to want to be with sluts, homosexual normativity and the whole nine yards. It also pushed an unnatural passion for football, regarding it as the &#039;god of all sports&#039;, and you see the population was easily alienated.<br><br>Governments tend to push cultural agendas that befit their interests and their interests alone. Through subside, whether directly or indirectly, a country&#039;s government controls much of the populace&#039;s general behavior.","time":1492871025,"resto":122278664,"id":"CuP1m9e1","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122281606,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:23:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why do people keep replying to this shill?<br><br>It probably can&#039;t even think straight after taking some Critical Theory up its ass for the entirety of its adult life.<br><br>If you can&#039;t resist the bait at least use Sage with your post to spare us the trouble of seeing this shit on page 1.","filename":"Wrong","ext":".jpg","w":125,"h":92,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1492871039526,"time":1492871039,"md5":"\/HIh8SlCuT5qkFYgaiv3sg==","fsize":1830,"resto":122278664,"id":"t5Lpk4Wb","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":122281621,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:24:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281495<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mises<\/span><br>Go back to r\/The_Donald","time":1492871047,"resto":122278664,"id":"LfEJGBbe","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122281704,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:24:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281621<\/a><br>\/leftypol\/ is down the hall and to the left.","filename":"10539386","ext":".jpg","w":324,"h":372,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492871097392,"time":1492871097,"md5":"MNmuwlR3WcoTQBjKHFLzBQ==","fsize":54325,"resto":122278664,"id":"glD2UfQS","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122281814,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:26:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281495<\/a><br>What is with worker Politicians?<br>btw, not posting an archive<br>http:\/\/archive.is\/2PedP","filename":"1492868827084","ext":".jpg","w":604,"h":403,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492871173398,"time":1492871173,"md5":"x1bYPrBvaQy1+1s7qdSiGw==","fsize":66129,"resto":122278664,"id":"H2aSFJrx","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":122281838,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:26:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281515<\/a><br>If you&#039;re a historical materialist, how could it not?","time":1492871190,"resto":122278664,"id":"NrqoTkWL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122281849,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:26:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281515<\/a><br>Yes everything we do is a reflection of our foundations.","time":1492871196,"resto":122278664,"id":"DYgwXcm9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122281914,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:27:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281838\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281838<\/a><br>Because ethnicity isn&#039;t the determining factor in ideology.","time":1492871233,"resto":122278664,"id":"TrA5sB2+","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122281916,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:27:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122280718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122280718<\/a><br>&quot;The Culture of Critique&quot;","filename":"communist","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":523,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1492871234838,"time":1492871234,"md5":"Kt3TPWTelD7tRGnrMqy6FA==","fsize":184658,"resto":122278664,"id":"mxnJJxWH","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122281963,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:27:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Copied over from the last thread.<br><br>The magnum opus of the Frankfurt School, aka Institute for Social Research was a series of books under the heading &quot;Studies in Prejudice&quot;<br><br>Anybody bother to check who paid to have that work done?<br><br>http:\/\/ajcarchives.org\/AJC_DATA\/Fil<wbr>es\/AP1.pdf","filename":"AP1","ext":".png","w":666,"h":712,"tn_w":116,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492871266588,"time":1492871266,"md5":"tP6iJ7prJ4MwzvahU30yuw==","fsize":108054,"resto":122278664,"id":"Xhb6tLN2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122281974,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:27:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281704<\/a><br>Get&#039;m Carlos you cheeky foker","time":1492871271,"resto":122278664,"id":"DYgwXcm9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122282062,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:28:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281914<\/a><br>What has that to do with your statement?

You&#039;d most likely agree that European culture was strongly tied to Christianism. Homossexuality wasn&#039;t enforced, though it was accepted, general meritocracy was in place (aka no quotas for blacks, women or other &#039;minorities&#039;), and immigration was controlled. Women were meant to find long-lasting partners, as were men, and being a slut was generally shunned upon. Men were expected to protect their propriety and found families with traditional values, and children were meant to be just that: children. Cultural marxism comes into play when you insert alien values into this society; such as mass immigration, forceful insertion of homosexuality acceptance (and even heterosexuality despisal), an outright rebellion against conservative values, which are regarded as &#039;boring&#039; and &#039;uninteresting&#039;, and so forth.<br><br>It&#039;s not spam. It&#039;s Cultural Marxism by definition. The same thing happened in Brazil, you see: Past the militar regime a few years ago, most of the population was actually right-wing and overall conservative. It was a good place to live in. Music spoke of love, of life, of happiness. Through en masse populism, however, Lula (aka the commies) won the elections, and Cultural Marxism entered into play. It&#039;s strongly suggested that the birth of strongly immoral &#039;funk&#039; was subsided by this government. It pushed women to be sluts, men to be and to want to be with sluts, homosexual normativity and the whole nine yards. It also pushed an unnatural passion for football, regarding it as the &#039;god of all sports&#039;, and you see the population was easily alienated.<br><br>Governments tend to push cultural agendas that befit their interests and their interests alone. Through subside, whether directly or indirectly, a country&#039;s government controls much of the populace&#039;s general behavior.","time":1492871025,"resto":122278664,"id":"CuP1m9e1","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122281606,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:23:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why do people keep replying to this shill?<br><br>It probably can&#039;t even think straight after taking some Critical Theory up its ass for the entirety of its adult life.<br><br>If you can&#039;t resist the bait at least use Sage with your post to spare us the trouble of seeing this shit on page 1.","filename":"Wrong","ext":".jpg","w":125,"h":92,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":92,"tim":1492871039526,"time":1492871039,"md5":"\/HIh8SlCuT5qkFYgaiv3sg==","fsize":1830,"resto":122278664,"id":"t5Lpk4Wb","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":122281621,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:24:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281495<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Mises<\/span><br>Go back to r\/The_Donald","time":1492871047,"resto":122278664,"id":"LfEJGBbe","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122281704,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:24:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281621\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281621<\/a><br>\/leftypol\/ is down the hall and to the left.","filename":"10539386","ext":".jpg","w":324,"h":372,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492871097392,"time":1492871097,"md5":"MNmuwlR3WcoTQBjKHFLzBQ==","fsize":54325,"resto":122278664,"id":"glD2UfQS","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":122281814,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:26:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281495\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281495<\/a><br>What is with worker Politicians?<br>btw, not posting an archive<br>http:\/\/archive.is\/2PedP","filename":"1492868827084","ext":".jpg","w":604,"h":403,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492871173398,"time":1492871173,"md5":"x1bYPrBvaQy1+1s7qdSiGw==","fsize":66129,"resto":122278664,"id":"H2aSFJrx","country":"AT","country_name":"Austria"},{"no":122281838,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:26:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281515<\/a><br>If you&#039;re a historical materialist, how could it not?","time":1492871190,"resto":122278664,"id":"NrqoTkWL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122281849,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:26:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281515\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281515<\/a><br>Yes everything we do is a reflection of our foundations.","time":1492871196,"resto":122278664,"id":"DYgwXcm9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122281914,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:27:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281838\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281838<\/a><br>Because ethnicity isn&#039;t the determining factor in ideology.","time":1492871233,"resto":122278664,"id":"TrA5sB2+","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122281916,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:27:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122280718\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122280718<\/a><br>&quot;The Culture of Critique&quot;","filename":"communist","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":523,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":81,"tim":1492871234838,"time":1492871234,"md5":"Kt3TPWTelD7tRGnrMqy6FA==","fsize":184658,"resto":122278664,"id":"mxnJJxWH","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122281963,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:27:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"Copied over from the last thread.<br><br>The magnum opus of the Frankfurt School, aka Institute for Social Research was a series of books under the heading &quot;Studies in Prejudice&quot;<br><br>Anybody bother to check who paid to have that work done?<br><br>http:\/\/ajcarchives.org\/AJC_DATA\/Fil<wbr>es\/AP1.pdf","filename":"AP1","ext":".png","w":666,"h":712,"tn_w":116,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492871266588,"time":1492871266,"md5":"tP6iJ7prJ4MwzvahU30yuw==","fsize":108054,"resto":122278664,"id":"Xhb6tLN2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122281974,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:27:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281704<\/a><br>Get&#039;m Carlos you cheeky foker","time":1492871271,"resto":122278664,"id":"DYgwXcm9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122282062,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:28:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122281914\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122281914<\/a><br>What has that to do with your statement?

The Western Marxists were concerned with the marriage of hyper-egalitarian Marxism with culture in the West: that is the assertion.","time":1492873157,"resto":122278664,"id":"ZBZ+VBS6","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122285247,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:59:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122285206\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122285206<\/a><br>Yes.","time":1492873164,"resto":122278664,"id":"TrA5sB2+","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122285254,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:59:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122285032\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122285032<\/a><br>Kek","time":1492873170,"resto":122278664,"id":"DYgwXcm9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122285260,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)10:59:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122284975\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122284975<\/a><br><br>Cultural Marxism was the Frankfurt School&#039;s criticism of the capitalist Culture Industry.<br><br>Marxism is an economic theory... these guys were Cultural Theorists.

I get the sense that you don&#039;t even understand the idea of what people mean by cultural marxism, because any discussion of Marxism that does not include the oppressor-vs-oppressed paradigm is incomplete. <br><br>You started this video by poisoning the well -- defining cultural marxism as just the modern version of Nazi anti-jewish sentiment. Yet you miss the main point of the argument. Central to Marxism is the theory that society, and in fact all of human history, is defined by a struggle between the bourgeoisie and proletariate classes, aka the privileged oppressors and the disadvantaged oppressed. This is called a material dialectic. Cultural marxism is just the appropriation of a dialectical struggle to a cultural paradigm rather than a class paradigm. Replace bourgeoisie with white, and proletariate with black. Replace bourgeoisie with male and proletariate with female. Et cetera, et cetera. The rhetoric, arguments, and overtures to revolution are all the same; it&#039;s just framed in the context of cultural class rather than economic class. <br><br>In that regard, cultural marxism is kind of just objectively real. Hell, Bell Hooks, one of the most prominent minds of modern Feminism, helped define the entire third-wave with her book &quot;The Dialectic of Sex.&quot; Her use of the word dialectic is not an accident. She seems to believe in cultural marxism. So why don&#039;t you?

First of all, the opinions published in my name are solely my own, and do not represent the official policy of any Jewish movement or organization. Additionally, my answer, as written, is misleading. It is obvious, I thought, that any neighbor of the Jewish people should be treated, as the Torah commands us, with respect and compassion. Fundamental to the Jewish faith is the concept that every human being was created in the image of G-d, and our sages instruct us to support the non-Jewish poor along with the poor of our own brethren. The sub-question I chose to address instead is: how should we act in time of war, when our neighbors attack us, using their women, children and religious holy places as shields. I attempted to briefly address some of the ethical issues related to forcing the military to withhold fire from certain people and places, at the unbearable cost of widespread bloodshed (on both sides!)\u2014when one\u2019s own family and nation is mercilessly targeted from those very people and places.

The US had a free market in railways and until the state mixed in there were no problems with monopolies. I read this years ago but I think there were about 4 major companies competing and progress was good and prices kept getting lower.

I&#039;ve been a libertarian since late 2016 (Thanks, 2k16 election), and I&#039;ve been mulling over a few things, specifically, the role of government in relation to the crony capitalist system. My personal view is that government should not necessarily be eliminated, but definitely limited, because I believe that with the deregulation of certain areas of the market, and the strengthening of regulation in a few places, it could potentially ensure that the market stays free. I also believe in the repeal of citizens united because it allows for the government to be owned and controlled by crony capitalists, who monopolize resources in the free market.

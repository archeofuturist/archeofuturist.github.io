This bill being passed has nothing to do with Trump because he isn&#039;t part of the House, and in fact Trump is the main man opposing the globalist elites who are destroying the entire West, which is why he&#039;s already passed a ton of executive orders which all benefit the American people, and nominated a Supreme Court justice who will benefit the American people, and exposed the media, deep state, and puppet politicians and judges are the anti-American traitors they&#039;ve always been.

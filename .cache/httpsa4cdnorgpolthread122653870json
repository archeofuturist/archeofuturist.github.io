The way the way of life is formalized for teaching, how detailed the worldview or the way of life is, and its overall purpose differs between religions. <br><br>When speaking specifically about Christianity, the Bible is a series of books with varying structure, genre, and authorship. The compilation is to explain the life of Christ, the beginning of the church Christ came to create, and the setting in which God prepared for the coming of Christ. The Tanakh is in the Bible and fulfills the latter goal. It is referred to as the &quot;Old Testament&quot; with everything else lumped together into what is collectively known as the &quot;New Testament&quot;. As the work in the Old Testament is simply a preparation to what is revealed by the coming of Christ they don&#039;t follow the Old Testament as doctrine but as inspiration as due to knowing God was involved in this scenario (as opposed to elsewhere, which couldn&#039;t be effectively be claimed) despite that the covenant at the time was incomplete and was superseded.<br><br>The Dead Sea Scrolls caused no new religions or new scripture but greater examination of existing scripture.<br><br>Islam is a religion from the 6th century that came about when a middle eastern man learned from Christian heretics and began to think himself a prophet.

This is mongols storming into Islamic territories and both dominating them and being converted by them. What became of this is the more violent aspects to the middle east. The west trying to install puppets in the middle east led to Islamic people getting more violent to have their way.

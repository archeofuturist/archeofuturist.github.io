Some people say they&#039;re part of history and others think it&#039;s all racist. <br><br>That reminded me of a problem we have in Croatia. The thing in the pic is the emblem of the Croatian armed forces that were formed during the war of &#039;91. They were all volunteers and they fought against the Serbian army. Everybody agrees they were bad ass. <br><br>But the thing is, &quot;Za dom spremni&quot; is a salute that was used as an official salute during the time Croatia was a nazi puppet state in WWII. It&#039;s a version of &quot;Heil Hitler&quot;. It means something like &quot;Ready to defend our home&quot;. <br><br>So some people want to band the flag and the salute, and some people will defend it to the death because of the Croatian war for independence. But everyone pretty much agrees that it was a nazi salute. <br><br>So what do you guys think?","filename":"hos_flag_2","ext":".jpg","w":670,"h":380,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":141,"tim":1493837215503,"time":1493837215,"md5":"cyYg52BGbfqFY7cc1M41yw==","fsize":38712,"resto":0,"id":"9sKyvgu2","country":"HR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-just-saw-that-the-americans-are-fighting-over","country_name":"Croatia","replies":12,"images":2,"unique_ips":7},{"no":123945023,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:48:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123944832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123944832<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;band the flag<\/span><br><br>I meant &quot;ban&quot;, obviously","time":1493837306,"resto":123944832,"id":"9sKyvgu2","country":"HR","country_name":"Croatia"},{"no":123946093,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)14:57:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123944832\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123944832<\/a><br>Our airforce uses the swastika and no one bats an eye.

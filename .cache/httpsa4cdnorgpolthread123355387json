It&#039;s a long story, but trust me, only reason Lucent and 4 other big corps were involved in 666 and tied to Kush&#039;s is only because we had been promised lease lock for 10 years if we committed to move in, which guaranteed tenants and ROI to Kushner&#039;s if they were going to pull the trigger on such a hefty price tag for the space. Us 4 companies and the commitment upfront, made it worth them buying it knowing they&#039;d immediately start returning investment and they promised a 6 mo. full rehab w\/ cool amenities (like upgraded cafeterias w\/good vendors, on-site dry cleaning and childcare services, etc.) which were great, unheard of perks at the time. <br><br>There are no ties directly between Kushner&#039;s and Lucent other than that. <br><br>However remember, Jared is only who he is b\/c his dad handed him his Harvard degree, and first job at Goldman through political ties and large campaign contributionsin exchange for some predominant recommendations. It&#039;s actually why Bannon hates the family. Bannon followed the same path it got everything he did, on his own. <br><br>Kushner graduated from HS w\/ a 2.83 GPA an no more than 1200 SAT score. When his dad Charles had been found guilty and was sentenced, he signed of 3\/4ths of all liquid assets and ownerships to Jared. Other 1\/4th was split between his wife and their other son, Josh. This was to protect themselves from outside attempts to put leans against assets while Charles was imprisoned. Lots of wealthy people do this. <br><br>Most important thing to remember is that Jared is a puppet of his dad. If you want to dig into something worth value, look into the ties of his dad, Charles and equally important, Charles&#039;s dad, who was also very wealthy and immigrated to NJ in 1949 post WWII, much to the displeasure of the Jewish elite of the time, who&#039;d resettled in, what would later officially become, Israel.

Lots of people who&#039;ve run in these circles know these things and predominant people, talk a lot about predominant people. NYC is like a giant dick contest when it comes to these guys. It&#039;s all a race for status, as you could probably imagine. Who makes what, fucks what, lives where, drives what, vacations where and with whom, owns what, knows who, etc. When you get to that kind of success level, it becomes much harder to tear someone&#039;s financial success and established clout down, so instead, they whip out their dick sticks, swinging away at eachother&#039;s character and how they got to where they are.

I&#039;ve always said these people&#039;s worst enemies ARE their best friends. Hell even family. Charles Kushner blackmailed his own bro-in-law by hiring a prostitute, getting him drunk, taking him to a hotel so he could snag video of him fucking her, all so he could send it to his sister, to extort him and his shares, out of their family business.

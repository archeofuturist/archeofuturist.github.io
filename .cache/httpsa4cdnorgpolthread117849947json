The jury ruled on Monday that his civil rights had been violated.<br><br>He was sent back to the medical unit, where the medical staff believed he was suffering from \u201cpsychosomatic paralysis\u201d and suggested that he be placed in the video-monitored cell. He was not seen by a doctor until Oct. 25, when he was dragged on a blanket into the cell.","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-03-22 at 7.44.04 PM","ext":".png","w":1734,"h":1032,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":148,"tim":1490226304816,"time":1490226304,"md5":"lpgE\/tDZ7kqFvtxC7Fvc4g==","fsize":2453484,"resto":0,"id":"9tel4Ehr","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"black-man-dies-after-left-in-jail-cell-with","country_name":"United States","replies":20,"images":1,"unique_ips":18},{"no":117850564,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)19:48:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117849947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117849947<\/a><br>bump","time":1490226537,"resto":117849947,"id":"0fUR4Ypb","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117850878,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)19:51:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117849947\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117849947<\/a><br>jail or prison is the last place you want to be sick or injured in <br><br>they do like this and neglect or when you do get a doctor they dont give a fuck and do the minimum","time":1490226663,"resto":117849947,"id":"wyGVan2I","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117853374,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)20:08:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117850878\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117850878<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;not wasting resourses on a nigger in prison<\/span><br>It&#039;s for the best.","time":1490227682,"resto":117849947,"id":"1pAA+Ce2","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117853683,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)20:10:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117853374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117853374<\/a><br>haha yeah it&#039;s for the best, now &quot;for the best&quot; taxpayers will shell out $10 million to his family after they sue the police department because it&#039;s &quot;for the best&quot;.","time":1490227807,"resto":117849947,"id":"1GK51z0q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117855786,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)20:24:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117853683\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117853683<\/a><br>And the family will blow it on weed, rims, diamond ear rings and probably use a couple million to start up a rap studio, they certainly won&#039;t help their own people or community.","time":1490228661,"resto":117849947,"id":"W+XxlqYp","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117857127,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)20:33:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117853374\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117853374<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;nigger<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;army veteran<\/span>","time":1490229230,"resto":117849947,"id":"6JRaFfNh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117857188,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)20:34:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117855786\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117855786<\/a><br><br>Cool.

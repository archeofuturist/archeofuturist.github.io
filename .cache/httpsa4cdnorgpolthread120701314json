The feds are relentless about their taxes, they will find a way to break you eventually. You should also file because otherwise they file FOR YOU and they always file super high for you in your absense. They literally had me filed for twice my income and twice the tax penalty and were charging me double interest than what I should have been paying until I filed my own return and fixed things. Also that registered letter means they&#039;re tacking on 20% for failing to respond to that letter within 90 day (I think). Oh and they charge you 9% interest on everything you owe them.<br><br>Not a tax lawyer, but I did manage to fuck myself pretty hard on taxes that I took a while to work clear of.","time":1491972001,"resto":120701314,"id":"Ub\/E2yUK","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120714640,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)00:40:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120714442\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120714442<\/a><br>There are plenty of other countries you could move to.","time":1491972034,"resto":120701314,"id":"Bv+BaLzf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120714706,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)00:41:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"Drain the IRS<br><br>http:\/\/www.judicialwatch.org\/press-<wbr>room\/press-releases\/judicial-watch-<wbr>obtains-695-pages-obama-irs-scandal<wbr>-documents-records-not-produced-ini<wbr>tial-congressional-investigation\/<br><br><br>Impeach Koskinen<br><br>http:\/\/thehill.com\/policy\/finance\/3<wbr>27855-gop-lawmakers-send-another-le<wbr>tter-urging-trump-to-fire-irs-chief<wbr>","time":1491972069,"resto":120701314,"id":"eYyo1ESP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120714837,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)00:42:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"What I never understood was:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Customer spends money at a company, pays sales tax<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Company reports revenue, pays tax<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Uses that money to pay employees, pays payroll tax<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Employees collect payment, pay federal income tax<\/span><br><br>Every transaction is taxed 3 or 4 fucking times","time":1491972157,"resto":120701314,"id":"NVU+WhFP","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120714910,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)00:43:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120713089\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120713089<\/a><br>muh","time":1491972205,"resto":120701314,"id":"u6Z1W1Dd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120715206,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)00:45:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120701314\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120701314<\/a><br>pay up goy","time":1491972356,"resto":120701314,"id":"zxrgZtgT","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":120715236,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)00:46:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"You pay the gubmit because you live under their roof and by proxy have their full protection.

The feds are relentless about their taxes, they will find a way to break you eventually. You should also file because otherwise they file FOR YOU and they always file super high for you in your absense. They literally had me filed for twice my income and twice the tax penalty and were charging me double interest than what I should have been paying until I filed my own return and fixed things. Also that registered letter means they&#039;re tacking on 20% for failing to respond to that letter within 90 day (I think).

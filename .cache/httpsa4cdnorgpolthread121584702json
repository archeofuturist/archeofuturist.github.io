Everything everyone was doing made no sense. Everything was going bad for me, acted out by people I trusted, against my interests, but most strangely for NO REASON. Could not think of any REASON they would do that, not even to suspect them of sabotage or spitefulness. It was as though the whole normies world had gone into a non-sequitur confusion. <br>Something happened last week when Trump joined ISIS. Why is Trump now leader of ISIS?","filename":"159k1j","ext":".jpg","w":690,"h":388,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492464283790,"time":1492464283,"md5":"YqjAnXX5q\/UMUW7SYA4gHw==","fsize":81709,"resto":0,"id":"OAkiMrz9","country":"CR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"did-you-just-have-a-very-strange-week","country_name":"Costa Rica","replies":2,"images":1,"unique_ips":2},{"no":121585091,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)17:27:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121584702\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121584702<\/a>","filename":"1492359691117","ext":".png","w":728,"h":6714,"tn_w":13,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492464456965,"time":1492464456,"md5":"fRbNqDXIW5mRxppvg2q3Ow==","fsize":1157642,"resto":121584702,"id":"hlgUonY6","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121585671,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)17:31:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121585091\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121585091<\/a><br>Thanks, <br>I will get back to you with the DJT\/Bibi version of it.

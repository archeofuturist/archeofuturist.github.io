During most of their history, they have lacked a homeland and were forced to survive by ingratiating themselves with the powerful and putting them at their service. Their intelligence is likely due to the jealous way they preserve their religion and zealousness with which they study their scriptures. This has been going on for three thousand years. Their superiority complex as a clan comes with an inclination to ruse out and rip off the pleb of the communities that welcome them and accumulating wealth sometimes at the expense of said communities. This has caused much resentment against their caste over the centuries and has brought them close to extermination, particularly in times of trouble and high social inequality.

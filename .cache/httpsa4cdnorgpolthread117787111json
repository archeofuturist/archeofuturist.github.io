You want my confession? Here it is. Yes, I support the FSA. Wanna know why? I first started going on demonstrations in Grade 8 after I got my head put through a wall by this arrogant fuck. I had no friends, I had no social contact whatsoever. FSA filled the void that being able to go an entire day without opening my mouth once had left in my brain. YPG didn&#039;t exist at the time. With FSA I developed an interest in islam, arabic, beheadings, and recently svbieds. I&#039;m glad that you feel so secure and loved . I&#039;m glad that you&#039;re part of a community like the FSA where everyone is so well adjusted you don&#039;t ever feel the need to call someone a stupid degenerate fucking goy because they&#039;re being a total fucking retard. I&#039;m glad that you&#039;re so fucking well adjusted that you don&#039;t feel the need to jump in and call that guy a cunt and a nigger and everything else you can think up. So I&#039;m sorry I go support the FSA. I&#039;m sorry if that offends you. I wish I didn&#039;t have to. I wish communities like this wouldn&#039;t throw people like me out because we&#039;re not secular enough and not civil enough. I&#039;m sorry every second word out of my mouth is nigger and every third one is faggot. I&#039;m sorry that the only people who want to talk to me are islamists, kikes and losers. But I&#039;m also sorry that you&#039;ll never be exposed to a community that&#039;s violent, acerbic and barbed and you&#039;ll never grow a skin thick enough to matter. I&#039;m sorry that you&#039;ll never come to the realisation that ignoring things doesn&#039;t make them go away. I&#039;m especially sorry that you&#039;ll never have the discussion that I did with a man who, despite being a convicted gay basher, has three wifes and five kids that he loves very much that made me realise that as much as I disagree with him, and as strongly as I disagree with him, he&#039;s still a person who has his viewpoint for a reason and I need to engage with him regardless of his background or mine.","time":1490201701,"resto":117787111,"id":"77NNR2EV","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"},{"no":117787793,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)12:55:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"As an American, what should I know about this war.","time":1490201751,"resto":117787111,"id":"PeS8dl6o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117787871,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)12:56:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"Anyone else getting tired of these shills?

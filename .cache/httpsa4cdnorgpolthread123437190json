Mr. Cohen said his horror of Mr. Trump almost made him understand how Tea Partyers might have felt under President Barack Obama. \u201cI want my country back!\u201d he said, echoing the right\u2019s rallying cry.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;For decades, Democrats have envied the Republicans\u2019 passionate, locally attuned base.

We prefer scientific evidence and rational analysis. The Right consists of many idealogues, who are governed by greed, hatred, and a reflexive dismissal of factual discussion.

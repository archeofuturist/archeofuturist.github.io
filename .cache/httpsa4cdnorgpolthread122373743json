I had my hair long and wore metal band tees, while the rest of the school was normally skater, emo, or some light\/casual\/preppy variant of that. I considered everyone else a poser and was pretty much alone because of this. I didn&#039;t want to be like them. Truth is, I should have, as I would have had a significantly better social life if I would have just bullshitted and pretended to like CKY and My Chemical Romance.<br><br>Then, when I got to college, I gave in. I lost weight, cut my hair, and adopted their image for a few years. Luckily even though I was early 20&#039;s, I looked much younger than my age and managed to score plenty of teen pussy. My social life increased. Cute girls were into me, I got invited to parties, MILFs at bars found me cute. Even had better job opportunities. <br><br>Around early-mid 20&#039;s, that charm started to wear off. My social life went from hot shit to washed up, so to speak. True adulthood kicked in and responsibilities ate up my time. I also felt imperfect. This affected my health (starving myself)<br><br>Fast forward to today, and I&#039;m calming down, wanting stability, a future, a wife, etc. However, I went back to partying, and put a bit of money into trivial shit. Cosplay, raves, drinking. However, being older, I thought I&#039;d no-longer get the good life. In fact, growing older as a male has benefits lately. I don&#039;t look &quot;emo&quot; ish anymore, my hair has somewhat grown long again from being lazy, I look a tad older (more defined) and I thought I&#039;d be left with older gross women. The reality is, my social life is improving with age. Thanks to this weird daddy-dom kink that&#039;s so popular with girls lately, girls as young as 18 are wanting me. I guess being older is attractive. <br><br>I&#039;ve also made more money with age.

Millenials avoid commitment like the plague - I think that&#039;s why polyamory is flourishing. No home, no dog, no wife, no kids ... what&#039;s the fucking point in life?

Now I want out, want to meet people, but have no idea how. <br><br>I sometimes want to kill myself. I feel that I really want off the ride, but then I think, I don&#039;t really have much reason to leave. I hate it.","filename":"01e034c1a05d429f84fb847aa058e569","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":410,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":106,"tim":1492924161061,"time":1492924161,"md5":"bsj8v5epcAW3NFMxfKFM+g==","fsize":11981,"resto":122373743,"id":"PFLGJ2nF","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122383602,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)01:11:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122383376\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122383376<\/a><br>I got roped into moving a coworker out his apartment once and the other guy was a literal drifter who lived out of his car and he seemed happier then I have ever been in my entire life.","time":1492924284,"resto":122373743,"id":"eiChHeL3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122383700,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)01:12:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122373743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122373743<\/a><br><br>I had a small group of &quot;outkast stoners&quot; during high school <br><br>Didnt care too much for the future then<br><br>We all still hang out and have a drink &quot;no bud&quot; <br><br>All grew up and got a life of our own with seperate paths but we all align about once every few weeks to escape the grind..<br><br>Myself i got a trade and finished it then got moved up in the company as a specialist, cant complain just waiting to buy a home have a kid and then die honestly","time":1492924352,"resto":122373743,"id":"beSjBKDt","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":122383726,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)01:12:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122383309\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122383309<\/a><br>I want to own land and farm too, my problem is I don&#039;t see how you can sustain that lifestyle financially. The only way I can see it is if either you have a lot of savings and drastically cut down on your expenses and live off of what you&#039;ve saved, if you own something that gives you income like leasing apartments or if you have a job that you can do from home then do the farming on the side. Or if you don&#039;t mind a 2 hour commute per day then I supposed you could just own your land and live on it and work your normal job.","time":1492924368,"resto":122373743,"id":"oMqdVrzu","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122383770,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)01:13:20","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122382954\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122382954<\/a><br>I never really felt like I belonged in Vermont. Sure I was happy my family is doing well upper middle class but I feel like I don&#039;t belong. Who knows. Maybe if I met some of you guys and ask you for some wisdom then maybe life would not be so shit. I am 19 so I don&#039;t know a lot by finding out knowledge from those who have lived longer then me I feel a task achomplished. Like something productive was finished and I feel genuine happiness. That&#039;s the reason why I feel like I want to connect to everyone here despite being a newfag. With the world out there you can expect repetive shit. But with you guys I literally learn something new everyday. It&#039;s because of you guys that my faith in god has reignited. Because if you guys exist, despite your shortcomings and understand what wrong with the world and want to change it, then maybe there is a god out there that can guide me towards the right path. Sorry for the long text. Just thank you all.","time":1492924400,"resto":122373743,"id":"MCD6ihQh","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122383912,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)01:14:52","name":"Anonymous","filename":"18052899_1523844280973484_142436455_n","ext":".png","w":741,"h":411,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":69,"tim":1492924492170,"time":1492924492,"md5":"Z0KghG1YSeQ0YB1YiI7\/Cw==","fsize":362595,"resto":122373743,"id":"npRUUYEy","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

I had my hair long and wore metal band tees, while the rest of the school was normally skater, emo, or some light\/casual\/preppy variant of that. I considered everyone else a poser and was pretty much alone because of this. I didn&#039;t want to be like them. Truth is, I should have, as I would have had a significantly better social life if I would have just bullshitted and pretended to like CKY and My Chemical Romance.<br><br>Then, when I got to college, I gave in. I lost weight, cut my hair, and adopted their image for a few years. Luckily even though I was early 20&#039;s, I looked much younger than my age and managed to score plenty of teen pussy. My social life increased. Cute girls were into me, I got invited to parties, MILFs at bars found me cute. Even had better job opportunities. <br><br>Around early-mid 20&#039;s, that charm started to wear off. My social life went from hot shit to washed up, so to speak. True adulthood kicked in and responsibilities ate up my time. I also felt imperfect. This affected my health (starving myself)<br><br>Fast forward to today, and I&#039;m calming down, wanting stability, a future, a wife, etc. However, I went back to partying, and put a bit of money into trivial shit. Cosplay, raves, drinking. However, being older, I thought I&#039;d no-longer get the good life. In fact, growing older as a male has benefits lately. I don&#039;t look &quot;emo&quot; ish anymore, my hair has somewhat grown long again from being lazy, I look a tad older (more defined) and I thought I&#039;d be left with older gross women. The reality is, my social life is improving with age. Thanks to this weird daddy-dom kink that&#039;s so popular with girls lately, girls as young as 18 are wanting me. I guess being older is attractive. <br><br>I&#039;ve also made more money with age.

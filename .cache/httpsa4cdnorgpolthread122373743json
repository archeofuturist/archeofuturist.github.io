I had my hair long and wore metal band tees, while the rest of the school was normally skater, emo, or some light\/casual\/preppy variant of that. I considered everyone else a poser and was pretty much alone because of this. I didn&#039;t want to be like them. Truth is, I should have, as I would have had a significantly better social life if I would have just bullshitted and pretended to like CKY and My Chemical Romance.<br><br>Then, when I got to college, I gave in. I lost weight, cut my hair, and adopted their image for a few years. Luckily even though I was early 20&#039;s, I looked much younger than my age and managed to score plenty of teen pussy. My social life increased. Cute girls were into me, I got invited to parties, MILFs at bars found me cute. Even had better job opportunities. <br><br>Around early-mid 20&#039;s, that charm started to wear off. My social life went from hot shit to washed up, so to speak. True adulthood kicked in and responsibilities ate up my time. I also felt imperfect. This affected my health (starving myself)<br><br>Fast forward to today, and I&#039;m calming down, wanting stability, a future, a wife, etc. However, I went back to partying, and put a bit of money into trivial shit. Cosplay, raves, drinking. However, being older, I thought I&#039;d no-longer get the good life. In fact, growing older as a male has benefits lately. I don&#039;t look &quot;emo&quot; ish anymore, my hair has somewhat grown long again from being lazy, I look a tad older (more defined) and I thought I&#039;d be left with older gross women. The reality is, my social life is improving with age. Thanks to this weird daddy-dom kink that&#039;s so popular with girls lately, girls as young as 18 are wanting me. I guess being older is attractive. <br><br>I&#039;ve also made more money with age.

Millenials avoid commitment like the plague - I think that&#039;s why polyamory is flourishing. No home, no dog, no wife, no kids ... what&#039;s the fucking point in life?

Trolling was an art, conversations were a lot more entertaining, and no one really took anything seriously. &quot;Internet SRS BUSINESS.&quot; was a constant phrase used when people were taking things a little too seriously. Fast forward to now. It seems like only idiots litter the internet and they constantly have to push their stupid, insignificant, opinions on everyone and god forbid you speak out against them or tease them for being silly or stupid. Its a different world now. Now I dont really connect with anyone online anymore. I connect better with people in person and at the bar down the road. I come here because the bantz sometimes remind me of a better time. Also because its the only place online I can go on about how much I hate socialists and communists.

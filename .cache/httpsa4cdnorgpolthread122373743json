I feel so out of place in the world. Life seems so pointless and like people just work, do drugs, eat, shit, have sex, party maybe, use entertainment and then die. I&#039;m not really sure what being an adult has to offer. Being a teenager and child seems like a much more happy time to me. Even high school, although I hated it at the time, seems great looking back on it. Every time I feel like I&#039;m wasting my life, I try for a little while to fix it, and it just seems pointless, and I go back to wasting my life.","filename":"1492889816153","ext":".jpg","w":687,"h":855,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492918626318,"time":1492918626,"md5":"n8la7bjK6oZhBlweSWjN9Q==","fsize":100106,"resto":0,"id":"VSY++jxp","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"am-i-missing-something","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":2,"unique_ips":9},{"no":122373888,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:38:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122373743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122373743<\/a><br>post feet with timestamp","time":1492918706,"resto":122373743,"id":"EzRnNWv5","country":"RS","country_name":"Serbia"},{"no":122374082,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)23:40:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122373743\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122373743<\/a><br>Happiest time of my life was probably from ages 6-12.

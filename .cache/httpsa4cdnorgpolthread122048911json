We give the police the power to decide over life and death, and we trust them with that responsibility. I think if we give them that kind of power it&#039;s common sense to scrutinize every case where they decide to use their guns very deeply. There&#039;s no way a cop is ever not gonna use a gun to defend his life because of the paperwork, if he is truly in a deadly situation he will use his gun. Also I don&#039;t think the defence that &quot;I wasn&#039;t trying to kill him&quot; flies here. Shooting someone in the leg is considered a reasonable amount of force in that case.

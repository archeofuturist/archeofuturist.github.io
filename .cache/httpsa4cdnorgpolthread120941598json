President Trump says it is bad. Russia agrees. All the pundits agree too.<br><br>So it must be true, right?<br><br>In the 2nd dimension \u2013 where things are just the way they look \u2013 it does seem that the U.S. and Russia are in a bad place with each other. <br><br>The United States attacked Russia\u2019s little buddy, Assad, for allegedly using chemical weapons. But Russia says Assad didn\u2019t use chemical weapons. Now Russia is mad at the United States.<br><br>Maybe the situation is exactly what I just described.<br><br>But just for fun, let\u2019s hop up to the 3rd dimension (of persuasion) and see what the view looks like.<br><br>Hopping up now. Looking around\u2026<br><br>Okay, it looks different from here. In the 3rd dimension, the smartest thing for both Trump and Putin to say right now is that relations between Russia and the U.S. are terrible\u2026 while not thinking it is true in any practical sense.<br><br>For Trump, pretending to have bad relations with Russia solves for his\u201cPuppet of Putin\u201d problem while giving him room to improve.","filename":"trump-laughing","ext":".jpg","w":1000,"h":600,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":150,"tim":1492107554685,"time":1492107554,"md5":"jDHtDFSVTFOlymRKnN8g9A==","fsize":318982,"resto":0,"id":"AUduij5q","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-playing-level-9000-waifu-simulator","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0,"unique_ips":1},{"no":120941666,"now":"04\/13\/17(Thu)14:19:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120941598\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120941598<\/a><br>He\u2019s setting the bar as low as the bar will go. And he gets a free pass on Russian relations right now because public opinion in the United States is supportive of the Syrian strike. Later, when relations with Russia improve, it will look like progress. Trump wins now, and he wins later too.<br><br>Luckily for President Trump, Putin also has an incentive to pretend that relations with the United States are strained. He needs to put up a strong front because of all the usual reasons countries act tough. Given the circumstances, I\u2019d say Russia is acting restrained.<br><br>The United States and Russia are what I call\u201cnatural allies.\u201d We have some common problems to solve (notably ISIS), and no natural problems with each other, such as claims to the same territory, or a long history of shooting wars against each other. And both countries are super-pragmatic.<br><br>The smartest play right now for both Trump and Putin (two Master Persuaders) is to claim relations between their countries are in the basement and can\u2019t get much worse. That quiets the haters without creating any real risk of a trade war or a shooting war. Everyone gets what they need in this situation. And when relations improve \u2013 which they will \u2013 everyone gets to take credit for it.","time":1492107591,"resto":120941598,"id":"AUduij5q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}

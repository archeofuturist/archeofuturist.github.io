Antifa wants Trump supporters to play by the rules, and to &quot;let the cops handle the violence&quot;, because A) Antifa doesn&#039;t follow any rules except what they think they can get away with, and B) they know beforehand that the cops won&#039;t defend Trump supporters like they&#039;re legally required to, since the mayor gave a stand-down order. <br>Antifa has no shame and they don&#039;t care that they&#039;re hypocrites when they act faux outraged over &quot;innocent&quot; girls getting punched &quot;for no reason&quot;, yet have no problem whatsoever throwing explosive firecrackers into a crowd of people, or literally sneaking up on a person who was just talking and hitting them over the head with a metal lock. <br><br>The ONLY thing that Antifa and their ilk will respect is violence. You will NEVER convince them with rational debate, or with some logical and clever meme. The time for reasoned discussion is OVER. Trump supporters have a legal and constitutional right to hold rallies, marches, etc., but anyone who shows up thinking the police will protect them are NAIVE. If you&#039;re stupid enough to show up to a Trump rally and not have a gun, or at least SOME means of protecting yourself from rabid leftists, then sorry to say but you KINDA deserve whats coming to you. Antifa are literally the enemy at this point, they don&#039;t care about rule of law, they just want to hurt\/kill you. You don&#039;t debate with Orcs, you KILL orcs and bash their ugly face in with a bat.","filename":"giphy","ext":".gif","w":500,"h":180,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":90,"tim":1492403510090,"time":1492403510,"md5":"AawzrGGLgfgmRcbfD\/GkPA==","fsize":1019970,"resto":0,"id":"3n8ORg\/N","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"friendly-reminder","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0,"unique_ips":1}]}

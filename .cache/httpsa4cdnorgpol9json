Thereby I propose n\u00fc-nazism as a rejuvenation of the old and stagnant movement of nazism and neo-nazism.<br>N\u00fc-nazism will be more broad-sighted and encompassing, involving not only the works of famous nazis, but also encompassing the way nazi people lived their lives and learning from their mistakes. My aim with this movement to create a modern and tolerant face of the old ideology to keep up with the times.<br><br>The basic tenets will be such:<br>-Acceptance of homosexuality and civil unions<br>-Free Recreational drug use with taxes<br>-Nationalization of key industries (agriculture, infrastructure, e.g.)<br>-Modernization of healthcare, because our people deserve the best treatment possible<br>-Rekindling pride in being part of such a vibrant world<br>-Protection of jewish people and other vulnerable minorities<br>-Increased funding for modern arts with revolutionary techniques<br>-Increasing funding for cultural institutions, especially for minority cultures<br>-Community-centric approach to problems<br>-Strong central government to lead the people and work for their well-being<br>-Strong and diverse army to protect peace at home and abroad. Everybody can chip in something for the defense of the country, regardless of ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity and mental or physical shortcomings.<br>-Religious education classes, with a wide range of religions to choose from<br><br>If anybody has some ideas what could make our ideology more friendly and popular, please share below.","filename":"1385564799114","ext":".jpg","w":1708,"h":2126,"tn_w":200,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493111306599,"time":1493111306,"md5":"nmb5cL5U3UxkkdrpbZYPLQ==","fsize":782709,"resto":0,"id":"4RbCSPCG","country":"HU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nnazism-rejuvenation-of-the-old-ways","country_name":"Hungary","replies":8,"images":3,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":2},{"no":122715260,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)05:12:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122715007\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122715007<\/a><br>I for one, am very interested in this subject.","time":1493111549,"resto":122715007,"id":"y0cPT7En","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122715290,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)05:13:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122715139\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122715139<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;want&#039;s old school nazism<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;no muslims<\/span><br>Are you retarded ?","time":1493111581,"resto":122715007,"id":"pL8j+DlX","country":"BA","country_name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"no":122715638,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)05:18:35","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122715099\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122715099<\/a><br>Killing R\u00f6hm was a huge mistake.<br><br><a href=\"#p122715260\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122715260<\/a><br>Please share &amp; repost then.<br>We can only start this movement if people like you spread it.","time":1493111915,"resto":122715007,"id":"4RbCSPCG","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":122715888,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)05:22:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Anime is a redpilled as fuck and a good medium to spread ideas.","filename":"1411472904520","ext":".jpg","w":520,"h":537,"tn_w":121,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493112162682,"time":1493112162,"md5":"4BXuZ+VrJ5RelR1v9YyiGg==","fsize":57878,"resto":122715007,"id":"4RbCSPCG","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":122716001,"now":"04\/25\/17(Tue)05:24:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"Are bronies welcome?<br><br><a href=\"#p122715888\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122715888<\/a><br>Majestic trips.","filename":"1491050742959","ext":".png","w":1024,"h":1024,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493112255280,"time":1493112255,"md5":"4cSFXesYBE5fIU8\/L+qWug==","fsize":615381,"resto":122715007,"id":"PqbOVHwq","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122677342,"now":"04\/24\/17(Mon)22:19:11","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/CPD\/ CHICAGO PD SCANNER THREAD - ALMOST REAL ROBERT HOURS EDITION","com":"FOR YOUR LISTENING PLEASURE<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;CPD Dispatch Stream: <\/span><br>http:\/\/www.broadcastify.com\/listen\/<wbr>feed\/763\/web<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Same feed with ambient music:<\/span><br>http:\/\/youarelistening.to\/chicago<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;For Ambiance: <\/span><br>https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/sithdemonic\/<wbr>sets\/newwaveretro <br><br>Zone-6 (isolated scanner of worst area)<br>http:\/\/www.broadcastify.com\/listen\/<wbr>feed\/13262<br><br>#### #### #### #### #### #### #### ####<br><br>BACK THE BLUE<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Get Behind the Vest donation drive: <\/span><br>http:\/\/www.getbehindthevest.org\/<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Chicago cops aren&#039;t even issued fucking armor by their shithole city. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;The Chicago Police Department Memorial Fund (ALSO GET SOME SWEET SWEET MERCH):<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.cpdmemorial.org\/<br><br>#### #### #### #### #### #### #### ####<br><br>CHICAGO&#039;S K\/D RATIO:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Shootings ScoreboardS:<\/span><br>http:\/\/heyjackass.com<br>http:\/\/crime.chicagotribune.com\/chi<wbr>cago\/shootings\/<br>http:\/\/crime.chicagotribune.com\/chi<wbr>cago\/homicides\/<br>http:\/\/homicides.suntimes.com\/<br><br>#### #### #### #### #### #### #### ####<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Chicago Racial Demographics:<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.radicalcartography.net\/i<wbr>ndex.html?chicagodots<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Chiraq Gangland Map:<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.wbez.org\/shows\/wbez-new<wbr>s\/in-chicago-gangs-abound-but-where<wbr>-are-they\/0d956c2e-171a-483a-8666-f<wbr>5228d98812d<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Police Codes:<\/span><br>http:\/\/www.bearcat1.com\/radioil.htm<wbr><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&gt;Chicago Police Dept.

I finally understand why Trump supporters are fighting to get things changed... you guys and girls are fighting because we can&#039;t afford the same bullshit over and over again and even though I might not really feel %100 confident in Trump because I just feel he&#039;s not totally honest about everything, it&#039;s more of the goals and actionable path that this administration is taking away from the same old song and dance, it&#039;s the overall message to the world and not necessarily just Trump...

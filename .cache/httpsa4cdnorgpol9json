I mean, I guess it\u2019s fun making fun of people because of your own insecurities, but you all take to a whole new level. This is even worse than jerking off to pictures on facebook.<br>Don\u2019t be a stranger. Just hit me with your best shot. I\u2019m pretty much perfect. I was captain of the football team, and starter on my basketball team. What sports do you play, other than \u201cjack off to naked drawn Japanese people\u201d? I also get straight A\u2019s, and have a banging hot girlfriend (She just blew me; Shit was SO cash).

all human populations are genetically similar, the new work concludes that populations from different parts of the world share even more genetic similarities than previously assumed.<br>All humans are 99.9 per cent identical and, of that tiny 0.1 per cent difference, 94 per cent of the variation is among individuals from the same populations and only six per cent between individuals from different

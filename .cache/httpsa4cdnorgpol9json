Germany is lost. <br>Shit Germany doesnt even have a rightwing option, so there you go. <br>Stop shilling European political affairs. It&#039;s never going to change. We will become islamic and you be like it. <br>Let&#039;s instead think of ways we can ensure that Islam serves our needs, a kind of european islam. <br><br>Fact: There are many different versions of Islam. There is no reason why Islam has to be shit. <br><br>Fact: The Quran does not contain any reference to pedo Mohammad, his wifes or anything like that. <br><br>So don&#039;t act like Islam is some unsalvageable mess.

He called it the last man and the religion of comfortableness. Upon his announcement that God was dead and that we had murdered him our forefathers searched the news papers for happenings in vain as we do today here on \/pol\/. We wait and wait for something anything we don&#039;t quite know what we are waiting for but we believe we will know it when we see it. I had believed that Jung was right when he said, &quot;Christianity split the Germanic barbarian into an upper and a lower half, and enabled him, by repressing the dark side, to domesticate the brighter half and fit it for civilization. But the lower, darker half still awaits redemption and a second spell of domestication. Until then, it will remain associated with the vestiges of the prehistoric age, with the collective unconscious, which is subject to a peculiar and ever-increasing activation. As the Christian view of the world loses its authority, the more menacingly will the \u201cblond beast\u201d be heard prowling about in its underground prison, ready at any moment to burst out with devastating consequences. When this happens in the individual it brings about a psychological revolution, but it can also take a social form.&quot; But I now understand what Fyodor Dostoevsky meant by man as a piano key. There is no need to domesticate us if our women can be domesticated. That is what has occurred and continues to occur. We have intellectualized life. We have rationalized our extinction. We have become ok with it. We are now piano keys.","filename":"th","ext":".jpg","w":266,"h":300,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493886060086,"time":1493886060,"md5":"HWkTyeVGJKYM7r1glggkPw==","fsize":7456,"resto":124029758,"id":"Z3M4Lt87","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124039074,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)04:36:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;0%<\/span>","filename":"hillary trump xcom","ext":".jpg","w":680,"h":645,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1493886993432,"time":1493886993,"md5":"EniAGzJxxClmbXjI22Dzow==","fsize":51961,"resto":124029758,"id":"EQ0O+8PC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124043827,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)05:46:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124033653\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124033653<\/a><br>Well said!","time":1493891197,"resto":124029758,"id":"jUNOISQY","country":"RE","country_name":"R\u00e9union"}]},{"posts":[{"no":124043820,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)05:46:31","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Republicans running ad against Georgia Democrat Jon Ossoff&#039;s college cosplaying","com":"Is this fair, \/pol\/?<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=qg7<wbr>NYk-6JQQ","filename":"TrumpOssoff","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":750,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493891191934,"time":1493891191,"md5":"bLNNY0LYqCInKc9hMb5nDQ==","fsize":70249,"resto":0,"id":"Tjlv3rPO","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"republicans-running-ad-against-georgia-democrat","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":124041106,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)05:07:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"Society: Work, you trash.<br>Me: Ok, I&#039;ll work.<br>Corporation: We are not giving jobs to trashes.<br>Me: Ok, I&#039;ll just kill myself.<br>Society: Don&#039;t kill yourself.<br>Me: Ok, I won&#039;t kill myself.<br>Society: But trashes don&#039;t deserve to live.<br>Me: Ok, now I&#039;ll kill myself.<br>Parents: Please don&#039;t die and work.<br>Me: Ok, I&#039;ll work<br>Corporation: We are not giving jobs to trashes.","filename":"1491919392275","ext":".png","w":664,"h":602,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":226,"tim":1493888849598,"time":1493888849,"md5":"AxMYUBkSP5zOqwthsrZFjw==","fsize":286254,"resto":0,"id":"LB8o4ZWM","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"society-work-you-trash","country_name":"United States","replies":10,"images":3,"omitted_posts":5,"omitted_images":1},{"no":124041631,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)05:14:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124041106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124041106<\/a><br><br>Yes, that&#039;s right, blame everyone and everything else around you for your mistakes.","time":1493889293,"resto":124041106,"id":"LXgTJXa3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124041764,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)05:16:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124041106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124041106<\/a><br>If you cant tell the society to suck you dick and live your life as only you see fit, then you deserve everything that happens to you for being such pathetic obedient beta.","time":1493889402,"resto":124041106,"id":"fiuV51WW","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":124042246,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)05:23:51","name":"Breakroom","com":"It&#039;s not going to fucking kill you to get a job at walmart.

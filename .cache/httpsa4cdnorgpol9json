Their forces are very professional and very effective. As sad as this is for me to say, I&#039;m fairly confident that France would crush us in almost any theatre now. I still think we produce slightly better soldiers, but we have too few of them and every beach of our armed forces is chronically under equipped. The only thing about our military capability that&#039;s improved in the last 20 years is the ability of our MOD and elected officials to bullshit the public into thinking we aren&#039;t a shadow of what we were.

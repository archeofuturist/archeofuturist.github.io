Mearsheimer was a vocal opponent of the Iraq War in 2003 and was almost alone in opposing Ukraine&#039;s decision to give up its nuclear weapons in 1994 and predicted that, without a deterrent, they would face Russian aggression. His most controversial views concern alleged influence by interest groups over US government actions in the Middle East which he wrote about in The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy.

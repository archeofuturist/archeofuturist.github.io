Sky News also reported a fashionable duo have been questioned in relation to the attack. Police spokesman Lars Bystrom said: &quot;I can confirm that we have taken in two stylish men for questioning, but that does not necessary mean that they are suspects.&quot; As many as 15 people were hurt, nine of them seriously, according to the Stockholm County Council. Police late Friday raised the death toll from three to four. Sky News reported that police believed the attacker had run away toward the subway station. All subway traffic was halted. &quot;Sweden has been attacked. Everything points to the fact that this is a terrorist attack,&quot; Lofven told reporters during a visit in western Sweden.

which will imitate the looks and function of a real foreskin- covering and remoistenijg your glans while restoring the sliding mechanism. The nerve endings and specialized structures like the frenulum are gone for good, at least until further breakthroughs in medical technology, but if you&#039;re fortunate you still have at least a partial frenulum remnant left behind.<br><br>It&#039;s a long, slow process- it takes years of tugging. But I cannot recommend it enough- it&#039;s been literally life changing for me, sex easily feels 10 times better than when I started. It&#039;s the fucking shit, every cut man will benefit from growing more excess skin. Start immediately.<br><br>Growing skin cells is actually not all that difficult- when surgeons need to grow extra skin to be used in a skin graf (for example, when someone has suffered from sever burns) they&#039;ll sometimes implant and gradually expand a saline balloon under the skin to grow additional tissue. This is basically jensamw<br>concept- by applying heavy tension to the scar line in your penis you can cause the growth of skin cells and mucosal tissue (the redder, more sensitive skin that would have made up the inside of the foreskin). You create microtears in the tissue that the cells are forced to &quot;heal&quot; via mitosis. It&#039;s real, permanent tissue growth. <br><br>You can search around and check on the foreskin regeneration subeeddit for more info- people will recommend devices but you absolutely don&#039;t need one- doing it by hand works perfectly fine and might actually be better.","time":1492908526,"resto":122353424,"id":"bmax7Yhu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122354063,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)20:46:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Tfw we could have supported a true constitutional conservative like Ted Cruz.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Instead we got the liberal RINO conman Trump<\/span>","filename":"1477510793587","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":453,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":188,"tim":1492908370965,"time":1492908370,"md5":"ZdhlZclIn4xer+OsDiz\/2g==","fsize":154612,"resto":0,"id":"Sa7CPLn6","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"tfw-we-could-have-supported-a-true-constitutional","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":122354342,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)20:48:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;we could have got a huge zionist<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;instead we got a huge zionist<\/span>","filename":"1478760240059","ext":".jpg","w":180,"h":180,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492908505311,"time":1492908505,"md5":"6BGjhc2RlU6h\/29Mb7YGpg==","fsize":6406,"resto":122354063,"id":"Is2UAyGu","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122346705,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)19:42:34","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Why libertardianism doesn&#039;t work","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;live in libertopia&#039;s capital<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a river crosses the city<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;some corporation owns the river banks directly across one another<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;constructs a bridge only 10ft above the waterline<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;shipping stopped forever<\/span><br><br>Is this the Roads 2.0 of libetarianism?","filename":"tmp_30394-2016-04-15T15-12-28.9Z--1280x720812432192","ext":".jpg","w":670,"h":377,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492904554219,"time":1492904554,"md5":"w0861gorOpGX6raf2RChOA==","fsize":29719,"resto":0,"id":"QiSFbG79","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-libertardianism-doesnt-work","country_name":"Canada","replies":10,"images":3,"omitted_posts":5,"omitted_images":1},{"no":122351292,"now":"04\/22\/17(Sat)20:21:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"They would also own the air above it so they&#039;d have to agree to the bridge being built.

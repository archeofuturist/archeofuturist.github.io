I was talking to a white guy about it is alright to have fun with hispanic and asian women, but marry white. I trying to get him to produce white babies. This guy tells me, &quot;I do not like white girls&quot;. When I asked why he&#039;s responds was, &quot;White girls have no ass&quot;. We know the cultural in america forces a false narrative of white men being less masculine (sexual desirable) than other men, but this is the first time I realize white women are also portrayed as less sexually desirable. This get to the bigger picture of race-mixing to strip away culture (race) to control the population. If you can target the majority race in a country by making the opposite sex undesirable to the other sex they will most likely not reproduce with each other or reproduce with less desirable of an other race. This is a double whammy to white people since it has affect on both sexes. <br><br>This is my opinion, but I do think a lot of white people do not realize it is white people they are ultimately after not just white men.

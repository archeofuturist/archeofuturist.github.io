The problem is that if people are left alone and are told &quot;do what makes you happy,&quot; as libertarians prescribe, they eventually spiral into degeneracy: drug use, materialism and greed, free love, having children out of wedlock, etc.<br><br>This leads to the breakdown of the fundamental unit of society, the family. And as the family becomes weaker, the state grows and becomes more powerful to fill that void: welfare, food stamps, money fo dem programs. So, in a sense, libertarianism sows the seeds of its own destruction: it might work out well for a while, but eventually people are going to fuck themselves into a situation where they vote to give the government more power so they can be saved.<br><br>The only way a libertarian society can last is if it has religion, since devout people will naturally do the right things -- only have children in marriage, don&#039;t get divorced, don&#039;t gamble, don&#039;t do drugs, don&#039;t drink to excess, don&#039;t be a greedy fuck -- without the state having to write laws that control society.","filename":"_86785093_istock_000012285352_large","ext":".jpg","w":660,"h":371,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492974889854,"time":1492974889,"md5":"+7oZeqCnW1BaKErBui0XFQ==","fsize":25460,"resto":0,"id":"d2LXb+gG","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-think-its-fair-to-say-we-should-want-a","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":122470203,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)15:20:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"Wew, lad.","filename":"1467912356935","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492975213446,"time":1492975213,"md5":"1OqbdwRFSsr0VUeelpBsEg==","fsize":19238,"resto":122469351,"id":"K0FEdNIu","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122467894,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)15:06:15","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Why the Jews?","com":"Why is this shit posted online I a passive way?

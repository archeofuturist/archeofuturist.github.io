This makes sense as before modern times, travel across distances like that was more or less impossible. So as Europeans were setting up society, they stopped having a need for things like dance circles and whatnot. Meanwhile, they needed things like conformation to societal norms and rules. A self imposed artificial selection of sorts. Developing a strong society and civilization is what Europeans focused on, with things like strong, permanent settlements, farming, career specialization, etc. Meanwhile the people in places like Africa and the New World (think Hispanic) didn&#039;t develop as strong societies and therefore didn&#039;t need as much conformation to societal rules. Drums and dancing remained an important aspect of their societies because it brought them together and whatnot, thereby increasing their likelihood of survival. <br><br>So the lack of focus on advancing civilizations and technologies (such as farming) kept the need for drums as an important aspect of their relatively simplistic societal structures and traditions. So those who could dance and play drums well had a better chance of survival. The focus on drums and simplistic, beating rhythms is what gave rise to the good senses of rhythm (and can be seen in modern African-American music as well). Meanwhile law breakers are bad for advanced societies as a whole. So those not willing to follow the rules of society were weeded out in Europe. <br><br>If you accept this as true, then it becomes apparent that societies that place heavy importance on drums and simplistic music and dancing are more likely to be lawless and have simplistic societies, cultures, civilizations, and technologies. <br><br>Any thoughts, pol?","filename":"warrior dance","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1066,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493536015731,"time":1493536015,"md5":"M2TNMf3Ple5x5dVJMiFXlA==","fsize":388056,"resto":0,"id":"XUPC8CIg","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-i-recently-came-up-with-a-social-theory-that-i","country_name":"United States","replies":48,"images":3,"omitted_posts":43,"omitted_images":3},{"no":123462855,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)06:01:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123449813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123449813<\/a><br>No.<br><br>Human populations always had to endure various inconveniences. What pushed for example - ancient Egyptians - to building civilisation was desertification of Sahara(until about 5000-7000 BC Sahara was like huge savannah), which led to quite huge population of people migrating towards Nile and having to figure out how to cope with this now. They&#039;ve realised the existence of seasonal floods, knew some basic agriculture and made use of those two, building the foundations for the civilisation.<br><br>On the other hand, Bushmens or Capoids were pushed by Bantu from western parts of South Africa, Mozambique and Zimbabwe - all pasture land - to the western parts of SA and Namibia - mostly deserts. This was about the time when whites started settling there.<br><br>Those populations adapted to the new conditions by choosing strategy more common among Africans.<br><br>Instead of trying to find another sources of food(granted, in this region this would be hard), they&#039;ve been half-starving for some 400 years until the only ones that survived are the guys with super-light metabolism which allows them to survive on relatively low amounts of food while maintaining activity.<br><br>This is probably what the general thing black Africans did when Sahara was desertifying. Which is what made them so attractive as slaves - they could do quite a lot of work without being fed well. It&#039;s also why blacks are so obese when in western countries.<br><br>Both strategies have advantages and disadvantages. The African one allows the population to survive regardless of natural resources, but the Egyptian\/MiddleEastern one leads to selection dictated by ability of performing abstract thinking. Good abstract thinkers are able to secure bigger crops, build better melioration systems and survive droughts better.<br><br>The reason why Europeans eventually outcompeted middle Easterns is the fault of - at one side - islam being cult of death - and Europe offering relatively harsher conditions to its inhabitants.","time":1493546483,"resto":123449813,"id":"zS+9Du0L","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":123462972,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)06:03:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123462052\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123462052<\/a><br>1) Heavily rhythmic music makes it easier to dance along in a large communal dance (tribal dances, line dancing, etc). This would help to incorporate as many people as possible, making the experience active instead of passive for the large number of those in the society. <br>2) I never said that Western music wasn&#039;t used for social or political purposes, just that it was no longer required in order to help maintain the societal structure. The societies in Europe wouldn&#039;t fall apart without music, no question about that. But the tribal societies? They would have a harder time, likely needing to resort to some other kind of societal &quot;glue&quot; as it were.<br>3) Political and religious beliefs are at least somewhat responsible for the displacement of the use of music to keep societies together in Europe. They more effectively brought people together, helping to promote larger, more advanced civilizations, and helped to remove teh need in the society for &quot;tribal music&quot; of any sort. That isn&#039;t to say that it eliminated the need or desire for it, but it replaced it enough that it is no longer necessary as it was in the more simplistic societies. <br>4) I have done exactly no research on this topic. Like I said earlier at some point, this is just something that I thought up on the fly. I figured pol would appreciate it, so I posted it. I&#039;m not opposed to researching it at some point, but I don&#039;t have the time right now. If you want to do so, I would appreciate any evidence that you find in favor or opposition to this theory. <br><br>As for why African music relies so heavily on rhythms, I think that it is because it is old, and effective. It likely dates back longer than any modern humans, was easy to do (just beating on things, clapping, stomping basically) and that helped to shape the evolving minds of humans prior to the split that gave rise to European and Asian and New World civilizations, ingraining it in basically all of modern man. It is still effective and easy.","time":1493546582,"resto":123449813,"id":"XUPC8CIg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123463255,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)06:07:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123462052\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123462052<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I disagree both that Western music is not similar in this regard<\/span><br>Perhaps the answer lies in the degree of importance music has to keep people together in small, tribal societies vs large, civilized, modern ones. <br><br>In tribes, community life can almost revolve around music, whereas in &quot;modern&quot; configuration societies it plays a smaller role.

Trudeau wanted to lessen Canada&#039;s reliance on the United States by forging closer ties with other countries and breaking out of the Cold War straitjacket. During a trip to the Soviet Union in 1971 he identified the United States as a bigger threat to Canada than the remote Soviet Union. The Americans, he said, are &quot;a danger to our national identity from a cultural, economic and perhaps even military point of view.&quot; Eventually Trudeau backed away from his &quot;Third Option&quot; policy and returned to the Western fold.

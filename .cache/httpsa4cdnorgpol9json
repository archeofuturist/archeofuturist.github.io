I&#039;m a Republican, and although I wasn&#039;t alive at the time, I would have been upset when the Republican controlled establishment armed moderate Islamic rebels to remove Soviet influence from the Middle East. Now that I lived through the USA doing the same thing again, only this time it was the Democrats attempting to remove Russian influence, I find it shocking to see so many anti-Bush and anti-Reagan individuals get so butthurt that Trump wants to work with Russia to remove ISIS and leave Syria alone. Please be consistent in your world view.","time":1490338181,"resto":118045441,"id":"8L6vLc5K","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118054250,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)02:57:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118050253\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118050253<\/a><br>Doing God&#039;s work there Anon","time":1490338649,"resto":118045441,"id":"gc2hLXFx","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118056562,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)03:31:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118045441\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118045441<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; Implying if KKK Westboro baptist terrorist went out and started lynching niggers you would trip over yourself to defend them<\/span><br>Kill yourself kike.","time":1490340691,"resto":118045441,"id":"X4SszLoW","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118056539,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)03:31:07","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/pol\/ Plays Nations","com":"Let&#039;s play a game, eh \/pol\/?<br><br>Rules:<br>1.)

The word goyim roughly translates to &quot;men of the nations&quot; and it refers to those who bow before the kings of men. Jews are only to bow before God. The problem with bowing to Kings is that it is easy to corrupt one man, and if you give him all the power then all you have to do to crush a nation is to crush that one man. The Jews call you goyim because you are stupid enough to believe that giving ultimate power to one man will somehow benefit you, even though history has proven this to be impossible time and time again.

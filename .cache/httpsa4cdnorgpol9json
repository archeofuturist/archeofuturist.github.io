This measure effectively legalised push-backs from Hungary and denies migrants and refugees the right to seek international protection. As a result of the legalisation of push-backs, in the period between July 5th and December 31st 2016, 19,219 migrants were denied access (prevented from entering or escorted back to the border) at the Hungarian-Serbian border. These people were not only denied the right to apply for international protection, despite most of them coming from war zones such as Syria, Iraq or Afghanistan, but many of them were also physically abused by personnel in uniforms and injured as a consequence, which is described in our report Pushed Back at the Door that appeared on January 25th

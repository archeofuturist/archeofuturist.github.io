I&#039;ll try to keep these points precise and numbered, with a quick rundown on the topics at hand.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 1) Each generation from baby boomers &amp; up is being bombarded with sexualization.<\/span><br>- From social media to magazines to TV to video games to erotic literature, etc., sex has been proven time &amp; time again to be the #1 interest in matured or maturing human beings. <br>- Every day, we are exposed to some form of sexuality. Whether it be browsing the internet &amp; coming across suggesting pictures or even nude pictures, or even going outside and seeing how slutty women dress.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 2) With the decline of religion (mostly Christianity) in the west, sex has become easier to normalize in society.<\/span><br>- Social media apps such as tinder &amp; even apps like instagram\/snapchat\/etc. promote narcissism in women and the steadily available option to have easy casual sex. <br>- Because society is bombarded with sexual content every day, these social media platforms allow society to give into their degenerate desires.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 3) Contraceptives allow for this moral degeneracy to occur without requiring any social responsibility to procreate<\/span><br>- The contraceptive (condoms, birth control pills, plan B) industry thrives off of over sexualization and social media to exist. Without these 2 factors, contraceptives would not be as profitable.<br>- Contraceptives promote the idea of casual sex by ensuring that the risk of having a baby is significantly lowered, as well as the risk of receiving STIs from sexual encounters.<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt; 4) Sexual Intercourse is losing\/has lost it&#039;s meaning of procreation between 2 consenting human beings who truly love each other<\/span><br>- The more that porn &amp; casual sex is normalized, the less emotional sexual intercourse becomes","filename":"1491335189477","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":1280,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491335625044,"time":1491335625,"md5":"Z65HYGpcjCU7YUl+vvIE5w==","fsize":167399,"resto":0,"id":"UJoFoktm","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"sexual-degeneracy","country_name":"United States","replies":57,"images":8,"omitted_posts":52,"omitted_images":8},{"no":119518281,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)17:22:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"Reminder that nofap is a meme and it&#039;s fine to jack off as long as you keep it to once a week, twice a week MAX and no pornography ever.<br><br>Just learn your body&#039;s energy levels and masturbate accordingly.

You want to settle down at that point, which means you don&#039;t want to waste 20 years of your life and get a divorce. So there are are things you can look for in a woman who is going to stay commited. Virgins have only a 10% chance of divorce, whereas higher up on the past partner scale, women with 20+ partners have a 90% chance of divorce. Obviously this is not going to be the only thing to look for, but you should definitely go for a woman with a low partner count if you want to settle down. Don&#039;t do it when you are young, young people are dumb and inexperienced, I know a couple of poeple who got married at around 20 and are already divorced. But marrying a virgin who you really get along with is a good idea.

Asian-Americans, like Jews, are indeed a problem for the \u201csocial-justice\u201d brigade. I mean, how on earth have both ethnic groups done so well in such a profoundly racist society? How have bigoted white people allowed these minorities to do so well \u2014 even to the point of earning more, on average, than whites? Asian-Americans, for example, have been subject to some of the most brutal oppression, racial hatred, and open discrimination over the years. In the late 19th century, as most worked in hard labor, they were subject to lynchings and violence across the American West and laws that prohibited their employment. They were banned from immigrating to the U.S. in 1924. Japanese-American citizens were forced into internment camps during the Second World War, and subjected to hideous, racist propaganda after Pearl Harbor. Yet, today, Asian-Americans are among the most prosperous, well-educated, and successful ethnic groups in America. What gives? It couldn\u2019t possibly be that they maintained solid two-parent family structures, had social networks that looked after one another, placed enormous emphasis on education and hard work, and thereby turned false, negative stereotypes into true, positive ones, could it? It couldn\u2019t be that all whites are not racists or that the American dream still lives?<\/span>","filename":"go_away","ext":".jpg","w":1118,"h":1100,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":245,"tim":1492200209301,"time":1492200209,"md5":"dry06K0aCN\/Ng\/PWCfbZ+Q==","fsize":121136,"resto":0,"id":"Szc5iMJC","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"its-easy-to-mock-this-reductionism-i-know-but-it","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":121105540,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)16:04:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121105412\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121105412<\/a><br><br>Who the fuck cares?<br><br>She is irrelevant now.","time":1492200270,"resto":121105412,"id":"jANRDHXa","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121105509,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)16:04:18","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Seattle the first to go?","com":"What are the chances that Seattle is the first city to receive the NK nuke treatment?

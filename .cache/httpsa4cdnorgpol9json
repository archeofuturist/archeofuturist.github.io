To symbolize this new autonomy and rebirth, he renamed the country from the French colonial Upper Volta to Burkina Faso (&quot;Land of Upright Man&quot;). His foreign policies were centered on anti-imperialism, with his government eschewing all foreign aid, pushing for odious debt reduction, nationalizing all land and mineral wealth, and averting the power and influence of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank. His domestic policies were focused on preventing famine with agrarian self-sufficiency and land reform, prioritizing education with a nationwide literacy campaign, and promoting public health by vaccinating 2.5 million children against meningitis, yellow fever, and measles.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sankara was assasinated in 1987, his body was dismembered and he was quickly buried in an unmarked grave, while his widow Mariam and two children fled the nation. Blaise Compaor\u00e9, the coup perpetrator, immediately reversed the nationalizations, overturned nearly all of Sankara&#039;s policies, rejoined the International Monetary Fund and World Bank to bring in &quot;desperately needed&quot; funds to restore the \u201cshattered\u201d economy, and ultimately spurned most of Sankara&#039;s legacy. Compaor\u00e9&#039;s dictatorship remained in power for 27 years, until it was overthrown by popular protests in 2014.<\/span>","filename":"1492082031471","ext":".jpg","w":634,"h":800,"tn_w":198,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492162349919,"time":1492162349,"md5":"9CfPAz7ZLl4NAm4Nebgjow==","fsize":279686,"resto":0,"id":"V+b0IPHK","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"niggers-getting-btfo","country_name":"United States","replies":34,"images":4,"omitted_posts":29,"omitted_images":2},{"no":121045471,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)06:29:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121042620\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121042620<\/a><br><br>if you think every black person is a stupid heartless psychopath killer than you can&#039;t be engaged with really, you&#039;re beyond reason","time":1492165796,"resto":121041356,"id":"euAdfUU7","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121045590,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)06:31:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121045471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121045471<\/a><br>It&#039;s a reasonable assumption to make for blacks you don&#039;t know, but I do agree, there are a tiny minority who aren&#039;t.","time":1492165898,"resto":121041356,"id":"yMymTOJG","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121048406,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:11:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121045471\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121045471<\/a><br>I agree but in his defense most are.","time":1492168261,"resto":121041356,"id":"2WokYAyY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121049291,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:22:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121045590\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121045590<\/a><br>If thats the case....that black are just born with being more &quot;violent&quot; then that means they can&#039;t be held accountable for their actions, just like a mentally ill person isn&#039;t hold for his..","time":1492168963,"resto":121041356,"id":"ViTlzuys","country":"DK","country_name":"Denmark"},{"no":121050765,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:41:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Idi amin lived a comfy life in north Africa.","time":1492170119,"resto":121041356,"id":"jP3c8XPN","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121043846,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)06:07:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"Why are millennials going the &#039;&#039;spirituality&#039;&#039; route instead of following traditional religion?","filename":"0505050505050","ext":".jpg","w":1440,"h":1324,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":229,"tim":1492164436343,"time":1492164436,"md5":"IrNZHfTnyR+1fsMo+sRPaA==","fsize":274290,"resto":0,"id":"fXxdNTmB","country":"GB","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-are-millennials-going-the-spirituality-route","country_name":"United Kingdom","replies":118,"images":14,"omitted_posts":113,"omitted_images":13,"tail_size":50},{"no":121050522,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:38:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"because traditional religion is a mixture of idolatrous bullshit, empty ritual, dogmatic adherence to books and pagan tier silliness","time":1492169938,"resto":121043846,"id":"KaTQKVFm","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121050535,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:39:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121046268\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121046268<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Most inbred, stupid, fanatical fuckers<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Somehow isn&#039;t describing Murica fuk yas <\/span><br>I bet you&#039;re one of those people who think prosperity doesn&#039;t(or hasn&#039;t) existed as long as Islam reigns too<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;American education<\/span>","time":1492169952,"resto":121043846,"id":"XmT88Nmd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121050651,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:40:31","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121050522\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121050522<\/a><br>oh i almost forgot. all that shit about miracles and cannibalising your god every sunday and mohammed flying on a wing horse, all that supernatural shit that noone with a functioning brain could possibly believe. that puts people off too","time":1492170031,"resto":121043846,"id":"KaTQKVFm","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121050658,"now":"04\/14\/17(Fri)07:40:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121046334\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121046334<\/a><br>You&#039;re mistaken friend, Islam allows for natural hierarchies to take place based upon an individual&#039;s ability.

They needed this PR narrative to distance from voes about little boy prostitutes late night visits to whitehouse during reagan presidency.

However, at the same time, it is claimed that the burial pits went much deeper than 5 meters, otherwise the number of bodies buried would have been much lower than claimed. This apparent contradiction is still in the official narrative.<br><br>There are many more examples documented in those three videos. One of the most eye-opening is that American Pysch Warfare and a Hollywood film director created the display of human skin tattoos, shrunken heads, and skin lampshades at Buchenwald. They got the material from a local university just 10 miles from the camp, where a researcher was writing a study on tattoo culture which was not well understood at the time. Besides that, it goes against Jewish law to get tattoo&#039;d.

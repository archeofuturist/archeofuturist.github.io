Marxism is a culture, that follows the ideas of Marx and Communism. The main point of said culture is the revolution - or in other words, implement communism.<br> Because Marxism, or Cultural Marxism, is a culture, it can be seen in many ideologies. These ideologies are simply different ways of trying to achieve communism. At first, it was about workers taking up arms and fighting the bourgeoisie, today it is about opressed people against straight white males. And in-between these two, there are hundreds of different variations. And every single one of them wants the same things: destroy the traditional culture, control the economy, put the masses against itself, and, at the end, implement communism.<br> On the political side there has been many ideologies that followed Marx. Socialism is one of the most known - and ideology firstly created because people quickly got afraid of communism, once they saw the evil that lurks in it. But soon, people realized that socialism was just the front door of communism, and discarded it. Other ideologies came to take it&#039;s place, and today the most successful of them is the Social Democracy - and ideology that, just like socialism in it&#039;s roots, wants a big government that interferes in every aspect of life, slowly absorbing everything. Once everything has been absorbed, the path is clear for communism.<br> In short:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;It&#039;s social democracy guys, totally not socialism!<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now, let&#039;s tax 25% of your property<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now let&#039;s tax 50% because healthcare, you wanna be healthy right?<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now 70% because you&#039;re too rich!

You also have to realize where they get the DNA to which they compare yours to. For example how do they know you have anglo genes or german genes or jewish genes? They took DNA from people who are from those populations and then they just found what genes are common among them. This means something substantial for the jew genes however, since european jews existed in a bunch of different nations and many interbred with euros till they became fully european, so now some jewish populations dont have jewish blood, but they use their genes anyways as a reference point for what is jewish genes, even if those so called jews are european. Now they take a full blooded euro&#039;s DNA and run a test, and lo and behold some of his genes are similar to the &quot;jew&quot; genes, so they tell him he is part jewish. Its basically all estimates and guesswork based on populations. They cannot determine what genes belong where without referencing a population, and this is a problem because some populations are not what they claim to be.","time":1491183728,"resto":119265407,"id":"9uYTKiIc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119253904,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:19:07","name":"Anonymous","com":"What are the most redpilled scenes in movie history?","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":1440,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491171547694,"time":1491171547,"md5":"XBcmboY5g8yBGyox4yK\/Sg==","fsize":448830,"resto":0,"id":"uj7jb2QM","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-are-the-most-redpilled-scenes-in-movie","country_name":"United States","replies":323,"images":71,"omitted_posts":318,"omitted_images":69,"tail_size":50},{"no":119276316,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)21:56:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119269106\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119269106<\/a><br>This is what I actually got out of the book.

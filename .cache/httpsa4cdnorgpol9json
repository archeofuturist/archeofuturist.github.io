I&#039;m vegan and have been for over 10 years. My wife and kids eat meat.<br>But they never eat ready meals or processed shit. As I said, I&#039;m a baker. I&#039;ve got two shops and supply restaurants. I employ 6 staff. <br>Some of our products contain meat -sausage rolls, pies, for example. I&#039;ll ask one of my employees to taste them for quality. They laugh about getting paid to eat pies. We profit share and I insist upon a pension scheme, I pay \u00a310 per hour. And they get 30 days paid holiday each year.<br>I have organised a work experience system with my daughter&#039;s school, so that for a week a schoolchild can come and visit and work. Gain a reference, and get free bread. I love my job. And I love my community.","time":1490636390,"resto":118526344,"id":"V2TDJAmB","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118536515,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)13:40:44","name":"The triplord formerly known as Not Bomber Rimmer","com":"<a href=\"#p118536417\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118536417<\/a><br>How many times a week?","time":1490636444,"resto":118526344,"id":"Cz\/iGaxo","country":"GB","trip":"!!FJ60XUrqjrt","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118536746,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)13:43:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118535284\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118535284<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;EU law making it hard<\/span><br>By making it hard do you mean legally impossible?","time":1490636583,"resto":118526344,"id":"goW0mZ\/E","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118536823,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)13:43:46","name":"EgonSpengler","com":"<a href=\"#p118535530\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118535530<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;I know but do you think you will become a pioneer of the sport?<\/span><br><br>lel, no way, id be happy making purple belt 5 years deep. \/pol\/ rogan posting over the years got me into it.","time":1490636626,"resto":118526344,"id":"8Y8idCD3","country":"GB","trip":"!lVhJLXYcPw","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":118536976,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)13:45:08","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118536435\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118536435<\/a><br>I remember you posting about your bakery before.

She had no real formal sex education (bible belt) but had seen a porno flick after sneaking into the theater last year. I&#039;m guessing that&#039;s where her knowledge came from because she had some pretty detailed requests, asking me to take off her bra and rub her breast,and in turn she would take off my pants and poke my weiner. We went to her bedroom and she gently tied me to the frame with her bra and took off her underwear. I didn&#039;t know what was going on and I didn&#039;t have any real sexual attraction to my sister but I got a slight chubby and she got on top of me and slid it in her vagina. She told me that she&#039;d do all the work because I didn&#039;t know how and kinda started jumping up and down on my semi.This scared my penis a bit so it became flaccid and she was tired from all the movement so she kinda just laid on top of me with my penis in her for about thirty minutes before she told me to release. I thought she meant pee because I didn&#039;t know how to ejaculate yet so I peed inside her and then she cancelled her date because she thought sex was gross.But in all seriousness we can&#039;t let this guy get the nuclear codes","time":1490120117,"resto":117648297,"id":"0rowPIhM","country":"BD","country_name":"Bangladesh"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117649701,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)13:56:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"BLM apologist Lisa Durden is at my college speaking about media, \/pol\/.

A few weeks ago, my friend and classmate, Tyrone Jackson was brutally beaten by a drunk, white, former cop named Sam Hyde. When the police came, they refused to charge him and let him go, and after looking him up, apparently he&#039;s been getting away with this for a long time! How can he keep getting away with this, and how do we stop men like him from getting away with this?&quot;","time":1490120104,"resto":117649701,"id":"7e7oPXF3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117651720,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)14:14:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=i70<wbr>kIV8g2N0<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this triggers the \/pol\/<\/span>","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":770,"h":590,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":191,"tim":1490120097428,"time":1490120097,"md5":"B0ozvSLvpf5VtIoU990gPg==","fsize":125761,"resto":0,"id":"UeG58O3Z","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"this-triggers-the-pol","country_name":"Canada","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":117647038,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)13:31:30","name":"Anonymous","sub":"DAVID ROCKEFELLER DEAD","com":"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/arti<wbr>cles\/2017-03-20\/david-rockefeller-b<wbr>anker-philanthropist-heir-dies-at-1<wbr>01","filename":"weakfearstrong","ext":".jpg","w":607,"h":608,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":249,"tim":1490117490657,"time":1490117490,"md5":"PaviesTAx2kVg+UDJDOYwA==","fsize":193458,"resto":0,"id":"S5JtbGav","country":"IE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"david-rockefeller-dead","country_name":"Ireland","replies":8,"images":2,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":0},{"no":117647770,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)13:38:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117647333\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117647333<\/a><br><br> 333<br><br>KEK has spoken","filename":"C4OSr2EWcAEDogZ","ext":".jpg","w":750,"h":651,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":108,"tim":1490117891170,"time":1490117891,"md5":"lUUfnYXBEPEkkt8e+zp5Fg==","fsize":63845,"resto":117647038,"id":"NouzCB0U","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117647792,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)13:38:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117647038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117647038<\/a><br>Yeah, yesterday, there have been many threads.<br>He died on the Spring Equinox, March 20th. <br>This is also the birthday of Barron Trump, who turned 11 yesterday.","filename":"mature","ext":".png","w":628,"h":285,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":56,"tim":1490117905880,"time":1490117905,"md5":"grWeJu9+myax4Yazhss9Ew==","fsize":143228,"resto":117647038,"id":"oLZqdkwM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117650296,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)14:01:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117647174\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117647174<\/a><br>Just a 101 year old slab of mush.","time":1490119297,"resto":117647038,"id":"LvOXbgIJ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117651711,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)14:14:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117647038\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117647038<\/a><br><br>He was 101.

Sure later I came to understand the poison of islam in things I didn&#039;t understand at the time. Anyway the whole fundamentalist revolution thing happened and they had to go home to be executed. So while I totally get the resentment against the CIA puppet we gave their country to you have to admit that Iran was on the edge of becoming completely modern country when islam reared its beshitted head and pulled them back into the only shithole islam ever leads anyone. So Iran owes me the lives of some cool people I knew, the progress in culture and HDI lost in the cesspool that followed the revolution and all the suffering their endless support of jihad has cost every non-jew sfor the last 40 years.

It has been used as a preservative in vaccines, immunoglobulin preparations, skin test antigens, antivenins, ophthalmic and nasal products, and tattoo inks. In the U.S., Thiomersal has been removed from or reduced to trace amounts in all vaccines routinely recommended for children 6 years of age and younger with the exception of inactivated influenza vaccine. Thiomersal is very toxic by inhalation, ingestion, and in contact with skin (EC hazard symbol T+), with a danger of cumulative effects. It is also very toxic to aquatic organisms and may cause long-term adverse effects in aquatic environments (EC hazard symbol N).[20] In the body, it is metabolized or degraded to ethylmercury (C2H5Hg+) and thiosalicylate.[13] Cases have been reported of severe Mercury poisoning by accidental exposure or attempted suicide, with some fatalities.[21] Animal experiments suggest that thiomersal rapidly dissociates to release ethylmercury after injection; that the disposition patterns of mercury are similar to those after exposure to equivalent doses of ethylmercury chloride; and that the central nervous system and the kidneys are targets, with lack of motor coordination being a common sign. Similar signs and symptoms have been observed in accidental human poisonings. The mechanisms of toxic action are unknown. Fecal excretion accounts for most of the elimination from the body. Ethylmercury clears from blood with a half-life of about 18 days in adults by breakdown into other chemicals, including inorganic mercury.","time":1493515893,"resto":123415944,"id":"Gebi7VsV","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123416472,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)21:31:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123415944\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123415944<\/a><br>unless you are a 90 year old women or immunocompromised or work in hospitals there is absolutely no reason for a healthy young person to get a flu shot","time":1493515913,"resto":123415944,"id":"Tx5btbgy","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123413517,"now":"04\/29\/17(Sat)21:08:01","name":"LIBERAL CANADA","sub":"RED PILL ME","com":"\/POL\/ I NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE<br><br>I have always considered myself to be a pretty progressive person, always leaned pretty far left.

But make no mistake. This &#039;studying&#039; cannot be done from lofty heights. No one who has not been seized in the jaws of this murderous viper can know its poison fangs. Otherwise nothing results but superficial chatter and false sentimentality. Both are harmful. The former because it can never penetrate to the core of the problem, the latter because it passes it by. I do not know which is more terrible: inattention to social misery such as we see every day among the majority of those who have been favored by fortune or who have risen by their own efforts, or else the snobbish, or at times tactless and obtrusive, condescension of certain women of fashion in skirts or in trousers, who &#039; feel for the people.&#039; In any event, these gentry sin far more than their minds, devoid of all instinct, are capable of realizing. Consequently, and much to their own amazement, the result of their social &#039;efforts&#039; is always nil, frequently, in fact, an indignant rebuff, though this, of course, is passed off as a proof of the people&#039;s ingratitude.<br>Such minds are most reluctant to realize that social endeavor has nothing in common with this sort of thing; that above all it can raise no claim to gratitude, since its function is not to distribute favors but to restore rights.","time":1493516449,"resto":123415855,"id":"dKZEQdUi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

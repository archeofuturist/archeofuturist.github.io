However, I wouldn&#039;t give socialism any of the credit for the rise of the middle class. For one, it started long before Marx&#039;s grandmother was a twinkle in satan&#039;s eye. It began with the protestant reformation. <br><br>Wait, wait, put that fedora down, let&#039;s talk this through. You see, the protestant reformation was the start of something a lot bigger than ten decades of murdering germans. It was the first time the common man looked up and saw noone, no kings, no priests, no popes, between them and god. Now, there is no more disquieting feeling than suddenly realizing that you alone are responsible for your own behavior. This sense of disquiet drove the mentally liberated peasants into a frenzy of activity, for once aimed not at enriching feudal lords or bishops, but bettering themselves. After all, no man wants to stand before god having done nothing of note, especially when their&#039;s no Saints, no Madonna nearby to pick up your slack. Before being proud of your faith became gauche, this industry driven by profound existential terror was known as the protestant work ethic. And it was this ethic which drove the middle class in europe to swell. With wealth came a need for education. Education broadened the scope of a man&#039;s aim, the world saw a rebirth of science and art lost since the fall of Rome. The Renaissance. During this upheaval, one particularly neurotic bunch of protestants managed to piss off their neighbors so bad they had to flee to the new world to satisfy their autistic compulsions. The rest, as they say, is geography.","time":1491172393,"resto":119252061,"id":"k1my0S9Q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119252903,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:09:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;mfw single-payer universal healthcare WILL become a reality in America and Trump could be the one to do it if he wants to be re-elected<\/span><br><br>Reminder that those who voted Trump likely benefit from Obamacare the most.

This raises serious questions in regards to the \u201cRussian Hacking\u201d narrative often proposed by representatives of the American intelligence community and in the press regarding the U.S. presidential election of 2016.<br><br>Conservative candidate Guillermo Lasso has promised to revoke Assange\u2019s asylum within \u201c30 days\u201d of election, if he is is elected. Opposing Lasso is Len\u00edn Moreno, who has indicated he will allow Assange to remain in the Ecuadorian embassy if victorious. The race has so far been reported as very close, with some Latin American media reporting that polls lean slightly in favor of Moreno.<br>Although U.S. President Donald Trump has commented favorably on Wikileaks, the U.S. Department of Justice has remained silent on claims it has readied a secret indictment of Assange, which Wikileaks has referred to as \u201cunconstitutional.\u201d","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-02 at 4.53.12 PM","ext":".png","w":828,"h":461,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":139,"tim":1491170199740,"time":1491170199,"md5":"X2nvORgsr1PekDimqEiesQ==","fsize":212051,"resto":0,"id":"cH91zfQz","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"wikileaks-press-release-on-the-program-alleges","country_name":"United States","replies":11,"images":4,"omitted_posts":6,"omitted_images":3},{"no":119253286,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:13:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119251677\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119251677<\/a><br><a href=\"#p119252077\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119252077<\/a><br><br>Kek says hi, apparently","time":1491171208,"resto":119251486,"id":"cH91zfQz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119253773,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)18:17:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"http:\/\/archive.is\/WmAWl<br><br>listen to the dude, he has answers you seek<br><br><br>&quot;Ecuador poll data &quot;can be published after 5pm but usually at 6pm&quot;.

People go to Annapolis, or Baltimore and buy bulk heroin for cheap from niggers or sometimes from good connects. Then they bring it back to southern Maryland and sell it all for a massive profit. No one out here wants to drive out to Baltimore to score so they pay the higher prices.<br><br>A few months ago I was at a local vape shop and someone was outside on the sidewalk and collapsed because of an overdose. The dude shot up in the bathroom of a bar next door and stumbled outside and fell over. Dude had to have multiple injections of that naloxone shit or whatever it is. We know people overdose, but you never expect to just see that shit happen in an upscale part of town at a fucking store.<br><br>All these degenerate addict pieces of shit are causing problems for people who take opioids for legitimate reasons. The governor of my state had a cousin who overdosed and ever since then he&#039;s been on a rampage. If his proposed policies get enacted, I&#039;m going to have to deal with such a huge amount of bullshit to get my medicine that it&#039;s just beyond ridiculous.<br><br>I don&#039;t know how we solve this shit... there&#039;s addicts everywhere, pills, heroin, fentanyl etc is fucking everywhere but there&#039;s also people like me who genuinely need opioid medication to function. Without my medicine I would literally not be able to work or do anything at all. Becuase I take opioids daily I am able to work and contribute to society. I work 9 to 5 everyday doing network security and programming. If I didn&#039;t have my medicine I would not be able to do anything and my contribution to the economy and my own life for that matter would be non-existent.<br><br>I almost wish we could just start killing addicts... you know legally.","filename":"pepe on fire","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491026346498,"time":1491026346,"md5":"y2LgNZjOlIgLtXmHwvRbTA==","fsize":41244,"resto":119136232,"id":"cSeQjmCX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119151821,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)01:59:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"jesus fucking christ man holy fuck.

He was still a young man when he wrote it, and not yet a philosopher. He was interested, however, in who they were, and how they philosophized. A few years later, after Dawn, though arguably in 1879, N considered himself a philosopher and he wrote as such. To understand what he thought himself to be, how he wrote, with what purpose, and most importantly HOW HE WANTED TO BE READ, you have to read PTAG. <br><br>In short, to know how to read Nietzsche, you have to know how Nietzsche read those he considered genuine philosophers. Read N in the same way N read Heraclitus or Anaximander...always with an eye to the personality. It&#039;s all that matters, he says. It&#039;s not the content of their philosophy, or rather, the content matters only insofar as it reveals something about the personality of the philosopher. <br><br>The personality of the philosopher is all that matters to N. It&#039;s the only thing that&#039;s important to culture at large, which is why he even wrote Ecce Homo, a book which serves as a sort of reader&#039;s guide to his other works, but which at every point refers the reader back to N&#039;s personality. <br><br>Basically read PTAG (in which N talks about all these genuinely philosophical personas) and then read Ecce Homo as a continuation of that work, i.e., one in which N talks about N as a genuinely philosophical persona.","time":1491024570,"resto":119146119,"id":"gclsp9yY","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119149385,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)01:29:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Makes me sick, another neva-do-nuthin having a chimpout<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Killed Asian wife, mother to his child with cyanide after beating her to death in the driveway.<\/span><br><br>http:\/\/www.13newsnow.com\/news\/local<wbr>\/mycity\/virginia-beach\/prosecution-<wbr>man-poisoned-estranged-wife-with-cy<wbr>anide-had-fiancee-in-china\/42724535<wbr>0<br><br>Now his kid has no mother or father, he tried to escape to China.","filename":"QwSiY3k","ext":".png","w":607,"h":291,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":119,"tim":1491024566884,"time":1491024566,"md5":"rovxL6h6MwSA3WFtNjSrhQ==","fsize":168055,"resto":0,"id":"5+i56pwM","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"makes-me-sick-another-nevadonuthin-having-a","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":119149916,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)01:36:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"why do we let whites in our society?","time":1491024974,"resto":119149385,"id":"5+i56pwM","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119148023,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)01:13:01","name":"Anonymous","sub":"White supremacy pics and gifs ITT","com":"This is an image board and pics are worth a thousand words<br><br>Drop your best (((Whites are better))) redpill images","filename":"1488865418709","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":2812,"tn_w":44,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491023581125,"time":1491023581,"md5":"dEMA5Ah16i5XwMksceGYlQ==","fsize":907745,"resto":0,"id":"kgjryj1q","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"white-supremacy-pics-and-gifs-itt","country_name":"United States","replies":16,"images":14,"omitted_posts":11,"omitted_images":9},{"no":119149348,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)01:28:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119149016\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119149016<\/a><br>So too does decades of media propaganda.","time":1491024536,"resto":119148023,"id":"GVU\/\/wA7","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119149514,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)01:31:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119149348\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119149348<\/a><br>(((Reality is propaganda)))","filename":"1487416306403","ext":".png","w":480,"h":480,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491024665081,"time":1491024665,"md5":"zQBzOCncuZ68gBefUIvbxg==","fsize":291564,"resto":119148023,"id":"kgjryj1q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119149569,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)01:31:44","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1489761826662","ext":".jpg","w":1600,"h":1209,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1491024704945,"time":1491024704,"md5":"mzST1WfjuMtwSX8XynjM4A==","fsize":193402,"resto":119148023,"id":"kgjryj1q","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":119149750,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)01:34:07","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1487241959907","ext":".png","w":604,"h":780,"tn_w":96,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491024847326,"time":1491024847,"md5":"JYcT6J0vV\/2GdhMQkQ3D9Q==","fsize":340934,"resto":119148023,"id":"kgjryj1q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119150017,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)01:37:16","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1489677681576","ext":".jpg","w":1200,"h":1195,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491025036591,"time":1491025036,"md5":"FEIZ5lAwkhJ87bkTXKYigA==","fsize":64400,"resto":119148023,"id":"kgjryj1q","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119148611,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)01:19:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"Are these guys brain-damaged?<br><br>I mean they&#039;re all liberal, even the &quot;conservatives&quot;, but it seems like the registration asks for a maximum IQ of 85.","filename":"MUH ROADS","ext":".jpg","w":468,"h":351,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491023966313,"time":1491023966,"md5":"NPyGyqjbklq\/ihtq5e+phA==","fsize":20677,"resto":0,"id":"KDbDPPWD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-these-guys-braindamaged","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":119149334,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)01:28:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"You mean minimum IQ?

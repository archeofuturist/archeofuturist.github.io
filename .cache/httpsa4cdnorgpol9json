I&#039;d like to start a company using low-cost alkaline hydrolysis cremations to cater to low income areas, as I know that the afterlife industry will be very large in coming years. (I can also be slightly redpilled with any employees. While I could not ask them their religion, religious knowledge is very important in the industry, and I could verify that I&#039;m not hiring some liberal-goth nihilist. They would have to know enough about religious practices to meet my standards.) I guess what I&#039;m really asking is do any of you have any experience with mortuary science? And if so, how well do straight cremation facilities fare? And would a redpilled mortician survive trying to provide services to low income and generally dindu infested neighborhoods?","filename":"download","ext":".jpg","w":275,"h":183,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493583721877,"time":1493583721,"md5":"U31\/PLsL2d71oz0PNMtIJg==","fsize":4756,"resto":0,"id":"qGpX2Atk","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"small-business-advice","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":1,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":0},{"no":123522856,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)16:36:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123522166\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123522166<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;10x1000<\/span><br>Checks out.

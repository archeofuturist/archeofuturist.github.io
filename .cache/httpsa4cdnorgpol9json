Granted, they&#039;re both from well to do families, one&#039;s mom&#039;s a lawyer and the other&#039;s stepdad&#039;s some kind of businessman, but they both said the sanctions didn&#039;t change their lives or most of their friends&#039; lives much, and probably will just affect businesses wanting to build overseas.

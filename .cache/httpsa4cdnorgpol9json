Then, he signed an order undoing protections for wildlife and the environment.<br><br>The policy Zinke reversed would have phased out toxic ammunition and fishing tackle from national wildlife refuges by 2022. The purpose of this common-sense safeguard was to reduce lead, a powerful neurotoxin that persists in water and soil for a long time.<br><br>Birds are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning. Ducks and waterfowl rooting around the bottom of wetlands accidentally eat discarded lead. Birds of prey eat animal carcasses that contain lead bullet fragments -- making lead poisoning a huge threat for iconic species like bald eagles and California condors.<br><br>While other government agencies are moving forward with policies to limit lead exposure, the Interior Department is going backward. It&#039;s especially frustrating since nontoxic alternatives already exist for hunters and anglers.<br><br>That Zinke undid this protection on his first day is extremely disconcerting given his professed dedication to the environment.

I started listening to common filth and I read some julius evola. All I see around me is decadence. There are no traditionalist organizations or political parties. There are no traditionalist girls. The only christian girls I know don&#039;t even care about god and nature. They just go to rockband Jesus church every week to make them feel better. How do you live knowing what&#039;s best for people, but know they will hate you if you try to tell them?","filename":"9146173e289029b9249db01e6cd647cc_sad-frog-for-president-2016-pepe-memes-sad_385-385","ext":".jpg","w":385,"h":385,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490393708854,"time":1490393708,"md5":"lvWQhN\/CXx\/Gosb+4GufGg==","fsize":23061,"resto":0,"id":"4G\/I5E\/b","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-do-you-deal-with-the-depression-of-being-a","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":1},{"no":118141284,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)18:19:01","name":"Anonymous","filename":"1484123568177","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":965,"tn_w":103,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490393941641,"time":1490393941,"md5":"aUV5CAHPPkwe51D3kHXoHg==","fsize":193464,"resto":118140748,"id":"rA69a34+","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":118141422,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)18:20:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"I fuck traps.","time":1490394001,"resto":118140748,"id":"hliVr+6g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118141618,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)18:21:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118140748\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118140748<\/a><br>adapt or die","time":1490394086,"resto":118140748,"id":"n2vESngj","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118138556,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)17:59:02","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/pol\/ on Chappelle","com":"Don&#039;t know if this was already brought up but what do you faggots think of Dave Chappelle?","filename":"Chappelle","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490392742618,"time":1490392742,"md5":"7f5Z73cFESkf8D\/f+pf2dw==","fsize":129267,"resto":0,"id":"Gmo7+w52","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-on-chappelle","country_name":"United States","replies":19,"images":1,"omitted_posts":14,"omitted_images":1},{"no":118140855,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)18:15:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"The only thing i can think of that&#039;d spoil his stuff for me is if we learned he&#039;s a pedo, otherwise chappelles show is full blown goat","time":1490393759,"resto":118138556,"id":"g9CLdsMf","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118141120,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)18:17:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118138556\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118138556<\/a><br>He&#039;s a funny guy for all that i care.

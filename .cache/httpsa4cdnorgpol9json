Uppsala used to be one of the safest cities in the country, and I would never imagine Uppsala would become an unsafe place. Now every time I visit it feels shittier. There are cases of rape all the time, there are lots of street kids (from morocco) who go around robbing people. You have to hold on to your belongings when you are at the central station or you will get pickpocketed. There have been robberies at the central station in the middle of the day. Just a few years ago this sort of thing didn&#039;t exist in Sweden, Swedes would have to be warned when going abroad because they weren&#039;t familiar with the concept of pickpockets. My mom&#039;s apartment complex have had to get security cameras because of criminal gangs that assault people, deal drugs etc inside the complex, this only started recently. One of the tenants has started renting out to refugee &quot;children&quot; because it&#039;s so profitable, and this is one of the most expensive places in Uppsala.","time":1491647159,"resto":120109870,"id":"NYOJCSbg","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":120116111,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:28:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120110439\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120110439<\/a><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;a shotgun and fifty shells to each white swedish citizen<\/span><br><br><br>...don&#039;t you think male swedes got enough anal toys as it is?","time":1491647295,"resto":120109870,"id":"sqWs+A2Y","country":"GR","country_name":"Greece"},{"no":120117577,"now":"04\/08\/17(Sat)06:48:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120115929\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120115929<\/a><br>Its sad but its true.

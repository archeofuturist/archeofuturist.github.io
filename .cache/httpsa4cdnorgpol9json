These capacities are based on adult males - if cremating children was involved, you could achieve higher numbers. <br><br>Step 3: getting the fuel<br><br>For a 12-hour-period, a total of about 2,800 kg of coke is needed for crematories II and III. For the Kremas IV and V you&#039;ll need 1,120 kgs each.<br><br>Conclusion:<br><br>Each gas chamber and crematorium was operational for a total of approx. 2 years. Just in this period alone, all gas chambers are mathematically capable of killing 4 million people alone, and all crematories were capable of cremating potentially upto 2.5 million adult male corpses. There were open air pit burnings for any excess, and don&#039;t give me that bullshit about the water table because there is photographic evidence of said pit burnings both on ground-level and aerial photography, so deal with it.<br><br>Of course, in reality far fewer people died in Auschwitz (1.1 million, which is 900k killed by gas and 200k by other causes like disease, malnutrition, labor attrition and so on).<br><br><br>*HOLOCAUST DENIERS GOT MATHEMATICALLY BTFO*","time":1491856784,"resto":120472131,"id":"FcQjarrF","country":"PT","country_name":"Portugal"},{"no":120488364,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:47:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120485974\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120485974<\/a><br>The stench of reddit is strong","time":1491857232,"resto":120472131,"id":"GplHC6f9","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":120488578,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:48:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120487368\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120487368<\/a><br>wow","time":1491857320,"resto":120472131,"id":"t4BugwW6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120446077,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)11:01:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"Communism vs Nazism?<br>Who&#039;s better system?","filename":"9190905_orig","ext":".jpg","w":400,"h":200,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491836509728,"time":1491836509,"md5":"UGuOEvz5rYpW32+UF3okaw==","fsize":11868,"resto":0,"id":"IuXsmJeo","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"communism-vs-nazism","country_name":"Poland","replies":215,"images":65,"omitted_posts":210,"omitted_images":63,"tail_size":50},{"no":120485925,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:28:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120446077\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120446077<\/a><br>Nazism killed only undesirables and dregs on society, communism killed those work free will or you couldn&#039;t make it to the bread line that day so no food this week.","time":1491856126,"resto":120446077,"id":"LU8S4fsO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120486038,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:29:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120446077\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120446077<\/a><br>Hitler killed less of his own people so I&#039;d say Hitler.","time":1491856178,"resto":120446077,"id":"J\/d+AkcN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120486588,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)16:33:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120448316\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120448316<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Communism because it allows all the rights of the citizens to remain intact <\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;soviet citizens had rights<\/span><br>lmao, have a (You)<br><br>t. ruskie<br><a href=\"#p120450950\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120450950<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;National socialism is a complete false ideology that is not sustainable in the slightest.

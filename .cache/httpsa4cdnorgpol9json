High functioning autism, also known as aspergers, is basically mild autism. People can still live normal lives if they&#039;re high functioning, but aren&#039;t born with social skills and need to learn them.<br>Low functioning autism is on the opposite spectrum where it&#039;s more severe and the autist is non-verbal and has screeching meltdowns. They can&#039;t live normal lives. It&#039;s such a wide spectrum with different severities and levels of accommodations depending on the person.","time":1490591463,"resto":118473787,"id":"k6vzXi\/M","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118472200,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)00:40:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"Ben Garrison?

Even in the early 30s, Hitler was talked about as a buffoon and a political novice who could be manipulated by the more traditional conservatives (even after the Nazi party had grown to be the largest party in Germany). Communist attacks on Nazis grew in intensity, and streetfighting soon commenced (going from barroom brawls to fighting with clubs to finally shooting at each other). Many Nazis were assassinated by Communists and Horst Wessel Lied, the Nazi anthem, was a song written by one of the men turned into a martyr by Goebbels&#039; propaganda.<br><br>Watching what happened at the Battle of Berkeley and the way the police completely refused to intervene, I am beginning to think that conservatives\/alt-right need better organization and an outfit like the Sturmabteilung to protect people and make sure Communists can no longer attack old people or try to kick people to death on the floor.... or throw fucking explosives.<br><br>I&#039;m gonna quote some stuff from (((wikipedia))), and tell me if it doesn&#039;t sound familiar.","filename":"SA 2","ext":".jpg","w":365,"h":550,"tn_w":165,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492654368572,"time":1492654368,"md5":"BJoK\/p6kSW7Hyd6ZnnfP7w==","fsize":20862,"resto":0,"id":"YP+kbp+D","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"american-stumabteilung","country_name":"United States","replies":204,"images":44,"omitted_posts":199,"omitted_images":39,"tail_size":50},{"no":121961642,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)02:09:12","name":"missouri fag","filename":"8585bd0c9f62aa03cf453d5c1c179267","ext":".jpg","w":539,"h":537,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1492668552119,"time":1492668552,"md5":"IN0Lb+OlHxuckfS8BBEr6Q==","fsize":46598,"resto":121936340,"id":"0cnTDbZO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121961683,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)02:09:38","name":"missouri fag","filename":"uqIRcN4","ext":".jpg","w":1038,"h":584,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1492668578143,"time":1492668578,"md5":"GhnRz3rQIKRW+qHNvEKnrw==","fsize":138776,"resto":121936340,"id":"0cnTDbZO","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":121962393,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)02:18:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121944305\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121944305<\/a><br>Not enough armor.

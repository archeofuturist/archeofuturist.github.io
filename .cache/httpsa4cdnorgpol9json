This is largely based on the fact that the extension of European empires and trading companies in the post-Columbus period created global-level changes (in consumption of foods and goods, disease environments, cultural practices, etc.). But historians like Sanjay Subrahmanyam at UCLA have also argued that advanced polities like those of South Asia can be regarded as &quot;early modern&quot; in the sense that they underwent political, economic and technological developments that were comprable to those of Western Europe in the same period. I&#039;d point to Giancarlo Casale&#039;s The Ottoman Age of Exploration for more on this, and several of Subrahmanyam&#039;s articles, such as &quot;Connected Histories: Notes towards a Reconfiguration of Early Modern Eurasia.&quot; Its true that historians don&#039;t talk about &quot;early modern Fiji,&quot; but they in fact do talk about &quot;early modern Japan&quot; or &quot;early modern India,&quot; as a quick Google search will demonstrate.","filename":"l235","ext":".jpg","w":1239,"h":929,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493198225004,"time":1493198225,"md5":"QLn3BvTb1ljWkKR8UY\/XFQ==","fsize":284956,"resto":0,"id":"PNNMgtvY","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"im-in-training-as-an-historian-of-the-17th18th","country_name":"Canada","replies":3,"images":1},{"no":122865055,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:21:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122864790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122864790<\/a><br>Don&#039;t confuse \/pol\/ with facts.","time":1493198472,"resto":122864790,"id":"+rmuzUEo","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122865343,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:25:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122864790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122864790<\/a><br><br>And your point is ?","time":1493198749,"resto":122864790,"id":"veJrXhA9","country":"RO","country_name":"Romania"},{"no":122866203,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:40:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122864790\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122864790<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Sanjay Subrahmanyam (born 21 May 1961) is an Indian historian<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Indian historian<\/span>","filename":"1463437208473","ext":".jpg","w":517,"h":768,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493199644083,"time":1493199644,"md5":"rioobnyrbXGIDCI0NyLUGg==","fsize":66765,"resto":122864790,"id":"6Tz6APyI","country":"BE","country_name":"Belgium"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122865311,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:25:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2<wbr>017\/apr\/25\/china-bans-religious-nam<wbr>es-for-muslims-babies-in-xinjiang<br><br>Based China","filename":"140","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":528,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":220,"tim":1493198705830,"time":1493198705,"md5":"yKmnqbbX2FfHABLoUmJMEA==","fsize":37881,"resto":0,"id":"DQXPbCUc","country":"NL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"based-china","country_name":"Netherlands","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":122865703,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:31:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122865311\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122865311<\/a><br>You can call a turd a diamond but it&#039;s still a turd","time":1493199109,"resto":122865311,"id":"Nk9XBbfX","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122866182,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:40:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122865311\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122865311<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;all baby names will now be decided by ballpeen hammer<\/span>","time":1493199627,"resto":122865311,"id":"myRnhmj\/","country":"JP","country_name":"Japan"}]},{"posts":[{"no":122864714,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:16:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"will masculinity ever be a desirable trait again? or are we doomed to a future populated solely by numale pyjama boys?","filename":"IMG_5211","ext":".jpg","w":297,"h":419,"tn_w":177,"tn_h":249,"tim":1493198162615,"time":1493198162,"md5":"fRUP4oBSBWhaOC0o2UKwRA==","fsize":63433,"resto":0,"id":"GXbDANvp","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"will-masculinity-ever-be-a-desirable-trait-again","country_name":"Australia","replies":16,"images":2,"omitted_posts":11,"omitted_images":2},{"no":122865544,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:29:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122864714\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122864714<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;will masculinity ever be a desirable trait again?<\/span><br>the left can try but masculinity will always be a desirable trait.","time":1493198950,"resto":122864714,"id":"gjr52c\/8","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":122865695,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)05:31:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122864962\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122864962<\/a><br>That.

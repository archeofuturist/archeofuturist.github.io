While there\u2019s a glut of homoerotic writings from priests going back to the Middle Ages, obtaining an accurate count is tough. But most surveys (which, due to the sensitivity of the subject, admiittedly suffer from limited samples and other design issues) find between 15 percent and 50 percent of U.S. priests are gay, which is much greater than the 3.8 percent of people who identify as LGBTQ in the general population.<br><br>As straight priests left the church for domestic bliss, the proportion of remaining priests who were gay grew. In a survey of several thousand priests in the U.S., the Los Angeles Times found that 28 percent of priests between the ages of 46 and 55 reported that they were gay. This statistic was higher than the percentages found in other age brackets and reflected the outflow of straight priests throughout the 1970s and \u201980s.<br><br>The high number of gay priests also became evident in the 1980s, when the priesthood was hit hard by the AIDS crisis that was afflicting the gay community. The Kansas City Star estimated that at least 300 U.S. priests suffered AIDS-related deaths between the mid-1980s and 1999. The Star concluded that priests were about twice as likely as other adult men to die from AIDS.<br>Given that the church has called a gay orientation an \u201cobjective disorder\u201d and gay sex \u201can intrinsic moral evil,\u201d it may seem bewildering why a gay man would chose this profession. But it makes more sense after realizing the church encourages sublimation of homosexuality through prayer. \u201cHomosexual persons are called to chastity,\u201d states the Catechism of the Catholic Church. \u201cBy the virtues of self-mastery that teach them inner freedom, at times by the support of disinterested friendship, by prayer and sacramental grace, they can and should gradually and resolutely approach Christian perfection.\u201d","filename":"Screen Shot 2017-04-20 at 12.27.58 PM","ext":".png","w":1196,"h":1380,"tn_w":216,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492705833621,"time":1492705833,"md5":"lsoD5ab4cVx\/EdO9C7phng==","fsize":722834,"resto":0,"id":"y6\/hx0d8","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"if-catholics-hate-gays-why-are-so-many-gay-men","country_name":"United States","replies":47,"images":3,"omitted_posts":42,"omitted_images":2},{"no":122021098,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:05:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122012427\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122012427<\/a><br>I spent years explaining to people why we banned them, ultimately most people didn&#039;t understand that we were damned either way.","time":1492711526,"resto":122011121,"id":"yLhJTrjA","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122021589,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:10:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122020660\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122020660<\/a><br>When did I say that homosexuals were immoral or evil?","time":1492711822,"resto":122011121,"id":"SZqZMEN+","country":"FR","country_name":"France"},{"no":122021735,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:11:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"Let priests have kids and you&#039;ll fix 80% problems of why christianity is dying","time":1492711899,"resto":122011121,"id":"57iwuT+T","country":"HU","country_name":"Hungary"},{"no":122021873,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:12:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122021735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122021735<\/a><br>That will create a shit load of extra problems. killing christianity was a necessity.","time":1492711977,"resto":122011121,"id":"HL9M1Eds","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":122022515,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:18:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122021873\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122021873<\/a><br>Not really <br><br>Nobody becomes a priest anymore because<br>1.)

Trump claimed Curiel could not impartially hear the case because of his background and Trump&#039;s hardline immigration policies. The case was eventually settled.<br><br>Now, Curiel is assigned to hear the case of Juan Manuel Montes Bojorquez, 23, who his lawyers allege was deported from California to Mexico earlier this year despite having active protection under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA.<br>And Trump&#039;s comments toward Curiel last year -- he called the Indiana-born judge a &quot;hater&quot; and a &quot;Mexican&quot; -- drew some of the loudest accusations of racism that the then-candidate faced during his campaign and several repudiations from prominent Republicans.<br><br>Lawyers for Montes say their client was apprehended by Border Patrol and deported on February 18. DHS said Wednesday that never happened.<br>While DHS initially said Tuesday they had a record of Montes&#039; DACA status expiring in 2015, they released further information Wednesday saying he did, in fact, have DACA status until 2018, agreeing with lawyers for Montes.<br><br>They really buried this paragraph:<br><br>The problem, though, is on the part of the story both sides agree on: Montes tried to sneak back into the US on February 19 and was caught by Border Patrol. DACA requires individuals to get pre-clearance to leave the country, and so Montes&#039; re-entry then showed he had left without authorization and voided his status, DHS said. He was sent back to Mexico the following day, where he is now staying.","filename":"GonzaloCuriel","ext":".jpg","w":667,"h":1000,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492710813729,"time":1492710813,"md5":"wcrvQudUPIOXpx64vmHnng==","fsize":50330,"resto":0,"id":"MwHtVFtD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"our-old-friend-gonzalo-curiel-to-hear-case-of","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":2},{"no":122020308,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)13:57:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122019892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122019892<\/a><br>Looks like Montes wasn&#039;t the dindu good boy after all!","filename":"bog boyz","ext":".png","w":473,"h":379,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1492711067261,"time":1492711067,"md5":"oheut06UdkB\/8G4bA28yFw==","fsize":224986,"resto":122019892,"id":"3ICX22jz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122022062,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)14:14:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122019892\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122019892<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;his background<\/span><br><br>Judenpresse will never tell that truth.

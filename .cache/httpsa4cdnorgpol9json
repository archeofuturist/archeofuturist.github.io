No matter how many terror attacks happen, no matter how much awful culture immigrants and migrants bring into the West, people are never going to say &quot;that&#039;s enough.&quot; Most millenials in particular are victims of relentless brainwashing to turn them all into globalists, marxists loonies. And these people are going to be running the governments at some point. It&#039;s a sad reality.<br><br>If there was going to be come kind of reactionary resistance, even a peaceful, political one, it would have happened by now. Stuff like Trump and Brexit are just temporary stopgaps. It won&#039;t do much when the populace is so insanely bluepilled. Besides, most of the voters for those things tend to skew older. The world we are going to be facing in the coming decades will be ruled by globalist morons.","filename":"1476406388132","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":521,"tn_w":239,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490233241460,"time":1490233241,"md5":"1UEmHIjURQygBGMYDY6cgQ==","fsize":138604,"resto":0,"id":"gUFZTyBr","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-west-is-never-going-to-wake-up","country_name":"United States","replies":126,"images":33,"omitted_posts":121,"omitted_images":31,"tail_size":50},{"no":117883384,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)23:56:26","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117866299\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117866299<\/a><br>I agree.","filename":"god dang it pol","ext":".jpg","w":1343,"h":461,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":42,"tim":1490241386291,"time":1490241386,"md5":"AGvEiOcIdOZg7E1eJHn5tA==","fsize":92921,"resto":117866299,"id":"ieWdmLq3","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117883412,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)23:56:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117868688\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117868688<\/a><br><br>Cheer up mate, even if everything seems to be fucked and nobody but us seems to notice or care","time":1490241401,"resto":117866299,"id":"6CTXw4Ps","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":117883579,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)23:58:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117883190\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117883190<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;When an Aussie sends you libcucked ass off the deep in with a bit of bantz<\/span><br><br>Pic related, it&#039;s you.","filename":"1461002123643","ext":".png","w":578,"h":548,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1490241490619,"time":1490241490,"md5":"94giDN\/fofsC5hQINaUK5w==","fsize":446402,"resto":117866299,"id":"sDHVCOxO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117883591,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)23:58:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117866299\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117866299<\/a><br>The west died with the Third Reich","time":1490241498,"resto":117866299,"id":"uUBzzeXO","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":117883934,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:01:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117883190\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117883190<\/a><br>Ha, look how butthurt you are","time":1490241678,"resto":117866299,"id":"YU1KuzCU","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":117875813,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)22:52:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"Trump BTFO by CNN","filename":"Trumpstairs","ext":".jpg","w":1024,"h":546,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":133,"tim":1490237575029,"time":1490237575,"md5":"85JUFNf5qmHN8FY+RbKzGQ==","fsize":81853,"resto":0,"id":"RBG7Er76","country":"NZ","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"trump-btfo-by-cnn","country_name":"New Zealand","replies":7,"images":1,"omitted_posts":2,"omitted_images":0},{"no":117878969,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)23:18:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117875813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117875813<\/a><br><br> I don&#039;t want to eat shit on a stone staircase 30ft tall.","time":1490239093,"resto":117875813,"id":"gWxPlOKu","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117880142,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)23:28:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117875813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117875813<\/a><br>if only we had a real leader","filename":"stronger together stairs","ext":".jpg","w":1035,"h":586,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":70,"tim":1490239689790,"time":1490239689,"md5":"fDg2JgOD+NxJrD7DQOAUaQ==","fsize":123611,"resto":117875813,"id":"3+bkaqXl","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"},{"no":117880276,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)23:29:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117880142\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117880142<\/a><br>It&#039;s like watching a toddler.","time":1490239763,"resto":117875813,"id":"p55gYsww","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117881249,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)23:38:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117875813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117875813<\/a><br>H-He&#039;ll never recover now!","time":1490240295,"resto":117875813,"id":"uifXlqAe","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117883916,"now":"03\/23\/17(Thu)00:01:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117875813\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117875813<\/a><br>Have you ever walked up a stone step, stumbled and then hit your shin against the corner of it?

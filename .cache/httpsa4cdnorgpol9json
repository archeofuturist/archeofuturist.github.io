The pane shatters and the glass sprinkles the bakery&#039;s stock of buns and cakes. The furious baker runs out to assess the damage and, after a moment of consuming rage, determines that he will need to purchase a new window and will probably need to replace some, if not all, of the affected stock. The inevitable crowd that gathers around the scene is fascinated by the event and pipe up with whimsies in an attempt to break encroaching malaise that seems to wash over the baker as he considers his bank and creditors. They offer condolences, all of which are shrouded in the guise of the following sentiment:<br><br>&quot;Well, at least you&#039;ll be giving the glazier some work, right? After all, what would happen to the glaziers if windows were never broken?&quot;<br><br>I have a question regarding the above and forgive me if it the answer is simple:<br><br>What *would* happen to the glaziers if, say, 50% less windows were broken?","filename":"TheBrokenWindow","ext":".jpg","w":960,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1493842234156,"time":1493842234,"md5":"M4A7W8UO8GDPnM+MpL46SA==","fsize":124599,"resto":0,"id":"sbKEFk6r","country":"IE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-broken-window","country_name":"Ireland","replies":4,"images":0},{"no":123956970,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:17:55","name":"Anonymous","com":"They raise prices and\/or find another line of work<br><br>Or they pay tramps to throw bricks through windows","time":1493842675,"resto":123955778,"id":"Uo1QC6Mr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123957247,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:19:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123955778\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123955778<\/a><br>The Jewish run window fixing company will pay youths to smash Windows, thus creating jobs for their workers and generating profit","time":1493842791,"resto":123955778,"id":"Za0EH4YR","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123957704,"now":"05\/03\/17(Wed)16:22:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123955778\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123955778<\/a><br>Cheaper bread and cheaper glass. x% more village product basically.

Romantic because this half-woman\/half man is symbolic of twin souls who parted and reunited. We fall in love and instinctively seek out that one perfect mate to be with for life. And otherworldly because our search for that mate is really an echo of a bigger, cosmic goal of uniting with the universe, God, the Tao, or whatever you call that great something from whence we came and to which we will return someday.<br>The idea of oneness, completeness, the unity of the physical and spiritual, of totally opposite worlds, is the main message of androgyny as an alchemical symbol. The yin-yang symbol is an androgynous symbol. It is called the taiji-tu in Taoist alchemy and it shows the perfect fusion of duality, or the complementary combination of all opposites with and into one another. The androgyny is symbolic of the persistent driving force to attain balance and harmony.<br><br>Lao Tzu has written that a person can achieve purity if he or she can acknowledge both feminine and masculine dualities and reconcile them. One must gain wisdom of masculinity and hold on to femininity to represent the ideal Man and Woman as One. According to ancient Chinese texts, male philosophers such as Zhuang Zhi have embraced a way of life described as Yin or passive in order to balance their Yang qualities and live as a more enlightened whole. One might envision many things at the mention of the words androgyne, androgyny or androgynous. This may include a woman with masculine features or vice versa, a cross-dresser or a homosexual. And yet the origin of the alchemical or Hermetic Androgyne or Hermaphrodite is far from just skin deep or sexual. It is not just about being man and woman at the same time. It is about being whole, containing both a whole man and a whole woman in equal proportions.","filename":"the-yin-yang-symbol","ext":".png","w":388,"h":392,"tn_w":247,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493595304941,"time":1493595304,"md5":"oY+V99mcStXpZhFPxqeu2w==","fsize":33204,"resto":0,"id":"f3dYEywk","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"as-a-symbol-androgyny-is-for-me-both-romantic-and","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":123544753,"now":"04\/30\/17(Sun)19:36:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123544642\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123544642<\/a><br>androgyny is a spiritual symbol pointing to the cosmic truth or principle of divine wholeness.

Pretty much all of the Christian sources I&#039;ve listened to over the years are of the Meek and Mild ChristCuck variety as that&#039;s what seems to be insanely popular in America right now. However, that&#039;s such a disservice as we know that virtues such as Honesty, Morality, Loyalty, Respect, and Family are fundamental pillars to NatSoc and Christianity heavily emphasizes such teachings but is often glossed over for more feminine, &quot;safe&quot; teachings in order to appeal to larger audiences.<br><br>I&#039;m tired of the Cucks that unemotionally beat around the bush, clergy that are clearly extorting their crowd for profit and care only for numbers, and pastors that try to sound profound pulling messages and sermons out of passages just because. All of the required reading and prominent traditional Alt-Right material has been fine up until this point and probably still will be for some time, but I wonder if there&#039;s anyone, or even an entire church, that fills this specific nich\u00e9 yet?

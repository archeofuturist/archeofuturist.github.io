Before training citizens in the highly specialized techniques of earning a living, they should be trained in one or more methods of commonplace labor, trades or callings which could be utilized when they were transiently unemployed in their specialized work. No civilization can survive the long-time harboring of large classes of unemployed. In time, even the best of citizens will become distorted and demoralized by accepting support from the public treasury. Even private charity becomes pernicious when long extended to able-bodied citizens.<br><br>81:6.33 (910.6) Such a highly specialized society will not take kindly to the ancient communal and feudal practices of olden peoples. True, many common services can be acceptably and profitably socialized, but highly trained and ultraspecialized human beings can best be managed by some technique of intelligent co-operation. Modernized co-ordination and fraternal regulation will be productive of longer-lived co-operation than will the older and more primitive methods of communism or dictatorial regulative institutions based on force.<br><br>81:6.34 (910.7) 12.

One of the great hindrances to the progress of human society is the conflict between the interests and welfare of the larger, more socialized human groups and of the smaller, contrary-minded asocial associations of mankind, not to mention antisocially-minded single individuals.","time":1490498966,"resto":118288850,"id":"bhsjOk5d","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118318002,"now":"03\/26\/17(Sun)00:13:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118289758\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118289758<\/a>","filename":"1489858005609","ext":".jpg","w":455,"h":650,"tn_w":87,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490501597874,"time":1490501597,"md5":"O9ieRVDSPzuJROc5GCoVuQ==","fsize":60377,"resto":118288850,"id":"LYSK6ggu","country":"DE","country_name":"Germany"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118310864,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)22:55:54","name":"Anonymous","sub":"ITT: we give thanks for being born in a civilised nation and not having mutilated genitals","com":"Thanks.","filename":"Thanks","ext":".jpg","w":470,"h":311,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":165,"tim":1490496954459,"time":1490496954,"md5":"+i8VyooupVqQqFwWQ6dteg==","fsize":15803,"resto":0,"id":"UaroK9n4","country":"NZ","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"itt-we-give-thanks-for-being-born-in-a-civilised","country_name":"New Zealand","replies":19,"images":3,"omitted_posts":14,"omitted_images":2},{"no":118315245,"now":"03\/25\/17(Sat)23:43:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118310864\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118310864<\/a><br>I was born in Russia.

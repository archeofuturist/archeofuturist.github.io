I decided to watch and give it a go since I was feeling enraged at injustice in the world after reading some of Patton&#039;s diaries. Well one of the first thing I noticed in the series was that Hitler had a pretty impressive military career. It seemed a little too heroic so I chalked it up to propaganda.<br><br> I looked up what the MSM narrative is and it seems until recently that this semeed to be indeed true.<br>However, recent ((evidence)) was uncovered and it seems like Hitler wasn&#039;t quite heroic as he was made out to be, more working in regimental camps than on the front lines<br><br> This is all according to Thomas Weber. I looked more into the guy to see if he was a Jew which I could not find out, but in one of his interviews I read that Hitler actually served in the infamous Bavarian Soviet Republic. I looked into it and it seems like this Weber guy is the only one espousing these ideas as they come from primary documents that were missed by previous historians.<br><br>I guess my questions are:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Were you aware of this<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;How do you explain this<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Is Weber credible?<\/span>","filename":"1478564334839","ext":".jpg","w":403,"h":403,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493189572921,"time":1493189572,"md5":"HdYHsRcsAI+n\/qs2EyyaKw==","fsize":21427,"resto":0,"id":"GZ1WfEX9","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hitler-served-in-the-bavarian-soviet-republic","country_name":"United States","replies":18,"images":0,"omitted_posts":13,"omitted_images":0},{"no":122859035,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)03:40:39","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;GSNT<\/span><br>lol","time":1493192439,"resto":122855806,"id":"CHqSTNGt","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":122859197,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)03:43:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122858487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122858487<\/a><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Milit<wbr>ary_career_of_Adolf_Hitler<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;During the Battle of the Somme in October 1916, he was wounded in the left thigh when a shell exploded at the entrance to the dispatch runners&#039; dugout.[19] He begged not to be evacuated,<\/span><br><br>What he was doing in a Dispatch runners dugout that was be bombarded does raise questions in regards to Thomas Weber&#039;s narrative of &quot;behind the lines&quot; service.","time":1493192584,"resto":122855806,"id":"GZ1WfEX9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":122860910,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)04:12:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122858487\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122858487<\/a><br><br>Hitler was in a hospital recovering from a gas attack during the Third Battle of Ypres when he heard the news that the war had ended.<br><br>Hitler was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class and Iron Cross First Class.

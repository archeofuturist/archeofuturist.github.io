They have been offered dick ever since they were twelve and grew some tits and there is always a man offering them dick every minute of their lives. For women having sex is all about saying yes or no. Sex is so easy to get and so frequent for them that they plan their days around sex, they actually put sex on their daily agendas, its part of their daily lives and they are constantly prepared for it to happen at any moment. They always wear new or nice panties and bras and are always making sure to smell good and have their make up game on. They literally walk around all day with a bag full of beauty enhancing tools. Men can wear underwear with holes in it and spend all day sweaty no fucks given because unless they know for a fact that they are going to have sex they are not expecting to have sex. Women have no idea what its like to not have sex. For men, getting sex is a task that takes time, patience, skills and money to achieve. So its very easy for women to boast about their sex life when their sex life is on easy mode. Women are called sluts because when a woman says she got laid 5 times today it just means that she said yes five times today. When a man says he got laid 5 times today it means that he ran 5 A+ plays out of riskiest playbook that exist, landed all 5 of them and had the stamina to fuck all 5 women.... it really is an impressive task.","time":1491191452,"resto":119284994,"id":"qeFJYDyu","country":"SE","country_name":"Sweden"},{"no":119288121,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:04:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119284994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119284994<\/a> (You)","filename":"1490840646157","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491192258876,"time":1491192258,"md5":"J3xaSfLSH\/YOkuPR\/wxYXw==","fsize":42542,"resto":119284994,"id":"NraM\/pc9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119288663,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:10:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119284994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119284994<\/a><br>JESUS FUCK I DIDN&#039;T THINK IT WAS POSSIBLE TO HATE NIGGERS ANY MORE THAN I ALREADY DID!","time":1491192604,"resto":119284994,"id":"9apoOCh6","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":119288944,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:13:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119284994\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119284994<\/a><br>No, but it should be illegal for American niggers to live.","time":1491192783,"resto":119284994,"id":"+Ts56Nb+","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119288940,"now":"04\/03\/17(Mon)00:12:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"Haven&#039;t watched Alex Jones in years.

Ted Lieu (D-Calif.), along with Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.). About 70 other members of Congress, all Democrats, have said they support the bill, which would allow the Federal Trade Commission to classify conversion therapy and its practitioners as fraudulent.<br><br>\u201cThe bill is very simple,\u201d Lieu told The Washington Post. \u201cIt says it is fraud if you treat someone for a condition that doesn\u2019t exist and there\u2019s no medical condition known as being gay. LGBTQ people were born perfect; there is nothing to treat them for. And by calling this what it should be, which is fraud, it would effectively shut down most of the organizations.\u201d<br><br>Conversion therapy, also referred to as \u201creparative therapy\u201d or \u201cex-gay therapy,\u201d purports to be able to change a person\u2019s sexual orientation. Highly controversial, the practice has been decried by dozens of mental health, medical and LGBT rights groups as harmful and misleading. Nevertheless, very few states have passed legislation banning it.<br><br>A San Francisco State University study found that, compared to LGBT youth who are accepted, young people who experience rejection based on their sexual orientation or gender identity were eight times more likely to have attempted suicide, nearly six times more likely to report high levels of depression and more than three times as likely to use illegal drugs, according to the nonprofit Human Rights Campaign.<br><br>Seven states and the District of Columbia have successfully passed legislation to ban or restrict conversion therapy in some way. California was the first to do so, banning the practice outright in 2012; others are New Jersey, Oregon, Illinois, Vermont and, just this month, New Mexico. Although New York does not have an outright ban, the state effectively prohibits conversion therapy through administrative regulations.","filename":"convertible","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1493325911692,"time":1493325911,"md5":"dKY0IsN7fQEArKLb7DdTZQ==","fsize":114128,"resto":0,"id":"SMPSvYFw","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"does-pol-support-banning-conversion-therapy","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":123084438,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)16:41:38","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Nigga What?","com":"\/pol\/<br>What does nigger mean?","filename":"IMG_0079","ext":".jpg","w":1771,"h":1328,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1493325698702,"time":1493325698,"md5":"fe\/SyyyuARCc5POYEyr7dg==","fsize":219911,"resto":0,"id":"ZBNGOHj4","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"nigga-what","country_name":"Australia","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":123084915,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)16:45:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"Alex","filename":"7dVbDJYQ","ext":".jpg","w":512,"h":512,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493325904271,"time":1493325904,"md5":"4U9zEnoy\/Vj2Ol+cqk0vKA==","fsize":56060,"resto":123084438,"id":"NDjOLc24","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

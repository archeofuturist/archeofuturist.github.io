One of Muhammad&#039;s most brutal acts involved a prisoner named Kinana. Kinana was one of the leaders of Khaibar. Muhammad wanted him to reveal where some buried treasure was hidden.

In my opinion, you can&#039;t send them back or just let them die on their own, because that&#039;s not only cruel but also selfish as f***. We have the capabilities of taking them in, the majority of these people are the most thankful and giving members in our whole society.

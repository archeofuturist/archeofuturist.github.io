Some idealists will emerge, no doubt, but they simply cannot compete with a charismatic professional liar that is backed by connections to mass media.<br><br>National socialism seeks to destroy this system and replace it with a single, unified governing body that serves the peoples best interests as a matter of ideology (or, if all else fails, because the people would <br>otherwise remove it). <br><br>No more lies, no more smear campaigns, no more empty promises never meant to be kept, no more endless arguments that never lead to action. <br><br>It combines two seemingly conflicting notions - the stark and stoic Nationalism with the subservient and altruistic Socialism - so that they may balance each other. The harshness of nationalism is softened by an imperative to help those in need. The weakness of socialism to exploitation is tempered with iron resolve and burning pride.<br>One nation. One state.

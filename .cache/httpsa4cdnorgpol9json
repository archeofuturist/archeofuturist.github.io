Expect one country two systems to become one country one system at an even faster rate than ever before.<br><br>Hong Kong and Macau have a slightly sad atmosphere to them now. Both are essentially adrift and without any influence from the US they&#039;re on borrowed time and will be reattached to the hive within time. Eventually all that will be left will be some faded old signs no one can read and cars driving on the other side of the road from the mainland.<br><br>Here in Worst Korea we can expect the left to emerge triumphant especially following the recent scandal involving Park Gun-hye. Despite Trump having gone back on what he said, the cat is out of the bag, the new thinking is that the Far East and Europe are ultimately on their own and will have to make their own accommodations with China.<br><br>If we end up with a Chinese-dominated Far East, Russian dominated Europe and the US itself is a semi-authoritarian illiberal state, this will be a kind of shitty 1984-esque world we are about to start living in. China sucks. Russia sucks. I hope America will be at least somewhat less shitty than either I guess that&#039;s the best we can hope for.<br><br>I know about the Jews, I know about demographics, I know about all that. But can we at least admit that some things about the liberal era will be missed?

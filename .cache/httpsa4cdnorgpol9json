Listen to the Between Two Lampshades podcast from 14 December, with Mike Enoch, Richard Soencer and Andrew Anglin. They talk about how enviromentalism is an exclusively white concern, and even more than that, how whites are the only ones who enjoy nature, going on trails, camping and such. They talk about how the right needs to take the fight against the left to all fields, and also take from them policies that have no business being exclusive to them.","time":1492684519,"resto":121976518,"id":"LROanbml","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121979392,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)06:18:10","name":"Anonymous","sub":"How can u tell is someone is attempting damage control?","com":"It feels like it should be obvious, but how can you tell if someone is trying to defend someone else getting btfo, or if they are in fact that same person attempting damage control?<br><br>ultimately it doesnt matter, as if 1 or 2 opposing voices could change the mindset of ANY board here on 4chan.<br><br>pic unrelated","filename":"1486742891035","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":694,"tn_w":180,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492683490455,"time":1492683490,"md5":"MHXmzsjr+dZ2vGGKD2RaXw==","fsize":96038,"resto":0,"id":"GIuE39pl","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-can-u-tell-is-someone-is-attempting-damage","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":1,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":1},{"no":121980111,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)06:27:53","name":"OP","com":"main reason why im asking is because i tried defending someone who fucked up pretty badly on a \/v\/ thread. posted a screen cap cuz of some glichy steam download and didnt blank out his steam name. seemed like the idiot didnt have a clue what he was getting himself into so i tried to back him up and call everyone else out on their shit.<br><br>guess what happened","time":1492684073,"resto":121979392,"id":"GIuE39pl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121980567,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)06:34:02","name":"OP","com":"<a href=\"#p121980111\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121980111<\/a><br>nice trips","time":1492684442,"resto":121979392,"id":"GIuE39pl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121980589,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)06:34:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121979392\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121979392<\/a><br><br>If you say something stupid, and they point out the logical inconsistency or flaw, then accuse them of doing &#039;damage control.&#039; It negates the validity of their argument instantly, and shows that you are the supreme intellectual in the thread.<br><br>After all, no one could LEGITIMATELY disagree with you, and you&#039;re certainly not WRONG.","time":1492684455,"resto":121979392,"id":"vfHBYcxc","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121980896,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)06:38:01","name":"OP","com":"<a href=\"#p121980589\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121980589<\/a><br>is that how shit works around here?<br><br><a href=\"#p121980567\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121980567<\/a><br>also, i will indeed admit, I complimented my own roll","filename":"canstock8309378","ext":".jpg","w":271,"h":194,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":89,"tim":1492684681252,"time":1492684681,"md5":"62lAUIMM6+xeG58DGC\/eyg==","fsize":8986,"resto":121979392,"id":"GIuE39pl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121981030,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)06:39:33","name":"OP","com":"<a href=\"#p121980896\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121980896<\/a><br>sue me","time":1492684773,"resto":121979392,"id":"GIuE39pl","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121979446,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)06:18:53","name":"Anonymous","sub":"ANN COULTER DROPS A REDPILL","com":"http:\/\/www.breitbart.com\/big-govern<wbr>ment\/2017\/04\/19\/choice-green-americ<wbr>a-brown-america<br>Is she \/ourgal)?","filename":"1476333206298","ext":".jpg","w":800,"h":792,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":247,"tim":1492683533208,"time":1492683533,"md5":"Jqpk73urmxUOzM8\/asK\/3g==","fsize":75846,"resto":0,"id":"M\/LGP2ZX","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"ann-coulter-drops-a-redpill","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":2},{"no":121979657,"now":"04\/20\/17(Thu)06:21:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121979446\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121979446<\/a><br>She betrayed Trump, she&#039;s a fucking traitor.

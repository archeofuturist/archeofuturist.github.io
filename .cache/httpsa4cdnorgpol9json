The key resistance stands in the 113-114 zone. The press will try to manipulate the people to save the EU. That is the agenda of the press in Europe, so they will cheer Macron and do their best to destroy Le Pen and in doing so, they are condemning the EU to utter failure. All they can see is keep the EU together even if that leads to internal civil war within Europe. The only thing holding the EU together is France and Germany.&quot;<br><br>The elite want Macron to win but this will be the nail in the coffin for the EU. Brussels will assume they defeated the \u201cpopulist\u201d simply if Le Pen loses. However, the mainstream parties all lost already. Macron will simply mean that Brussels will not reform and that suggests that we are looking at the collapse of the Euro moving forward into 2018. <br><br>https:\/\/www.armstrongeconomics.com\/<wbr>international-news\/politics\/the-eur<wbr>o-french-elections\/<br><br>EU might be screwed anyway you look at it, the question is if european globalism will fade with it.","filename":"1490468909251","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":640,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493909524010,"time":1493909524,"md5":"kdOYl3238N7GDEwZejU\/yQ==","fsize":44242,"resto":0,"id":"2iL46q9i","country":"SE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"eu-in-turmoil-regardless-of-le-pen-or-macron","country_name":"Sweden","replies":10,"images":1,"omitted_posts":5,"omitted_images":0},{"no":124070416,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)11:26:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"I wonder if the EU wouldn&#039;t fall faster with Macron actually<br>What&#039;s their stance on NGOs?","time":1493911574,"resto":124067091,"id":"Yzz8mU6P","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"},{"no":124070819,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)11:30:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p124070416\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;124070416<\/a><br>&quot;Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have become essential actors in the social field, particularly in the fight against poverty and social exclusion.

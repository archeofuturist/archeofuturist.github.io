To contest that an argument is unsound because its words aren&#039;t explicitly defined, and because words have an infinite number of possible definitions (between what number of definitions is irrelevant), is a continuum fallacy. All words already have a finite number of implicit definitions. The principle of charity dictates that, when a word in an argument isn&#039;t explicitly defined, you simply choose whichever pre-existent, implicit definition (which exist for all words) would make the argument sound. This is obvious with arguments with &#039;little&#039; words, and it doesn&#039;t change for arguments with &#039;big&#039; words; &#039;big&#039; words don&#039;t objectively exist.

The Republican candidate had a history of corruption and sexual scandals and his rival Republican candidate (from the first phase of the election) campaigned for the Democrat in the runoff.","filename":"4chan_pol_logo","ext":".png","w":500,"h":500,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492567659862,"time":1492567659,"md5":"myZLikD+dqFZtaMUbZR5mg==","fsize":307156,"resto":121780704,"id":"NDCQlPxg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121784108,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:10:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121780704\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121780704<\/a><br>TO SEE IF I STILL FEEL","time":1492567809,"resto":121780704,"id":"qTAaVT5Q","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121784539,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:13:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121783730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121783730<\/a><br>I think Louisiana was just tired of being associated with Bobby Chupacabra and would have even voted for a nigger.","filename":"1486857845961","ext":".jpg","w":500,"h":791,"tn_w":79,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492567996126,"time":1492567996,"md5":"R85bPQyk+zZ9uJFyVycHYQ==","fsize":40866,"resto":121780704,"id":"\/J5cZi\/o","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121780066,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)21:41:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"whats a good caption for this pic?","filename":"1492213833063","ext":".png","w":1013,"h":659,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":162,"tim":1492566073715,"time":1492566073,"md5":"C2iup6VUjZBnalhLPcbCZg==","fsize":131723,"resto":0,"id":"MtIdrSzN","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"whats-a-good-caption-for-this-pic","country_name":"United States","replies":6,"images":1,"omitted_posts":1,"omitted_images":0},{"no":121782739,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:00:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"Today we will dominate America.Tommorow,the world!","time":1492567238,"resto":121780066,"id":"l95nMuot","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121783093,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:02:56","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121780066\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121780066<\/a><br><br>Jew jew train","time":1492567376,"resto":121780066,"id":"H81OK6xz","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121783362,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:04:47","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121780066\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121780066<\/a>","filename":"1491821628203","ext":".png","w":1637,"h":682,"tn_w":124,"tn_h":52,"tim":1492567487475,"time":1492567487,"md5":"FE9+P8OiYaXpYNS2Nr3FDQ==","fsize":806346,"resto":121780066,"id":"qNg5yEX6","country":"AU","m_img":1,"country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121784342,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:11:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121783362\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121783362<\/a><br>IT COMES FULL CIRCLE","time":1492567910,"resto":121780066,"id":"biG0DXIZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121784540,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)22:13:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121783093\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121783093<\/a><br>This OP","time":1492567995,"resto":121780066,"id":"R1lnUNVX","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121768954,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)20:24:57","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Bikelockscum WILL be found and punished.","com":"New thread for sharing info on bikelockscum, so we can get him in touch with:<br>- Law enforcement<br>- His victims<br>- Randos who just want to inform him that they dislike him<br><br>Ground rules:<br>Trolling and responding to trolls are WELCOME, but, please only post that shit to a separate thread.

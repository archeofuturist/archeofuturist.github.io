I live over in the Melbourne area and they&#039;re all over the Florida Tech area, even have a mosque directly across the street from a private Catholic school, because Florida Tech keeps importing them from their desert shit holes. The school did an international day festival last month and like half the fucking groups were muslim groups from various gulf states.<br><br>There was already an incident back in December 2015 where an ex-FIT student from Dubai was arrested for possessing a shitload of ammo illegally (he&#039;d been dropped from the school in 2014 and was thus living here illegally on an expired student visa), living in a hotel and checking out and then into different rooms every day and somehow racking up $11,000 in charges. I&#039;m worried that--and wouldn&#039;t be too surprised if--this area turns into a hotbed of radical Islamists passing through or gathering.","time":1490936374,"resto":119013469,"id":"nJ6\/OfRI","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119023375,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)01:09:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119020995\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119020995<\/a>","filename":"14882701256503","ext":".jpg","w":950,"h":672,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":88,"tim":1490936961502,"time":1490936961,"md5":"v84JJ2G\/aBv7ivmVDuwKiw==","fsize":110149,"resto":119013469,"id":"opf\/CGIk","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118997856,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)21:11:42","name":"Anonymous","sub":"HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!","com":"IT&#039;S FUCKING OVER!!!!

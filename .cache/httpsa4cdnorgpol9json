A Temple University-led team hopes so, by using a gene editing technique to successfully remove HIV infection from lab mice.

majority of young people were not hippies but that didnt stop the hippie movement from becoming the defining feature of the cultural narrative from that decade and why everyone associates the 60s with hippies even though they were a small minority relative to the overall population. most likely the blacked meme will be the same for the obama years because the (((academics))) who write history textbooks will talk about how having a black president removed the last vestiges of stigma associated with interracial dating and they will use pop culture as evidence for this in the exact same way

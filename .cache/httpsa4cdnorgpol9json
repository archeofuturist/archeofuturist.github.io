Ok, we know the back story to Ishmael and Isaac (if not don&#039;t bother replying until reading up on it please) Isaacs descendants (The Jews) were promised a great empire (Israel under Judaism) However, Since Abraham and his wife Sarah grew impatient due to her infertility, they had a son through their Handmaiden Hagar, Ishmael. Because of this rash decision, God also promised a great Kingdom to Ishmael (Islam) <br><br>Now it is my belief, and that of many other Christians, that Muhammad did not speak to an Angel, he was actually demon posessed. Muhammad was in a very dark place when he went into the cave and recited the Quran, he was suicidal. This allowed the Demons to creep in. He himself believed it was demonic posession until his wife convinced him that he was a messenger of God. Muhammad being in a dark suicidal place is a good reflection of Ishamel himself, who at 14 was cast out, lost his entire family, his home, everything due to the birth of Isaac. Effectively, all Ishamels descendants have an emotinal and spiritual wound that never healed when Ishmael was cast out. It is because of this emotinal wounding that Christians should show love to Muslims, they are good people who have been wounded and misguided. We should love them and try to help heal there wound and guide them to the light.<br><br>How do Jews, the descendents of Isaac fit into this? Well, they forsook their prophecy of the great kingdom of Israel when they denied the Christ. Which is why the Middle East is a warzone today. There are no great kingdoms because the Jews are trying to achieve their prophecy under false pretences, lies, and violence. <br><br>cont.","filename":"17991105_1952129665009004_2494312478358096412_n","ext":".jpg","w":552,"h":828,"tn_w":166,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492972335728,"time":1492972335,"md5":"xJlziqKqR2ac5r8ehEAbsw==","fsize":54316,"resto":0,"id":"\/8ns9HQT","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"kikes-muslims-and-christians-weigh-in","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":122462619,"now":"04\/23\/17(Sun)14:34:18","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p122462307\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122462307<\/a><br>No. Muslims are backwards people who prefer throwing acid in their daughters&#039; faces than forgiveness.

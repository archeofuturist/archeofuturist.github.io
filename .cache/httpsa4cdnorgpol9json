Most of this is just liberal arts biographers using debunked stories from those men who have lied about their experiences like Eli Weisel. <br><br>The majority can say that what happened was terrible, and even with a bluepilled mindset about the Holocaust, the acceptance of the real figures is good enough evidence that the event was real and such a thing could be called a genocide, but they continue talking about a 6 million that is a lie in the face of the facts. <br><br>Why do they continue parroting this lie to the world when even the factual numbers are high enough to use for their never again crusade? Why do they use people who admit to lying to forward their message? Most importantly, why do they not give a shit about any other genocide in the numbers equivalent to the factual holocaust numbers? <br><br>It&#039;s baffling, and makes people just look harder at the event to the point of outright denial that the event happened in any form.","filename":"tmp_8737-Corpses789655434","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":460,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":95,"tim":1490674300978,"time":1490674300,"md5":"U16GujGmrq5SDFmakmhJpw==","fsize":61782,"resto":118602393,"id":"g6bgbs6g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118609869,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:21:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118602393\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118602393<\/a><br>You&#039;re probably a kike trying to wipe information away from the internet.","time":1490674887,"resto":118602393,"id":"DthRvAB9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118610081,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:23:34","name":"Anonymous","filename":"soroskraut","ext":".jpg","w":600,"h":866,"tn_w":86,"tn_h":124,"tim":1490675014537,"time":1490675014,"md5":"W7pb0Cj5+9YFJsb8l+rKYQ==","fsize":327166,"resto":118602393,"id":"dXC4fsiN","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118609563,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:18:03","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;British &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;food&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;<wbr>&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;<\/span>","filename":"british food","ext":".jpg","w":640,"h":1084,"tn_w":147,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490674683956,"time":1490674683,"md5":"Z4IYIOts+iRlNk5zJwf47w==","fsize":86707,"resto":0,"id":"5kxQDNDl","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"british-food","country_name":"United States","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":118610053,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:23:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;British &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;girls&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;<wbr>&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;<\/span>","filename":"MaisieWilliams","ext":".jpg","w":300,"h":262,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":109,"tim":1490674997177,"time":1490674997,"md5":"xSyX4HZZ82j7bXa6KiVCTw==","fsize":5362,"resto":118609563,"id":"QLMnOARm","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118573703,"now":"03\/27\/17(Mon)18:44:28","name":"robert paulson","sub":"What are the main points that lead people to believe the Holocaust never happened?","com":"is there a video i can watch","filename":"tJAcNNx","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":1600,"tn_w":140,"tn_h":250,"tim":1490654668188,"time":1490654668,"md5":"bkmaOTox\/669mENzL4j6GA==","fsize":322659,"resto":0,"id":"6KTimFXm","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-are-the-main-points-that-lead-people-to","country_name":"Australia","replies":228,"images":75,"omitted_posts":223,"omitted_images":73,"tail_size":50},{"no":118608671,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:08:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118595597\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118595597<\/a><br>Der ewige Australier","time":1490674131,"resto":118573703,"id":"dN4AbR7\/","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":118608691,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:09:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118575182\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118575182<\/a><br>7, 9 or 0","time":1490674141,"resto":118573703,"id":"i2uInvjr","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118608994,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:12:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118579194\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118579194<\/a><br><br>I wasn&#039;t even anti-semitic until 2008 to now when cultural marxism and kikery have been pushed harder than ever before.","time":1490674331,"resto":118573703,"id":"d7093OTd","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118609248,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:15:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118607046\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118607046<\/a><br>go away, leaf kikeeeeee","filename":"OHFUCKIT","ext":".png","w":501,"h":576,"tn_w":108,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490674500313,"time":1490674500,"md5":"vo2oWVMIdGx4Pnyj+MIwMQ==","fsize":11173,"resto":118573703,"id":"DyTceu7\/","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118610039,"now":"03\/28\/17(Tue)00:23:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118602197\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118602197<\/a><br>That&#039;s a very general claim.

An estimated 250 million vehicles worldwide are expected to contain connected features within the next five years, and automakers\u2014inundated with detailed information on drivers\u2019 whereabouts, in-car entertainment selections, and vehicle diagnostics\u2014are searching for ways to harvest and profit from that data stream. With that in mind, global supplier Delphi Automotive has announced a series of partnerships and investments intended to establish platforms that will help their OEM customers extract customer data and generate revenue from it. Delphi executives announced that their company has acquired minority stakes in two Israeli companies and established a strategic partnership with a third firm. The moves are all centered on improving vehicle connectivity and data analytics. Valens, a chipmaker, will help Delphi speed the transfer of data, moving it approximately six times faster than today\u2019s averages. Otonomo establishes a common platform and serves as a data broker between OEMs and third parties. Rosenberger, a German connectivity company, helps tie together systems that enable driver-assistance features, automated driving, and connected platforms.<br><br>Of the most recent announcements, the one with the broadest implications for automakers and motorists is Delphi\u2019s stake in Otonomo. The Israeli tech company is essentially creating a data marketplace. What makes the company\u2019s services attractive to automakers is the ability to aggregate data from multiple companies and provide a more comprehensive data set to interested parties. That reach is significant.<br><br>1\/2<br><br>-- <br><br>Why is this allowed?","filename":"HappyIsraelis","ext":".jpg","w":876,"h":535,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":152,"tim":1492017174908,"time":1492017174,"md5":"p8gafGzaiJyPIDvcmOyBng==","fsize":59493,"resto":0,"id":"fgFKRe8g","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"carmarkers-soon-to-profit-off-selling-your-data","country_name":"United States","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":120779266,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)13:13:10","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120779240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120779240<\/a><br>If a third-party service \u201cwants specific information on vehicle or consumer behavior, Otonomo could be customizing the query for that data,\u201d DeVos said. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of flexibility and customization to tailor that data set to a third-party provider.\u201d What kind of third party? These might include insurance companies, tolling authorities, roadside burger joints, city planners, and emergency services. In its 2016 Connected Car Forecast, global automotive consulting firm SBD noted that OEMs anticipate building after-sales relationships with customers through connectivity and using that data to offer them insurance discounts or reduce warranty expenses. \u201c<br><br>That\u2019s one of the most exciting parts of this,\u201d DeVos said. Consumers may be less excited. For all the industry chatter about making money off vehicular data, others have been pushing to ensure that driver data remains owned by drivers. In 2014, AAA, the nation\u2019s largest motoring club, urged automakers to be transparent about the ways they extract data from customers.<br><br>Congress, too, has taken interest in automotive privacy. In 2015, a provision in the Fixing America\u2019s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act established that customers own the data that resides in the event data recorders that come in all new vehicles. That law didn\u2019t address the reams of other telematics-based data streams, but Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) has sponsored legislation that would direct federal agencies to establish standards that safeguard driver privacy.<br><br>Delphi says that data harvested by Otonomo is anonymized and that customers would have the right to opt out of any connected services. Opting out of using connected services, however, doesn\u2019t mean that drivers who do use those services would have any say in what automakers do with the data those services collect.<br><br>2\/2","time":1492017190,"resto":120779240,"id":"fgFKRe8g","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120779712,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)13:17:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120779240\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120779240<\/a><br>bump","time":1492017450,"resto":120779240,"id":"zoS3+Vn4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120749334,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)08:22:33","name":"Anonymous","sub":"EARNED not given","com":"In the 90&#039;s scifi action film, Starship Troopers, the characters that lived in what seems to be a more militaristic version of future America, had to earn their citizenship, they were not granted it automatically by birth.<br><br>Most of the characters in the movie saw enlisting in the military was the easiest option although there were other methods of obtaining it.<br><br>Do you think countries in real life would benefit from a system like this?","filename":"starshiptroopers1997.0113[1]","ext":".jpg","w":520,"h":282,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":135,"tim":1491999753972,"time":1491999753,"md5":"0GrzD0rysp80XTZ1+V8chw==","fsize":36142,"resto":0,"id":"hBIVnj88","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"earned-not-given","country_name":"United States","replies":173,"images":28,"omitted_posts":168,"omitted_images":26,"tail_size":50},{"no":120775159,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)12:36:37","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120773193\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120773193<\/a><br>To be fair its kind of meant to be flashy and cool at the same time.

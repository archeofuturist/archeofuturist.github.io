It is beyond stupid. This is complete historic revisionism that makes me want to cut my own eye out. This may be the most idiotic, yet fearsomely defended lie on this board. <br><br>Germany did not let the BEF go. The counter-attack at Arras was almost fateful for the Germans as the tanks were far ahead of the infantry and had no ground or air support.<br><br>Despite failing, the counter-attack at Arras proved to be almost dangerous for the German Panzers for the reason stated above. The German Panzers flanks were very open to attack because of the lack of infantry. General Ewald von Kleist, commanding Panzer Group Kleist, pulled out the 10th Panzer Division from Heinz Guderian&#039;s XIX Corps&#039;s advance on Boulogne and Dunkirk, put it into in reserve in case Britain and France renewed their attack at Arras. Kleist complained that his XIX and XIV corps weren&#039;t strong enough to continue their advance until Arras was dealt with.<br><br>Complaints were made to Gunther von Kluge, commander of the 4th army. This complaint was kicked up the chain of command and eventually reached G\u00fcnther von Kluge who ordered a halt on 23rd of May.<br><br>It was thought that the German infantry could catch up within 36 hours and the assault could continue, but it took more than 48 hours for the infantry to catch up and secure the tanks. It was von Rundstedt who ordered the assault be continued later, not Hitler. Hitler did not micromanage at this stage in the war, he began to get obsessive later on.<br><br>The decision to stop was not made by foreign policy officials or Hitler as some elaborate ruse to gain Britain&#039;s favour. The halt was ordered because it takes time to prepare to crush 300,000 men who are heavily armed.<br><br>The Blitzkrieg attacks were so unorganised and chaotic that the German communication lines were weak, and the counter-attack at Arras proved as much.<br><br>History isn&#039;t as simple as you say","time":1492808354,"resto":122146771,"id":"UoFOI8ss","country":"GB","country_name":"United

In 1884 in Freiburg, the commission declared that corporatism was a &quot;system of social organization that has at its base the grouping of men according to the community of their natural interests and social functions, and as true and proper organs of the state they direct and coordinate labor and capital in matters of common interest&quot;.<\/span><br> <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Corporatism

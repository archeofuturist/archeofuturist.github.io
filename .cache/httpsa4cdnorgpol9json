Niggers are carrying guns in your country, giving a nigger a gun is like giving a baby abo some weed. Why do you even need guns? bows and arrows are more effective at killing anyway. Guns are loud, bows are almost completely silent but it depends how much force you apply to the string. Actually, boomerangs are the most efficient, effective ranged weapon known to mankind. If you&#039;re skilled with a boomerang you practically have infinite ammo, also, boomerangs rarely kill unless you apply a lot of force into the throw and it hits your targets head. Another great thing about boomerangs is that they&#039;re surprisingly easy to make, all you need is wood and something to carve the wood and if you want you can get some paint and paint a huge penis on it too make it all the more humiliating to get boomaranged. Also, boomerangs have almost 50 thousand years worth of history, do you know what that means you pathetic american pig? it means that boomerangs have gone through 50 thousand years worth of EVOLUTION, they&#039;re the perfect weapon because they have evolved so much.","filename":"boomerang1","ext":".jpg","w":2048,"h":1536,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":187,"tim":1491021459656,"time":1491021459,"md5":"CiQ3fD2jLliNW\/o6cUnTbA==","fsize":1013574,"resto":0,"id":"TYNfQ64S","country":"AU","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"american-gun-laws","country_name":"Australia","replies":5,"images":2},{"no":119147062,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)01:02:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119144941\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119144941<\/a><br>Boomerangs are illegal in your country.

That itself was a violation of the Logan Act, and then Flynn went on to lie about it to the FBI, a prosecutable felony. MSNBC analyst Jeremy Bash, who has a prior history as Chief of Staff at the State Department and CIA, reported the following on-air on Thursday night. His words were posted online by respected political pundit Caroline Orr:<br><br>This may explain why Michael Flynn is offering to cut a deal. He\u2019s spent years working in the government, including the Defense Intelligence Agency, and he\u2019s surely aware that immunity is only granted when a suspect can deliver evidence that a more important suspect in the hierarchy is guilty. Flynn wouldn\u2019t even be bothering to make the immunity request unless he has sufficient evidence up his sleeve.","filename":"1305477152315","ext":".jpg","w":5616,"h":3744,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491019572550,"time":1491019572,"md5":"ZttkfYITGQiu9g8JxtHJhQ==","fsize":1123988,"resto":0,"id":"R+41wl9h","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"mike-flynn-was-forced-to-resign-in-february-after","country_name":"United States","replies":29,"images":5,"omitted_posts":24,"omitted_images":4},{"no":119147505,"now":"04\/01\/17(Sat)01:07:24","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119145981\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119145981<\/a><br>http:\/\/www.washingtontimes.com\/news<wbr>\/2017\/mar\/16\/inside-the-beltway-oba<wbr>ma-in-paradise-hes-in-tahiti\/<br>Ok, then.

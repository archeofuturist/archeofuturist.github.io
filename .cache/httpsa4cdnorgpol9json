By focusing on them we&#039;re closely associating our movement with theirs. That association, even if we&#039;re their counterpoint, still brings us down to their level. Most moderate leftist normies are embarrassed by antifa and we shouldn&#039;t be known as one of two belligerent parties, but instead as a viable alternative ideology to the mainstream leftist narrative. We&#039;re looking as foolish as they do, like rabble-rousers most people wouldn&#039;t want to be associated with. <br><br>Fighting them in the streets is great and I applaud everyone who does so but we should frame it as being relatively easy and just a small part of what we&#039;re about. Walk right through them and crush them with your boots, don&#039;t engage them in an ideological struggle. Our struggle is against the jews, the globalists, the leftists, and pretty much everybody else in the world, not the fringe elements. Don&#039;t take your eye off the ball and get distracted by hipster fags in skinny jeans who aren&#039;t really a threat. If our movement is successful their time will come in due course.<br><br>When Richard Spencer got sucker-punched he wouldn&#039;t shut up about it for months. It made him look weak. Call the attacker a pussy, say he hits like a girl, then finish the interview like it was no big deal. Doxxing them and pressing charges is gay, street fights shouldn&#039;t be a big deal. These college tours are getting stupid too. We look like edge-lords stirring up a new controversy every week\u2014just like antifa. We should present ourselves as an ideology not a controversy.<br><br>Finally, antifa isn&#039;t going anywhere so what are we going to accomplish by focusing our efforts on them? Do you really think we&#039;re going to change their minds and they&#039;ll stop knocking over garbage cans? The ride will never end so let&#039;s not get on it in the first place. Our movement is too important.

Think of modern world as military theater that is fashioned after WWE or WWF. So even though there they perform military activities they are not exactly designed to inflict damage unless they use that activity to target someone. So we have lots of friendly fire, IED, fragging, suicides, sexual assaults, code red, bullying, taunting, etc.. and of course lots of programs to &quot;combat&quot; those evils with pride parades, marathons, fundraisers, etc.. It&#039;s a very vicious cycle of shit martini stirrers.","time":1492519105,"resto":121678248,"id":"p+yYiMW8","country":"LT","country_name":"Lithuania"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121679704,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)08:37:57","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Traitor whore Teresa May promises MORE immigration after Brexit LOL","com":"Prime Minister Theresa May has indicated that EU migrants could continue flowing into the UK for years,even after Britain leaves the European Union in 2019.<br>May said (((free movement))) may linger in the first couple of years after Brexit, as businesses and governments will need time to adjust while the final deal with the EU is implemented. <br>Speaking to reporters during her trip to the Middle East, May ruled out stripping EU migrants of their right to free movement during the post-Brexit transitional period.<br>\u201cIf you think about it, once we\u2019ve got the deal, once we\u2019ve agreed what the new relationship will be for the future, it will be necessary for there to be a period of time when businesses and governments are adjusting systems and so forth, depending on the nature of the deal.","filename":"untitled","ext":".png","w":417,"h":524,"tn_w":198,"tn_h":250,"tim":1492519077985,"time":1492519077,"md5":"HtpqB7\/CMU4+p\/Eigh1XgA==","fsize":203520,"resto":0,"id":"SRJxPQkV","country":"ME","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"traitor-whore-teresa-may-promises-more","country_name":"Montenegro","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121667304,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)06:25:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"When are we just going to stop this sissy political bull shit and destroy North Korea already \/pol\/?","filename":"trumpaircraftcarrier","ext":".jpg","w":299,"h":168,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492511127563,"time":1492511127,"md5":"l2qyczFxBZG0y+HjiK4YcQ==","fsize":9401,"resto":0,"id":"3ei0l5cV","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"when-are-we-just-going-to-stop-this-sissy","country_name":"United States","replies":54,"images":7,"omitted_posts":49,"omitted_images":7},{"no":121675884,"now":"04\/18\/17(Tue)07:55:23","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121675366\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121675366<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;What about Russia?

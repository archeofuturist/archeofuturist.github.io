You can shoot down their satellites to jam their entire communication system, conduct cyber warfare to destroy their financial system, hold bioweapons over their heads and blackmail them, that kind of stuff. To go all in with guns blazing in 21st century warfare (between real superpowers, not just bombing sand people) would be like bringing a sledgehammer to a sniper battle.

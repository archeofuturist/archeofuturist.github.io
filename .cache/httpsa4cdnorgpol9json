Some organisms do so by asexual reproduction, needing no partner. Some organisms reproduce sexually, requiring a partner to consummate with. Humans are such creatures. In humans, sexual reproduction requires contact of two organisms possessing differing genitalia. One individual, classified as &#039;female&quot;, possesses organs necessary to give birth to a new individual. The other individual, classified as &quot;male&quot;, possesses organs necessary to give genetic diversity to the new individual. Humans are not hermaphroditic; they can either be male or female.<br><br>Despite the obvious requirement of compatible sexes for successful reproduction, our culture is now fully accepting of mating between incompatible sexes: male-male and female-female matings. Such pairings are unable to bear children. The male-male pairing does not have structures for growth of a new individual. The female-female pairing does not have structures for transmission of genetic material to grant genetic diversity. Even more disturbing is the nonacceptance of one&#039;s own sex, believing that, despite possessing genitalia of one of the sexes, one is of the other sex. This can also lead to failure in reproduction either behaviourally (i.e. refusing to mate with the correct sex) or physically (i.e. mutilating one&#039;s own genitalia, reducing the capability of reproducing).<br><br>Why is inhibition of the incredibly natural behaviour of sexual reproduction so accepted in western culture?","filename":"1488337467226","ext":".gif","w":342,"h":320,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":233,"tim":1490151430748,"time":1490151430,"md5":"LoAjKf1JQ6Pl9UQcvxyqMA==","fsize":779723,"resto":0,"id":"eI90iX8R","country":"CA","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-faggot-problem","country_name":"Canada","replies":9,"images":3,"omitted_posts":4,"omitted_images":2},{"no":117711475,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)23:09:11","name":"Anonymous","com":"The problem is that fags are gay as fuck","time":1490152151,"resto":117710223,"id":"sHhyrc4r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":117711592,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)23:10:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is now a gay thread.

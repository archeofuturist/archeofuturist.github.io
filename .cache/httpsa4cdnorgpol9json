Homosexual historian Frank Rector writes that &quot;Hitler was, to a substantial extent the most outstanding, most notorious, of all homosexuals. The celebrated Nazi leader Ernst Rohm, the virile and manly chief of the SA, was the du buddy of Adolf Hitler from the beginning of his political career. Hitler&#039;s rise had in fact depended upon Rohm and everyone knew it. Rohm&#039;s gay fun and games were certainly no secret; his amorous forays to gay bars and gay Turkish baths were riotous. Whatever anti-homosexual sentiments may have been expressed by straight Nazis were more than offset by the reality of highly visible, spectacular, gay-loving Rohm. If there were occasional ominous rumblings and grumblings about &quot;all those queers&quot; in the SA and Movement, and some anti-gay flare-ups, homosexual Nazis felt more-or-less secure in the lap of the Party.

Everyday I hear about my country importing more and more military vehicles, tanks, long range missiles, self propelled artillery with up to 40 km range, drones, no weapons because we have developed private arms industry, support equipment. We have propaganda posters about joining the army and air force everywhere, almost in every fucking tram. We are getting an obligatory military service.<br>We are buying military equipment from EU countries (mostly Germany) at a relativly low price and getting a lot of free weapons, vehicles, drones etc of the newest tech from USA.<br>So my question is, does any one of you EU nations notice the same thing? Mostly asking the bordering ones, Hungary, Poland,..<br>My country is not doing economicaly good at all and we are in debt but our investments in the military are huge. <br>Forgot to mention our president is NATO whore.<br>What is NATO arming us against? We are just a random low developed country why are they investing in our military so much?","filename":"tank","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":512,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":166,"tim":1491586026810,"time":1491586026,"md5":"5KTelvP4IWjnRQxb1lPIWg==","fsize":89239,"resto":0,"id":"TzQojxlg","country":"HR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"hello-random-croatian-here-with-several-military","country_name":"Croatia","replies":30,"images":5,"omitted_posts":25,"omitted_images":4},{"no":119995303,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)14:16:59","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119986631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119986631<\/a><br>We aren&#039;t that armed, even if we spend a lot on military<br>Look Ukraine has 3x amount of tanks, artillery, armored vechicles etc, then it has 2x amount of standing army than Poland<br>Yet Ukraine spends 2x less than Poland on military<br><br>We just pay a lot on fancy and new stuff, while Ukraine has post-WW2 stuff that barely works<br>Also: proper aircraft is fucking expensive","time":1491589019,"resto":119986631,"id":"OMzqJWQo","country":"PL","country_name":"Poland"},{"no":119995340,"now":"04\/07\/17(Fri)14:17:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119986631\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119986631<\/a><br><br>They\u00b4re building a regional Western powerhub to hold off Russia-Turkish and allied nations\/regions in the area; Russia has been arming Serbs for decades with far more outlaying weaponry they normally couldn&#039;t afford (29s etc).

One year later, the company began operations in Asia with the opening of Hong Kong.[5] In 1996 the company listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The company markets its products in 54 markets through a network of approximately 1.2 million independent distributors.[2]<br><br>In the 1990s, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) investigated Nu Skin over complaints of its multilevel marketing practices.[6] In 1992, Nu Skin reached settlements with 5 states which had accused the company of deceptive advertising and overstating the income earned by distributors.[7] In 1994, following an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the company paid $1 million and signed a consent decree prohibiting it from making deceptive or unsubstantiated claims about its products.[8] In 1997, the company paid an additional $1.5 million to the FTC to settle ongoing allegations of unsubstantiated promotional claims.[9] In January 2014, the Chinese government announced that it was investigating Nu Skin following a People&#039;s Daily newspaper report calling it a &quot;suspected illegal pyramid scheme.&quot; In 2016, Nu Skin settled $47 Million for operating a pyramid scheme after a being sued by China in a Utah federal court.[10] Nu Skin was also forced to pay another $750,000 for bribing a top Chinese official with funds from Nu Skin&#039;s charitable division after a US Securities and Exchange Commission probe.[","filename":"chavez","ext":".jpg","w":1280,"h":720,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492633375705,"time":1492633375,"md5":"2gtciZXeUgOcxwwoPN1SgQ==","fsize":66301,"resto":0,"id":"MEXh2lYA","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"i-thought-this-guy-was-based-turns-out-he-ran-a","country_name":"Canada","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":121890713,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:24:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"Source:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Nu_S<wbr>kin_Enterprises<\/span><br><br>Basic gesault <br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In January 2014, the Chinese government announced that it was investigating Nu Skin following a People&#039;s Daily newspaper report calling it a &quot;suspected illegal pyramid scheme.&quot; In 2016, Nu Skin settled $47 Million for operating a pyramid scheme after a being sued by China in a Utah federal court.[10] Nu Skin was also forced to pay another $750,000 for bribing a top Chinese official with funds from Nu Skin&#039;s charitable division after a US Securities and Exchange Commission probe<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;settles for 47 million<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Pyramid scheme<\/span>","filename":"Steve-Stephens-aka-Stevie-Steve-10","ext":".jpg","w":615,"h":409,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1492633459144,"time":1492633459,"md5":"RcumsBE4+nRNwyRzblQZ1g==","fsize":26143,"resto":121890550,"id":"MEXh2lYA","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121890545,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:22:54","name":"Anonymous","sub":"what does \/pol\/ think about people like this","com":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=f6T<wbr>S3fcrVQ0&amp;index=9&amp;list=UU8WX2lUGdDv9<wbr>UeVaq6CFvig<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;he is the fresno shooter<\/span>","filename":"r","ext":".png","w":830,"h":489,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":147,"tim":1492633374334,"time":1492633374,"md5":"sLGqjrjMF80y7JvY92TWVQ==","fsize":744577,"resto":0,"id":"XREQvB+2","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-does-pol-think-about-people-like-this","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":121887930,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:02:45","name":"Anonymous","sub":"comfy best korea thread","com":"Pyongyang and north korea dosen&#039;t look that bad desu<br>https:\/\/m.youtube.com\/watch?v=8FwAb<wbr>9QvVjM<br>Pyongyang seems much more comfy then seoul, tokyo or most western cities","filename":"maxresdefault-14","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1492632165648,"time":1492632165,"md5":"vZOuN5jdmqdQgHiyM2De+w==","fsize":441974,"resto":0,"id":"NbHwknXf","country":"IT","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"comfy-best-korea-thread","country_name":"Italy","replies":8,"images":1,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":1},{"no":121889643,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)16:15:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121887930\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121887930<\/a><br>kinda looks like a South American city.

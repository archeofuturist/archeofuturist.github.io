Health in highschool is completely focused on safe sex, and while that&#039;s important it doesn&#039;t need to be the only focus. Elementary and highschool should both teach you how calories work, about macros and micros, about what&#039;s actually bad and what just requires moderation, what isn&#039;t bad even though people tell you it is, etc. I also believe that a cooking class should be mandatory for highschool students. To me knowing how to at least prepare a basic meal is as important as math or English. They don&#039;t need to be chefs by the end, but they need to be able to feed themselves. In my perfect world the exam would be making a half-decent and semi-nutritious meal out of a randomized assortment of ingredients in a fridge, with no guidance. <br>That&#039;s a lofty goal though and I&#039;ll likely end up doing hospital work mixed with some advisement work. Possibly some product development as well. I admit I&#039;m sacrificing pay for passion, but that&#039;s why Chem is my back up. <br><br>It&#039;s distinctly possible they&#039;ve swung the pendulum too far and the backswing will actually fix a lot of these problems naturally. Like you said, people are sick of it.

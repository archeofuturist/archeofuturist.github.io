It was widely used in press and political language to describe either direct competition (such as the White movement) or even internal fractions of the socialist movement, for example social democracy which was called social fascism. Also the Nazi movement in Germany was described as &quot;fascist&quot; until 1939, when the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact was signed, after which Nazi\u2013Soviet relations started to be presented positively in Soviet propaganda.<br>In 1944 British writer George Orwell commented that due to the widespread use in the European press, &quot;the word &#039;Fascism&#039; is almost entirely meaningless&quot; due to its non-specific use detached from its original political associations.[1]<br>After 1941 &quot;fascist&quot; was used in the Soviet Union to describe virtually any anti-Soviet activity or opinion. According to Marxism\u2013Leninism, fascism was the &quot;final phase of crisis of bourgeoisie&quot;, which &quot;in fascism sought refuge&quot; from &quot;inherent contradictions of capitalism&quot;. As result of this approach, it was almost every Western capitalist country that was &quot;fascist&quot;, with the Third Reich being just the &quot;most reactionary&quot; one.[2][3] As result, after 1941 &quot;fascist&quot; was used in Soviet Union to describe virtually any anti-Soviet activity: for example, the international investigation on Katyn massacre was described as &quot;fascist libel&quot;.,[4] the Warsaw Uprising as &quot;illegal and organised by fascists&quot;.[5] Communist S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa described trotskyism, titoism and imperialism as &quot;variants of fascism&quot;.[6]<br><br>http:\/\/www.ozy.com\/flashback\/anna-y<wbr>egorovas-red-sky\/32366<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;the torture and taunts of being labeled a \u201cfascist bitch\u201d by her fellow Soviets hurt the most.<\/span>","time":1491454139,"resto":119693323,"id":"PyajJxaD","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119706589,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:49:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119697555\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119697555<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Berl<wbr>in_Wall<\/span><br><br>The Berlin Wall was officially referred to as the &quot;Anti-Fascist Protective Wall&quot; (German: Antifaschistischer Schutzwall) by GDR authorities, implying that the NATO countries and West Germany in particular were considered equal to &quot;fascists&quot;[5] by GDR propaganda.","time":1491454188,"resto":119693323,"id":"PyajJxaD","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119707415,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:58:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119706178\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119706178<\/a><br>Nice one.","time":1491454713,"resto":119693323,"id":"17uxIOMG","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119703159,"now":"04\/06\/17(Thu)00:13:48","name":"Anonymous","com":"Memes aside, do Bashar Assad and his men conduct the same kind of torture typically found among Arab leaders?<br><br>I don&#039;t want the U.S. to meddle in another war...but dude&#039;s still an Arab.

Ableism characterizes persons as defined by their disabilities and as inferior to the non-disabled.[2] On this basis, people are assigned or denied certain perceived abilities, skills, and\/or character traits. Discrimination faced by those who have or are perceived to have a mental disorder is sometimes called mentalism rather than ableism.<br><br>There are stereotypes associated with various disabilities. These stereotypes in turn serve as a justification for ableist practices and reinforce discriminatory attitudes and behaviors toward people who are disabled.[3] Labeling affects people when it limits their options for action or changes their identity.[4]<br><br>In ableist societies, people with disabilities are viewed as less valuable to society, or even less than human. This manifested itself in the eugenics movement of the early 20th century. In some cases this can lead to mass murder of the disabled, as in the Nazi Aktion T4.<br><br>Other definitions of ableism include those of Chouinard, who defines it as &quot;ideas, practices, institutions, and social relations that presume able-bodiedness, and by so doing, construct persons with disabilities as marginalized [\u2026] and largely invisible &#039;others,&#039;&quot; [5][6] and of Amundson and Taira, who define ableism as &quot;a doctrine that falsely treats impairments as inherently and naturally horrible and blames the impairments themselves for the problems experienced by the people who have them.&quot;[5][7]","time":1491454986,"resto":119706647,"id":"VR+T6lub","country":"IN","country_name":"India"}]}]}

Money degrades all the gods of man \u2013 and turns them into commodities. Money is the universal self-established value of all things. It has, therefore, robbed the whole world \u2013 both the world of men and nature \u2013 of its specific value. Money is the estranged essence of man\u2019s work and man\u2019s existence, and this alien essence dominates him, and he worships it.<br><br>The god of the Jews has become secularized and has become the god of the world. The bill of exchange is the real god of the Jew. His god is only an illusory bill of exchange.<br><br>The view of nature attained under the domination of private property and money is a real contempt for, and practical debasement of, nature; in the Jewish religion, nature exists, it is true, but it exists only in imagination.","filename":"stalin-freedom","ext":".jpg","w":480,"h":335,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1492930884477,"time":1492930884,"md5":"uUEy2AWZv0O10dTR2lrJ8g==","fsize":33734,"resto":122389260,"id":"F\/24IEg1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

to use recycled tires to produce safer playground surfaces, it likely had no idea it was triggering a major religious liberty fight.<br><br>But that&#039;s exactly what occurred when a preschool run by the Trinity Lutheran Church was denied a state grant to participate in the program.<br><br>The state defended its decision, citing the Missouri Constitution, which bars churches from receiving

Its lawyers argued that the state&#039;s action constituted religious discrimination in violation of the federal Constitution&#039;s Free Exercise and Equal Protection Clauses.

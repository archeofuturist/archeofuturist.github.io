The apartment was in Brooklyn, in a mixed White and Latino neighborhood, that had not gentrified too much yet (this was a few years back) so not too many SJWS\/brunch loving yuppies, and the lationos were mostly hard working south americans with families and a desire to improve their neighborhood. Most didnt mind some white kids moving in, because a little bump in rent was worth pushing out the bums, criminals, and most importantly, the niggers.

Early on, we talked about how this made it difficult to learn about a topic from someone, as anything that seemed contrary to their view would set them off on you. Both of us had seen our reapective favorite professors (the rare few who still care about teaching) get shit on by students and the university, no matter what they did, someone was always offended and reporting them for something. Being too pro religion, or too anti religion, or pro gay, or anti gay etc, it didnt matter, anything they said triggered someone, even though they wete truly liberal as they promoted free thinking and open conversation above all else, no matt t what they personally believed. They were the sort of people who liked to be persuaded that they were wrong, because that meant they had something new to learn. But the safe space shitheads wouldnt have that. <br><br>Some BLM protests had been going on over the past few montes. We had seperatly been to some, to get a better sense of what was happening and what was being said. Shouts of &quot;shut it down&quot; were nonstop, but no one ever said what should be done after that, no real goal was presented. Like occupy, the movement seemed splintered into endlessly groups. We would crack some jokes, not \/pol\/ level, about BLM, safe spaces, and occasionaly sarcastically spout some far right type lines. <br><br>While talking about the neighborhood, we made some darker jokes, more \/pol\/ style, about how living in a neighborhood with mixed races ( i had lived in chinatown for 6 monthes before) was never a concern but with blacks. From there we progressed to discuss issues with crime (mostly blacks), sketchy encounters we&#039;d had( usually blacks), and the like. The jokes became less so, we started citing studies and statistics, and agreed that the numbers made predujice an ally when looking out for saftey on the streets.","time":1493335967,"resto":123106416,"id":"i+4EtHGg","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123110275,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)19:36:19","name":"Anonymous","com":"What in gods name are you babbling about","time":1493336179,"resto":123106416,"id":"o7Rxx4QR","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123111472,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)19:45:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123109777\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123109777<\/a><br>Op again... sorry for the length, but im pissed at the moment off so rambilings easy to fall into. <br><br>Anyway, one day he asked me to grab something and hand it over, and without thinking, I said, &quot;do i look like your pet porch monkey?&quot;<br><br>It was still said in humor, but suddenly, it clicked.

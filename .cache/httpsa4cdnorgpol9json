Even though Labour governed for 13 years, they sill wanted to &quot;fight the establishment&quot;. <br><br>Look at the USSR - lots of their propaganda said &quot;Long Live the Revolution&quot; - the revolution already happened. It cannot live long and be protected if it is an event that has already happened. But the USSR peddled the narrative that their beloved &quot;revolution&quot; was an ongoing thing - a continuous fight against the establishment. That&#039;s how every purge was justified - the enemies on the right who seek to crush and destroy the revolution - as if they still held power in the communist state.<br><br>Antifa has adopted a similar narrative. In this video (https:\/\/youtu.be\/oJ1eZqenaDw) linked by <a href=\"#p122871519\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;122871519<\/a>, members are called upon to &quot;fight back&quot; against the &quot;fascist regime&quot;. They believe that they are &quot;waging a war&quot; against the establishment. Your almonds should be activating right about now.<br><br>It dawned on me. What do all of these hitherto mentioned leftist entities have in common? They all believe that they are fighting the right wing, fascist establishment. Even when in power, the left must constantly peddle the narrative that it is fighting the right wing establishment to justify their existence and everything they do. That&#039;s how they stay in power - they create the right wing, fascist boogeyman as something to hate and fight against. Think of 1984&#039;s Goldstein and the Two Minutes&#039; Hate. This is how the left operates - by peddling never-ending hate.<br><br>Now, here&#039;s the kicker -the left doesn&#039;t realise that they ARE they establishment. They ARE in power. This constant &quot;anti-establishment&quot; talk is to ensure that they not only keep power, but get more. But they can&#039;t admit they ARE the establishment because to do so would mean their collapse, as they have nothing to fight against but themselves.","time":1493218367,"resto":122862292,"id":"qRYUM2CK","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":122891735,"now":"04\/26\/17(Wed)10:55:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"One of the best things you can do is to trick antifa into savaging themselves in the court of public opinion.

Japanese never yelp about discrimination when something goes wrong, and never sue employers for \u201cracism.\u201d There is no racial tension, race riots, or hate laws. No one gets in trouble because the board of directors is all Japanese or because all the faces on television are Japanese. Nobody complains about \u201cprofiling\u201d when the police pat down the most likely trouble-makers. No one is ever fired because he said something \u201cinsensitive\u201d or told a forbidden joke or used a forbidden slur. Elections are about politics, not about whether Hispanics or blacks are taking over. Voting districts can have logical geograpahic boundaries, because no one worries about whether black or Hispanic votes are being diluted.

Islamic mindset makes you think that your cult friends are your unquestionable allies and this creates a bond between the individual worshippers.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=6Ds<wbr>G9yQrdD4<br><br> They form communities in foreign countries and push their agenda. The bond is stronger than a political one because every one of us here branch out on our political views when talking about specific aspects. The book of Quran is unquestionable therefore the absolute truth. This totally destroys the diversion within the cult.<br> From my observations, I have come to the conclusion today&#039;s &quot;moderate&quot; muslims are people that care half or less for their religion. The so called &quot;extremists&quot; are the true followers of the religion. They all have something to speak of. Go ask moderate muslims detailed questions, most of them cannot answer you in full knowledge. I have distant-family members who are deep in this shit and they keep preaching for it, try to convert people around them.<br> To defend yourself from the bullshit you have to hiss at them and show power. Because in their world kindness, mercy and acting civilized are the signs of weakness and stupidity and deserve to take advantage of.<br> As for the solutions for this, I have no direct answer. Let&#039;s say that west started deporting muslims. What if those groups form a massive group in their middle eastern world? Would the extreme left movement take a halt after that?

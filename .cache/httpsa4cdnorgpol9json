Secularism has destroyed our birthrate and corrupted our discourse. <br><br>The future belongs to the religious because secularists don&#039;t have babies. In the last 100 years, since the creation of the first atheist state, modern secularism has given us nothing but misery, poverty, and bloodshed. We must revere God and respect Muslims more than we respect atheists or agnostics. <br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Socia<wbr>l_and_cultural_exchange_in_Al-Andal<wbr>us","filename":"La_Rendici\u00f3n_de_Granada_-_Pradilla","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1230,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":160,"tim":1492581856775,"time":1492581856,"md5":"Cg9cF3X6VhQegfCp1XtPlg==","fsize":740914,"resto":0,"id":"+rSV+QyC","country":"CA","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"muslim-and-christian-truce","country_name":"Canada","replies":5,"images":1},{"no":121812399,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)02:13:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Muslims and Christians lived in peace before modernity.<\/span><br><br>What?","time":1492582424,"resto":121811501,"id":"mH\/5bh7r","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121812734,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)02:17:30","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;dhimmis didnt exist<\/span><br><br>oh ok","time":1492582650,"resto":121811501,"id":"MLwsTvK+","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":121812800,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)02:18:22","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121811501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121811501<\/a>","filename":"1482559533091","ext":".png","w":627,"h":800,"tn_w":97,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492582702523,"time":1492582702,"md5":"+wtLg1qLNKp7+3v0xzAdaA==","fsize":341840,"resto":121811501,"id":"fKog+3wO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121813132,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)02:21:51","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121812734\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121812734<\/a><br>You don&#039;t think you&#039;re a dhimmi now?<br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bake the fucking faggot cake!<\/span>","time":1492582911,"resto":121811501,"id":"+rSV+QyC","country":"CA","country_name":"Canada"},{"no":121813580,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)02:27:14","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121811501\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121811501<\/a><br>Muslims and Christians lived in peace only when muslims were weak for the Mongolian invasion.<br>Give them a chance and muslims will attack and kill everyone in sight","time":1492583234,"resto":121811501,"id":"RkZhovDn","country":"IT","country_name":"Italy"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121810877,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:58:29","name":"Anonymous","com":"http:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/us\/2017\/04\/1<wbr>9\/fresno-shooting-rampage-suspected<wbr>-gunman-wanted-to-kill-as-many-whit<wbr>e-people-as-possible-cops-say.html<br><br>Are you ready for the \/racewar\/ ?","filename":"sheeeeeittt","ext":".png","w":500,"h":378,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":189,"tim":1492581509876,"time":1492581509,"md5":"fbua97y1MvHdc8thAUwooA==","fsize":13012,"resto":0,"id":"5vvaFSmn","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"are-you-ready-for-the-racewar","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":121812738,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)02:17:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121810877\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121810877<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;During his arrest, Muhammad shouted &quot;Allahu Akbar,&quot; but Dyer said the shootings had &quot;nothing to do with <\/span><br>terrorism in spite of the statement he made.&quot;<br>Commiefornia everybody","time":1492582654,"resto":121810877,"id":"DC0g2eZB","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121812864,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)02:18:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121812738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121812738<\/a><br>I guess &quot;black jesus&quot; kills white people and yells allah snackbar?","time":1492582738,"resto":121810877,"id":"5vvaFSmn","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121813123,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)02:21:45","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121812738\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121812738<\/a><br>desu i think he just yelled allahu akbar to artificially stur the pot, doesn&#039;t really make sense when you call yourself black jesus","time":1492582905,"resto":121810877,"id":"ZmSBg+l9","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121812960,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)02:19:53","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;This it was, the screaming of the women, that most tried my nerves. It must have tried, too, the nerves of the red-faced man, for I have another picture which will never fade from my mind. The stout gentleman is stuffing the magazine into his overcoat pocket and looking on curiously. A tangled mass of women, with drawn, white faces and open mouths, is shrieking like a chorus of lost souls; and the red-faced man, his face now purplish with wrath, and with arms extended overhead as in the act of hurling thunderbolts, is shouting, \u201cShut up!

And I remember that the sounds they made reminded me of the squealing of pigs under the knife of the butcher, and I was struck with horror at the vividness of the analogy. These women, capable of the most sublime emotions, of the tenderest sympathies, were open-mouthed and screaming.

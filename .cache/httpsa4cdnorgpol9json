TOPOFF theorized the covert release of an aerosol of Y. pestis in the Performing Arts Center in Denver, Colorado. By noon on the third day of the drill-the third day following release of the Y. pestis-there were an estimated 3060 cases of the pneumonic plague, 795 of which resulted in death. The (theoretical) plague spread throughout the United States and to London and Tokyo, and travel in or out of state was prohibited in an attempt at limiting further spread of the disease. Colorado officials expressed concern about their ability to obtain food and supplies.

doesn&#039;t add up regarding the data on IQ and Race that I have been researching lately. Specifically, the African IQ is 70, while the Black American IQ is 85, the explanation for the 15 point increase is the addition of white ancestry within the Black American population. <br><br>Scientific studies on the subject have found that, on average, African Americans are of 73.2\u201380.9% West African, 18\u201324% European, with large variation between individuals. The result of this information concludes that Black Americans are altogether a different sub type of negroid when compared to pure Africans. <br><br>The issue here is that 20% of European blood is not enough to boost an IQ of 70 to 85. The favored theory when it comes to IQ and mix race individuals is that the average ends up being between both races. For example, the American Mulatto IQ is estimated around 93%, which is the half way IQ point between whites and blacks in America. <br><br>Based on the logic of this explanation, a average of 50% European Ancestry would have to be necessary if one was going to explain the Black American IQ increases, in relation to pure Africans, on their European admixture. Based on this inconsistency, one can only conclude that the bulk of gains in the Black American IQ must have been caused by environmental factors like better education and the addition of western cultural values.<br><br>Does \/pol\/ have a better explanation on this specific point?

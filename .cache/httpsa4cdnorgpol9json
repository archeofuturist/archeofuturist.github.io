Far-right trolls and meme warriors like the kind whohelped elect Donald Trumphave found a new calling: &quot;The Battle of France.&quot; There&#039;s no way of telling what real-world impact it&#039;s having, but with the vote just a few days away, activity in support of right-wing candidate Marine Le Pen has reached a fever pitch on Reddit, 4chan\/pol\/, and otheronline forums popular withthe American alt-right.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;&quot;All shitposting units are required to man their battle stations,&quot; declared a recent 4chan post . &quot;Meme war recruits: prove your worth. Veterans, lead the charge.... MAKE FRANCE GREAT AGAIN.&quot; The post urged 4channers to join a Discord forum dubbed &quot;Operation: Marine Le Kek,&quot; where at any given moment up to about 450 participants are conducting meme &quot;raids&quot; to hype their candidate and attack her centrist rival, Emmanuel Macron. Using fake French identities and sock puppet social media accounts, they&#039;ve hijacked Twitter hashtags, social media posts, and comments sections on news sites with memes portraying Macron as a stooge of Jewish financiers who will sell out the working class and capitulate to Muslim terrorists.<\/span><br><br><br>http:\/\/m.motherjones.com\/politics\/2<wbr>017\/05\/marine-le-pen-alt-right-amer<wbr>ican-trolls","filename":"Screenshot_2017-05-04-08-12-11_1","ext":".jpg","w":1070,"h":1466,"tn_w":182,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493860525626,"time":1493860525,"md5":"83zAh6knJRzMc8l0ZI+wvA==","fsize":206027,"resto":0,"id":"5Z1o09ok","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":1,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"oyy-vey-shut-it-down","country_name":"United

And it&#039;s true, the provisions are extremely broad and could apply to an enormous range of activities online, including activities that purely involve using a system in the manner in which it was intended (i.e., flooding a server with more legitimate traffic than it can handle).<br><br>So the quick answer as to whether it&#039;s a criminal offense: Probably yes. But will you get prosecuted? Probably no. The fact of the matter is you&#039;re not causing pecuniary harm to anybody other than, perhaps, an immeasurably small increase in electricity consumption by the server if your attack consumes all the CPU capacity and heats everything up. But really, I&#039;m not aware of any serious effort by the feds or even by states (to the extent that they can) to prosecute small-time pranksters that actually do not cause harm beyond annoying people.<br><br>The idea that you&#039;re using &quot;in-game mechanics&quot; isn&#039;t really a defense either.

He called it the last man and the religion of comfortableness. Upon his announcement that God was dead and that we had murdered him our forefathers searched the news papers for happenings in vain as we do today here on \/pol\/. We wait and wait for something anything we don&#039;t quite know what we are waiting for but we believe we will know it when we see it. I had believed that Jung was right when he said, &quot;Christianity split the Germanic barbarian into an upper and a lower half, and enabled him, by repressing the dark side, to domesticate the brighter half and fit it for civilization. But the lower, darker half still awaits redemption and a second spell of domestication. Until then, it will remain associated with the vestiges of the prehistoric age, with the collective unconscious, which is subject to a peculiar and ever-increasing activation. As the Christian view of the world loses its authority, the more menacingly will the \u201cblond beast\u201d be heard prowling about in its underground prison, ready at any moment to burst out with devastating consequences. When this happens in the individual it brings about a psychological revolution, but it can also take a social form.&quot; But I now understand what Fyodor Dostoevsky meant by man as a piano key. There is no need to domesticate us if our women can be domesticated. That is what has occurred and continues to occur. We have intellectualized life. We have rationalized our extinction. We have become ok with it. We are now piano keys.","filename":"th","ext":".jpg","w":266,"h":300,"tn_w":110,"tn_h":125,"tim":1493886060086,"time":1493886060,"md5":"HWkTyeVGJKYM7r1glggkPw==","fsize":7456,"resto":124029758,"id":"Z3M4Lt87","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":124039074,"now":"05\/04\/17(Thu)04:36:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<span class=\"quote\">&gt;0%<\/span>","filename":"hillary trump xcom","ext":".jpg","w":680,"h":645,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1493886993432,"time":1493886993,"md5":"EniAGzJxxClmbXjI22Dzow==","fsize":51961,"resto":124029758,"id":"EQ0O+8PC","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]}]}

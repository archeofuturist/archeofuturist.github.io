You might think the elites might use it to rid the earth of their enemies and reduce population, but even for them this way of doing it a) causes to many side effects and influence on nature and b) has too many variables, since you can&#039;t be sure who nukes where and you can&#039;t plan the outcome good enough to be able to stabilize a new society afterwards.<br><br>I mean look at the war zones we have today, war isn&#039;t what it used to be and the war in those countries is neverending.

This one is simple and you heard it before: So no madman can push the button without killing himself. And there is a second answer: You can use nuclear weapons on a smaller scale for tactical combat.

This is just not true. Jew semantics have convinced people that are for all intents and purposes slaves, that they are free, simply by loading the word &quot;slavery&quot;, and then isolating it in the modern lexicon, the vast majority of slaves don&#039;t even realize they&#039;re slaves simply because they are not called such. The Jew has perfected slavery, and there are different levels of slavery. I&#039;m essentially a modern day slave. If you do not own land, or are not self employed, you too are a slave. Perhaps slavery just means not having any expendable income, whatever it means it is still with us, that I know to be true. Maybe the prison industrial complex is the closest approximation, it certainly is demographically. You may be a rich slave, but you are still a slave. Being &quot;free&quot; whatever that means nowadays isn&#039;t always easy or sweet. I&#039;ve met poor ass free men that struggle.","filename":"image","ext":".jpg","w":468,"h":417,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":222,"tim":1490182237600,"time":1490182237,"md5":"AcUf69SPCcgQURD\/poldBA==","fsize":51353,"resto":0,"id":"rANRDpYn","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"the-definition-of-slavery","country_name":"United States","replies":8,"images":0,"omitted_posts":3,"omitted_images":0},{"no":117750941,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)07:54:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117749406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117749406<\/a><br>I saw this babe as a whore in (((westworld)))","time":1490183697,"resto":117749406,"id":"0HKKWf7C","country":"RU","country_name":"Russian Federation"},{"no":117751096,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)07:57:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117750452\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117750452<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;If you dont recieve that check<\/span><br>You sue the fuckers","time":1490183837,"resto":117749406,"id":"rEPqL6QA","country":"FI","country_name":"Finland"},{"no":117751283,"now":"03\/22\/17(Wed)07:59:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p117750452\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117750452<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Well what happens if you don&#039;t receive that check. <\/span><br>I sue for wrongful dismissal due to not receiving an appropriate workload.

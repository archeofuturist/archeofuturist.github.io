In practice, however, the actual pressure exerted on these peoples lives was really only felt strongly when they rebelled or went heretical. Otherwise tradesmen, farmers, and the rest were more or less left to their own devices, minor crimes and governing were left to local authorities or village leaders, and most people had an astounding amount of free time, especially during the winter season. Compelled military service was also only expiernced by a small minority of the population as well.","time":1492578194,"resto":121790763,"id":"lOkHSqnZ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121807608,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)01:26:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"In my lifetime I have encountered two kinds of men.

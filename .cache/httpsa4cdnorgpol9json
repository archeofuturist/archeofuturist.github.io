It&#039;s like your afraid of losing a future, that in the end you have no control over. It&#039;s like you&#039;re allowing that fear of loss to dictate the moment. That&#039;s why you feel like this is something you need to talk about. I understand fear can be a good thing in certain moments, but to allow it to influence this totally safe moment is what I don&#039;t understand.","time":1491281200,"resto":119415248,"id":"1qzlrugN","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119432981,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)00:54:27","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119415248\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119415248<\/a><br>http:\/\/www.informationclearinghouse<wbr>.info\/pdf\/RebuildingAmericasDefense<wbr>s.pdf<br><br>https:\/\/4threvolutionarywar.wordpre<wbr>ss.com\/2017\/01\/05\/apocalypse-as-pra<wbr>xis-akira-3\/<br><br>Read these two things and if you get the gist of both of them and can connect them to current events you will literally understand what is happening in the world at a higher level than the vast majority of people.<br><br>The quick rundown is that Internationalism as it has existed for the lifetime of millennials is a construct that exists as a construct of the Neocon military complex in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Obama did little but add a rebranding to US foreign policy goals, selling them as humanitarian in nature as opposed to securing domestic security so as to sell them to Democrat voters. Most aspects of Progressivism actually promote Neocon goals of large scale US military intervention and cultural imperialism, to maintain a unipolar world ruled by the US.<br><br>Russia as the most powerful rival tactically knows it cannot fight the US in a purely military sense and win, but along with Arab nationalists and other groups like NK is generally opposed to US power projection expanding into their parts of the world. As such, political strategists like Aleksandr Dugin have sought to fight with information warfare as the internet offers a new and less regulated avenue of mass communication and the goal has been to essentially wage a kind of PR war against American Neoconservatives.<br><br>Donald Trump&#039;s platform of Nationalism and supposed isolationism (while giving voice to pursuing terrorist threats) in addition to his apparent desire to co-operate with Putin marks a level of ideological similarity with Dugin and Putin&#039;s conception of a multipolar world, as co-operating with Russia essentially goes totally contrary to neocon foreign policy of containment and preventing it from growing any regional power (which allowing Russian backed Assad remain in control of Syria directly aids)","filename":"Untitled","ext":".png","w":1776,"h":1768,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":124,"tim":1491281667706,"time":1491281667,"md5":"XWHzjisWaA0+AyCQC1UpHQ==","fsize":3456992,"resto":119415248,"id":"YvI14X+d","country":"US","m_img":1,"country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119432975,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)00:54:24","name":"Anonymous","sub":"FPMITAP","com":"Does he stand a chance of becoming the alpha in prison?","filename":"56163316c4618814748b45da[1]","ext":".jpg","w":900,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":138,"tim":1491281664667,"time":1491281664,"md5":"+o46B4MjYOJWN1hYKQA5Nw==","fsize":99172,"resto":0,"id":"LNph671G","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"fpmitap","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":119431747,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)00:40:09","name":"Anonymous","sub":"GET IN HERE FAGGOTS - HELP NEEDED","com":"BLM will not allow whites to their event, you know what to do to the Facebook event page. <br><br>http:\/\/clapsnews.com\/2017\/04\/03\/bla<wbr>ck-lives-matter-philly-bans-white-p<wbr>eople-from-events\/","filename":"black-lives-matter-terrorist-organisation-678x381","ext":".jpg","w":678,"h":381,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491280809870,"time":1491280809,"md5":"jh1kVkg6wczgRdhwVV\/8qA==","fsize":50986,"resto":0,"id":"DfvioPbi","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"get-in-here-faggots-help-needed","country_name":"United States","replies":15,"images":6,"omitted_posts":10,"omitted_images":6},{"no":119432688,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)00:50:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119431747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119431747<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;BLM will not allow whites to their event, you know what to do<\/span><br>I gotcha anon","filename":"PNLyncher","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":530,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":94,"tim":1491281452931,"time":1491281452,"md5":"ZgkXxaAKLxghbWtNGdgumw==","fsize":100338,"resto":119431747,"id":"OyVj6jfv","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119432778,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)00:51:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119432651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119432651<\/a><br>my post is supposed to prove that nigger kang respected both sides in harmony and would probably hate BLM","time":1491281514,"resto":119431747,"id":"+\/bSMe0t","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119432892,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)00:53:17","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119431747\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119431747<\/a><br><br>Here.....my gift to you.....Use it well.","filename":"All Lives Splatter","ext":".jpg","w":720,"h":593,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":102,"tim":1491281597929,"time":1491281597,"md5":"uk1wcuXaUwY2f5hlYqt46g==","fsize":33405,"resto":119431747,"id":"hEvEyQf3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119432931,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)00:53:44","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119432661\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119432661<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;social justice<\/span><br>no such thing.

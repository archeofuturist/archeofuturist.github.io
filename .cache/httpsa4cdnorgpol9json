Regardless of North Korea\u2019s nuclear capabilities, they have enough heavy artillery within range of Seoul, South Korea to raze the city to the ground and kill thousands. North Korea would only need to land one or two low yield nuclear warheads on Seoul to kill hundreds of thousands of innocent men, women and children. While North Korea would most certainly lose any military confrontation with the United States, they could inflict heavy damage to South Korea and Japan and kill millions.<br><br>There is one problem with all of this however. China is not going to sit back and allow a preemptive strike against North Korea by the United States. If Trump thinks for a minute he can bully China, he is in for one hell of a shock. Neither will Russia allow it for that matter. If you don\u2019t think China and\/or Russia can stop us, think again. Yes, we have the most advanced and power military in the world, no doubt. With China and\/or Russia, it would not be a conventional conflict. It would go nuclear almost immediately. If you think our Missile Defense System will protect us, think again. It was never designed to defend against a massive nuclear strike. <br><br>Russia alone has enough nuclear firepower to turn the United States into an uninhabitable radioactive wasteland and China is no slouch either. China has the Dong Feng-5 ICBM, it carries 3 to 5 warheads of 5 megatons each. You drop one of those warheads on a city like Los Angeles and 2 million people reach 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit in less than a second. Another 4 million would be severely burned and dying or dead. Peak overpressures of 20psi would spread out over 28 square miles.","filename":"1430932987080","ext":".jpg","w":192,"h":256,"tn_w":187,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491800045080,"time":1491800045,"md5":"JRn\/fwmu4GRtrb2XGwpotg==","fsize":22769,"resto":0,"id":"kKiS3Sde","country":"BR","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"so-a-few-facts-regardless-of-north-koreas-nuclear","country_name":"Brazil","replies":2,"images":0},{"no":120394919,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)00:54:25","name":"Anonymous","com":"Overpressures of 20psi are instantly fatal to humans and will severely damage if not destroy reinforced concrete buildings. Overpressures of 5psi would spread out over 170 square miles. Overpressures of 5psi will destroy most residential structures and the fatality rate is almost 90%. I haven\u2019t even talked about the heat blast, or the air blast, or the radiation. Keep in mind, this is just one warhead, just one.<br><br>This is not a game folks, this is as real as it gets. Iraq and Afghanistan were nothing. If we launch a preemptive strike against North Korea and China responds, which they most certainly will. You can also bet Putin would respond to back up China. We will be looking at a global nuclear exchange. The exchange would kill, by most estimates, 2\/3rds of the worlds human population. The after math of the exchange would destroy the base of the photosynthetic food chain, sending a wave of extinction across the Tree of Life. It is likely, by most estimate, humanity would end at the current generation. <br><br>So, if you think Trump has a good idea, I invite you to look at the big picture and reconsider. He would lead the world to that which is has tried to avoid for over 60 years, nuclear Armageddon. Why else do you think President&#039;s Clinton, Bush, and Obama have avoided a military confrontation with North Korea? They understood the consequences, it is clear Trump either doesn&#039;t understand, or simply doesn&#039;t care.","time":1491800065,"resto":120394890,"id":"kKiS3Sde","country":"BR","country_name":"Brazil"},{"no":120394993,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)00:55:13","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120394890\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120394890<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;believing nukes exist<\/span>","time":1491800113,"resto":120394890,"id":"oWLF8\/N1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":120392804,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)00:34:21","name":"Anonymous","sub":"HAPPENING!

The Orbital Ring goes to low earth orbit, so it does not need advanced materials.<br><br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0qe<wbr>zLhypA0Y [Embed]<br><br>https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Orbit<wbr>al_ring<br><br>Why build the Orbital Ring? It would cut our costs of going to orbit from about $2000\/kg to about $1\/kg. There are individual asteroids that have tens of trillions of dollars in materials on them that could be mined. One mission could easily pay for the cost of building the Orbital Ring.<br><br>We could then deploy solar power satellites in orbit above cloud cover and return the power back to the surface with near zero loss by running power transmission cables down the elevator, and sell the power at a profit.<br><br>With increased luminosity in space, enhanced exposure time, and the ability to deliver base loads, solar panels pay for themselves in only 1-2 years while having a 20 year life time.<br><br>In other words, if you put $5 trillion of solar panels into space, you get your $5 trillion back by the end of year two and a $5 trillion income stream each year thereafter.<br><br>In other words, the US could cut everyone&#039;s taxes, both personal and business, income, capital, death, or otherwise, all to 0%, not even cut any benefits or current spending, and pay off the national debt within a decade.","filename":"Wanderer Above Sea of Fog","ext":".jpg","w":1249,"h":1600,"tn_w":195,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491785198702,"time":1491785198,"md5":"nhMYxyFZftFNsxsLQmuFpg==","fsize":323878,"resto":0,"id":"yKEeP4j1","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"why-did-we-ever-stop-exploring-our-destiny-is-in","country_name":"United States","replies":280,"images":115,"omitted_posts":275,"omitted_images":111,"tail_size":50},{"no":120392825,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)00:34:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120365670\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120365670<\/a><br><br>Gas the outer jew","filename":"BeavisAtacamahumanoidsidebysideLS","ext":".jpg","w":652,"h":434,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":83,"tim":1491798876139,"time":1491798876,"md5":"18UVKl7XWDRBsj3nTfQvvA==","fsize":156197,"resto":120365670,"id":"2\/vLSjZA","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":120394268,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)00:48:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"This is clearly a \/b\/ thread.","time":1491799721,"resto":120365670,"id":"UTBY2N3n","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":120394374,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)00:49:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120384531\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120384531<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;without accomplishing anything.<\/span><br>we kill each other","time":1491799781,"resto":120365670,"id":"UTBY2N3n","country":"CL","country_name":"Chile"},{"no":120394772,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)00:53:06","name":"Anonymous","com":"Cuz one light year requires 30,000 earth years to travel","time":1491799986,"resto":120365670,"id":"pqMM7yR4","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120394957,"now":"04\/10\/17(Mon)00:54:54","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120389249\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120389249<\/a><br>Once you have a cheap orbit method, just put out a bunch of cheap-ass probes with mesh nets.

The only reason a lot of this society destroying bullshit is so prevalent is because the state itself grants incentives for it and protects individuals from the natural consequences of those actions. Premarital pregnancy wouldn&#039;t be so common if it meant destitution rather than 18 years of government handouts and affirmative action. Where degeneracy had wider knock-on effects upon the wider community I think you could argue for some form of institutionally delivered punishment. For example, deadbeat dads lead to a generation of unproductive criminals and inter-generational poverty therefore I am more than happy defending child support payments. It&#039;s a balancing act but I think if you conceptualize things right you can have a system where people are free to make choices but are not spared punishment for the consequences of those decisions. <br><br>The West is in decline because we reward behavior damaging to our society or refuse to acknowledge the wider consequences of such actions. It&#039;s like viewing drug abuse purely as an illness with no regard to the fact that many abusers transform themselves into a societal liability placing other citizens at risk. I don&#039;t know, people should have the right to be stupid but they should bear the consequences or repay society for the damage they do. Unfortunately that still leaves me having to accept behaviors I deem degenerate because I can&#039;t fully substantiate my claims of wider community detriment (e.g. BMWF relationships).","time":1492577253,"resto":121781815,"id":"LooVYW51","country":"AU","country_name":"Australia"},{"no":121803768,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:49:52","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121792651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121792651<\/a><br>Spill the beans","time":1492577392,"resto":121781815,"id":"gRtY3KXI","country":"IE","country_name":"Ireland"},{"no":121804140,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:53:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121792651\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121792651<\/a><br>\/pol\/ tonight is top lels.","time":1492577580,"resto":121781815,"id":"C3HZ\/Qqi","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121804173,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:53:15","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121792737\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121792737<\/a><br>That arm","filename":"1491929245320","ext":".jpg","w":558,"h":529,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":118,"tim":1492577595892,"time":1492577595,"md5":"RAwHnV6+jgheviQXufVggg==","fsize":18919,"resto":121781815,"id":"RzfdMvu6","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":121804442,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:55:43","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p121804173\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;121804173<\/a><br>Hey Lon Chaney Jr. has urges too anon","time":1492577743,"resto":121781815,"id":"I4xAYL7P","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":121802014,"now":"04\/19\/17(Wed)00:35:19","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/ptg\/ PRESIDENT TRUMP GENERAL -

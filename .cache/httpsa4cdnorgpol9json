The remaining 66% should be splitted into 1000 packages of coins and each package should be sold at a spot price of 5900usd. <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;With the Wyoming example this would be as follows:<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Price: US$5,900,000<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Parcel Size:10710,41 Hectares<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Square meters: 107,104,100<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Initial coins: 107,104,100<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Reserved for investors (to be released later): 35,344,353<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Reserved for initial settlers: 71,759,747<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Every settler pays 5900 for 71,759 coins<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Now there are rules (yet to be created) to be a settler. So even if you have coins, it is not a guarantee that you are going to be able to actualy settle. But let&#039;s assume you have the coins and you are eligible to apply to be a settler. Then you move to the ranch, and you can claim a piece of land giving to the company-town hall the amount of coins that matches with the square meters you have claimed. These coins are then destroyed by sending them to a bogus coin address so actually records the transaction. Coins are never extracted from this address and for this matter, there is no private key (This can be done). <\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;So, if investors cannot use coins to actually settle (because they are not elegible to apply) what can they do with these coins? Well they can build plants or shopping malls, or stuff that will help our economy while giving them profit.<\/span><br><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Also, with because this is a crypto currency we can take leverage from bitcoin exchanges, asking them to add our cryptocurrency. Because our crypto will be the first that it&#039;s attached to a land, i believe we can get MILLIONS in weeks.<\/span>","filename":"1490035905352","ext":".jpg","w":641,"h":530,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":103,"tim":1490143841676,"time":1490143841,"md5":"RZh9\/4LOgj11cX0pFP+ZGQ==","fsize":42834,"resto":117693162,"id":"U1h5mKp0","country":"ES","country_name":"Spain"},{"no":117696654,"now":"03\/21\/17(Tue)20:56:04","name":"pakistanis are faggots","com":"<a href=\"#p117694973\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;117694973<\/a> Yeah sounds nice for a Harold Covington movie, not for the movement that believes in the stars. <br><br>Europe tier?

They developed a culture around the Talmud of taking the Torah and then twisting and deconstructing the Law until there was nothing of its essence remaining and then reconstructing it to be whatever they wanted. They would do this to get away with doing things that were forbidden, such as sacrificing their children to Molech....they reasoned ways it would be ok. Here&#039;s a great example: the command is given to wear a blue thread on the wings of your garments. Well, they took wing to mean corners and thus even blankets have corners that they reasoned would then also need the fringe. Well, they reasoned if one were to cut the blanket such that one of the corners of it were rounded, it would only have 3 corners instead of 4 and thus you would not have to add fringes to if. This is what they do and why they have developed such a high verbal IQ and why they excel in the legal field. That is also why our justice system is absolute shit. It&#039;s become a game for Jews of trying Jew the other Jew lawyer in court such that their sophistry has escalated to astronomical levels of absurdity. It now requires a ridiculous amount of education and cleverness to succeed which makes legal costs insanely high. This has meant that legal action by deep pocketed individuals can be used to intimidate and ruin in ovens people with little means to pay because legal fees alone irrespective of the merits of the case can ruin people. This is also why technicalities and reinterpretation of words are so common. They reinterpret the Constitution to mean whatever they want without having to go through the standard process of changing it (see: definition of militia and well-regulated in 1780s). This is also why legislation has to be so assininely specific and bills have to be hundreds to thousands of pages long.

I paid them in Bitcoin and then I had talked to my lawyer and he told me to cancel the order as it is risky to ship to the Asian country I am currently living in (I&#039;m an American expat). So they canceled the order, which was very nice of them, and said &quot;Your refund will show up within 5 to 7 days in your account&quot;. Well that was about 2 weeks ago, as I had placed the order on April 10th, 2017. My order number was AB-201999.<br><br>After 7 days, I tried sending the owner, saundra, an email and also a support ticket and asked him where my Bitcoin refund was and got no response. I then waited another 5 days and tried again to contact him and this time no response either. So I warned him that unless he refunded my Bitcoin within 48 hours, I would publicly leave this review and warn others to avoid buying from Buykratom.us as they are scammers and will steal your money and run away with it.<br><br>So that&#039;s all I can say. Don&#039;t buy from Buykratom.us, they are scammers and I&#039;m really pissed off he stole 80 dollars worth of Bitcoin from me.

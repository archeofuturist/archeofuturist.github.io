A few of (((them))) may have died from starvation (primarily) or execution (much less common), but as far as actual mass death camps and genocide, I believe that was a campaign to garner sympathy and give (((them))) a scapegoat for the next century or so for any wrong doings. I believe actual numbers for Jews in WW2 were in the low hundred of thousands (around the number of gypsies that died), and could mostly be accounted for with just the natural deaths of all the other European civilians in WW2 due to combat.","filename":"2448098-700x","ext":".jpg","w":700,"h":500,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":178,"tim":1491174888277,"time":1491174888,"md5":"xZ\/\/dHt26hGXv9ND83d50Q==","fsize":41881,"resto":0,"id":"flPIUzGD","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"blue-pill-me-or-red-pill-me","country_name":"United States","replies":0,"images":0}]},{"posts":[{"no":119250879,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)17:50:51","name":"op fag","sub":"girls are crazy","com":"fking girls, twisted fking minds but beautiful faces","filename":"7331cfd3f2fce642d3150c07ab614326","ext":".jpg","w":540,"h":535,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":247,"tim":1491169851544,"time":1491169851,"md5":"QCKMgdLyHetQ1BLU9QJE7A==","fsize":22593,"resto":0,"id":"kt+kR6ZU","country":"PL","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"girls-are-crazy","country_name":"Poland","replies":42,"images":15,"omitted_posts":37,"omitted_images":15},{"no":119259781,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)19:12:00","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119256068\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119256068<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;polish girls<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;beautiful<\/span><br><br>Kys jew","time":1491174720,"resto":119250879,"id":"3dsoU1lL","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119259790,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)19:12:05","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119250879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119250879<\/a><br>the pussy feel good tho","filename":"1455664593261","ext":".jpg","w":628,"h":676,"tn_w":116,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491174725443,"time":1491174725,"md5":"go1GRRkfnkfstcrG96TnYA==","fsize":31463,"resto":119250879,"id":"rNY1wp3m","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119259871,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)19:12:58","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119256505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119256505<\/a><br>weak men create twisted women","time":1491174778,"resto":119250879,"id":"gY6dzEBn","country":"NO","country_name":"Norway"},{"no":119259937,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)19:13:33","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119253073\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119253073<\/a><br>faggot","time":1491174813,"resto":119250879,"id":"0JNw4ljS","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119260047,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)19:14:46","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119250879\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119250879<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;politics<\/span><br><br>Go to r9k, you fucking loser.","time":1491174886,"resto":119250879,"id":"A8aphC5W","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119259062,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)19:05:34","name":"Anonymous","com":"Our institutions and political classes have become so corrupt, ineffective and outright evil that this bitches insane ideas have become not only viable, but actually preferable to any kind of government the 21st century could spawn","filename":"maxresdefault","ext":".jpg","w":1920,"h":1080,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1491174334653,"time":1491174334,"md5":"M6Yt\/mvhENSsS5kxRCAWow==","fsize":93638,"resto":0,"id":"yWDPBn1j","country":"AR","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"our-institutions-and-political-classes-have","country_name":"Argentina","replies":1,"images":0},{"no":119260017,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)19:14:28","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119259062\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119259062<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;this bitches insane ideas<\/span><br>Yeah because you taking responsibility for your own life is so crazy","time":1491174868,"resto":119259062,"id":"N++YA\/eH","country":"CR","country_name":"Costa Rica"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119259953,"now":"04\/02\/17(Sun)19:13:43","name":"Anonymous","sub":"WHO CARES ABOUT RUSSIA??","com":"Okay so I need someone to give me a quick rundown on this.

Yes, we know you don&#039;t like Trump and yes, we know you are upset that he won. But what are you trying to spin by saying Trump and Russia are colluding?<br><br>1. How did Russia steal the election from Hillary by showing the clearly undemocratic and unlawful ways the DNC was running their show? All it did was show that the DNC and their super delegates had Hillary coined as their nominee before the election process even started. Which people should be happy about knowing.<br><br>2. Russia had absolutely no idea Trump was going to win the election, just like everyone else had no idea. Everyone was surprised. <br><br>3. The Trump administration has not done anything that empowers Russia or done anything that would hint that Trump is a secret shill for Russia. The administration has been clear on where they stand with Ukraine, Crimea and other hot spots in the world. Trump has not done anything to weaken us.<br><br>4. Wasn&#039;t it the Obama administration that wanted to Buddy up to Iran, and gave them billions of dollars only for Iran to spit in our face? And wasn&#039;t it the Clinton&#039;s that sold Russia 20% of our Uranium? And wasn&#039;t it Obama that told Putin that he would be &quot;more flexible&quot; after the election? The only people cozying up to Russia and our enemies are the liberals and this is based on fact. <br><br>So you can try to divert,distract, and blame others.

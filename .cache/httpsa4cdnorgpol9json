He became more and more obsessed with the idea of nazism, &quot;alt-right&quot; ideologies, and has been isolated from the general public at his high school. He lost his friends over time and can hardly relate to anybody at his school. Teachers are feeding him &quot;lies&quot; and the liberalism is unbearable.

Today he tried to commit suicide, and had notes in his room that related to things seen here that seemed to be schizophrenically written out. 4chan was definitely a reason for his depression. He would sit in his room all day and browse, learn about nazism and watch Sam Hyde shit.

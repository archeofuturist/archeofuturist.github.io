If you are a laissez-faire capitalist and a free market purist then this is still bad. If you&#039;re someone who supports government intervention into the market to help people then it&#039;s certainly better than Obamacare as it helps people without kicking back to the corporations or forcing people to get insurance. <br><br>The upside to this is people won&#039;t die simply from not having insurance before they get ill. The downside is prices will raise to accomodate the costs insurance providers face by being forced to cover those with pre-existing conditions, but since you&#039;re no longer forced to have insurance, you&#039;re not forced to pay the fees, which means insurers can&#039;t just charge whatever they want. <br><br>Ultimately I think it&#039;s worse than a free market solution, but I&#039;m right of center and this is more centrist policy. I ultimately think the reason congress is rolling with it is because they&#039;re concerned with re-election in 2018 and they don&#039;t want the media posting images of dying children denied healthcare under the free market system due to having pre-existing conditions, which may sway voters to vote democrat in 2018 and 2020 by appealing to their emotions, essentially assuring Obamacare would be revived.","filename":"1441402375832","ext":".jpg","w":571,"h":460,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":100,"tim":1490348428776,"time":1490348428,"md5":"TpxqULAnChTvQZvEtZ\/L0A==","fsize":48024,"resto":118061032,"id":"oqxwP4sq","country":"NZ","country_name":"New Zealand"}]},{"posts":[{"no":118063594,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)05:28:03","name":"GhostofNiccolo","sub":"Sein Fein America","com":"Did Sein Fein betray the Irish people with the death of Martin?

It&#039;s a willing userbase. The trouble with \/tv\/ is that the bar for entry is extremely low, since everyone watches movies and tv, but only a fraction of a fraction of people care enough about the subjects to learn anything of substance about them. Hacks like Red Letter Media and the hipster blogger horde that control Rotten Tomatoes are to blame. Our culture has become hopelessly debased and it&#039;s the democratization of opinion that did it. Here I go combining \/tv\/ and \/pol\/ without meaning to. Armond White covered it quite well in an interview. Nobody troubles themselves to learn anymore because there&#039;s no immediately recognizeable incentive to.

How are the arts in your country? In Australia our government stopped funding decent projects 20 years ago, we make about 3 good movies a decade and we have no living writers worth talking about, and the ones we&#039;ve had in our whole history can be counted on your fingers and are barely even footnotes in the history of global literature.<br><br><a href=\"#p118063406\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118063406<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Bloom<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;controlled op<\/span><br>I don&#039;t think so.

Once he dies the resenters win, kids read Harry Potter in school and Shakespeare is an obscure historical footnote by 2100. He&#039;s still alive and I don&#039;t believe him to be an anti-semite hunter of any kind. He appears to have no beef with &#039;The Merchant of Venice&#039; and also I think he&#039;s just plain too autistic on the topic of literature to ever think a subjective thought on writing.

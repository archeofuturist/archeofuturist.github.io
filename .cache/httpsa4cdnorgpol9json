The worst part is the flags that play up to their stereotypes, like Canadians making abhorrent posts. I don&#039;t know if you unironically thought they made the community better or not but quite frankly I thought they were a one time meme addition as a joke. If you really want to include flags then have a drop down menu of selectable ideological flags, like it used to be.<br><br>Increase post timers. This one&#039;s a no brainer. Again, I thought it was a one time joke but you kept it, you literally gave spammers the tools to shit the board up and then are surprised when they do it.

Sheriff Joe Arpaio already proved his so-called birth certificate is a fraud, but where exactly WAS he born then? If he&#039;s from Kenya, then why did the powers that be pick some random Kenyan peasant to be the (officially) most powerful person in the world for 8 years? Doesn&#039;t add up.<br><br>Furthermore, how come NOBODY knows anything about his past? All of his records, if they even exist, are sealed. How come not one person from his past has come forth to say they knew the president when they were in college or whatever? It&#039;s like he just appeared out of thin air a few decades ago. Who or what is he that (((they))) would thrust him out of utter obscurity into the Senate and soon after the presidency?<br><br>The Kenyan thing doesn&#039;t add up at all, and you&#039;d think SOMEONE from Kenya would&#039;ve spoken up about this by now. What I&#039;m thinking now is... what if he literally doesn&#039;t and has never actually existed? Could he be a clandestine CIA experiment or plant? A literal advanced hologram that they put into the White House, knowing it would be far more loyal than any flesh and blood human puppet could ever be?<br><br>inb4 I&#039;m vanned for this post.","filename":"151002113215-obama-oregon-shooting-super-169","ext":".jpg","w":1100,"h":619,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":140,"tim":1490400449165,"time":1490400449,"md5":"W8Hdt0nmNRbOv80iGlYRLQ==","fsize":129023,"resto":0,"id":"VBgx14MT","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"is-obama-real","country_name":"United States","replies":22,"images":11,"omitted_posts":17,"omitted_images":11},{"no":118160931,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:51:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118155492\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118155492<\/a>","filename":"1490315743897","ext":".jpg","w":768,"h":960,"tn_w":100,"tn_h":125,"tim":1490403109322,"time":1490403109,"md5":"LDL9pdRNtN2IDfY8YM54Fw==","fsize":84456,"resto":118155492,"id":"Dd8KF\/iT","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118160975,"now":"03\/24\/17(Fri)20:52:12","name":"Anonymous","com":"The best story I ever read about Obama said he was groomed by top global communists back when the soviet empire was still in full awful swing.

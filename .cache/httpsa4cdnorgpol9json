Due to Constitutional protections, women are equal before the law and can only be voluntarily subject to a man&#039;s whim or force. Without genetic physical strength to tilt the situation in men&#039;s favor, women are quickly making gains in all elements of society, becoming more educated, more employed and more successful. Women have unprecedented choice in selecting partners and establishing independent incomes, leaving them to be able to choose lives that are not dependent on males that are not in top shape to be husband and father material. Today&#039;s familial and economic failures are largely the result of deadbeat males who have abandoned their responsibilities, their children and their homes -- first in black communities, now in white communities. With increased economic pressure and a changing society that no longer favors repetitive manual labor and other unskilled tasks, males are not as valuable or necessary as they once were. Sure, there are some outlier men who will continue to be successful, like Jews and progressives and tech immigrants. Together, with women, they will usher in a new progressivism that sees final end of archaic gender roles, the last gasp of a dying patriarchy that assumed its privilege and then squandered it through laziness and stupidity.","time":1493295965,"resto":123028890,"id":"zMDAUz0H","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123030914,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)08:29:38","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123028890\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123028890<\/a><br>Jews","time":1493296178,"resto":123028890,"id":"DIjHzA04","country":"FR","country_name":"France"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123029941,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)08:18:16","name":"Anonymous","com":"What can be done about (((Bill Nye)))?","filename":"18119502_1330960450285318_6087160097043191653_n","ext":".png","w":490,"h":960,"tn_w":127,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493295496767,"time":1493295496,"md5":"ltnDxG+KC2FB\/IRjQfH\/WQ==","fsize":618948,"resto":0,"id":"cSLGZTSs","country":"AU","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-can-be-done-about-bill-nye","country_name":"Australia","replies":2,"images":1},{"no":123030755,"now":"04\/27\/17(Thu)08:27:36","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123029941\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123029941<\/a><br>you shouldn&#039;t do anything with such CIA homos. they would fuck you up. he is a windmill on the hill erected for this exact purpose..

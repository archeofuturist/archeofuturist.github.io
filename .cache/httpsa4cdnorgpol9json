But he talks about politics the same way all the german idealists were talking about all the other stuff, like metaphysics and epistemology, and its basically really hard to read for that reason. I like Kant and Hegel and Schoepenhauer&#039;s ideas so I&#039;m not against their whole school of tohught at all, its just that its they are pretty esoteric and laborious to understand. But while the other idealists had a lot to say about knowledge and truth and ethics, marx had very little to say about politics.<br><br>Like for example everyone gives him credit for illuminating the plight of workers and shit, and starting his project of communism and stuff. But when I say &#039;everyone&#039; I mean, academics, elites, scholars, nerds, whatever. Theres a reason why these marxists can never get the proletariat of the world to give a shit about marxism: they already know everything he was talking about, and its a waste of time to read and understand his whole dogma when you are living it. Marx also made lots of idiotic dogmatic predicitions and normative statements that completely miss the point of his tortured analysis of exploitation. I think communism as marx desribed it sounds like a real shitty society to live in.<br><br>Also communists always point at each other and say that those guys aren&#039;t real communists. Like they will say stalin and shit wasn&#039;t a communist or not a marxist. But stalin would definitely tell you he was hahahaha.

Just do yourself a favor and steer clear of anarcho-communists (which are the predominant anarchists and have somewhat appropriated the term), and acquaint yourself with anarcho-capitalism a bit and learn about economics and how free markets will provide all the services the state does now more efficiently and better, and most importantly, voluntarily.

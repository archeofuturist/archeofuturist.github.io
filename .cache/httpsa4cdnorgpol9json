You know it&#039;s an understandable motivation to want power. It&#039;s not necessarily an admirable one. Although sometimes power is a perfectly reasonable thing to pursuit. But I don&#039;t know why we ever assumed that those guys were after victory. Like you should never make the presupposition that everyone is out to win. Some people are out to lose, and the more people they can take with them, the better. You know when Hitler died he committed suicide in a bunker way down below in Berlin whilst Berlin was on fire, and Europe was burning.

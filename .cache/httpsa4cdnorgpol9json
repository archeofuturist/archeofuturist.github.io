Generally there are a few key members who do all the planning and deciding whats moral and what&#039;s not, and the rest follow them. The leaders clash with each other a lot and their followers take their sides. They are very disorganized internally and different groups can have wildly different views. The way to dismantle them is to play off that and relentlessly go after their talking points. They never really think to hard about them, it&#039;s just rhetoric that they regurgitate and if you invalidate that for them you remove it from them. You have to attack their core tenants, especially the parts that they aren&#039;t as invested in. Go after them with their own ideology and show them that they can be targeted by leftism just as much as anyone else. If you do that it shatters their connection to leftist ideology and they become willing to accept new viewpoints.","time":1491367884,"resto":119548197,"id":"J2B65BA8","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119566160,"now":"04\/05\/17(Wed)00:23:30","name":"Anonymous","sub":"A request to the fatherland.","com":"Dear Anon,<br><br>This is a distress call.

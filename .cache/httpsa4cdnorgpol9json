This is uncharted territory for Donald Trump ... he actually has responsibilities.<br><br>So he&#039;s scared and lonely and angry, and he reacts to that the way any manchild would. He mashes his red button, summoning a manservant with an icy cold soda pop, and then he sulks off to the living room to play video games.

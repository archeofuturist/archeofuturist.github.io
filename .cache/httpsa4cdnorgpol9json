Perhaps they know about me here, because I was fired yesterday from my job at the bank. They said it was because I was saying - TALKING THE TRUTH - about the Jews causing 9\/11 to a customer, but I know they&#039;re out to get me, because they just fired me just like that! This is supposed to be the Trump era but (((they))) keep on stopping us Whites from taking our rightful place on the top of society. And I could tell the customer would have agreed with me if my whore of a boss hadn&#039;t taken me away. I always knew the bank was run by Socialist-Marxist Jews, but its hard to get any work with my record (nothing major, just a few fights and name-calling), and with my two bitch exes always on about child support I had no choice. The bank&#039;s a big one and I won&#039;t mention there name in case they find me, but my boss gave me no reason for firing me, even though I calmly talked my way convincingly about freedom of speech in a great arguement noone could refute. She barely listened to me. I&#039;ve been thinking a long time that she might be a Jew, or a Jew-associate, since I heard her say she wanted to see the SJW film Beauty and the beast. She would not listen to me though. I did shout a bit, I admit, but I&#039;d been drinking a bit and I hadn&#039;t had time to have lunch to sober me up. If she&#039;d just seen me after lunch everything would be fine. She&#039;s been on my case every since I asked her to go out with me for a drink several times and she&#039;s kept refusing. And I&#039;ve seen from the photo on her desk she&#039;s unashamably married to a nog, so I thought she&#039;d appreciate a bit of time away from that. But she&#039;s just been cold.

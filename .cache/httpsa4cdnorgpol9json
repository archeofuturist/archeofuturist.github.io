This means no, they do not get their own bathrooms, no they cannot be given sexual reassignment or hormone treatments, no they cannot legally change their gender. All of those policies sound so nice and so accepting and what have you, but as I said, they just ignore the real mental illness behind their delusion. <br><br>The actual treatment is complicated, and I dont fully understand all of the details, but accepting it is not the appropriate response. Treatment needs to be made available to them. Counseling, drugs, etc. <br><br>In today&#039;s political climate, if you suggest that a transgender individual undergo therapy, you would be called a bigot. It is not like we hate transgender people, but we understand that they are not functioning normally. I don&#039;t condone calling these people out or yelling at them or anything like that, but I positively hate that their illness is ignored by the left in the name of &quot;compassion.&quot; It is the same &quot;compassion&quot; that leads to liberals being against the treatment of deaf people. They do not care about correcting real illnesses, they care about the preservation of identities that they have imagined to be important.

The way I interpret this is Sessions is saying they are focusing on the LEAKERS, i.e. the malicious deep state actors trying to undermine the Trump administration. I don&#039;t get the impression that they are going to go after the publishers of the leaked info or even specifically Assange. Now you may be thinking, clearly it is a fact that the question included &quot;Is it a priority to arrest Assange&quot; and his answer included &quot;yes it is a priority&quot;. HOWEVER, from the context, it is not clear that specifically arresting Assange is a priority. Sessions broadens the reporter&#039;s question and says they are concerned about ALL leaks, not just Assange\/Manning. It appears to me that Sessions is concerned about our enemies, rather than concerned about the man that Donald Trump repeatedly praised throughout the whole presidential campaign.","time":1493677724,"resto":123680633,"id":"XFziTgc1","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123684470,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)18:37:01","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123683339\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123683339<\/a><br>Its because America has more muh freedom and less totalitarianism.

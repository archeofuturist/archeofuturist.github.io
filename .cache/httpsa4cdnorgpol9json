Free, 1964, p.98 and photograph opposite p.94.<br><br>Manetho, an Egyptian priest who evidently hated the Jews, wrote in the Greek language about 280B.C.E. The Jewish historian Josephus quotes Manetho as saying that the ancestors of the Jews \u201centered Egypt in their myriads and subdued the inhabitants,\u201d and then Josephus says that Manetho \u201cgoes on to admit that they were afterwards driven out of the country, occupied what is now Judaea, founded Jerusalem, and built the temple.\u201d\u2014Against Apion, I, 228 (26).<br><br>While Manetho\u2019s account is in general very unhistorical, the significant fact is that he mentions the Jews as being in Egypt and as going out, and in further writings, according to Josephus, he identifies Moses with Osarsiph, an Egyptian priest, indicating that, even though Egyptian monuments do not record the fact, the Jews were in Egypt and Moses was their leader. Josephus speaks of another Egyptian historian, Chaeremon, who says that Joseph and Moses were driven out of Egypt at the same time; also Josephus mentions a Lysimachus who tells a similar story.\u2014Against Apion, I, 228, 238 (26); 288, 290 (32); 299 (33); 304-311 (34).","time":1492052909,"resto":120846681,"id":"IiASXAoq","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":120860396,"now":"04\/12\/17(Wed)23:28:09","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p120858219\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;120858219<\/a><br>Interesting.<br><br>So much history in the last 100 years has been proven to be false, and yet we are to believe something from thousands of years ago is accurate?

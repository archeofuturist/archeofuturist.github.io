The Soviet system failed, as did the Roman Empire, and every Chinese or Ottoman dynasty. Some of these examples of government lasted thousands of years, while some didn&#039;t last more than a generation. All forms of government inevitably fail. This has been true since ancient times.

To claim that &quot;living space&quot; meant solely &quot;to exterminate and re-populate more land than there would have been Germans to inhabit, for several generations after the war&quot; is absurd, and contradicts the policies of &quot;Germanization&quot; that were ACTUALLY PRACTICED by the Germans regarding their Slavic allies:<br> <br>https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8ra<wbr>-ChcOiuU<br> <br>Hitler didn&#039;t consider Russians subhuman.

He even talks about how some Russians of the old rich class were Germanic. There were multiple reasons for the invasion of the Soviet Union, for example:<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;1. To gain the necessary resources to fuel a long time war, something that Germany was severely lacking.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;2.

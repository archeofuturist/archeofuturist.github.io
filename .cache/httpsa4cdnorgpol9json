Then, a period of class struggle follows in which the capitalist class is liquidated by the working class. When the capitalist class has been completely vanquished, there will be only one class, the working class, and eventually the functions of the state will become indistinguishable from the functions of the society as a whole, and the state as such will &#039;wither away&#039; as Marx said.<\/span><br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1847\/11\/prin-com.htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1848\/communist-manifesto\/<br><br>ML uses a philosophy called dialectical materialism, see here:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/1938\/09.htm<br><br>It is recommended that you read some of the critical works of Marxism-Leninism so you can make an informed assessment of the ideology.<br><br>Resources:<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/sw\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/stalin\/works\/decades-index.<wbr>htm<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/reference\/<wbr>archive\/mao\/selected-works\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/ma<wbr>rx\/works\/1884\/origin-family\/<br>https:\/\/www.marxists.org\/archive\/le<wbr>nin\/works\/1914\/mar\/11.htm","filename":"1481244074852","ext":".png","w":1010,"h":1010,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":250,"tim":1491307881110,"time":1491307881,"md5":"676S1nirnOI5InkeibSxFw==","fsize":177742,"resto":0,"id":"DDVI1yVR","country":"ES","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"pol-communism-general","country_name":"Spain","replies":1,"images":1},{"no":119463235,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)08:14:50","name":"Anonymous","com":"No","filename":"Yuri","ext":".png","w":318,"h":470,"tn_w":84,"tn_h":125,"tim":1491308090578,"time":1491308090,"md5":"TcHHp5J+XqM4GsrSbGo4xw==","fsize":42759,"resto":119462989,"id":"0Vlg0rmU","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"}]},{"posts":[{"no":119462652,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)08:06:47","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Redpilled hobbies?","com":"my mommy told me i need a hobby, but i can&#039;t go outside, what should i do?<br><br>Gaming is getting boring.","filename":"itsnotthatbad","ext":".png","w":500,"h":312,"tn_w":250,"tn_h":156,"tim":1491307607023,"time":1491307607,"md5":"JmGAN6qS9k6MBDwtEnkKgQ==","fsize":140272,"resto":0,"id":"zTQDW5nA","country":"DE","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"redpilled-hobbies","country_name":"Germany","replies":4,"images":0},{"no":119462748,"now":"04\/04\/17(Tue)08:08:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p119462652\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;119462652<\/a><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;but i can&#039;t go outside<\/span><br>Eh?

So, fearing that the FBI was compromised and knowing that the AG was meeting with Clinton on the tarmac, they decided to use Flynn as the sacrificial lamb, for the purpose of gathering ultimate proof and exposing the leakers and the spying. <br><br>This would normally be pure speculation, but Flynn immediately followed the dude who tweeted all of this.

I think the mental mechanism is a profound sense of betrayal. Which, looking back, isn&#039;t entirely realistic. I mean, I didn&#039;t really care about or know about the whole firearms thing back in the 1990&#039;s. I mean, i owned a couple of guns, but what Southerner doesn&#039;t? From a political standpoint, the smarter people on the Left had realized gun control was a loosing issue and had shut the hell up about it by the time i got into the shooting sports in a serious way. So I was able to rationalize that the left had given up on gun control and the rest of their agenda (equality, multiculturalism, Yeah!) was a good thing. Then sandy Hook happened, and they thought they had their Dunblaine or Port Aurther. This ignored the fact that Americans had responded to the assault weapons and Brady Bill by going out and buying more guns, which caused an explosion in the shooting sports. And like I said, they lied their asses of about everything to do with firearms to try and get their way. Which left me feeling betrayed. I recognize this is not entirely rational. But it is what it is. The the Zimmerman shooting happened and in the interest of pushing their narrative, the media &quot;promoted&quot; George Zimmerman, a half Jewish one quarter Native Peruvian, one quarter Black man to &quot;white.&quot; And Obama, the president himself, stepped in to fan the flames of racial tension. And it just kept going. So here I am. In about six years I&#039;ve gone from being a &quot;moderate&quot; leftist to a member of the &quot;Alt Right,&quot; for whatever it&#039;s worth. To OP&#039;s baity point, maybe I&#039;m not a &quot;good guy,&quot; but I sure as hell ain&#039;t one of (((them))) or one of their minions. And neither is Trump.

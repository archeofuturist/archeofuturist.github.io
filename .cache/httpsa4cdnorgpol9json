However, remember the War On Drugs was full steam ahead under Regan and The War On Terror went underway with Bush Jr, meaning that spending far outpaced revenue. Remember the Obama administration reduced war efforts, but funneled more money into the CIA\/NSA as well as giving it to everyone who donated to his campaign via Stimulus Package 2. This coupled with an increase in taxes made the average deficit for his tenure greater than that of Bush and Regan. However lets look at Clinton: why did we have a surplus under Clinton?<br><br>There is a third factor here: the Chinese. Clinton actively sold American Secrets to the Chinese while also effectively making them exclusively our trading partners, giving a temporary boost to the govt coffers at a massive cost of advancing the Chinese by about 30-50 years and destroying the American Manufacturing base, leading to less possible tax revenues in the future.","time":1493637196,"resto":123601469,"id":"LUJZKbWQ","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123607620,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)07:06:15","name":"Anonymous","sub":"Two Genders my dudes.","com":"That was quick.","filename":"IMG_20170501_070438","ext":".jpg","w":710,"h":1122,"tn_w":158,"tn_h":250,"tim":1493636775232,"time":1493636775,"md5":"fga1MJ7ek9MPTApNVY5F7w==","fsize":165813,"resto":0,"id":"2AVRFHJ4","country":"US","m_img":1,"bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"two-genders-my-dudes","country_name":"United States","replies":3,"images":0},{"no":123607735,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)07:07:41","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123607620\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123607620<\/a><br>It&#039;s a parody account.<br><br>About half of all antifa twitter accounts are parodies.","time":1493636861,"resto":123607620,"id":"Hoaqpfew","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":123608022,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)07:11:21","name":"Anonymous","com":"We can always depend on Antifa to maintain safety and order in this world.","time":1493637081,"resto":123607620,"id":"XKJZEi3f","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":123608125,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)07:12:40","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p123607735\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;123607735<\/a><br>way over half are parody","time":1493637160,"resto":123607620,"id":"G1xLwrRO","country":"US","country_name":"United States"}]},{"posts":[{"no":123596507,"now":"05\/01\/17(Mon)04:25:39","name":"Anonymous","sub":"\/ptg\/ PRESIDENT TRUMP GENERAL -

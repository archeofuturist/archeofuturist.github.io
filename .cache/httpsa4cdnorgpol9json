It&#039;s almost like blaming the west is their dogma, mantra and rallying cry. We don&#039;t kill millions of you, you suck so bad that you passively and even actively allow a weak, corrupt state. Always playing the victim (like right now). Much of the Muslim world&#039;s been a disaster even before the creation of America. Some Muslims can&#039;t even stand or work with other Muslims so they even emigrate to the Western world and even the so-called Great Satan. Piss off and realize good things come from hard work so put some effort into your destiny. Why do you guys stab each other in the back and fight and hate each other for centuries? Because America? Good grief. Left to your own devices your nations spiral into chaos. You want freedom and when it stops working out you blame who? Call up Indonesia, Jordan or Malaysia and ask them what their secrets to success are and why they&#039;re not pointing fingers like the failed states.","time":1490848367,"resto":118873019,"id":"FDrHWCa3","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":118882951,"now":"03\/30\/17(Thu)00:33:02","name":"Anonymous","com":"<a href=\"#p118881730\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118881730<\/a><br>I kinda covered them already:<br><a href=\"#p118879505\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118879505<\/a><br><a href=\"#p118880426\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;118880426<\/a><br>Mubarak<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Ruler who took power from vice to president in 1981-2011 after the death of Sadat.<\/span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Crazy Islamists riot to get rid of him.

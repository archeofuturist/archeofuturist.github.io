wife, 2 wives comes into play when some social requirements are needed but you can divorce when you start playing favorites, and there is no reason to have the wife stay at home and do house work, her only duties are keeping the man sexually satisfied cuz why the fuck did he marry a woman to spend the rest of his life, and to not be a bitch, and the man needs to not be a cunt and do house abuse, hence it has high emphasis on family bonding and family happiness. and the kids must not dissapoint their parents, and listen to what they say, which most of the times is the right thing to do, cuz parents got more know how and experience, and the kids dont. i can go on and on but you get the point, it covers rules and baselines to not cross for the sake of keeping families together and happy,

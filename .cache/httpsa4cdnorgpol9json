This is due to the fact that it is actually a combination of beliefs and more of an anti-culture than a single ideology. <br> In some ways liberalism can be considered a lack of convictions rather than any sort of set of strong opinions due to the fact that the core of liberalism is subjectivity. Liberalism claims that the quality, nature, and even very existence of many things is in the mind of the observer rather than what the mind is actually observing. With liberalism, art is completely subjective and all art should be held to the same regard. A series of avant garde nonsensical noises is equivalent to a well written tune. A canvas of paint splatters rivals Picasso. Definitive, objective morals are not present in Liberalism. The thief is not wrong to steal if he is hungry. The cheater is not at fault because their spouse dissatisfied them. The glutton simply can\u2019t help it and why should you care if they\u2019re fat? Liberalism implies that Thing A can never technically be better than Thing B as long as someone holds that opinion, even if by all measurements Thing A is clearly better.","filename":"1c89eae55648ae09c4b9e1882044b95fafbbe2e5121269b411c97ae00d98fdea","ext":".gif","w":895,"h":680,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":189,"tim":1490972509966,"time":1490972509,"md5":"JSWJZKvto+I1\/xohn2LbmA==","fsize":1439869,"resto":0,"id":"goZBkK6D","country":"US","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"what-is-liberalism","country_name":"United States","replies":5,"images":4},{"no":119063754,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)11:04:57","name":"Anonymous","com":"The idea that so many things in life can be subjective leads to the idea that life itself must be subjective, the end result being nihilism. Liberalism promotes the idea that there is no basis for objective truth or meaning in life. All philosophies or ideas on what makes a positive, fulfilling, and meaningful life are null and void as it is up to the individual what will make them the most happy. A man who lets his time, wealth, and health go to waste on unproductive material and hedonistic desires is fine as long as he himself is happy. Liberalism toys with the idea that life and this universe itself might not exist at all as we know it and we might only be experiencing an illusion of sorts. <br> Such a deep break down of objectivity and reality suggests an inherent meaninglessness of reality, society, etc in spite of the fact that these things exist anyway. This eventually results in a distaste and mistrust of things like authority, tradition, and majority groups leading to the promotion of vague, virtually unprovable, egalitarian ideals on topics such as science, politics, sexuality, etc.","filename":"8-snake","ext":".jpg","w":429,"h":234,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":68,"tim":1490972697961,"time":1490972697,"md5":"IrO5PsG\/MbMrgJYuolJZ1w==","fsize":20152,"resto":119063473,"id":"goZBkK6D","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119063897,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)11:06:42","name":"Anonymous","com":"Liberalism places a strong emphasis on scientific fantasies, or at least scientific ideas or achievements that we are absolutely nowhere near achieving. Flying to Mars and subsequently colonizing it will be a landmark for mankind even though there is seemingly no actual benefits for humans on Earth. Genetic engineering for humans is an inevitable beneficial result of medical science, though in reality it would only be available to the richest and most elite. Artificial intelligence will be a reality even if we still have absolutely no understanding of how consciousness actually arises.","filename":"future","ext":".jpg","w":450,"h":315,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":87,"tim":1490972802326,"time":1490972802,"md5":"mRZaFajyxyrb0mi5EEk5Pw==","fsize":69861,"resto":119063473,"id":"goZBkK6D","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119064039,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)11:08:32","name":"Anonymous","com":"Marxism and communism play a very big role in the political ideals of liberalism. Like marxism, liberalism promotes fiscal equality at seemingly all costs, although there is no real answer as to how this would be achieved. Whereas marxism claims that a violent revolution of the proletariat followed by dissolution of the state is required, liberalism more often than not promotes endless protests, media campaigns, civil disobedience, and propaganda. Communism is the preferred economic model of liberalism even though it has killed tens of millions in the past in places like Russia, China, and Cambodia. A hatred for capitalism is also very prevalent in liberalism as it is thought that capitalism is the root of all inequality and begets a super rich oligarchic class.","filename":"marx","ext":".jpg","w":420,"h":361,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":107,"tim":1490972912238,"time":1490972912,"md5":"xQRgn4tVDkP61Hx1\/G+YqA==","fsize":47618,"resto":119063473,"id":"goZBkK6D","country":"US","country_name":"United States"},{"no":119064303,"now":"03\/31\/17(Fri)11:11:04","name":"Anonymous","com":"The politics of liberalism claim complete equality for all. Though making one group more equal almost always is done by forcing another group to comply. A law preventing discrimination against people claiming to be trans gendered using certain bathrooms seems like it promotes equality but in reality it is only forcing establishment owners to comply with laws written without them in mind. A company might be forced to hire a woman who is less qualified than a man simply to fill a sort of diversity quota. People receive tax dollars in the form of food stamps even though the people who were taxed might be struggling to feed their own children. A landlord might be sued for not renting to a black man even if the reason for not renting was the man had bad credit. <br> It is thought that as long as a minority group is gaining some sort of rights or clout in society, it does not matter how many other people are effected if those people belong to a majority group.

After WW2 during a period of national unity and shortage of housing, we built fucking houses and sold them cheap so people could get on with their lives.

Seriously.&quot;.But we never reached the peak. Instead it has been normalized that people take out 90% of the cost of the house as loans ($500&#039;000 for a flat) and let bankers get fat while contributing nothing to society. The housing crisis is brought on by extreme demand due lack of new houses built, mass immigration which also brings wages down and centralization because no jobs exist in the countryside. There is no real political will among mainstream parties to solve this as undoubtedly ending this spiral will step on the toes of the biggest benefactors and most powerful in the game.<br><br>The solution is simple. Do what we did post WW2. All housing loans are handled by the STATE. Any interest on loans goes to PUBLIC BENEFIT and not in the pocket of bankers. We build these houses on the public purse and sell them at break-even cost. This creates jobs, creates housing, enriches the people and not the bankers.","filename":"norway","ext":".png","w":804,"h":698,"tn_w":249,"tn_h":217,"tim":1492441027219,"time":1492441027,"md5":"HQT5j4Wk6cQg4i0V0xgOiw==","fsize":99370,"resto":0,"id":"1M5viI0m","country":"NO","bumplimit":0,"imagelimit":0,"semantic_url":"how-to-fix-the-westfutureeverything","country_name":"Norway","replies":2,"images":1},{"no":121534893,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)10:59:13","name":"Anonymous","filename":"4305333+_6b49d1d6b8d947cf18fbac0c313d11f1","ext":".png","w":200,"h":200,"tn_w":125,"tn_h":125,"tim":1492441153557,"time":1492441153,"md5":"YRaVgKBMc8jBnm\/D8WOA0Q==","fsize":53653,"resto":121534661,"id":"H8eY84zq","country":"GB","country_name":"United Kingdom"},{"no":121536114,"now":"04\/17\/17(Mon)11:10:49","name":"Anonymous","com":"#2) The frailty of the welfare state<br>There is consensus among norwegians that the welfare state is working and worth keeping.
